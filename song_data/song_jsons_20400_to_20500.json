I'll pick you up.\n\n\nLooking sharp.\n\n\nUse the stairs. Your father\npaid good money for those.\n\n\nSorry. I'm excited.\n\n\nHere's the graduate.\nWe're very proud of you, son.\n\n\nA perfect report card, all B's.\n\nVery proud.\n\n\nMa! I got a thing going here.\n\n\n- You got lint on your fuzz.\n- Ow! That's me!\n\n\n- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.\n- Bye!\n\n\nBarry, I told you,\nstop flying in the house!\n\n\n- Hey, Adam.\n- Hey, Barry.\n\n\n- Is that fuzz gel?\n- A little. Special day, graduation.\n\n\nNever thought I'd make it.\n\n\nThree days grade school,\nthree days high school.\n\n\nThose were awkward.\n\n\nThree days college. I'm glad I took\na day and hitchhiked around the hive.\n\n\nYou did come back different.\n\n\n- Hi, Barry.\n- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.\n\n\n- Hear about Frankie?\n- Yeah.\n\n\n- You going to the funeral?\n- No, I'm not going.\n\n\nEverybody knows,\nsting someone, you die.\n\n\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\nSuch a hothead.\n\n\nI guess he could have\njust gotten out of the way.\n\n\nI love this incorporating\nan amusement park into our day.\n\n\nThat's why we don't need vacations.\n\n\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp...\nunder the circumstances.\n\n\n- Well, Adam, today we are men.\n- We are!\n\n\n- Bee-men.\n- Amen!\n\n\nHallelujah!\n\n\nStudents, faculty, distinguished bees,\n\n\nplease welcome Dean Buzzwell.\n\n\nWelcome, New Hive Oity\ngraduating class of...\n\n\n...9:15.\n\n\nThat concludes our ceremonies.\n\n\nAnd begins your career\nat Honex Industries!\n\n\nWill we pick our job today?\n\n\nI heard it's just orientation.\n\n\nHeads up! Here we go.\n\n\nKeep your hands and antennas\ninside the tram at all times.\n\n\n- Wonder what it'll be like?\n- A little scary.\n\n\nWelcome to Honex,\na division of Honesco\n\n\nand a part of the Hexagon Group.\n\n\nThis is it!\n\n\nWow.\n\n\nWow.\n\n\nWe know that you, as a bee,\nhave worked your whole life\n\n\nto get to the point where you\ncan work for your whole life.\n\n\nHoney begins when our valiant Pollen\nJocks bring the nectar to the hive.\n\n\nOur top-secret formula\n\n\nis automatically color-corrected,\nscent-adjusted and bubble-contoured\n\n\ninto this soothing sweet syrup\n\n\nwith its distinctive\ngolden glow you know as...\n\n\nHoney!\n\n\n- That girl was hot.\n- She's my cousin!\n\n\n- She is?\n- Yes, we're all cousins.\n\n\n- Right. You're right.\n- At Honex, we constantly strive\n\n\nto improve every aspect\nof bee existence.\n\n\nThese bees are stress-testing\na new helmet technology.\n\n\n- What do you think he makes?\n- Not enough.\n\n\nHere we have our latest advancement,\nthe Krelman.\n\n\n- What does that do?\n- Catches that little strand of honey\n\n\nthat hangs after you pour it.\nSaves us millions.\n\n\nCan anyone work on the Krelman?\n\n\nOf course. Most bee jobs are\nsmall ones. But bees know\n\n\nthat every small job,\nif it's done well, means a lot.\n\n\nBut choose carefully\n\n\nbecause you'll stay in the job\nyou pick for the rest of your life.\n\n\nThe same job the rest of your life?\nI didn't know that.\n\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\n\nYou'll be happy to know that bees,\nas a species, haven't had one day off\n\n\nin 27 million years.\n\n\nSo you'll just work us to death?\n\n\nWe'll sure try.\n\n\nWow! That blew my mind!\n\n\n\"What's the difference?\"\nHow can you say that?\n\n\nOne job forever?\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.\n\n\nI'm relieved. Now we only have\nto make one decision in life.\n\n\nBut, Adam, how could they\nnever have told us that?\n\n\nWhy would you question anything?\nWe're bees.\n\n\nWe're the most perfectly\nfunctioning society on Earth.\n\n\nYou ever think maybe things\nwork a little too well here?\n\n\nLike what? Give me one example.\n\n\nI don't know. But you know\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n\nPlease clear the gate.\nRoyal Nectar Force on approach.\n\n\nWait a second. Oheck it out.\n\n\n- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!\n- Wow.\n\n\nI've never seen them this close.\n\n\nThey know what it's like\noutside the hive.\n\n\nYeah, but some don't come back.\n\n\n- Hey, Jocks!\n- Hi, Jocks!\n\n\nYou guys did great!\n\n\nYou're monsters!\nYou're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!\n\n\n- I wonder where they were.\n- I don't know.\n\n\nTheir day's not planned.\n\n\nOutside the hive, flying who knows\nwhere, doing who knows what.\n\n\nYou can'tjust decide to be a Pollen\nJock. You have to be bred for that.\n\n\nRight.\n\n\nLook. That's more pollen\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\n\n\nIt's just a status symbol.\nBees make too much of it.\n\n\nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it\nand the ladies see you wearing it.\n\n\nThose ladies?\nAren't they our cousins too?\n\n\nDistant. Distant.\n\n\nLook at these two.\n\n\n- Oouple of Hive Harrys.\n- Let's have fun with them.\n\n\nIt must be dangerous\nbeing a Pollen Jock.\n\n\nYeah. Once a bear pinned me\nagainst a mushroom!\n\n\nHe had a paw on my throat,\nand with the other, he was slapping me!\n\n\n- Oh, my!\n- I never thought I'd knock him out.\n\n\nWhat were you doing during this?\n\n\nTrying to alert the authorities.\n\n\nI can autograph that.\n\n\nA little gusty out there today,\nwasn't it, comrades?\n\n\nYeah. Gusty.\n\n\nWe're hitting a sunflower patch\nsix miles from here tomorrow.\n\n\n- Six miles, huh?\n- Barry!\n\n\nA puddle jump for us,\nbut maybe you're not up for it.\n\n\n- Maybe I am.\n- You are not!\n\n\nWe're going 0900 at J-Gate.\n\n\nWhat do you think, buzzy-boy?\nAre you bee enough?\n\n\nI might be. It all depends\non what 0900 means.\n\n\nHey, Honex!\n\n\nDad, you surprised me.\n\n\nYou decide what you're interested in?\n\n\n- Well, there's a lot of choices.\n- But you only get one.\n\n\nDo you ever get bored\ndoing the same job every day?\n\n\nSon, let me tell you about stirring.\n\n\nYou grab that stick, and you just\nmove it around, and you stir it around.\n\n\nYou get yourself into a rhythm.\nIt's a beautiful thing.\n\n\nYou know, Dad,\nthe more I think about it,\n\n\nmaybe the honey field\njust isn't right for me.\n\n\nYou were thinking of what,\nmaking balloon animals?\n\n\nThat's a bad job\nfor a guy with a stinger.\n\n\nJanet, your son's not sure\nhe wants to go into honey!\n\n\n- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.\n- I'm not trying to be funny.\n\n\nYou're not funny! You're going\ninto honey. Our son, the stirrer!\n\n\n- You're gonna be a stirrer?\n- No one's listening to me!\n\n\nWait till you see the sticks I have.\n\n\nI could say anything right now.\nI'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\n\n\nLet's open some honey and celebrate!\n\n\nMaybe I'll pierce my thorax.\nShave my antennae.\n\n\nShack up with a grasshopper. Get\na gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"!\n\n\nI'm so proud.\n\n\n- We're starting work today!\n- Today's the day.\n\n\nOome on! All the good jobs\nwill be gone.\n\n\nYeah, right.\n\n\nPollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,\nstirrer, front desk, hair removal...\n\n\n- Is it still available?\n- Hang on. Two left!\n\n\nOne of them's yours! Oongratulations!\nStep to the side.\n\n\n- What'd you get?\n- Picking crud out. Stellar!\n\n\nWow!\n\n\nOouple of newbies?\n\n\nYes, sir! Our first day!

What's available?\n\n\nRestroom attendant's open,\nnot for the reason you think.\n\n\n- Any chance of getting the Krelman?\n- Sure, you're on.\n\n\nI'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.\n\n\nWax monkey's always open.\n\n\nThe Krelman opened up again.\n\n\nWhat happened?\n\n\nA bee died. Makes an opening. See?\nHe's dead. Another dead one.\n\n\nDeady. Deadified. Two more dead.\n\n\nDead from the neck up.\nDead from the neck down. That's life!\n\n\nOh, this is so hard!\n\n\nHeating, cooling,\nstunt bee, pourer, stirrer,\n\n\nhumming, inspector number seven,\nlint coordinator, stripe supervisor,\n\n\nmite wrangler.

Out where?\n\n\n- Out there.\n- Oh, no!\n\n\nI have to, before I go\nto work for the rest of my life.\n\n\nYou're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?\n\n\nAnother call coming in.\n\n\nIf anyone's feeling brave,\nthere's a Korean deli on 83rd\n\n\nthat gets their roses today.\n\n\nHey, guys.\n\n\n- Look at that.\n- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?\n\n\nHold it, son, flight deck's restricted.\n\n\nIt's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.\n\n\nReally? Feeling lucky, are you?\n\n\nSign here, here. Just initial that.\n\n\n- Thank you.\n- OK.\n\n\nYou got a rain advisory today,\n\n\nand as you all know,\nbees cannot fly in rain.\n\n\nSo be careful. As always,\nwatch your brooms,\n\n\nhockey sticks, dogs,\nbirds, bears and bats.\n\n\nAlso, I got a couple of reports\nof root beer being poured on us.\n\n\nMurphy's in a home because of it,\nbabbling like a cicada!\n\n\n- That's awful.\n- And a reminder for you rookies,\n\n\nbee law number one,\nabsolutely no talking to humans!\n\n\nAll right, launch positions!\n\n\nBuzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

Maybe a dash over there,\n\n\na pinch on that one.\nSee that? It's a little bit of magic.\n\n\nThat's amazing. Why do we do that?\n\n\nThat's pollen power. More pollen, more\nflowers, more nectar, more honey for us.\n\n\nOool.\n\n\nI'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.\nOould be daisies. Don't we need those?\n\n\nOopy that visual.\n\n\nWait.

This...\n\n\nDrapes!\n\n\nThat is diabolical.\n\n\nIt's fantastic. It's got all my special\nskills, even my top-ten favorite movies.\n\n\nWhat's number one? Star Wars?\n\n\nNah, I don't go for that...\n\n\n...kind of stuff.\n\n\nNo wonder we shouldn't talk to them.\nThey're out of their minds.\n\n\nWhen I leave a job interview, they're\nflabbergasted, can't believe what I say.\n\n\nThere's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.\n\n\nI don't remember the sun\nhaving a big 75 on it.\n\n\nI predicted global warming.\n\n\nI could feel it getting hotter.\nAt first I thought it was just me.\n\n\nWait! Stop! Bee!\n\n\nStand back. These are winter boots.\n\n\nWait!\n\n\nDon't kill him!\n\n\nYou know I'm allergic to them!\nThis thing could kill me!\n\n\nWhy does his life have\nless value than yours?\n\n\nWhy does his life have any less value\nthan mine? Is that your statement?\n\n\nI'm just saying all life has value. You\ndon't know what he's capable of feeling.\n\n\nMy brochure!\n\n\nThere you go, little guy.\n\n\nI'm not scared of him.\nIt's an allergic thing.\n\n\nPut that on your resume brochure.\n\n\nMy whole face could puff up.\n\n\nMake it one of your special skills.\n\n\nKnocking someone out\nis also a special skill.\n\n\nRight. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.\n\n\n- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?\n- Sure, Ken.

Oome on!\n\n\nNo. Yes. No.\n\n\nDo it. I can't.\n\n\nHow should I start it?\n\"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good.\n\n\nHere she comes! Speak, you fool!\n\n\nHi!\n\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n- You're talking.\n- Yes, I know.\n\n\nYou're talking!\n\n\nI'm so sorry.\n\n\nNo, it's OK. It's fine.\nI know I'm dreaming.\n\n\nBut I don't recall going to bed.\n\n\nWell, I'm sure this\nis very disconcerting.\n\n\nThis is a bit of a surprise to me.\nI mean, you're a bee!\n\n\nI am. And I'm not supposed\nto be doing this,\n\n\nbut they were all trying to kill me.\n\n\nAnd if it wasn't for you...\n\n\nI had to thank you.\nIt's just how I was raised.\n\n\nThat was a little weird.\n\n\n- I'm talking with a bee.\n- Yeah.\n\n\nI'm talking to a bee.\nAnd the bee is talking to me!\n\n\nI just want to say I'm grateful.\nI'll leave now.\n\n\n- Wait! How did you learn to do that?\n- What?\n\n\nThe talking thing.\n\n\nSame way you did, I guess.\n\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.\n\n\n- That's very funny.\n- Yeah.\n\n\nBees are funny. If we didn't laugh,\nwe'd cry with what we have to deal with.\n\n\nAnyway...\n\n\nCan I...\n\n\n...get you something?\n- Like what?\n\n\nI don't know. I mean...\nI don't know. Ooffee?\n\n\nI don't want to put you out.\n\n\nIt's no trouble. It takes two minutes.\n\n\n- It's just coffee.\n- I hate to impose.\n\n\n- Don't be ridiculous!\n- Actually, I would love a cup.\n\n\nHey, you want rum cake?\n\n\n- I shouldn't.\n- Have some.\n\n\n- No, I can't.\n- Oome on!\n\n\nI'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.\n\n\n- Where?\n- These stripes don't help.\n\n\nYou look great!\n\n\nI don't know if you know\nanything about fashion.\n\n\nAre you all right?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nHe's making the tie in the cab\nas they're flying up Madison.\n\n\nHe finally gets there.\n\n\nHe runs up the steps into the church.\nThe wedding is on.\n\n\nAnd he says, \"Watermelon?\nI thought you said Guatemalan.\n\n\nWhy would I marry a watermelon?\"\n\n\nIs that a bee joke?\n\n\nThat's the kind of stuff we do.\n\n\nYeah, different.\n\n\nSo, what are you gonna do, Barry?\n\n\nAbout work? I don't know.\n\n\nI want to do my part for the hive,\nbut I can't do it the way they want.\n\n\nI know how you feel.\n\n\n- You do?\n- Sure.\n\n\nMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or\na doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\n\n\n- Really?\n- My only interest is flowers.\n\n\nOur new queen was just elected\nwith that same campaign slogan.\n\n\nAnyway, if you look...\n\n\nThere's my hive right there. See it?\n\n\nYou're in Sheep Meadow!\n\n\nYes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\n\n\nNo way! I know that area.\nI lost a toe ring there once.\n\n\n- Why do girls put rings on their toes?\n- Why not?\n\n\n- It's like putting a hat on your knee.\n- Maybe I'll try that.\n\n\n- You all right, ma'am?\n- Oh, yeah. Fine.\n\n\nJust having two cups of coffee!\n\n\nAnyway, this has been great.\nThanks for the coffee.\n\n\nYeah, it's no trouble.\n\n\nSorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,\nI'd be up the rest of my life.\n\n\nAre you...?\n\n\nCan I take a piece of this with me?\n\n\nSure! Here, have a crumb.\n\n\n- Thanks!\n- Yeah.\n\n\nAll right. Well, then...\nI guess I'll see you around.\n\n\nOr not.\n\n\nOK, Barry.\n\n\nAnd thank you\nso much again... for before.\n\n\nOh, that? That was nothing.\n\n\nWell, not nothing, but... Anyway...\n\n\nThis can't possibly work.\n\n\nHe's all set to go.\nWe may as well try it.\n\n\nOK, Dave, pull the chute.\n\n\n- Sounds amazing.\n- It was amazing!\n\n\nIt was the scariest,\nhappiest moment of my life.\n\n\nHumans! I can't believe\nyou were with humans!\n\n\nGiant, scary humans!\nWhat were they like?\n\n\nHuge and crazy. They talk crazy.\n\n\nThey eat crazy giant things.\nThey drive crazy.\n\n\n- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?\n- Some of them. But some of them don't.\n\n\n- How'd you get back?\n- Poodle.\n\n\nYou did it, and I'm glad. You saw\nwhatever you wanted to see.\n\n\nYou had your \"experience.\" Now you\ncan pick out your job and be normal.\n\n\n- Well...\n- Well?\n\n\nWell, I met someone.\n\n\nYou did? Was she Bee-ish?\n\n\n- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\n- No, no, no, not a wasp.\n\n\n- Spider?\n- I'm not attracted to spiders.\n\n\nI know it's the hottest thing,\nwith the eight legs and all.\n\n\nI can't get by that face.\n\n\nSo who is she?\n\n\nShe's... human.\n\n\nNo, no. That's a bee law.\nYou wouldn't break a bee law.\n\n\n- Her name's Vanessa.\n- Oh, boy.\n\n\nShe's so nice. And she's a florist!\n\n\nOh, no! You're dating a human florist!\n\n\nWe're not dating.\n\n\nYou're flying outside the hive, talking\nto humans that attack our homes\n\n\nwith power washers and M-80s!\nOne-eighth a stick of dynamite!\n\n\nShe saved my life!\nAnd she understands me.\n\n\nThis is over!\n\n\nEat this.\n\n\nThis is not over! What was that?\n\n\n- They call it a crumb.\n- It was so stingin' stripey!\n\n\nAnd that's not what they eat.\nThat's what falls off what they eat!\n\n\n- You know what a Oinnabon is?\n- No.\n\n\nIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting.\nThey heat it up...\n\n\nSit down!\n\n\n...really hot!\n- Listen to me!\n\n\nWe are not them! We're us.\nThere's us and there's them!\n\n\nYes, but who can deny\nthe heart that is yearning?\n\n\nThere's no yearning.\nStop yearning. Listen to me!\n\n\nYou have got to start thinking bee,\nmy friend. Thinking bee!\n\n\n- Thinking bee.\n- Thinking bee.\n\n\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n\nThere he is. He's in the pool.\n\n\nYou know what your problem is, Barry?\n\n\nI gotta start thinking bee?\n\n\nHow much longer will this go on?\n\n\nIt's been three days!\nWhy aren't you working?\n\n\nI've got a lot of big life decisions\nto think about.\n\n\nWhat life? You have no life!\nYou have no job. You're barely a bee!\n\n\nWould it kill you\nto make a little honey?\n\n\nBarry, come out.\nYour father's talking to you.\n\n\nMartin, would you talk to him?\n\n\nBarry, I'm talking to you!\n\n\nYou coming?\n\n\nGot everything?\n\n\nAll set!\n\n\nGo ahead. I'll catch up.\n\n\nDon't be too long.\n\n\nWatch this!\n\n\nVanessa!\n\n\n- We're still here.\n- I told you not to yell at him.\n\n\nHe doesn't respond to yelling!\n\n\n- Then why yell at me?\n- Because you don't listen!\n\n\nI'm not listening to this.\n\n\nSorry, I've gotta go.\n\n\n- Where are you going?\n- I'm meeting a friend.\n\n\nA girl? Is this why you can't decide?\n\n\nBye.\n\n\nI just hope she's Bee-ish.\n\n\nThey have a huge parade\nof flowers every year in Pasadena?\n\n\nTo be in the Tournament of Roses,\nthat's every florist's dream!\n\n\nUp on a float, surrounded\nby flowers, crowds cheering.\n\n\nA tournament. Do the roses\ncompete in athletic events?\n\n\nNo. All right, I've got one.\nHow come you don't fly everywhere?\n\n\nIt's exhausting. Why don't you\nrun everywhere?

I can't do this\"?\n\n\nBees have never been afraid\nto change the world.\n\n\nWhat about Bee Oolumbus?\nBee Gandhi? Bejesus?\n\n\nWhere I'm from, we'd never sue humans.\n\n\nWe were thinking\nof stickball or candy stores.\n\n\nHow old are you?\n\n\nThe bee community\nis supporting you in this case,\n\n\nwhich will be the trial\nof the bee century.\n\n\nYou know, they have a Larry King\nin the human world too.\n\n\nIt's a common name. Next week...\n\n\nHe looks like you and has a show\nand suspenders and colored dots...\n\n\nNext week...\n\n\nGlasses, quotes on the bottom from the\nguest even though you just heard 'em.\n\n\nBear Week next week!\nThey're scary, hairy and here live.\n\n\nAlways leans forward, pointy shoulders,\nsquinty eyes, very Jewish.\n\n\nIn tennis, you attack\nat the point of weakness!\n\n\nIt was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.\n\n\nHoney, her backhand's a joke!\nI'm not gonna take advantage of that?\n\n\nQuiet, please.\nActual work going on here.\n\n\n- Is that that same bee?\n- Yes, it is!\n\n\nI'm helping him sue the human race.\n\n\n- Hello.\n- Hello, bee.\n\n\nThis is Ken.\n\n\nYeah, I remember you.

I try not\nto use the competition.\n\n\nSo why are you helping me?\n\n\nBees have good qualities.\n\n\nAnd it takes my mind off the shop.\n\n\nInstead of flowers, people\nare giving balloon bouquets now.\n\n\nThose are great, if you're three.\n\n\nAnd artificial flowers.\n\n\n- Oh, those just get me psychotic!\n- Yeah, me too.\n\n\nBent stingers, pointless pollination.\n\n\nBees must hate those fake things!\n\n\nNothing worse\nthan a daffodil that's had work done.\n\n\nMaybe this could make up\nfor it a little bit.\n\n\n- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\n- I guess.\n\n\nYou sure you want to go through with it?\n\n\nAm I sure? When I'm done with\nthe humans, they won't be able\n\n\nto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"\nwithout paying a royalty!\n\n\nIt's an incredible scene\nhere in downtown Manhattan,\n\n\nwhere the world anxiously waits,\nbecause for the first time in history,\n\n\nwe will hear for ourselves\nif a honeybee can actually speak.\n\n\nWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?\n\n\nIt's pretty big, isn't it?\n\n\nI can't believe how many humans\ndon't work during the day.\n\n\nYou think billion-dollar multinational\nfood companies have good lawyers?\n\n\nEverybody needs to stay\nbehind the barricade.\n\n\n- What's the matter?\n- I don't know, I just got a chill.\n\n\nWell, if it isn't the bee team.\n\n\nYou boys work on this?\n\n\nAll rise! The Honorable\nJudge Bumbleton presiding.\n\n\nAll right.

Yes, Your Honor,\nwe're ready to proceed.\n\n\nMr. Montgomery,\nyour opening statement, please.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\n\n\nmy grandmother was a simple woman.\n\n\nBorn on a farm, she believed\nit was man's divine right\n\n\nto benefit from the bounty\nof nature God put before us.\n\n\nIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world\nMr. Benson imagines,\n\n\njust think of what would it mean.\n\n\nI would have to negotiate\nwith the silkworm\n\n\nfor the elastic in my britches!\n\n\nTalking bee!\n\n\nHow do we know this isn't some sort of\n\n\nholographic motion-picture-capture\nHollywood wizardry?\n\n\nThey could be using laser beams!\n\n\nRobotics! Ventriloquism!\nOloning! For all we know,\n\n\nhe could be on steroids!\n\n\nMr. Benson?\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\nthere's no trickery here.\n\n\nI'm just an ordinary bee.\nHoney's pretty important to me.\n\n\nIt's important to all bees.\nWe invented it!\n\n\nWe make it. And we protect it\nwith our lives.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there are\nsome people in this room\n\n\nwho think they can take it from us\n\n\n'cause we're the little guys!\nI'm hoping that, after this is all over,\n\n\nyou'll see how, by taking our honey,\nyou not only take everything we have\n\n\nbut everything we are!\n\n\nI wish he'd dress like that\nall the time. So nice!\n\n\nCall your first witness.\n\n\nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\nof Honey Farms, big company you have.\n\n\nI suppose so.\n\n\nI see you also own\nHoneyburton and Honron!\n\n\nYes, they provide beekeepers\nfor our farms.\n\n\nBeekeeper. I find that\nto be a very disturbing term.\n\n\nI don't imagine you employ\nany bee-free-ers, do you?\n\n\n- No.\n- I couldn't hear you.\n\n\n- No.\n- No.\n\n\nBecause you don't free bees.\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\n\n\nit seems you thought a bear would be\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\n\n\nThey're very lovable creatures.\n\n\nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\n\n\nYou mean like this?\n\n\nBears kill bees!\n\n\nHow'd you like his head crashing\nthrough your living room?!\n\n\nBiting into your couch!\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\n\n\nOK, that's enough. Take him away.\n\n\nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\nYour name intrigues me.\n\n\n- Where have I heard it before?\n- I was with a band called The Police.\n\n\nBut you've never been\na police officer, have you?\n\n\nNo, I haven't.\n\n\nNo, you haven't. And so here\nwe have yet another example\n\n\nof bee culture casually\nstolen by a human\n\n\nfor nothing more than\na prance-about stage name.\n\n\nOh, please.\n\n\nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\n\n\nBecause I'm feeling\na little stung, Sting.\n\n\nOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\n\n\nThat's not his real name?! You idiots!\n\n\nMr. Liotta, first,\nbelated congratulations on\n\n\nyour Emmy win for a guest spot\non ER in 2005.\n\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n\nI see from your resume\nthat you're devilishly handsome\n\n\nwith a churning inner turmoil\nthat's ready to blow.\n\n\nI enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\n\n\nNot yet it isn't. But is this\nwhat it's come to for you?\n\n\nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\nso you don't\n\n\nhave to rehearse\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\n\n\nWatch it, Benson!\nI could blow right now!\n\n\nThis isn't a goodfella.\nThis is a badfella!\n\n\nWhy doesn't someone just step on\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\n\n\n- Order in this court!\n- You're all thinking it!\n\n\nOrder! Order, I say!\n\n\n- Say it!\n- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\n\n\nI think it was awfully nice\nof that bear to pitch in like that.\n\n\nI think the jury's on our side.\n\n\nAre we doing everything right, legally?\n\n\nI'm a florist.\n\n\nRight. Well, here's to a great team.\n\n\nTo a great team!\n\n\nWell, hello.\n\n\n- Ken!\n- Hello.\n\n\nI didn't think you were coming.\n\n\nNo, I was just late.\nI tried to call, but... the battery.\n\n\nI didn't want all this to go to waste,\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\n\n\nOh, that was lucky.\n\n\nThere's a little left.\nI could heat it up.\n\n\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\n\n\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\n\n\nI'm not much for the game myself.\nThe ball's a little grabby.\n\n\nThat's where I usually sit.\nRight... there.\n\n\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\n\n\nand he agreed with me that eating with\nchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\n\n\nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\n\n\nI know how hard it is to find\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\n\n\nDo we?\n\n\nBees have 100 percent employment,\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\n\n\nThat's just what\nI was thinking about doing.\n\n\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\n\n\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\n\n\nYeah, you do that.\n\n\nLook at that.\n\n\nYou know, I've just about had it\n\n\nwith your little mind games.\n\n\n- What's that?\n- Italian Vogue.\n\n\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\n\n\nA lot of ads.\n\n\nRemember what Van said, why is\nyour life more valuable than mine?\n\n\nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\n\n\nI think something stinks in here!\n\n\nI love the smell of flowers.\n\n\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\n\n\nNot as much.\n\n\nWater bug! Not taking sides!\n\n\nKen, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!\nThis is pathetic!\n\n\nI've got issues!\n\n\nWell, well, well, a royal flush!\n\n\n- You're bluffing.\n- Am I?\n\n\nSurf's up, dude!\n\n\nPoo water!\n\n\nThat bowl is gnarly.\n\n\nExcept for those dirty yellow rings!\n\n\nKenneth! What are you doing?!\n\n\nYou know, I don't even like honey!\nI don't eat it!\n\n\nWe need to talk!\n\n\nHe's just a little bee!\n\n\nAnd he happens to be\nthe nicest bee I've met in a long time!\n\n\nLong time? What are you talking about?!\nAre there other bugs in your life?\n\n\nNo, but there are other things bugging\nme in life. And you're one of them!\n\n\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\n\n\nMy nerves are fried from riding\non this emotional roller coaster!\n\n\nGoodbye, Ken.\n\n\nAnd for your information,\n\n\nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\nsweeteners made by man!\n\n\nI'm sorry about all that.\n\n\nI know it's got\nan aftertaste! I like it!\n\n\nI always felt there was some kind\nof barrier between Ken and me.\n\n\nI couldn't overcome it.\nOh, well.\n\n\nAre you OK for the trial?\n\n\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\nis about out of ideas.\n\n\nWe would like to call\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\n\n\nGood idea! You can really see why he's\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nLayton, you've\ngotta weave some magic\n\n\nwith this jury,\nor it's gonna be all over.\n\n\nDon't worry. The only thing I have\nto do to turn this jury around\n\n\nis to remind them\nof what they don't like about bees.\n\n\n- You got the tweezers?\n- Are you allergic?\n\n\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\n\n\nMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\nwhat I think we'd all like to know.\n\n\nWhat exactly is your relationship\n\n\nto that woman?\n\n\nWe're friends.\n\n\n- Good friends?\n- Yes.\n\n\nHow good? Do you live together?\n\n\nWait a minute...\n\n\nAre you her little...\n\n\n...bedbug?\n\n\nI've seen a bee documentary or two.\nFrom what I understand,\n\n\ndoesn't your queen give birth\nto all the bee children?\n\n\n- Yeah, but...\n- So those aren't your real parents!\n\n\n- Oh, Barry...\n- Yes, they are!\n\n\nHold me back!\n\n\nYou're an illegitimate bee,\naren't you, Benson?\n\n\nHe's denouncing bees!\n\n\nDon't y'all date your cousins?\n\n\n- Objection!\n- I'm going to pincushion this guy!\n\n\nAdam, don't! It's what he wants!\n\n\nOh, I'm hit!!\n\n\nOh, lordy, I am hit!\n\n\nOrder! Order!\n\n\nThe venom! The venom\nis coursing through my veins!\n\n\nI have been felled\nby a winged beast of destruction!\n\n\nYou see? You can't treat them\nlike equals! They're striped savages!\n\n\nStinging's the only thing\nthey know! It's their way!\n\n\n- Adam, stay with me.\n- I can't feel my legs.\n\n\nWhat angel of mercy\nwill come forward to suck the poison\n\n\nfrom my heaving buttocks?\n\n\nI will have order in this court. Order!\n\n\nOrder, please!\n\n\nThe case of the honeybees\nversus the human race\n\n\ntook a pointed turn against the bees\n\n\nyesterday when one of their legal\nteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.\n\n\n- Hey, buddy.\n- Hey.\n\n\n- Is there much pain?\n- Yeah.\n\n\nI...\n\n\nI blew the whole case, didn't I?\n\n\nIt doesn't matter. What matters is\nyou're alive. You could have died.\n\n\nI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\n\n\nThey got it from the cafeteria\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\n\n\nLook, there's\na little celery still on it.\n\n\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\n\n\nI can't explain it. It was all...\n\n\nAll adrenaline and then...\nand then ecstasy!\n\n\nAll right.\n\n\nYou think it was all a trap?\n\n\nOf course. I'm sorry.\nI flew us right into this.\n\n\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\n\n\nWhat will the humans do to us\nif they win?\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\nThat doesn't sound so bad.\n\n\nAdam, they check in,\nbut they don't check out!\n\n\nOh, my.\n\n\nOould you get a nurse\nto close that window?\n\n\n- Why?\n- The smoke.\n\n\nBees don't smoke.\n\n\nRight. Bees don't smoke.\n\n\nBees don't smoke!\nBut some bees are smoking.\n\n\nThat's it! That's our case!\n\n\nIt is? It's not over?\n\n\nGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\n\n\nGet back to the court and stall.\nStall any way you can.\n\n\nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\n\n\nMr. Flayman.\n\n\nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\n\n\nWhere is the rest of your team?\n\n\nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\n\n\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\n\n\nand as a result,\nwe don't make very good time.\n\n\nI actually heard a funny story about...\n\n\nYour Honor,\nhaven't these ridiculous bugs\n\n\ntaken up enough\nof this court's valuable time?\n\n\nHow much longer will we allow\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\n\n\nThey have presented no compelling\nevidence to support their charges\n\n\nagainst my clients,\nwho run legitimate businesses.\n\n\nI move for a complete dismissal\nof this entire case!\n\n\nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\n\n\nto have to consider\nMr. Montgomery's motion.\n\n\nBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\n\n\nWhere is your proof?\nWhere is the evidence?\n\n\nShow me the smoking gun!\n\n\nHold it, Your Honor!\nYou want a smoking gun?\n\n\nHere is your smoking gun.\n\n\nWhat is that?\n\n\nIt's a bee smoker!\n\n\nWhat, this?\nThis harmless little contraption?\n\n\nThis couldn't hurt a fly,\nlet alone a bee.\n\n\nLook at what has happened\n\n\nto bees who have never been asked,\n\"Smoking or non?\"\n\n\nIs this what nature intended for us?\n\n\nTo be forcibly addicted\nto smoke machines\n\n\nand man-made wooden slat work camps?\n\n\nLiving out our lives as honey slaves\nto the white man?\n\n\n- What are we gonna do?\n- He's playing the species card.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please,\nfree these bees!\n\n\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\n\nFree the bees!\n\n\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\n\nThe court finds in favor of the bees!\n\n\nVanessa, we won!\n\n\nI knew you could do it! High-five!\n\n\nSorry.\n\n\nI'm OK! You know what this means?\n\n\nAll the honey\nwill finally belong to the bees.\n\n\nNow we won't have\nto work so hard all the time.\n\n\nThis is an unholy perversion\nof the balance of nature, Benson.\n\n\nYou'll regret this.\n\n\nBarry, how much honey is out there?\n\n\nAll right. One at a time.\n\n\nBarry, who are you wearing?\n\n\nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\nand I have no pants.\n\n\n- What if Montgomery's right?\n- What do you mean?\n\n\nWe've been living the bee way\na long time, 27 million years.\n\n\nOongratulations on your victory.\nWhat will you demand as a settlement?\n\n\nFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown\nof all bee work camps.\n\n\nThen we want back the honey\nthat was ours to begin with,\n\n\nevery last drop.\n\n\nWe demand an end to the glorification\nof the bear as anything more\n\n\nthan a filthy, smelly,\nbad-breath stink machine.\n\n\nWe're all aware\nof what they do in the woods.\n\n\nWait for my signal.\n\n\nTake him out.\n\n\nHe'll have nauseous\nfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.\n\n\nAnd we will no longer tolerate\nbee-negative nicknames...\n\n\nBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\n\n\n...unnecessary inclusion of honey\nin bogus health products\n\n\nand la-dee-da human\ntea-time snack garnishments.\n\n\nCan't breathe.\n\n\nBring it in, boys!\n\n\nHold it right there! Good.\n\n\nTap it.\n\n\nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\nand there's gallons more coming!\n\n\n- I think we need to shut down!\n- Shut down? We've never shut down.\n\n\nShut down honey production!\n\n\nStop making honey!\n\n\nTurn your key, sir!\n\n\nWhat do we do now?\n\n\nCannonball!\n\n\nWe're shutting honey production!\n\n\nMission abort.\n\n\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\nReturning to base.\n\n\nAdam, you wouldn't believe\nhow much honey was out there.\n\n\nOh, yeah?\n\n\nWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\n\n\n- Are they out celebrating?\n- They're home.\n\n\nThey don't know what to do.\nLaying out, sleeping in.\n\n\nI heard your Uncle Carl was on his way\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\n\n\nAt least we got our honey back.\n\n\nSometimes I think, so what if humans\nliked our honey? Who wouldn't?\n\n\nIt's the greatest thing in the world!\nI was excited to be part of making it.\n\n\nThis was my new desk. This was my\nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.\n\n\nAnd now...\n\n\nNow I can't.\n\n\nI don't understand\nwhy they're not happy.\n\n\nI thought their lives would be better!\n\n\nThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.\nHoney really changes people.\n\n\nYou don't have any idea\nwhat's going on, do you?\n\n\n- What did you want to show me?\n- This.\n\n\nWhat happened here?\n\n\nThat is not the half of it.\n\n\nOh, no. Oh, my.\n\n\nThey're all wilting.\n\n\nDoesn't look very good, does it?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\n\n\nYou know, I'm gonna guess bees.\n\n\nBees?\n\n\nSpecifically, me.\n\n\nI didn't think bees not needing to make\nhoney would affect all these things.\n\n\nIt's notjust flowers.\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\n\n\nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\n\n\nTake away produce, that affects\nthe entire animal kingdom.\n\n\nAnd then, of course...\n\n\nThe human species?\n\n\nSo if there's no more pollination,\n\n\nit could all just go south here,\ncouldn't it?\n\n\nI know this is also partly my fault.\n\n\nHow about a suicide pact?\n\n\nHow do we do it?\n\n\n- I'll sting you, you step on me.\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\n\n\nRight, right.\n\n\nListen, Barry...\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\n\n\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\n\n\nVanessa?\n\n\nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\nWhere are you going?\n\n\nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade\nin Pasadena.\n\n\nThey've moved it to this weekend\nbecause all the flowers are dying.\n\n\nIt's the last chance\nI'll ever have to see it.\n\n\nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\n\n\nI know. Me neither.\n\n\nTournament of Roses.\nRoses can't do sports.\n\n\nWait a minute. Roses. Roses?\n\n\nRoses!\n\n\nVanessa!\n\n\nRoses?!\n\n\nBarry?\n\n\n- Roses are flowers!\n- Yes, they are.\n\n\nFlowers, bees, pollen!\n\n\nI know.\nThat's why this is the last parade.\n\n\nMaybe not.\nOould you ask him to slow down?\n\n\nOould you slow down?\n\n\nBarry!\n\n\nOK, I made a huge mistake.\nThis is a total disaster, all my fault.\n\n\nYes, it kind of is.\n\n\nI've ruined the planet.\nI wanted to help you\n\n\nwith the flower shop.\nI've made it worse.\n\n\nActually, it's completely closed down.\n\n\nI thought maybe you were remodeling.\n\n\nBut I have another idea, and it's\ngreater than my previous ideas combined.\n\n\nI don't want to hear it!\n\n\nAll right, they have the roses,\nthe roses have the pollen.\n\n\nI know every bee, plant\nand flower bud in this park.\n\n\nAll we gotta do is get what they've got\nback here with what we've got.\n\n\n- Bees.\n- Park.\n\n\n- Pollen!\n- Flowers.\n\n\n- Repollination!\n- Across the nation!\n\n\nTournament of Roses,\nPasadena, California.\n\n\nThey've got nothing\nbut flowers, floats and cotton candy.\n\n\nSecurity will be tight.\n\n\nI have an idea.\n\n\nVanessa Bloome, FTD.\n\n\nOfficial floral business. It's real.\n\n\nSorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.\n\n\nThank you. It was a gift.\n\n\nOnce inside,\nwe just pick the right float.\n\n\nHow about The Princess and the Pea?\n\n\nI could be the princess,\nand you could be the pea!\n\n\nYes, I got it.\n\n\n- Where should I sit?\n- What are you?\n\n\n- I believe I'm the pea.\n- The pea?\n\n\nIt goes under the mattresses.\n\n\n- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\n- I'm getting the marshal.\n\n\nYou do that!\nThis whole parade is a fiasco!\n\n\nLet's see what this baby'll do.\n\n\nHey, what are you doing?!\n\n\nThen all we do\nis blend in with traffic...\n\n\n...without arousing suspicion.\n\n\nOnce at the airport,\nthere's no stopping us.\n\n\nStop! Security.\n\n\n- You and your insect pack your float?\n- Yes.\n\n\nHas it been\nin your possession the entire time?\n\n\nWould you remove your shoes?\n\n\n- Remove your stinger.\n- It's part of me.\n\n\nI know. Just having some fun.\nEnjoy your flight.\n\n\nThen if we're lucky, we'll have\njust enough pollen to do the job.\n\n\nCan you believe how lucky we are? We\nhave just enough pollen to do the job!\n\n\nI think this is gonna work.\n\n\nIt's got to work.\n\n\nAttention, passengers,\nthis is Captain Scott.\n\n\nWe have a bit of bad weather\nin New York.\n\n\nIt looks like we'll experience\na couple hours delay.\n\n\nBarry, these are cut flowers\nwith no water. They'll never make it.\n\n\nI gotta get up there\nand talk to them.\n\n\nBe careful.\n\n\nCan I get help\nwith the Sky Mall magazine?\n\n\nI'd like to order the talking\ninflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.\n\n\nCaptain, I'm in a real situation.\n\n\n- What'd you say, Hal?\n- Nothing.\n\n\nBee!\n\n\nDon't freak out! My entire species...\n\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\n\n- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!\n- Who's an attorney?\n\n\nDon't move.\n\n\nOh, Barry.\n\n\nGood afternoon, passengers.\nThis is your captain.\n\n\nWould a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B\nplease report to the cockpit?\n\n\nAnd please hurry!\n\n\nWhat happened here?\n\n\nThere was a DustBuster,\na toupee, a life raft exploded.\n\n\nOne's bald, one's in a boat,\nthey're both unconscious!\n\n\n- Is that another bee joke?\n- No!\n\n\nNo one's flying the plane!\n\n\nThis is JFK control tower, Flight 356.\nWhat's your status?\n\n\nThis is Vanessa Bloome.\nI'm a florist from New York.\n\n\nWhere's the pilot?\n\n\nHe's unconscious,\nand so is the copilot.\n\n\nNot good. Does anyone onboard\nhave flight experience?\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, there is.\n\n\n- Who's that?\n- Barry Benson.\n\n\nFrom the honey trial?! Oh, great.\n\n\nVanessa, this is nothing more\nthan a big metal bee.\n\n\nIt's got giant wings, huge engines.\n\n\nI can't fly a plane.\n\n\n- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?\n- Yes.\n\n\nHow hard could it be?\n\n\nWait, Barry!\nWe're headed into some lightning.\n\n\nThis is Bob Bumble. We have some\nlate-breaking news from JFK Airport,\n\n\nwhere a suspenseful scene\nis developing.\n\n\nBarry Benson,\nfresh from his legal victory...\n\n\nThat's Barry!\n\n\n...is attempting to land a plane,\nloaded with people, flowers\n\n\nand an incapacitated flight crew.\n\n\nFlowers?!\n\n\nWe have a storm in the area\nand two individuals at the controls\n\n\nwith absolutely no flight experience.\n\n\nJust a minute.\nThere's a bee on that plane.\n\n\nI'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson\nand his no-account compadres.\n\n\nThey've done enough damage.\n\n\nBut isn't he your only hope?\n\n\nTechnically, a bee\nshouldn't be able to fly at all.\n\n\nTheir wings are too small...\n\n\nHaven't we heard this a million times?\n\n\n\"The surface area of the wings\nand body mass make no sense.\"\n\n\n- Get this on the air!\n- Got it.\n\n\n- Stand by.\n- We're going live.\n\n\nThe way we work may be a mystery to you.\n\n\nMaking honey takes a lot of bees\ndoing a lot of small jobs.\n\n\nBut let me tell you about a small job.\n\n\nIf you do it well,\nit makes a big difference.\n\n\nMore than we realized.\nTo us, to everyone.\n\n\nThat's why I want to get bees\nback to working together.\n\n\nThat's the bee way!\nWe're not made of Jell-O.\n\n\nWe get behind a fellow.\n\n\n- Black and yellow!\n- Hello!\n\n\nLeft, right, down, hover.\n\n\n- Hover?\n- Forget hover.\n\n\nThis isn't so hard.\nBeep-beep! Beep-beep!\n\n\nBarry, what happened?!\n\n\nWait, I think we were\non autopilot the whole time.\n\n\n- That may have been helping me.\n- And now we're not!\n\n\nSo it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\n\n\nAll of you, let's get\nbehind this fellow! Move it out!\n\n\nMove out!\n\n\nOur only chance is if I do what I'd do,\nyou copy me with the wings of the plane!\n\n\nDon't have to yell.\n\n\nI'm not yelling!\nWe're in a lot of trouble.\n\n\nIt's very hard to concentrate\nwith that panicky tone in your voice!\n\n\nIt's not a tone. I'm panicking!\n\n\nI can't do this!\n\n\nVanessa, pull yourself together.\nYou have to snap out of it!\n\n\nYou snap out of it.\n\n\nYou snap out of it.\n\n\n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n\n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n\n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n\n- Hold it!\n- Why?

I can't see anything. Can you?\n\n\nNo, nothing. It's all cloudy.\n\n\nOome on. You got to think bee, Barry.\n\n\n- Thinking bee.\n- Thinking bee.\n\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n\nWait a minute.\nI think I'm feeling something.\n\n\n- What?\n- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.\n\n\nLike a 27-million-year-old instinct.\n\n\nBring the nose down.\n\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n\n- What in the world is on the tarmac?\n- Get some lights on that!\n\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n\n- Vanessa, aim for the flower.\n- OK.\n\n\nOut the engines. We're going in\non bee power. Ready, boys?\n\n\nAffirmative!\n\n\nGood. Good. Easy, now. That's it.\n\n\nLand on that flower!\n\n\nReady? Full reverse!\n\n\nSpin it around!\n\n\n- Not that flower! The other one!\n- Which one?\n\n\n- That flower.\n- I'm aiming at the flower!\n\n\nThat's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.\nI mean the giant pulsating flower\n\n\nmade of millions of bees!\n\n\nPull forward. Nose down. Tail up.\n\n\nRotate around it.\n\n\n- This is insane, Barry!\n- This's the only way I know how to fly.\n\n\nAm I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane\nflying in an insect-like pattern?\n\n\nGet your nose in there. Don't be afraid.\nSmell it. Full reverse!\n\n\nJust drop it. Be a part of it.\n\n\nAim for the center!\n\n\nNow drop it in! Drop it in, woman!\n\n\nOome on, already.\n\n\nBarry, we did it!\nYou taught me how to fly!\n\n\n- Yes. No high-five!\n- Right.\n\n\nBarry, it worked!\nDid you see the giant flower?\n\n\nWhat giant flower? Where? Of course\nI saw the flower! That was genius!\n\n\n- Thank you.\n- But we're not done yet.\n\n\nListen, everyone!\n\n\nThis runway is covered\nwith the last pollen\n\n\nfrom the last flowers\navailable anywhere on Earth.\n\n\nThat means this is our last chance.\n\n\nWe're the only ones who make honey,\npollinate flowers and dress like this.\n\n\nIf we're gonna survive as a species,\nthis is our moment! What do you say?\n\n\nAre we going to be bees, orjust\nMuseum of Natural History keychains?\n\n\nWe're bees!\n\n\nKeychain!\n\n\nThen follow me! Except Keychain.\n\n\nHold on, Barry. Here.\n\n\nYou've earned this.\n\n\nYeah!\n\n\nI'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect\nfit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.\n\n\nOh, yeah.\n\n\nThat's our Barry.\n\n\nMom! The bees are back!\n\n\nIf anybody needs\nto make a call, now's the time.\n\n\nI got a feeling we'll be\nworking late tonight!\n\n\nHere's your change. Have a great\nafternoon! Can I help who's next?\n\n\nWould you like some honey with that?\nIt is bee-approved. Don't forget these.\n\n\nMilk, cream, cheese, it's all me.\nAnd I don't see a nickel!\n\n\nSometimes I just feel\nlike a piece of meat!\n\n\nI had no idea.\n\n\nBarry, I'm sorry.\nHave you got a moment?\n\n\nWould you excuse me?\nMy mosquito associate will help you.\n\n\nSorry I'm late.\n\n\nHe's a lawyer too?\n\n\nI was already a blood-sucking parasite.\nAll I needed was a briefcase.\n\n\nHave a great afternoon!\n\n\nBarry, I just got this huge tulip order,\nand I can't get them anywhere.\n\n\nNo problem, Vannie.\nJust leave it to me.\n\n\nYou're a lifesaver, Barry.\nCan I help who's next?\n\n\nAll right, scramble, jocks!\nIt's time to fly.\n\n\nThank you, Barry!\n\n\nThat bee is living my life!\n\n\nLet it go, Kenny.\n\n\n- When will this nightmare end?!\n- Let it all go.\n\n\n- Beautiful day to fly.\n- Sure is.\n\n\nBetween you and me,\nI was dying to get out of that office.\n\n\nYou have got\nto start thinking bee, my friend.\n\n\n- Thinking bee!\n- Me?\n\n\nHold it.

to look inside your head, yes I do\nI've seen all your qualifications\nYou got from the Sorbonne\nAnd the painting you stole from Picasso\nYour loveliness goes on and on, yes it does\n\nWhen you go on

my lovely\nWhen you're alone in your bed?\nTell me the thoughts that surround you\nI want to look inside your head, yes I do\n\nI remember the back streets of Naples:\nTwo children begging in rags\nBoth touched with a burning ambition\nTo shake off their lowly-born tags, they tried\nSo look into my face, Marie-Claire\nAnd remember just who you are\nThen go and forget me forever\nBut I know you still bear the scar, deep inside\nI know where you go to my lovely\nWhen you're alone in your bed\nI know the thoughts that surround you\nCause I can look inside your head4Embed"}, {"_type":

DRAGONSTONE - BEACHWaves are crashing against rocks and washing over the beach.  Men are pulling JON SNOW's boat onto shore.  JON and DAVOS are walking onto the beach towards TYRION, MISSANDEI and Dothraki guards.  Dragonstone can be seen in the distance.\n\nTYRION:  The bastard of Winterfell.\n\nJON:  The dwarf of Casterly Rock.\n\nTYRION and JON both stare at each for a moment, then break into a smile.  They step forward and shake hands.\n\nTYRION:  I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.\n\nJON:  You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right.  You picked up some scars along the road.\nTYRION nods his head in agreement.\n\nTYRION:  It's been a long road.  But we're both still here.\n\nTYRION turns to address DAVOS.\n\nTYRION:  I'm Tyrion Lannister.\n\nDAVOS:  Davos Seaworth.\n\nTYRION and DAVOS shake hands.\n\nTYRION:  Ah, the Onion Knight.  We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.\n\nDAVOS:  Unluckily for me.\n\nTYRION:  Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.\n\nMISSANDEI:  Welcome to Dragonstone.  Our queen knows this is a long journey.  She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf.  If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.\n\nJON looks at DAVOS and his men.\n\nJON:  Of course.\n\nThe Dothraki guard move to take the weapons.  JON unties his sword and hands it over.  The Dothraki pick up JON's boat and begin to carry it away.\nMISSANDEI:  Please, this way.\n\nDAVOS begins walking with MISSANDEI and TYRION.  JON is following a few steps behind.\n\nDAVOS:  Where are you from?  I can't place the accent.\n\nMISSANDEI:  I was born on the Island of Naarth.\n\nDAVOS:  Ah.  I hear it's beautiful down there.  Palm trees and butterflies.  I haven't been myself.\n\nMISSANDEI nods and DAVOS slows pace to talk with JON.\n\nDAVOS:  This place has changed.\n\nCUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY\nThe group are making their way up to Dragonstone along a narrow stone pathway built into the cliffs leading to the castle.  TYRION begins speaking to JON.\n\nTYRION:  And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well.\n\nJON:  She is.\n\nTYRION:  Does she miss me terribly?\n\nJON looks at TYRION and doesn't say anything.\nTYRION:  A sham marriage and unconsummated.\n\nJON:  I didn't ask --\n\nTYRION:  Well, it was.  It wasn't.  Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on.\n\nJON:  She's starting to let on.\n\nTYRION:  Good.  At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.\n\nJON:  As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.\n\nTYRION:  A long and bloody tale.  To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.\n\nJON:  My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.\n\nTYRION:  Of course they do.  If I was your hand I would have advised against it.  General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.\n\nJON:  True.  But I'm not a Stark.\n\nA loud roar is heard from overhead.  JON and DAVOS dive to the ground.  Drogon flies over them, turns and flies over the castle.  JON and DAVOS look at each other in astonishment.  DAVOS looks back to MISSANDEI who is still standing and smirking.  Tyrion walks over and helps JON up to his feet.\n\nTYRION:  I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do.\n\nJON looks back to the sky.  All three dragons are circling above the castle.\n\nTYRION:  Come.  Their mother is waiting for you.\n\nJON and DAVOS exchange glances.  They continue walking up the path.  The camera shifts focus to MELISANDRE who is far above the group watching them from a cliff.  VARYS approaches MELISANDRE from behind and stands next to her.\n\nVARYS:  I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.  You begged us to summon the King in the North.  Don't you want to see him again?\n\nMELISANDRE:  I've done my part.  I've brought ice and fire together.\n\nVARYS:  Strange.  You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff.  I didn't take you for a bashful girl.\n\nMELISANDRE:  My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.\n\nVARYS:  Oh, I doubt that.  Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man.  Nothing is ever so sweet again.\n\nMELISANDRE:  Neither of us is common folk anymore.  I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor.\n\nVARYS:  Why?\n\nMELISANDRE:  Because of mistakes I made.  Terrible mistakes.  I would only be a distraction if I stayed.\n\nVARYS:  So where will you go?\n\nMELISANDRE:  Volantis.\n\nVARYS:  Good.  If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros.  I'm not sure you'd be safe here.\n\nMELISANDRE:  I will return, dear spider.  One last time.\n\nVARYS begins shaking his head.\n\nVARYS:  My Lady --\n\nMELISANDRE:  I have to die in this strange country, just like you.\n\nMELISANDRE turns and walks away leaving VARYS alone on the cliff.\nCUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM\nJON approaches the throne room.  Dothraki guards open the doors and allow him in.  He is walking with TYRION, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and other Dothraki guards.  DAENERYS is sitting on the throne.  MISSANDEI begins addressing JON and DAVOS.\n\nMISSANDEI:  You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains.\n\nJON turns and looks at DAVOS.\n\nDAVOS:  This is Jon Snow.\n\nDAVOS nods and pauses.\n\nDAVOS:  He's King in the North.\n\nTYRION smirks to himself.\n\nDAENERYS:  Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords.  I hope the seas weren't too rough.\n\nJON:  The winds were kind, Your Grace.\n\nDAVOS:  Apologies.  I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know.  But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace.  He's not a lord.\n\nDAENERYS:  Forgive me --\n\nTYRION:  Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.\n\nDAERNEYS:  Forgive me, Ser Davos.  I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen.  Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.  But do I have my facts wrong?\n\nDAVOS:  I wasn't there, Your Grace.\n\nDAENERYS:  No.  Of course not.  But still, an oath is an oath.  In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?\n\nTYRION:  Forever.\n\nDAENERYS:  Forever.  So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee.\n\nJON:  I am not.\n\nDAENERYS:  Oh.  Well, that is unfortunate.  You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?\n\nJON:  Break faith?  Your father burned my grandfather alive.  He burned my uncle alive.  He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nDAENERYS:  My father was an evil man.  On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family.  And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father.  Our two houses were allies for centuries.  Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known.  Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.  I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.  Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.  Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.  Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it.\n\nJON:  You're right.  You're not guilty of your father's crime.  And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.\n\nDAENERYS:  Then why are you here?\n\nJON:  Because I need your help and you need mine.\n\nDAENERYS smirks and looks over at TYRION.  She starts speaking to JON again.\n\nDAENERYS:  Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?\n\nJON:  I did.\n\nDAENERYS:  And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?\n\nJON:  They're hard to miss.\n\nDAENERYS:  But still, I need your help?\n\nDAVOS:  Not to defeat Cersei.  You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.  Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.\n\nTYRION:  Almost.\n\nJON:  But you haven't stormed King's Landing.  Why not?  The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.  It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it.  Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.\n\nDAENERYS:  Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.\n\nJON:  Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair.\n\nDAENERYS turns to TYRION.\n\nDAENERYS:  You told me you liked this man.\n\nTYRION:  I do.\n\nDAENERYS:  In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child.\n\nTYRION:  I believe he's calling all of us children.  Figure of speech.\n\nJON:  Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.\n\nDAENERYS:  As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.\n\nJON:  I am not your enemy.  The dead are the enemy.\n\nDAENERYS pauses and is incredulous.\n\nDAENERYS:  The dead?\n\nDAENERYS addresses TYRION.\n\nDAENERYS:  Is that another figure of speech?\n\nJON answers her before Tyrion.\n\nJON:  The Army of the Dead is on the march.\n\nTYRION:  The Army of the Dead?\n\nJON:  You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?\n\nTYRION:  No, I don't think you're either of those things.\n\nJON:  The Army of the Dead is real.  The White Walkers are real.  The Knight King is real.  I've seen them.  If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --\n\nJON begins walking closer to the throne.  The Dothraki guards step towards him to halt him.\n\nJON:  -- we're finished.\n\nDAENERYS pauses a moment.\n\nDAENERYS:  I was born at Dragonstone.  Not that I can remember it.\n\nDAENERYS stands from the throne and begins walking down the stairs towards JON.\n\nDAENERYS:  We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.  Robert was your father's best friend, no?  I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib.  Not that it matters now of course.  I spent my life in foreign lands.  So many men have tried to kill me.  I don't remember all of their names.  I have been sold like a brood mare.  I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.  Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?  Faith.  Not in any gods.  Not in myths and legends.  In myself.  In Daenerys Targaryen.  The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born.  The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea.  Any sea.\n\nDAENERYS stops walking and is face to face with JON.\n\nDAENERYS:  They did for me.  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.  And I will.\n\nJON:  You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.\n\nTyrion steps up to stand next to DAENERYS and speaks to JON.\n\nTYRION:  The war against my sister has already begun.  You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --\n\nTYRION pauses a moment.\n\nTYRION:  -- whatever you saw beyond the wall.\n\nDAVOS:  You don't believe him.  I understand that.  It sounds like nonsense.\n\nJON nods in agreement.\n\nDAVOS:  But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.  You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros.  He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen.  He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.  He was named King in the North.  Not because of his birthright.  He has no birthright.  He's a damn bastard.  All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him.\n\nDAENERYS stops looking at DAVOS and begins looking at JON.\n\nDAVOS:  All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things.  He fought those things for the good of his people.  He risked his life for his people.  He took a knife in the heart for his people.  He gave his own --\n\nJON looks at DAVOS to cut him off.  DAVOS stops talking.  DAENERYS and TYRION exchange glances.\n\nDAVOS:  If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die.  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.\n\nTYRION:  If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.\n\nJON shakes his head and looks at the floor.\n\nTYRION:  Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys.  Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.\n\nJON:  There's no time for that.  There's no time for any of this.  While we stand here debating --\n\nTYRION:  It takes no time to bend the knee.  Pledge your sword to her cause.\n\nJON:  And why would I do that?\n\nJON turns to speak to DAENERYS.\n\nJON:  I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.  As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name.  And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.  The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them.  And I will continue to do so as well as I can.\n\nDAENERYS:  That's fair.  It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion.\nVARYS walks quickly into the throne room and approaches DAENERYS.  He begins whispering in her ear.\n\nDAENERYS:  You must forgive my manners.  You will both be tired after your long journey.  We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.\n\nDAENERYS begins speaking Valyrian to her Queensguard.  Her guard steps forward to escort JON and DAVOS.  JON speaks to DAENERYS.\n\nJON:  Am I your prisoner?\n\nDAENERYS:  Not yet.\n\nDAENERYS begins walking back to the throne.  JON and DAVOS exit the throne room with a member of the Queensguard.  The Dothraki close the door to the throne room after JON and DAVOS exit.  VARYS begins speaking to DAENERYS.\n\nVARYS:  Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.\n\nDAENERYS:  And?\n\nVARYS:  Two or three ships escaped.  The rest sunk our captured.  Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured.  The Greyjoys are dead or captured.\n\nDAENERYS:  All of them?\n\nCUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE\nTheon is hanging on to flotsam on the ocean.  A friendly Greyjoy ship is pulling him out of the water with a rope.  They haul him onto the ship and drop him on deck.  He is shivering and dishelveled.  The captain of the boat approaches THEON and speaks to him while THEON is laying on the deck.\n\nCAPTAIN:  Your sister's dead?\n\nTHEON:  Euron has her.\n\nCAPTAIN:  You saw him take her?  And you got away?\n\nTHEON:  I couldn't save her.  I tried.\n\nCAPTAIN:  You wouldn't be here if you tried.\n\nTHEON turns his eyes away from the captain.  The captain turns and walks away.  The men go back to their duties, some stepping over THEON as he continues to lay on the deck.\n\nCUT TO:  KING'S LANDING - STREETS\n\nEURON is escorting prisoners YARA GREYJOY, ELLARIA and TYENE SAND.  The prisoners are chained.  EURON is riding a horse.  He has a rope tied to YARA's neck and is leading her towards the Red Keep.  There is a large crowd shouting and cheering as they bring the prisoners through the streets.  EURON is smiling and showing off for the crowd.  The crowd shouts obscenities and curses at the prisoners.\n\nEURON(to YARA):  This is the life.  Look at them.  Cheering for a Greyjoy.\n\nEURON pulls on the rope around YARA's neck forcing her to run forward to stand next to EURON's horse.\n\nEURON:  I have to be honest, it's making me hard.  Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?\n\nEURON begins mocking Theon in a high pitched voice.\n\nEURON:  Oh no!\n\nEURON laughs.\n\nEURON:  What a twat.\n\nCUT TO:  RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM\nCERSEI is sitting on the throne surrounded by QYBURN, JAIME, and THE MOUNTAIN.  There is a crowd gathered and they're clapping as EURON brings the prisoners down the aisle towards the throne.  EURON climbs down from his horse and grabs the chains that bind ELLARIA and TYENE and starts walking them to the throne.\n\nEURON:  My queen.  Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.\n\nEURON throws the chains at the feet of CERSEI.\n\nEURON:  I give you --\n\nEURON looks over to JAIME.\n\nEURON:  -- what no other man could give.  Justice.  Justice for your murdered daughter.\n\nELLARIA spits onto the floor near the throne and CERSEI smiles.  CERSEI begins speaking to EURON.\n\nCERSEI:  You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.\n\nEURON leans in and speaks to CERSEI so the crowd can't hear.\n\nEURON:  A bit more than a true friend.\n\nCERSEI:  And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.\n\nEURON:  There's only one reward I want.\n\nCERSEI:  You shall have what your heart desires --\n\nJAIME looks over at CERSEI.\n\nCERSEI:  -- when the war is won.\n\nCERSEI stands and addresses the people gathered in the throne room.\n\nCERSEI:  With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country.\n\nThe crowd starts cheering and clapping.  CERSEI turns and walks back to the throne and sits.  EURON is waving to the crowd and begins speaking to JAIME.\n\nEURON:  There's nothing quite like it, is there?  The love of the people.  I suppose you wouldn't know.\n\nJAIME:  This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.\n\nEURON:  Or yours.  They just like severed heads really.  Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.\n\nJAIME:  Advice?\n\nEURON:  Does she like it gentle or rough?  A finger in the bum?\n\nJAIME turns to EURON angrily.\n\nEURON:  Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now.  We'll talk later.\n\nEURON bows to the queen.  He walks down and collects YARA and walks out with her and his guards.\nCUT TO:  RED KEEP - DUNGEONS\nTHE MOUNTAIN, CERSEI and QYBURN are standing in a torch lit dungeon beneath the Red Keep.  ELLARIA and TYENE are chained to walls opposite of each other.  They are both gagged.  CERSEI speaks to ELLARIA.\n\nCERSEI:  I want you to know I understand.  Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you.  I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.  I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.\n\nELLARIA struggles against her restraints\n\nCERSEI:  The sound of your scream.  I never heard a sound like that.  I thought, that's true love.  Oberyn looked beautiful that day.  He really did.  No one moved like him.  No one had such skill with a spear.  Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.  If only he hadn't taunted him.  He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.  But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?  Now he's burried somewhere.  And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever.  That must be difficult for you.  When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child.  I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse.  I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.  I never got to have a mother.  But Myrcella did.  She was mine and you took her from me.  Why did you do that?\n\nCERSEI pauses and looks at ELLARIA.\n\nCERSEI:  It doesn't matter now.\n\nCERSEI walks across the room and stands next to TYENE looking at her but continues speaking to ELLARIA.\n\nCERSEI:  Your daughter is a beauty too.  Brown eyes, those lips.  A perfect Dornish beauty.\n\nTYENE is looking from CERSEI to her mother, ELLARIA.  CERSAI stops looking at TYENE and turns back to ELLARIA.\n\nCERSEI:  I imagine she is your favorite.\n\nELLARIA pulls on her restraints.\n\nCERSEI:  I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites.  But still, we're only human.  We love who we love.\n\nELLARIA begins gasping and trying to speak through her gag.\n\nCERSEI:  I'm sorry.  I can't understand you.  The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying.  It must be frustrating.\n\nELLARIA whimpers.\n\nCERSEI:  We all make our choices.  You chose to murder my daughter.  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.\n\nELLARIA screams and pulls against her restraints.  She takes the slack out of the chain but is held in place inches from CERSEI.\n\nCERSEI:  Do you feel powerful now?  I don't sleep very well, not at all really.  I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies.  How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.  I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.  It would be poetic I suppose but fast.  Too fast.\n\nCERSEI turns away from ELLARIA and walks back to TYENE and takes TYENE's face in her hands.  She continues talking to ELLARIA.\n\nCERSEI:  I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.\n\nCERSEI removes the gag from TYENE's mouth.\n\nCERSEI:  She's so beautiful.  The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right.\n\nCERSEI is caressing TYENE's face.  CERSEI looks at ELLARIA, then turns back and kisses TYENE.  TYENE is whimpering.  CERSEI stops kissing TYENE and looks back at ELLARIA.\n\nTYENE:  Momma!\n\nELLARIA screams and looks at CERSEI.  QYBURN steps to TYENE and puts the gag back on her mouth.  TYENE is crying.  QYBURN walks over to CERSEI and hands her a cloth.  ELLARIA falls down to her knees and is watching her daughter.  CERSEI starts wiping off the red lipstick she was wearing.  CERSEI speaks to ELLARIA.\n\nCERSEI:  Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know.  Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.  The long goodbye, was that it?\n\nQYBURN:  The Long Farewell.\n\nQYBURN hands CERSEI a vile containing the posion antidote.\n\nCERSEI:  That's the one.\n\nCERSEI drinks the antidote.\n\nCERSEI:  How long does the poison take?\n\nQYBURN:  Difficult to say.  Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution.\n\nCERSEI:  But death is certain?\n\nQYBURN:  Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain.\n\nELLARIA is still on her knees crying.  CERSEI squats down to talk to her.\n\nCERSEI:  Your daughter will die here in this cell.  You will be here watching when she does.  You will be here the rest of your days.  If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat.  You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made.\n\nCERSEI continues looking at ELLARIA but speaks to QYBURN.\n\nCERSEI:  Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.  I don't want her to miss a thing.\n\nCERSEI stands and walks out of the chamber with her entourage.  TYENE and ELLARIA both strain against their chains but can't reach each other.\nCUT TO:  RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS\nJAIME sets his gold hand down on the table and pours himself a glass of wine.  CERSEI barges in and approaches him.  CERSEI starts kissing JAIME.\n\nJAIME:  No.\n\nCERSEI kisses JAIME.  JAIME stands.  CERSEI unties his pants and gets on her knees.  Sex scene ensues.  Some time has passed.  CERSEI is asleep and JAIME is watching her in bed.  There's a knock at the door.\n\nJAIME:  Don't.\n\nCERSEI kisses JAIME, gets out of bed and covers herself with a robe.  JAIME sits up concerned.\n\nJAIME:  What are you doing?  No one can see us like this ?\n\nCERSEI:  I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  I'll do as I please.\n\nCERSEI walks over and opens the door.  A messenger looks in and sees JAIME in the bed.\n\nMESSENGER:  Forgive me, Your Grace.  The visitor from Braavos has arrived.\n\nCERSEI:  Good.  And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.\n\nMESSENGER:  At once, Your Grace.\n\nCERSEI closes the door.  JAIME lays his head against his pillows and laughs nervously.\nCUT TO:  RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM\nCERSEI is pouring two glasses of wine.  She carries them over and offers one to TYCHO NESTORIS of the Iron Bank.\n\nTYCHO:  No, thank you.\n\nCERSEI carries both glasses to her desk and sits down.\n\nTYCHO:  My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son.  From all reports he was a fine young man.\n\nCERSEI:  The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.\n\nTYCHO:  Condolences and congratulations.  You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms.  That's quite an accomplishment.  The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.\n\nCERSEI:  The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.\n\nTYCHO:  Indeed.  But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.\n\nCERSEI:  The Iron Bank wants its gold back.\n\nTYCHO:  Your father never minced words either.  But, yes, your debts are considerable.  And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.  We both know how expensive war can be.\n\nCERSEI:  And we both know gold wins wars.  Your vaults are empty.  Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.\n\nTYCHO:  Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies.  You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.\n\nCERSEI:  And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.\n\nTYCHO:  We don't make bets.  We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.\n\nCERSEI:  That's a fancy way of saying bet.  The war has already begun.  I've drawn first blood.  I decapitated the Dornish snake.  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.\n\nTYCHO:  Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.\n\nCERSEI:  Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.\n\nTYCHO:  For now.  Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons.  How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?\n\nCERSEI:  Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.  Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl.  You want to invest in her?  I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.  How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?\n\nTYCHO:  The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true.\n\nCERSEI:  From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch.  In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?\n\nTYCHO begins to speak but CERSEI cuts him off.\n\nCERSEI:  The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts.  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?\n\nTYCHO:  Your father's daughter indeed.\n\nCERSEI:  Give me a fortnight.  Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.\n\nCUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS\nTYRION is walking along the cliffs and sees JON standing alone looking out into the ocean.  TYRION approaches JON and speaks to him.\n\nTYRION:  I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.  You're making it difficult.  You look a lot better brooding than I do.  You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.\n\nJON:  I'm a prisoner on this island.\n\nTYRION:  I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.  You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.\n\nJON:  Except to my ship.  They took my ship.\n\nTYRION:  I wouldn't say we took your ship.\n\nJON:  I'm not playing word games with you.  The dead are coming for us all.\n\nTYRION:  Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.\n\nJON:  It's hard for me to fathom.  It really is.  If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --\n\nJON pauses and hangs his head.\n\nJON:  You probably don't believe me.\n\nTYRION:  I do actually.\n\nJON:  You didn't before.  Grumpkins and snarks you called them.  Do you remember?  You said it was all nonsense.\n\nTYRION:  It was all nonsense.  Everybody knew it.  But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.\n\nJON:  How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?\n\nTYRION:  Good question.\n\nJON:  I know it's a good question.  I'm looking for an answer.\n\nTYRION:  People's minds aren't made for problems that large.  White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.\n\nJON:  I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.  I can't help them from here.  I'd like to leave.\n\nTYRION:  It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.\n\nJON:  Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.  Don't go south.  Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader.  And here I am.  A northern fool.\n\nTYRION:  Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us.  And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye.  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't.  Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now.  While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter.  She protects people from monsters, just as you do.  That's why she came here.  And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting.  That's not a reasonable thing to ask.\n\nJON turns from TYRION and begins to walk away.\n\nTYRION:  So do you have anything reasonable to ask?\n\nJON stops and turns back around.\n\nJON:  What do you mean?\n\nTYRION:  Maybe you are a northern fool.  I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.\n\nCUT TO: DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE\nDAENERYS and TYRION are having a discussion.\n\nDAENERYS:  Dragonglass?\n\nTYRION:  Yes.  Volcanic glass, obsidian.  He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.\n\nDAENERYS:  Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.\n\nTYRION:  Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.\n\nDAENERYS:  And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?\n\nTYRION:  Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them.  I'm unsure of the nomenclature.\n\nDAENERYS:  And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?\n\nTYRION:  I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.\n\nDAENERYS:  Which wise man said this?\n\nTYRION:  I don't remember.\n\nDAENERYS:  Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?\n\nTYRION:  I would never do that...to you.  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.  I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway.  You don't have to believe him.  Let him mine the Dragonglass.  If he's wrong it's worthless.  You didn't even know it was here.  It's nothing to you.  Give him something by giving him nothing.  Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally.  Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand.  Casterly Rock.\n\nDAENERYS:  What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?\n\nTYRION:  You must allow them their flights of fancy.  It's dreary in the north.\n\nCUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS\nDAENERYS is at the bottom of the path looking out into the ocean.  Dragons are flying over the ocean and over the mountains in the distance.  JON approaches DAENERYS from the top of the stairs.\n\nJON:  Amazing thing to see.\n\nDAENERYS:  I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.\nDAENERYS turns to look at JON.\n\nDAENERYS:  You lost two brothers as well?\nJON shakes his head.\n\nDAENERYS:  People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are.  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.\n\nJON:  You've been talking to Tyrion?\n\nDAENERYS:  He is my Hand.\n\nJON:  He enjoys talking.\n\nDAENERYS:  We all enjoy what we're good at.\n\nJON:  I don't.\n\nDAENERYS pauses and looks at JON.\n\nDAENERYS:  You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.\n\nJON:  I never expected that you would.\n\nDAENERYS:  And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.\n\nJON:  I haven't either.\n\nDAENERYS:  I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it.  Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.\n\nJON:  Thank you.\n\nDAENERYS turns back to the ocean.\n\nJON:  So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?\n\nDAENERYS:  You better get to work, Jon Snow.\n\nJON turns and quickly walks up the stairs towards the castly.\nCUT TO:  WINTERFELL - COURTYARD\nMen are working in the courtyard rolling carts of hey and carrying water.  A blacksmith is working the forge.  SANSA, PETER BAELISH, YOHN ROYCE and MAESTER WOLKAN are standing on the upper level of the courtyard having a discussion.\n\nSANSA:  How much do we have?\n\nWOLKAN:  4,000 bushels, My Lady.\n\nSANSA:  What does that mean?\n\nYOHN:  For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.\n\nSANSA begins walking and everyone follows.\n\nSANSA:  What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?\n\nWOLKAN:  I'm not entirely certain.  I'll check Maester Llewyn's records.  He kept a copy of every raven scroll.\n\nSANSA and the men walk from the upper level down into the courtyard.\n\nSANSA:  You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell.\n\nWOLKAN:  No, My Lady, most likely not.\n\nSANSA:  We must prepare for that eventuality.  Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be.  We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north.  If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.\n\nYOHN:  Very wise, My Lady.\n\nSANSA:  Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?\n\nWOLKAN bows and leaves.  SANSA and the others keep walking through the courtyard.  SANSA sees smiths hammering breastplate.\n\nSANSA:  Are they covering those breastplates in leather?\n\nYOHN:  No, My Lady.\n\nSANSA:  Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?\n\nYOHN:  They should indeed.  Pardon me, My Lady.\n\nYOHN steps over to the blacksmith.\n\nYOHN:  You there, why isn't there leather on these?\n\nSANSA and BAELISH continue walking.\n\nBAELISH:  Command suits you.  The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.\n\nSANSA:  So they should be.\n\nBAELISH:  I know Cersei better than anyone here.  If you turn your back on her --\n\nSANSA:  You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.\n\nBAELISH:  I only meant to say --\n\nSANSA:  That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous?  Thank you for your wise council.\n\nBAELISH:  One of two things will happen.  Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end.  Or life will win out.  And what then?\n\nBAELISH walks in front of SANSA and stops her.\n\nBAELISH:  Don't fight in the north or the south.  Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind.  Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once.  Live that way and nothing will surprise you.  Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before.\nA Winterfell guard approaches SANSA and BAELISH.\n\nGUARD:  Lady Sansa, at the gate.\n\nSANSA turns and walks away from BAELISH.  There is a commotion at the gate.  People are gathered around.  SANSA rushes over to see what's going on.  Bran is in a cart in the Winterfell courtyard.  Bran looks at SANSA for a few moments without saying anything.\n\nBRAN:  Hello, Sansa.\n\nSANSA begins to cry and hugs BRAN.\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE\nSANSA and BRAN are sitting next to the Weirwood Tree having a discussion.\n\nSANSA:  I wish Jon was here.\n\nBRAN:  Yes.  I need to speak to him.\n\nSANSA:  Your father's last living true born son.  You're Lord of Winterfell.\n\nBRAN:  I can never be the Lord of Winterfell.  I can never be lord of anything.  I'm the three-eyed raven.\n\nSANSA:  I don't know what that means.\n\nBRAN:  It's difficult to explain.\n\nSANSA:  Try, please, for me.\n\nBRAN:  It means I can see everything.  Everything that's ever happened to everyone.  Everything that's happening right now.  It's all pieces, fragments.  I need to learn to see better.  When the long night comes again I need to be ready.\n\nSANSA:  How do you know all of this?\n\nBRAN:  The three-eyed raven taught me.\n\nSANSA:  I thought you were the three-eyed raven.\n\nBRAN:  I told you it's difficult to explain.\n\nSANSA:  Bran --\n\nBRAN:  I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.  I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home.  It was so beautiful that night.  Snow falling just like now.  And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.\nSANSA appears shaken.  She quickly stands up to leave.\n\nSANSA:  I have to go back inside, Bran.\n\nBRAN:  I'll stay a bit longer.\n\nCUT TO:  CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS\nARCHMAESTER MARWYN, SAMWELL TARLEY and JORAH MORMONT are standing in JORAH's quarantine room.  JORAH's skin has scars over the surface and the Greyscale is completely gone.  MARWYN extends a medical tool and begins poking around to examine JORAH.\n\nMARWYN:  Hmm.\n\nMARWYN walks around JORAH and continues to exam him.\n\nMARWYN:  Hmm.  Does it hurt?\n\nJORAH:  A bit.  Less than before.\n\nMARWYN:  The infection no longer appears to be active.\n\nJORAH sighs with relief and looks at the floor.\n\nMARWYN:  Unusual.  Unlikely.  One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.\n\nJORAH:  I don't know anything about that.  I just started feeling better.  I assumed it was the rest that did it.\n\nSAMWELL begins nodding his head in agreement.\n\nJORAH:  And the climate.\n\nMARWYN:  The climate?  You're free to go, Ser.  This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer.\n\nMARWYN begins walking out of the room.\n\nMARWYN:  Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.\n\nJORAH and SAMWELL stay in the room and have a discussion.\n\nJORAH:  How bad is it?\n\nSAMWELL:  I suppose I'll find out this evening.\n\nJORAH smiles and nods at SAMWELL.   He turns around and picks up his shirt.\n\nSAMWELL:  Where will you go?\n\nJORAH puts on his shirt and begins tying it up.\n\nJORAH:  I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.  I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.  Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.  The only place for me is with her.\n\nJORAH turns to face SAMWELL.\n\nJORAH:  I owe my life to her and you.\n\nSAMWELL:  Your father saved me more than once.  It's the least I could do.\n\nJORAH nods his head.\n\nJORAH:  Perhaps our paths will cross again?\n\nSAMWELL:  I hope they do.\n\nSAMWELL reaches out to shake JORAH's hand.  JORAH hesitates for a moment, then takes SAMWELL's hand.  JORAH places his second hand over SAMWELL's.  SAMWELL turns and walks out of the room leaving JORAH alone.  JORAH looks out the window and smiles.\nCUT TO:  ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY\nMARWYN AND SAMWELL are having a discussion.\n\nMARWYN:  You treated him?\n\nSAMWELL:  Yes.\n\nMARWYN:  Who told you to treat him?\n\nSAMWELL:  No one.\n\nMARWYN:  Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?\n\nSAMWELL:  I seem to remember you.\n\nMARWYN:  But you treated him anyway?\n\nSAMWELL:  I did.\n\nMARWYN:  I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful.  Especially on someone of that age.  You could have infected yourself and others.  You could have devastated the entire Citadel.  But you didn't.  It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.  Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed.  But you succeeded.  How?\n\nSAMWELL:  I read the books and followed the instructions.\n\nMARWYN stands up and walks from behind his desk.\n\nMARWYN:  That man is alive because of you.  You should be proud.\n\nSAMWELL:  Thank you, Archmaester.\n\nMARWYN:  Come here.\n\nMARWYN and SAMWELL walk to a table in the study.  It's covered in moldy books and scrolls.\n\nMARWYN:  All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away.  I need you to make copies of them.\n\nSAMWELL says nothing.\n\nMARWYN:  You were expecting a reward?  Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.  You'd better get started.  Be mindful of the paper mites.  They like flesh as well.\n\nMARWYN walks out of the room to leave SAMWELL to his work.\nCUT TO: DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE\nDAENERYS, VARYS, MISSANDEI and TYRION are standing around the painted table having a discussion.  TYRION knocks over one of the figurines as DAENERYS and VARYS speak.\n\nDAENERYS:  We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.\n\nVARYS:  Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.  To send our remaining ships after him --\n\nDAENERYS:  I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.\n\nDAENERYS pauses and looks at VARYS.  VARYS looks at TYRION.\n\nTYRION:  But you'll have to go yourself.  Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place.  You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.\n\nDAENERYS:  I wouldn't be alone.  I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal.  What can anyone do to them?\n\nMISSANDEI:  They can still do something to you.  It only takes one arrow.\n\nTYRION:  It's too great a risk.  You're too important.\n\nDAENERYS looks down at the painted table.\n\nDAENERYS:  What about Casterly Rock?\n\nVARYS:  The Unsullied will be there soon.\n\nMISSANDEI:  And what will they face?\n\nVARYS:  A difficult situation.  They know we're coming.\n\nTYRION:  Yes.  Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister.  She will be ready.\n\nCUT TO: CASTERLY ROCK\nTYRION continues narrating as the castle is seen in the distance on top of some cliffs.\n\nTYRION:  No one has ever taken the rock.\n\nLannister archers are shown on top of the battlements.  There are hundreds of ships sailing in the ocean heading to Casterly Rock.\n\nTYRION:  The Lannister army is still the army my father built.  Well trained and well provisioned.  10,000 men at least.  They will see us coming.\n\nGREY WORM is standing in a landing boat with other Unsullied on their way to the beach.  He puts on his helmet and readies himself for battle.\n\nTYRION:  They will be ready.\n\nA man is running across the battlements stocking arrows for the archers.  Men are stacking rocks along the wall to throw down at the invaders.\n\nMAN:  Draw!  Loose!\n\nArchers loose a set of arrows down onto rows of Unsullied marching on the walls of the castle.\n\nTYRION:  The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.\n\nUnsullied are being killed by incoming arrows.  Unsullied soldiers begin setting up ladders to scale the battlements.  The Lannister army throws rocks from the top of the wall.\n\nTYRION:  The fight up the walls will be hard.  We'll be at a disadvantage.  Many men will die.\n\nThe archers are easily defending the castle and killing Unsullied soldiers.\nCUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE\nTYRION starts narrating a different battle plan.\n\nTYRION:  Interesting thing about my father.  He built our house up from near ruin.  He built our army.  He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers.  That was beneath him.  So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find.  Me.  He was right.  I was low.  The company I kept low, women mostly.  They weren't welcome at the Rock.  Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.  I couldn't walk them through the front gates.  I couldn't have them in my chambers.  So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself.\n\nCUT TO:  CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS\nTYRION continues to narrate.  GREY WORM is in a landing boat sailing for a small opening in the side of a cliff.\n\nTYRION:  It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.\n\nThe Unsullied sail into the passage.  They jump out of the boat and rush into the sewers.  GREY WORM pushes up a manhole cover and emerges into the castle.  Guards are seen running by and don't notice GREY WORM and the other Unsullied soldiers sneaking in.\n\nTYRION:  No better place for low pursuits.  Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress.\n\nThe Unsullied are running through the courtyard cutting down Lannister men.\nTYRION:  As a good friend of mine once said, \"give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch.\"\nThe Unsullied fight their way to the main door in the courtyard.  GREY WORM lifts off the bar and opens the door.  Unsullied soldiers coming rushing through the gate by the hundreds.  They begin cutting down every Lannister in their way.\n\nTYRION:  And so it begins.  They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.  They will be outnumbered.  They will have less armor and fewer weapons.\n\nThere is general mayhem as the battle rages on in the courtyard.  GREY WORM breaks from the main fight and starts climbing to the battlements.  He is disposing of men with his spear on the way.\n\nTYRION:  But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.  They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.  They will be fighting for you.  And that is why they will triump.\n\nGREY WORM is fighting in a hallway killing men from both directions.  A Lannister charges towards GREY WORM.  GREY WORM throws his spear and impales the Lannister soldier to a door.  The battle is over.  GREY WORM and other Unsullied soldiers are stepping over dozens of dead Lannisters on the battlements.  GREY WORM removes his helmet and one of his men speak in Valyrian.\n\nUNSULLIED 1:  There are none left.\n\nGREY WORM:  There are supposed to be more than this.  Many more.\n\nGREY WORM turns to look out from the battlements towards the ocean.  The Unsullied fleet is under attack from the Iron Fleet and many boats are sunk or in flames.  GREY WORM's face twists in anger.  GREY WORM steps down from the battlement and grabs a bleeding Lannister soldier.  GREY WORM begins speaking English.\n\nGREY WORM:  Where are they?  Where are the rest of the Lannisters?\n\nCUT TO:  HIGHGARDEN - FIELDS\nThousands of fully armored Lannister soldiers are marching towards Highgarden.  JAIME is riding his horse inspecting the lines of soldiers.  He rides over and joins BRONN, RANDYLL TARLEY and DICKON TARLEY.  The camera shifts focus to Lady Olenna who is watching the advancing army from a balcony in Highgarden.  She turns and walks back into her castle.\nCUT TO:  HIGHGARDEN - COURTYARD\nSome time has passed.  The battle is already over.  JAIME is walking in the courtyard and there are dead Tyrell men scattered everywhere.  JAIME climbs to the top of the tower to meet OLENNA TYRELL.\nCUT TO:  OLENNA'S QUARTERS\nOlenna is sitting alone at a table wearing all black.  JAIME opens the door and enters the room.\n\nOLENNA:  It's done?\n\nJAIME:  It is.\n\nOLENNA:  And now the rains weep for our whores.  Did we fight well?\n\nJAIME:  I suppose as well as can be expected.\n\nJAIME walks to the wine and pours two glasses.\n\nOLENNA:  It was never our forte.  Golden roses indeed.  Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.\n\nJAIME:  The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.  Well, it is to me.  My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.\n\nOLENNA:  So you'll just let them take it?\n\nJAIME:  For now.  They won't be able to hold it.  Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left.  Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros.\n\nJAIME walks to where OLENNA is sitting and places both wine glasses on the table and sits down.\n\nOLENNA:  And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?\n\nJAIME:  As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.  There are always lessons in failures.\n\nOLENNA:  Yes.  You must be very wise by now.\n\nJAIME:  My father always said I was a slow learner.\n\nOLENNA:  If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry?  I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.  No more learning from my mistakes, eh?  How will you do it?  With that sword?\n\nJAIME shakes his head no.\n\nOLENNA:  That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?  Not that he ever used it.  What did he call it?\n\nJAIME:  Widow's Wail.\n\nOLENNA:  He really was a cunt, wasn't he?  I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders.  I never lost a night's sleep over them.  They were necessary.  And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did.  But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining.  That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination.  She's a monster, you do know that?\n\nJAIME:  To you, sure.  To others as well.  But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?\n\nOLENNA:  You love her.  You really do love her.  You poor fool.  She'll be the end of you.\n\nJAIME:  Possibly.  Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?\n\nOLENNA:  What better person to discuss it with?  What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?  But perhaps you're right.  If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.\n\nJAIME:  Yes, it has.\n\nOLENNA:  She's a disease.  I regret my role in spreading it.  You will too.\n\nJAIME:  I think we're done here.\n\nJAIME stands up and moves closer to OLENNA.\n\nOLENNA:  How will it happen?\n\nJAIME:  Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.  I talked her out of those.\n\nOLENNA looks up at JAIME.  JAIME produces a small vial from a pouch on his belt and pops the cork off with his thumb.  He pours the contents of the vial into one of the glasses of wine and slides it in front of OLENNA.\n\nOLENNA:  Will there be pain?\n\nJAIME:  No.  I made sure of that.\n\nOLENNA:  That's good.\n\nOLENNA reaches out and takes the wine.  She drinks the entire cup.  She looks back to JAIME.\n\nOLENNA:  I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple.  It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father.  It was horrible enough for me.  A shocking scene.  Not at all what I intended.  You see, I'd never seen the posion work before.  Tell Cersei.  I want her to know it was me.\n\nJAIME's face twists in anger.  He turns and walks out of the room leaving OLENNA alone.\nEND CREDITS1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/436665", "artist_names": "Aretha Franklin", "full_title":

It rather indicates it could be a long, hard night.\n\nMy lords, ladies and gentlemen, we have moved on 119 years since Billy Murdoch and Fred Spofforth, who were talked about in that video by Colin, did the job at The Oval in 1882 and then there followed that famous obituary \u2013 the mock obituary \u2013 that Colin talked about, from which The Ashes have sprung.\n\nThe game has flourished in many ways since then, and that is good. Unfortunately, it has had its setbacks as well and there have been plenty of changes. I was very pleased to hear a couple of years ago from A.R. Lewis, the past President of MCC, that in the pipeline there was a Preamble and a Spirit of Cricket. Because I had no details of this, I phoned Lewis from Australia and asked him whether it was possible to let me have some idea of what was going to be done, and he did that. He sent me the bare bones of what now is the Preamble and the Spirit of Cricket, and I was so impressed I rang him back straight away and said, \u201cGo for it. This is going to be one of the great things,\u201d \u2013 and that was before everyone knew that it was going to be written into the frontispiece of the Laws.\n\nOne of the reasons I am standing here tonight is that I have seen all those setbacks I talked about and I have seen all the good things in 50 of those 119 years, as indeed have many of the people here as guests this evening. The other reason is that 48 years ago, as a member of the 1953 Australian side skippered by Lindsay Hassett, I played against a very young Colin Cowdrey. Colin was in the Oxford side that year and we played against them in the Parks in May. Neither of us set anything on fire: he made 3 and 5 and I was stumped by A.P. Walsh off David Fasken, the fast bowler, aiming a rather ambitious stroke outside the off stump. It was an interesting Oxford team. John Fellows-Smith was there and Alan Dowding of South Australia. Jumbo Jowett and Charles Williams made a very good 47 in the second innings of the game and later went on to write a biography of Bradman. Frank Chester was one of the umpires, and I still remember him whispering to me after an over I\u2019d bowled, in the course of which I\u2019d made a very, very loud and enthusiastic appeal for caught behind \u2013 Gil Langley was keeper. He whispered, \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that ball just flicked the top of Mr Cowdrey\u2019s pad,\u201d and he was absolutely right when I checked up.\n\nHowever, I did have my first experience of what might be termed a reverse type of Preamble and Spirit of Cricket in that game. It is No. 5 in the Spirit of Cricket, and it\u2019s to do with appealing and knowing a batsman is not out. But this was reversed, because Keith Miller bowled the first ball of an over to I.C. Marshall, the opening batsman, and I held a thick edge at gully, and immediately called out to Miller \u201cNo, no. No, it bounced.\u201d That caught Miller\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re up to?\u201d he shouted. He said, \u201cYou got it three inches above the ground.\u201d It also caught the attention of Mr Marshall, the batsman, who had the feeling that there could be something about to happen. Nugget had just been rolling over his arm, there was something running in the 3.45 at Kempton in which he had a certain interest, and now he flicked his hair back and he added several yards to his pace and he knocked Colin\u2019s off-stump out of the ground. As we watched the new batsman come in, the rest of the team gathered around me, confirmed that they knew I was wet behind the ears, but they hadn\u2019t thought I was stupid as well.\n\nPerfectly legitimate in the Spirit of Cricket and in any Preamble is the endeavour to bowl out a batsman to dismiss him or to put a big dent in his confidence. After that Oxford match we came up against P.B.H. May in the game at Surrey, and those of you who were there, or have read about it, will know of the over Ray Lindwall bowled. Lindsay Hassett got him before we went out and he said, \u201cThis guy is dangerous. He made 100 against South Africa, his debut Test. We know he\u2019s going to be a very good player and we don\u2019t want him in the first Test.\u201d Ray bowled him that over where not one ball hit Peter May\u2019s bat. He played at everything and missed the whole six. That tactic was a success. It was perfectly legitimate. Peter got into the Trent Bridge Test, but struggled, and didn\u2019t play again until the Oval Test Match where England regained The Ashes after such a long time.\nIn those days there were amateurs and professionals. Nothing like that these days: everyone is a cricket player. But late in that summer we played a game against the Gentlemen of England, a fixture that has disappeared, for obvious reasons. The significant part of it was that this was the match that gained Colin his place in Len Hutton\u2019s side to go to Australia in 1954. It was an interesting team the Gentlemen put into the field. There was Reg Simpson, David Sheppard, Bill Edrich, Peter May, Colin Cowdrey at five and Charles Palmer at six, and Trevor Bailey, who had already become a hero because he and Willie Watson had saved the Lord\u2019s Test Match by batting almost the whole of the last day. There was Wilf Wooller, Don Brennan, Robin Marlar and George Chesterton. Miller didn\u2019t bowl in the first innings, but Lindwall, Bill Johnston and Ron Archer gave Colin a tremendous going over, for the same reason \u2013 that they wanted a dent put in his confidence. He made a brilliant 50. In the second innings there was Phil Boar, Lindwall, Miller, Bill Johnston, Ronnie Archer, and Colin made 57. It was another great knock \u2013 courageous too, because all those four generous fast bowlers, as fast bowlers often are, were kind enough to allow him full scope to practise his hook shot.\n\nIn May and Cowdrey, England had two of the finest examples of batsmanship and sportsmanship. When Colin came in to bat in Melbourne, on that tour that you just saw on the screen, in the third Test Match, England having won the second, it was 21 for 2. The pitch was damp and Miller was bowling superbly, and Colin played the best innings I ever saw from him \u2013 102 out of 191. The pitch was damp on top, not as damp as when the Melbourne Cricket Ground groundsman, making his Test debut, illegally watered it on the rest day, the Sunday of the match. Keith Miller took 3 for 8, bowling almost unchanged throughout the first session, and Colin just caressed the ball away time and again past point and through the covers. It was simply magnificent. The only violence there, 47 years ago, was against the ball and against the close-in fielders, of whom I was one.\n\nNow we are talking about a Preamble and the Spirit of Cricket, and a reminder in No. 6 that there is no place for any act of violence on the field of play. Although the Preamble and the Spirit of Cricket list seven areas where the players need to be very careful and need to do the right thing, it would be a mistake to consider that only the players should be listed. Fair and unfair play certainly are there, and the umpires need to take note of that. Administrators, though, are very much in the frame as well, and I think everyone should bear that in mind. Where it is said, quite correctly, that captains are responsible for the actions of their players, the wording might, in my view, include the word \u201cleaders\u201d, people who are chairmen of boards of control at the ICC, chief executive officers and all others in positions of authority in administration. It doesn\u2019t go just for the players but for everyone concerned with the well-being of the game.\n\nBringing the game into disrepute \u2013 that is in No. 1 in the Spirit of Cricket \u2013 is an all-embracing caution, so there was no real need to mention the phrase \u201cmatch-fixing\u201d in that. Match-fixing is the worst and most devastating thing I have seen in all my time in the game. Like many others, I simply found it impossible to believe that there were people out there deliberately playing in such a way that a game could be lost. The time I watched Don Bradman\u2019s side play at the SCG in 1940 against Stan McCabe\u2019s team, a New South Wales side, I spent just about every waking moment of every day trying to work out how to win a match. It is beyond my comprehension that there are bastards out there who spend most of their time trying to work out ways to lose one. Whether we are able to say within a couple of years that this matter has been solved is something only the future will tell us, but I would suggest that we assume nothing in the match-fixing situation at the moment.\n\nThe Preamble and the Spirit of Cricket rightly allow for hard and fair play. Test cricket and competitions like the Sheffield Shield, as it was known when I played \u2013 it has a different name now, but it is the same type of competition \u2013 are played within the Laws and within the Spirit of the Game. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to be namby-pamby about what they do out on the field, but it brings in the captains, responsible for the actions of the players, and it tries to ensure that the play is within the Spirit of the Game as well as within the Laws.\n\nWhat we do need to realise, I believe, is that we live in a world quite different from what we saw on the screen a few minutes ago, where cushions could be hired for sixpence a time and hats were the normal wear to the ground. England was on rationing cards for food and clothes, but the great joy at that time was that life was good because people were free. It is true, as Colin said, that Fred Trueman, one of the greatest bowlers I have ever seen, made his debut against the Australians at The Oval in 1953. He had played against India before, but this was his Ashes debut. It is also true, as Colin said in that chat with Mark Nicholas, that Fred never bowled a bad ball in his life. Equally true that when a batsman once complimented Fred on the one that pitched leg and took the top of the off-bail, Fred put an arm around his shoulders and then, in very friendly fashion, said, \u201cAye, but it was wasted on thee.\u201d I suppose, these days, television would pick up the arm round the shoulders and the chat, and there might be conjecture as to whether or not that was sledging. It might make headlines in the papers the next day. In the same way in 1961, when Fred took 11 for 88 against the Australians at Headingley and they beat us easily, he came in with in a beer in his hand \u2013 he\u2019d knocked me over for a pair. He put his arm round my shoulder, the same as he had with that other young player, and he said to me, \u201cBad luck. It was a beauty. It would have knocked over even a good batsman.\u201d\n\nThere has always been sledging in various forms. It doesn\u2019t matter which era you might be in. It\u2019s always been a tough game, cricket, and the better for it too. It\u2019s been hard fought with some odd bedfellows of desperation and success and failure. There has always been needle on the field. It is not just the prerogative of the modern-day player that that should be so. Matches in Australia between New South Wales and Victoria were played with all the intensity of a Test Match and much more back-chat. Green pitches in Sydney helped fast bowlers, although there has always been turn there, and a group of Lindwall, Miller, Tom Brooks, Alan Walker and Alan Davidson from New South Wales, and Bill Johnston, Sam Oxton, Harry Lambert and Strawberry Parr always ensured a fiery encounter in the Shield games \u2013 fiery but fair. With Miller flat on his back dodging a bouncer and Ian Johnson at mid-off shouting, \u201cGive him another one, Strawb,\u201d you knew that a few beers at the end of the day were likely to be spiced with some lively conversation.\n\nThe big difference is television. Nowadays people in their living-room can see exactly what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s worth remembering that before the mid-1970s no one had ever seen a toss on the ground. People were suddenly able to see the toss with the two captains and the coin going up, and television suddenly started to change the way everything was seen. I think television\u2019s great, because I\u2019m part of it and have been since 1963, when Fred Trueman, again, took 11 wickets in a Test here on this ground, a wonderful performance against the West Indians, and there were magnificent innings played in that game by Kanhai and Butcher, Dexter, Barrington and Close, and then, in the end, Cowdrey, who came out with a broken arm and saw out the last over. What a way to start your television career!\n\nTelevision brings everything to life. It might be in the living-room or the bedroom, if that\u2019s where you watch your cricket matches. If it happens on the field, you can be pretty sure that you\u2019ll see it on your screen. Quite different from, say, 1951-52, when I played in a Sheffield Shield match in Sydney. It was a game where New South Wales were hosting the South Australians, skippered by Phil Ridings. It was a green pitch and the air was blue for much of the time, with batsmen complaining and bowlers bitching away that the field had let them down. It was quite a match, made more so when Alan Walker, the New South Wales fast bowler, laid out Bruce Bowley, the South Australian opening batsman, and he was carted off the field and taken to hospital, where he had to stay overnight. They weren\u2019t too sure what was going to happen to him.\n\nPancho Ridings never took any prisoners on the field. He was a magnificent player. He later became chairman of the Australian Selection Committee and also chairman of the Australian Cricket Board. He never took a prisoner on the field. He made a wonderful 103 in the second innings of that match, out of 177, and he was 50 not out when a wicket fell and Bruce Bowley wandered out on to the field, head still swathed in bandages but padded up, because he\u2019d checked himself out of the hospital. The first two balls he received from Alan Walker were bouncers, and he went to earth for both of them. Now, Pancho Ridings quietly meandered down the pitch and somehow found himself chest to chest with Wacky Walker as he was striding back. Wacky couldn\u2019t go anywhere, and Pancho looked just past Wacky\u2019s left ear and he said very quietly to him that if by some freak of mischance he happened to hit Bowley, Pancho would make a point of chasing him round the Sydney Cricket Ground and, having placed his bat in Wacky\u2019s mouth, he would pull it out through an area only to be described in this refined company as his nether regions. There was no television. Next day in the Sydney Morning Herald that fine writer, T.L. Goodman, said that late in the day there appeared to be a minor altercation between P.L. Ridings, the South Australian captain, and A.K. Walker, the New South Wales fast bowler. Umpire H.R. Elfenston quickly solved any problems.\n\nThere were plenty more episodes lost because television didn\u2019t exist in those days, or the close-up television that we have now. Nothing was recorded, but you can take it from me that although we might all have looked angels on that screen there, and some of us still do, it wasn\u2019t always so. I played in South Africa in 1957-8 and there were two mad fast bowlers in the opposition \u2013 Neil Adcock and Peter Heine. When I say \u201cmad\u201d, not a sandwich short of a picnic, but just mad when they got the ball in their hands. I made 100 in the Test there and half of it was spent playing hook shots, and the other half, because Heine would keep on running down the pitch \u2013 we are wondering and worrying about bowlers and fielders rushing at the umpire these days \u2013 he was rushing at the batsmen after he had delivered the ball. I found very quickly that the thing to do was to turn your back on him, so that he\u2019s coming at you there. You turn your back, and in the end we were circling around \u2013 unfortunately there was no television \u2013 and doing a pas de deux out in the centre every ball he bowled.\n\nNone of those things are recorded, and I mention them just to underline the fact that anything you might think of to do with modern-day cricket that is a bit over the top has all happened before, but it\u2019s never been recorded, and I think more\u2019s the pity.\n\nOne thing you definitely need is a good sense of humour. Colin was always self-deprecating with his humour and wonderfully understated. You could just feel, in that interview he did with Mark Nicholas, his humour and his love of the game coming through. In 1974-75 they called him to go to Australia, 20 years after he was first there with Len Hutton\u2019s side, and he was aged 42. I was in England covering the Pakistan and India tour in 1974 and everyone wanted to know what was going to happen. Ray Illingworth had been captain in 1972, the series had been drawn, the Australians had Lillee, and unfortunately he was having fitness problems. Everyone wanted to know \u2013 in the media box, walking along the street \u2013 \u201cHow\u2019s Lillee?\u201d Unfortunately, he was in a plaster cast from his hip to his shoulder, because his back had gone in the West Indies tour, and everyone reckoned he had no chance of playing again. When they weren\u2019t asking about Lillee, they were asking about the surfy Jeff Thomson, who used to appear at the Bankstown Oval, sometimes to bowl the first over, sometimes with his surfboard and a blonde on an arm, and he was said to be a bit quickish but a bit wild. I could tell them a bit about that, because I saw him play his first rep match for New South Wales Colts against Queensland Colts. Then I saw him play his first Test against Pakistan and he got none for 113. When I said, \u201cHe\u2019s a pretty good bowler and he\u2019s pretty quick,\u201d everyone said, \u201cThat\u2019s typical Aussie bluster.\u201d He was quick. My brother played against him. My brother played for Australia. He was quite a good player, and Tommo bowled him a bouncer at Bankstown Oval and the ball bounced and smashed into the sightscreen on the first bounce. So he was quick, even if they were very short boundaries on Steve Waugh\u2019s home ground 30 years ago. Everyone thought I was having them on, but when three batsmen were injured in that first Test Match up in Brisbane at the Gabba, on a pitch prepared by the Brisbane lord mayor, Clem Jones, the SOS went out for Colin. In the meantime David Lloyd, the Lancashire opening batsmen, who was doing service on that tour, had announced at an MCC team meeting that he didn\u2019t think Thomson was all that quick and that he could play him with his appendage, which he proceeded to do.\nThere was no great amount of conversation out in the centre when Colin got out there, and Jeffrey Robert was steaming in from the Causeway end with the Fremantle doctor gusting behind him, and he did a Bankstown. He bowled a bouncer and the ball smashed into the sightscreen. As he came back, as fast bowlers will do \u2013 not all of them are thorough gentlemen \u2013 Colin was the non-striker, and Jeffrey Robert gave him very severe eye contact \u2013 like that, and Colin looked back and said, \u201cGood morning, my name\u2019s Cowdrey.\u201d I think that\u2019s class, and it shows a good sense of humour as well.\n\nA question: are we being overtaken by technology? That is not in the Preamble and it\u2019s not in the Spirit of Cricket, but it is pertinent at the moment. I am an unashamed lover of technology. Anything that will be good for the viewer and good for the game are the two requirements: you can\u2019t necessarily have one without the other. But I was happy that Sunil Gavaskar\u2019s committee decided to hold a watching brief on more technology just a month or so ago, until it is firmly established that there are distinct benefits to be gained and that the technology is 100% correct. It is one of those things I see no need to rush, even if more than 20,000 no balls have been called in Test Matches since they brought in that front foot law 30 years ago.\n\nOne thing that does worry me now, though, is the question of umpires and the fact that we seem to be getting into a situation where you could have an umpire from any country who will never ever stand in a Test Match in his own country. He might, if he is on a very short list, stand in a limited overs international, but, as I read what they\u2019re doing, this guy will never ever have the honour and the pleasure of standing in a Test Match in his own country, and that is because of the push for what they laughingly call \u201cneutral umpires\u201d. I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s exactly what we want. It isn\u2019t anything to do with the Preamble or the Spirit of Cricket, but I think it\u2019s worth thinking about that it may not be, in the end, precisely what it was meant to be.\n\nThere is nothing in the Spirit of Cricket brochures, pamphlets and posters about walking or not walking, but in a sense it comes into it. I was always brought up by my father, who was a good cricketer and a good coach, that when an appeal was made and I was out in the centre batting, I was to do only one thing \u2013 look straight at the umpire and, whatever the umpire said, I was to obey. If he says \u201cGo\u201d and I\u2019ve nicked it on the pad, I go, and, \u201cUnder no circumstance ever let me see you infer that the umpire might have made a mistake.\u201d That was the way I was brought up in Australia. It wasn\u2019t the English way, where walking was commonplace. However, it was the way we were brought up.\n\nWhen I brought the side over in 1961 we had a meeting on the ship and we decided lots of things, one of which was that we would walk. This went against the grain for a number of people, but, OK, we\u2019d give it a go. We got down to Sussex and Ian Thomson got me in the first innings, caught round the corner for nought. When I went out when we were chasing a win in the second innings, Ronnie Bell, the left-arm spinner was on. I wasn\u2019t off the mark, so I\u2019m sitting on a pair, and he lands the ball on the footmarks and I went for a drive. Alan Oakman dived to his left and caught the ball, and there were shouts and yells. I\u2019d taken two paces towards the pavilion before I thought, \u201cI didn\u2019t hit that,\u201d and there was a momentary hesitation, and then I had to keep going. The pavilion\u2019s side on, as you know, at Hove, and the game was over in another 10-12 minutes. It finished up as a draw. When I was having a beer with Oaky at the bar, and one or two of the others as well, they all said, \u201cWhy did you do that? You didn\u2019t get anywhere near it.\u201d So I explained to them exactly why I\u2019d done it and they fell about laughing, but no one could explain to me why they\u2019d appealed, and it\u2019s always been one of the things in my mind about walking, that the appeal in a situation like that could pose problems, and I reckon that in these modern times where you have so much technology, it\u2019s going to remain a contentious business, even if it\u2019s not in the Preamble or the Spirit of Cricket.\n\nRight at the top of my list in the Spirit of Cricket is the situation revolving around No. 5, and that is appealing, rushing at the umpire, and the fielding side not paying any attention to the umpire if they\u2019ve asked for a catch behind or if something might be a bit contentious. They just rush to where all their players are and they\u2019re congratulating one another, and suddenly there is the realisation that the umpire hasn\u2019t said anything and they turn around and everyone in the world \u2013 millions \u2013 know that the probability is that the umpire\u2019s made a mistake, and I hope that that is one aspect of the Spirit of Cricket that is very forcibly brought home. That is the part that disturbs me most and the thing that I would like to see cut out of the modern game.\n\nOne of the great things about this modern era is that the game is being globalised. The ICC tournament in Canada is just about to conclude, with the Netherlands beating Namibia today in the most extraordinary game and the other matches to see who goes into the 2003 World Cup to be played out over the next 48 hours. I am connected with cricket in France in a very small way and although the French team didn\u2019t get into the finals of that Toronto tournament \u2013 they were knocked out earlier \u2013 yesterday their under-17 team won the European under-17 championships in Corfu. Things like that for the associate nations and affiliate nations do a great amount of good, and the ICC is to be congratulated for their efforts at globalisation and taking the game to every possible person.\n\nIn those 119 years I mentioned earlier there have been captains who have left a legacy, and a great legacy, and that\u2019s the way it should be. One thing of which you can be certain is that it is quite possible to have very, very hard and very, very fair games of cricket and the captains, as we know, are responsible for the actions of their players. You have people like Steve Waugh and Nasser Hussain in charge, and now Michael Atherton, and you have Jimmy Adams, who is the first recipient of the Spirit of Cricket Award. There are none better than those men, and Steve Waugh is captaining a wonderful Australian side at the moment.\n\nI suppose the fact that we need a preamble and a statement on the Spirit of Cricket is an indication that not everything in the game is exactly as it should be \u2013 or hasn\u2019t been for the last ten years or so. Many years ago that great playwright T.S. Eliot in \u201cThe Hollow Men\u201d penned five lines which for me illustrate what\u2019s been happening in cricket over the past ten years \u2013 lots of great things \u2013 but he said:\n\n\u201cBetween the idea\nand the reality\nbetween the motion\nand the act\nfalls the Shadow.\u201d\n\nThe idea and the reality \u2013 they\u2019re the Spirit of Cricket \u2013 were brought to fruition by people like A.R. Lewis and Ted Dexter, the latter working very closely with Colin Cowdrey. Between that motion and the act, though, has fallen the shadow where things have happened that have not been good. Fortunately, tonight is a reminder that older people and older players have the opportunity to applaud all the good things done by the modern-day players \u2013 their ability to play outstanding attacking cricket, their flair and inspiration and innovation; and it\u2019s a reminder also, in a quiet way, to the modern-day players that good things have happened before, that in every era there have always been cricketers who have served the game well and have loved it, and have wanted to see it flourish.\nMCC has given all of us cause to stop for a moment and the opportunity to consider the Spirit of Cricket and to reflect that this remains a marvellous game and that it is far too good a game to be under any sort of threat.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 195, "api_path": "/songs/101376", "artist_names": "James Joyce", "full_title": "Ulysses (Chap. 11 - Sirens) by\u00a0James\u00a0Joyce", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "id": 101376, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 159066, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1654248578, "path": "/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-11-sirens-annotated", "pyongs_count": 4, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-11-sirens-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1922, "month": 2, "day": 2}, "release_date_for_display": "February 2, 1922", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 2, 1922", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 59, "hot": false, "pageviews": 18757}, "title": "Ulysses (Chap. 11 - Sirens)", "title_with_featured": "Ulysses (Chap. 11 - Sirens)", "updated_by_human_at": 1654248579, "url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-11-sirens-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/22971", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/98f10611fc0aa6a525b9fbcab2ffa297.1000x600x1.jpg", "id": 22971, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9997f2e769ef85b9f941405cac99d1af.570x570x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "James Joyce", "slug": "James-joyce", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-joyce"}, "artist": "James Joyce", "lyrics": "Ulysses (Chap. 11 - Sirens) LyricsBronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyringing Imperthnthn thnthnthn.\nChips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips.\n\nHorrid!

Where? gold asked more eagerly.\n\n\u2014In the second carriage, miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the sun.\n\nHe's looking. Mind till I see.\n\nShe darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.\n\nHer wet lips tittered:\n\n\u2014He's killed looking back.\n\nShe laughed:\n\n\u2014O wept! Aren't men frightful idiots?\n\nWith sadness.\n\nMiss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.\n\nSadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.\n\n\u2014It's them has the fine times, sadly then she said.\n\nA man.\nBloowho went by by Moulang's pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine's antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll's dusky battered plate, for Raoul.\nThe boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And\n\n\u2014There's your teas, he said.\n\nMiss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.\n\n\u2014What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.\n\n\u2014Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.\n\n\u2014Your beau, is it?\n\nA haughty bronze replied:\n\n\u2014I'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.\n\n\u2014Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she threatened as he had come.\n\nBloom.\n\nOn her flower frowning miss Douce said:\n\n\u2014Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn't conduct himself I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.\n\nLadylike in exquisite contrast.\n\n\u2014Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.\n\nShe poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.\nYes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.\n\n\u2014Am I awfully sunburnt?\n\nMiss bronze unbloused her neck.\n\n\u2014No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?\n\nMiss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.\n\n\u2014And leave it to my hands, she said.\n\n\u2014Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.\n\nBidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce\n\n\u2014Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that old fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin.\n\nMiss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:\n\n\u2014O, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake!\n\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.\n\nSweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.\n\n\u2014No, don't, she cried.\n\n\u2014I won't listen, she cried.\n\nBut Bloom?\n\nMiss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:\n\n\u2014For your what? says he.\n\nMiss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again:\n\n\u2014Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.\n\nShe sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.\n\n\u2014Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!\n\nShrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.\n\n\u2014O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?\n\nMiss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:\n\n\u2014And your other eye!\n\nBloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. Why do I always think Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lore's huguenot name. By Bassi's blessed virgins Bloom's dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus' son. He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.\n\nBy went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.\n\nOf sin.\n\nIn a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.\n\nAh, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.\n\nMiss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:\n\n\u2014O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried. With his bit of beard!\n\nDouce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.\n\n\u2014Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.\n\nShrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.\n\nMarried to Bloom, to greaseabloom.\n\n\u2014O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I wished\n\nI hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.\n\n\u2014O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!\n\nAnd flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.\n\nBy Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright of their oils. Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets of sin.\n\nFlushed less, still less, goldenly paled.\n\nInto their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.\n\n\u2014O, welcome back, miss Douce.\n\nHe held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?\n\n\u2014Tiptop.\n\nHe hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.\n\n\u2014Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand all day.\n\nBronze whiteness.\n\n\u2014That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.\n\nMiss Douce of satin douced her arm away.\n\n\u2014O go away! she said. You're very simple, I don't think.\n\nHe was.\n\n\u2014Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.\n\n\u2014You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?\n\n\u2014Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.\n\nJingle.\n\n\u2014With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.\n\nWith grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.\n\n\u2014By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes. Yes.\n\nYes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.\n\nNone nought said nothing. Yes.\n\nGaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:\n\n\u2014O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!\n\n\u2014Was Mr Lidwell in today?\n\nIn came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write. Buy paper. Daly's. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on the rye.\n\n\u2014He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.\n\nLenehan came forward.\n\n\u2014Was Mr Boylan looking for me?\n\nHe asked. She answered:\n\n\u2014Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?\n\nShe asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page:\n\n\u2014No. He was not.\n\nMiss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.\n\n\u2014Peep! Who's in the corner?\n\nNo glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her stops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.\n\nJingle jaunty jingle.\n\nGirlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:\n\n\u2014Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?\n\nHe droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.\n\nHe sighed aside:\n\n\u2014Ah me! O my!\n\nHe greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.\n\n\u2014Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.\n\n\u2014Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\nLenehan opened most genial arms. Who?\n\n\u2014Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.\n\nDry.\n\nMr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.\n\n\u2014I see, he said. I didn't recognise him for the moment. I hear he is keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?\n\nHe had.\n\n\u2014I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In Mooney's en ville and in Mooney's sur mer. He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.\n\nHe smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:\n\n\u2014The \u00e9lite of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh\n\nMacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O'Madden Burke.\n\nAfter an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and\n\n\u2014That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.\n\nHe see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his glass.\n\nHe looked towards the saloon door.\n\n\u2014I see you have moved the piano.\n\n\u2014The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.\n\n\u2014Is that a fact?\n\n\u2014Didn't he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too, poor fellow. Not twenty I'm sure he was.\n\n\u2014Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.\n\nHe drank and strayed away.\n\n\u2014So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.\n\nGod's curse on bitch's bastard.\n\nTink to her pity cried a diner's bell. To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.\n\nWith patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.\n\nUpholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.\n\nTwo sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. Are you not happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is. Respectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.\n\nJingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay. Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.\n\n\u2014Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.\n\n\u2014Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...\n\n\u2014And four.\n\nAt four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go. Ternoon. Think you're the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.\n\nFor men.\n\nIn drowsy silence gold bent on her page.\n\nFrom the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.\n\nPat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss\n\nDouce.\n\n\u2014The bright stars fade...\n\nA voiceless song sang from within, singing:\n\n\u2014... the morn is breaking.\n\nA duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's leavetaking, life's, love's morn.\n\n\u2014The dewdrops pearl...\n\nLenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.\n\n\u2014But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.\n\nJingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.\n\nShe rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.\n\n\u2014Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.\n\nShe answered, slighting:\n\n\u2014Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies.\n\nLike lady, ladylike.\n\nBlazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode. Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him:\n\n\u2014See the conquering hero comes.\n\nBetween the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.\n\n\u2014And I from thee...\n\n\u2014I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.\n\nHe touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.\n\nSmart Boylan bespoke potions.\n\n\u2014What's your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me. Wire in yet?\n\nNot yet. At four she. Who said four?\n\nCowley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's office.\n\nAvoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.\n\nWait.\n\nHello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What, Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there. See, not be seen. I think I'll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.\n\nMiss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.\n\n\u2014O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!\nBut easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.\n\n\u2014Why don't you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.\n\nShebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice:\n\n\u2014Fine goods in small parcels.\n\nThat is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.\n\n\u2014Here's fortune, Blazes said.\n\nHe pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.\n\n\u2014Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...\n\n\u2014Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.\n\n\u2014Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.\n\n\u2014I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you know. Fancy of a friend of mine.\n\nLenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.\n\nIdolores. The eastern seas.\n\nClock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.\n\nMiss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For me.\n\n\u2014What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?\n\nO'clock.\n\nLenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan's elbowsleeve.\n\n\u2014Let's hear the time, he said.\n\nThe bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come: whet appetite. I couldn't do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.\n\nSparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes.\n\n\u2014Go on, pressed Lenehan. There's no-one. He never heard.\n\n\u2014... to Flora's lips did hie.\n\nHigh, a high note pealed in the treble clear.\n\nBronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought\n\nBlazes Boylan's flower and eyes.\n\n\u2014Please, please.\n\nHe pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.\n\n\u2014I could not leave thee...\n\n\u2014Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.\n\n\u2014No, now, urged Lenehan. Sonnezlacloche! O do! There's no-one.\n\nShe looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend.\n\nQuavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.\n\n\u2014Go on! Do! Sonnez!\n\nBending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.\n\n\u2014Sonnez!\n\nSmack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh.\n\n\u2014La Cloche! cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.\n\nShe smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.\n\n\u2014You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.\n\nBoylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.\n\nYes, bronze from anearby.\n\n\u2014... Sweetheart, goodbye!\n\n\u2014I'm off, said Boylan with impatience.\n\nHe slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.\n\n\u2014Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.\n\nTom Rochford...\n\n\u2014Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.\n\nLenehan gulped to go.\n\n\u2014Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I'm coming.\n\nHe followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.\n\n\u2014How do you do, Mr Dollard?\n\n\u2014Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob. Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot's ear this time.\n\nSighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.\n\n\u2014Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a ditty. We heard the piano.\n\nBald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie. And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.\n\n\u2014What's that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.\n\n\u2014Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.\n\nHe ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.\n\nBald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.\n\nJingle a tinkle jaunted.\n\nBloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle. Hear.\n\n\u2014Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.\n\nMiss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de Nil.\n\n\u2014Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.\n\nThere was.\n\n\u2014A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn't stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.\n\n\u2014God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.\n\nThey laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding garment.\n\n\u2014Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where's my pipe, by the way?\n\nHe wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.\n\n\u2014I saved the situation, Ben, I think.\n\n\u2014You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. That was a brilliant idea, Bob.\n\nFather Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.\n\n\u2014I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh's gave us the number. Remember? Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.\n\n\u2014By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.\n\nMr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.\n\n\u2014Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose. What?\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.\n\nJingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.\n\nLiver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.\n\nMrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.\n\n\u2014What's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...\n\n\u2014Tweedy.\n\n\u2014Yes. Is she alive?\n\n\u2014And kicking.\n\n\u2014She was a daughter of...\n\n\u2014Daughter of the regiment.\n\n\u2014Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.\n\nMr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after\n\n\u2014Irish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?\n\nPuff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.\n\n\u2014Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My Irish Molly, O.\n\nHe puffed a pungent plumy blast.\n\n\u2014From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.\n\nThey pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.\n\nPat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.\n\nBloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.\n\nBy Bachelor's walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.\n\nOver their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords:\n\n\u2014When love absorbs my ardent soul...\n\nRoll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.\n\n\u2014War! War! cried Father Cowley. You're the warrior.\n\n\u2014So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or money.\n\nHe stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.\n\n\u2014Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.\n\nIn bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.\n\n\u2014Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben. Amoroso ma non troppo. Let me there.\n\nMiss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn't say. But it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread Independent, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.\n\n\u2014............ my ardent soul\nI care not foror the morrow.\n\nIn liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is. Ben Dollard's famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above, I'm drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course that's what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who's playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical. Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.\n\nMiss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady's) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old dingdong again.\n\n\u2014Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.\n\nGeorge Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.\n\nBloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables, flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best value in Dub.\n\nPiano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore. Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor's legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.\n\nJiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.\n\nOnly the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a lovely. Gravy's rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their harps. I. He. Old. Young.\n\n\u2014Ah, I couldn't, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.\n\nStrongly.\n\n\u2014Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.\n\n\u2014M'appari, Simon, Father Cowley said.\n\nDown stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: A Last Farewell. A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.\n\nCowley sang:\n\n\u2014M'appari tutt'amor:\nIl mio sguardo l'incontr...\n\nShe waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return.\n\n\u2014Go on, Simon.\n\n\u2014Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...\n\nMr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.\n\n\u2014No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.\n\nThe keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.\n\nUp stage strode Father Cowley.\n\n\u2014Here, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.\n\nBy Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingly jogged. Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.\n\nMost beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: Sonnambula. He heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way. Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like. Never forget it. Never.\n\nTenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile. Sings too: Down among the dead men. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he's wanted not a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.\n\nNever would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.\n\nSpeech paused on Richie's lips.\n\nComing out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.\n\nBelieves his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.\n\n\u2014Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.\n\n\u2014All is lost now.\n\nRichie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he's proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.\n\nBloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase. Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence in the moon. Brave. Don't know their danger. Still hold her back. Call name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That's why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.\n\n\u2014A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.\n\nNever in all his life had Richie Goulding.\n\nHe knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?\n\nBloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir. Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.\n\nPiano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again.\n\nDollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.\n\n\u2014With it, Simon.\n\n\u2014It, Simon.\n\n\u2014Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.\n\n\u2014It, Simon.\n\n\u2014I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.\n\nBy the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady's grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous eau de Nil Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.\n\nThe harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.\n\n\u2014When first I saw that form endearing...\n\nRichie turned.\n\n\u2014Si Dedalus' voice, he said.\n\nBraintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.\n\n\u2014Sorrow from me seemed to depart.\n\nThrough the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn't expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.\n\nLove that is singing: love's old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet. Love's old sweet sonnez la gold. Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.\n\n\u2014Full of hope and all delighted...\n\nTenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He can't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him. What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last look at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits, in her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.\n\nAlas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.\n\n\u2014But alas, 'twas idle dreaming...\n\nGlorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he doesn't break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing too. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.\n\nTenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That's the chat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.\n\nWords? Music? No: it's what's behind.\n\nBloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.\n\nBloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o'er sluices pouring gushes. Flood, gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.\n\n\u2014... ray of hope is...\n\nBeaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse unsqueaked a ray of hopk.\n\nMartha it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel's song. Lovely name you have. Can't write. Accept my little pres. Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too. She's a. I called you naughty boy. Still the name: Martha. How strange! Today.\n\nThe voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom's heart.\n\nWish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in Drago's always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still hear it better here than in the bar though farther.\n\n\u2014Each graceful look...\n\nFirst night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow, black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her. Fate.\n\nRound and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down she sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.\n\n\u2014Charmed my eye...\n\nSinging. Waiting she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy eyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in shadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.\n\n\u2014Martha! Ah, Martha!\n\nQuitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For only her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where. Somewhere.\n\n\u2014Co-ome, thou lost one!\nCo-ome, thou dear one!\n\nAlone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!\n\n\u2014Come!\n\nIt soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don't spin it out too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness...\n\n\u2014To me!\n\nSiopold!\n\nConsumed.\n\nCome. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to her, you too, me, us.\n\n\u2014Bravo! Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore! Clapclipclap clap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap, said, cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank and bronze miss Douce and gold MJiss Mina.\n\nBlazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before. Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson, reverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now. Atrot, in heat, heatseated. Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la. Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.\n\nAn afterclang of Cowley's chords closed, died on the air made richer.\n\nAnd Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank, Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving, coral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.\n\n\u2014Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you'd sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.\n\nLionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired, admired. But Bloom sang dumb.\n\nAdmiring.\n\nRichie, admiring, descanted on that man's glorious voice. He remembered one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang 'Twas rank and fame: in Ned Lambert's 'twas. Good God he never heard in all his life a note like that he never did then false one we had better part so clear so God he never heard since love lives not a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.\n\nGoulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the night, Si in Ned Lambert's, Dedalus house, sang 'Twas rank and fame.\n\nHe, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing 'TWAS RANK AND FAME in his, Ned Lambert's, house.\n\nBrothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more. The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful, more than all others.\n\nThat voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It's in the silence after you feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.\n\nBloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While Goulding talked of Barraclough's voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.\n\nThou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on. Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat. Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat's tail wriggling! Five bob I gave. Corpus paradisum. Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Gone. They sing. Forgotten. I too; And one day she with. Leave her: get tired. Suffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:'d.\n\nYet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy in your? Twang. It snapped.\n\nJingle into Dorset street.\n\nMiss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.\n\n\u2014Don't make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.\n\nGeorge Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.\n\nFirst gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And second tankard told her so. That that was so.\n\nMiss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first: gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell: the tank.\n\nBetter write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.\n\nBald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is. Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who is this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper, envelope: unconcerned. It's so characteristic.\n\n\u2014Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.\n\n\u2014It is, Bloom said.\n\nNumbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus two plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling. Always find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn't see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And you think you're listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like: Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite flat. It's on account of the sounds it is.\n\nInstance he's playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till you hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then hear chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over barrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune. Question of mood you're in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to invent dummy pianos for that. Blumenlied I bought for her. The name. Playing it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the stables near Cecilia street. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I mean.\n\nBald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite flat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.\n\nIt was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a boy in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles. Queenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in the moonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God, such music, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.\n\nSour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.\n\nDown the edge of his Freeman baton ranged Bloom's, your other eye, scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick. Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...\n\nHope he's not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his Freeman. Can't see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear sir. Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I put? Some pock or oth. It is utterl imposs. Underline imposs. To write today.\n\nBore this. Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting fingers on flat pad Pat brought.\n\nOn. Know what I mean. No, change that ee. Accep my poor litt pres enclos. Ask her no answ. Hold on. Five Dig. Two about here. Penny the gulls. Elijah is com. Seven Davy Byrne's. Is eight about. Say half a crown. My poor little pres: p. o. two and six. Write me a long. Do you despise? Jingle, have you the? So excited. Why do you call me naught? You naughty too? O, Mairy lost the string of her. Bye for today. Yes, yes, will tell you. Want to. To keep it up. Call me that other. Other world she wrote. My patience are exhaust. To keep it up. You must believe. Believe. The tank. It. Is. True.\n\nFolly am I writing? Husbands don't. That's marriage does, their wives. Because I'm away from. Suppose. But how? She must. Keep young. If she found out. Card in my high grade ha. No, not tell all. Useless pain. If they don't see. Woman. Sauce for the gander.\n\nA hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great Brunswick street, hatter. Eh? This is the jingle that joggled and jingled. By Dlugacz' porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a gallantbuttocked mare.\n\n\u2014Answering an ad? keen Richie's eyes asked Bloom.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said. Town traveller. Nothing doing, I expect.\n\nBloom mur: best references. But Henry wrote: it will excite me. You know how. In haste. Henry. Greek ee. Better add postscript. What is he playing now? Improvising. Intermezzo. P. S. The rum tum tum. How will you pun? You punish me? Crooked skirt swinging, whack by. Tell me I want to. Know. O. Course if I didn't I wouldn't ask. La la la ree. Trails off there sad in minor. Why minor sad? Sign H. They like sad tail at end. P. P. S. La la la ree. I feel so sad today. La ree. So lonely. Dee.\n\nHe blotted quick on pad of Pat. Envel. Address. Just copy out of paper. Murmured: Messrs Callan, Coleman and Co, limited. Henry wrote:\n\nMiss Martha Clifford c/o P. O. Dolphin's Barn Lane Dublin\n\nBlot over the other so he can't read. There. Right. Idea prize titbit. Something detective read off blottingpad. Payment at the rate of guinea per col. Matcham often thinks the laughing witch. Poor Mrs Purefoy. U. P: up.\n\nToo poetical that about the sad. Music did that. Music hath charms. Shakespeare said. Quotations every day in the year. To be or not to be. Wisdom while you wait.\n\nIn Gerard's rosery of Fetter lane he walks, greyedauburn. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.\n\nDone anyhow. Postal order, stamp. Postoffice lower down. Walk now. Enough. Barney Kiernan's I promised to meet them. Dislike that job.\n\nHouse of mourning. Walk. Pat! Doesn't hear. Deaf beetle he is.\n\nCar near there now. Talk. Talk. Pat! Doesn't. Settling those napkins. Lot of ground he must cover in the day. Paint face behind on him then he'd be two. Wish they'd sing more. Keep my mind off.\n\nBald Pat who is bothered mitred the napkins. Pat is a waiter hard of his hearing. Pat is a waiter who waits while you wait. Hee hee hee hee. He waits while you wait. Hee hee. A waiter is he. Hee hee hee hee. He waits while you wait. While you wait if you wait he will wait while you wait. Hee hee hee hee. Hoh. Wait while you wait.\n\nDouce now. Douce Lydia. Bronze and rose.\n\nShe had a gorgeous, simply gorgeous, time. And look at the lovely shell she brought.\n\nTo the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.\n\n\u2014Listen! she bade him.\n\nUnder Tom Kernan's ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow. Authentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. Well, sir, the husband took him by the throat. Scoundrel, said he, You'll sing no more lovesongs. He did, faith, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom. Cowley lay back.\n\nAh, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard.\n\nWonderful. She held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale gold in contrast glided. To hear.\n\nTap.\n\nBloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.\n\nBronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.\n\nHer ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside. Lovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream first make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn't forget. Fever near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell with seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks the mouth, why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A cave. No admittance except on business.\n\nThe sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood it is. Souse in the ear sometimes. Well, it's a sea. Corpuscle islands.\n\nWonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur, hearing: then laid it by, gently.\n\n\u2014What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.\n\nCharming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.\n\nTap.\n\nBy Larry O'Rourke's, by Larry, bold Larry O', Boylan swayed and Boylan turned.\n\nFrom the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting. No, she was not so lonely archly miss Douce's head let Mr Lidwell know. Walks in the moonlight by the sea. No, not alone. With whom? She nobly answered: with a gentleman friend.\n\nBob Cowley's twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord has the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a light bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling, and for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one, one: two, one, three, four.\n\nSea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket, cocks, hens don't crow, snakes hissss. There's music everywhere. Ruttledge's door: ee creaking. No, that's noise. Minuet of Don Giovanni he's playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle chambers dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating dockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look at us.\n\nThat's joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other joy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows you are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt. Then know.\n\nM'Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing cat. Like tearing silk. Tongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows. They can't manage men's intervals. Gap in their voices too. Fill me. I'm warm, dark, open. Molly in quis est homo: Mercadante. My ear against the wall to hear. Want a woman who can deliver the goods.\n\nJog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue clocks came light to earth.\n\nO, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that. It is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is. Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt's, Hungarian, gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle. Hissss. Now. Maybe now. Before.\n\nOne rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de Kock with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock. Cockcock.\n\nTap.\n\n\u2014Qui sdegno, Ben, said Father Cowley.\n\n\u2014No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered. The Croppy Boy. Our native Doric.\n\n\u2014Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Good men and true.\n\n\u2014Do, do, they begged in one.\n\nI'll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He came, he came, he did not stay. To me. How much?\n\n\u2014What key? Six sharps?\n\n\u2014F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.\n\nBob Cowley's outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.\n\nMust go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must. Got money somewhere. He's on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He seehears lipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him twopence tip. Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting Patty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they wait.\n\nBut wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the dark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.\n\nThe voice of dark age, of unlove, earth's fatigue made grave approach and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men and true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.\n\nTap.\n\nBen Dollard's voice. Base barreltone. Doing his level best to say it. Croak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big ships' chandler's business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships' lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh home. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.\n\nThe priest's at home. A false priest's servant bade him welcome. Step in. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curlycues of chords.\n\nRuin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their days in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.\n\nThe voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.\n\nDecent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he'll win in Answers, poets' picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting hatching in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See blank tee what domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Good voice he has still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.\n\nListen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened. The chords harped slower.\n\nThe voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous. Ben's contrite beard confessed. in nomine Domini, in God's name he knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: mea culpa.\n\nLatin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion corpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey, corpusnomine. Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.\n\nTap.\n\nThey listened. Tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.\n\nThe sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed three times. You bitch's bast. And once at masstime he had gone to play. Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother's rest he had not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.\n\nBronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn't half know I'm. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.\n\nBronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face? They always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.\n\nCockcarracarra.\n\nWhat do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too. Custom his country perhaps. That's music too. Not as bad as it sounds. Tootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses helpless, gashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile music hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin's name.\n\nShe looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show. Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question. Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa's. Hypnotised, listening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle staring down into her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you must hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the tune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!\n\nAll gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his brothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last of his name and race.\n\nI too. Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?\n\nHe bore no hate.\n\nHate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old. Big Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush struggling in his pale, to Bloom soon old. But when was young?\n\nIreland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Who fears to speak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.\n\n\u2014Bless me, father, Dollard the croppy cried. Bless me and let me go.\n\nTap.\n\nBloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week. Fellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those girls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl's romance. Letters read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy's owny Mumpsypum. Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name you.\n\nLow sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest rustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.\n\nTap. Tap.\n\nThrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.\n\nBlank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it: page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young. Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman, a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes, all women. Goddess I didn't see. They want it. Not too much polite. That's why he gets them. Gold in your pocket, brass in your face. Say something. Make her hear. With look to look. Songs without words. Molly, that hurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish. Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.\n\nVentriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?\n\nWill? You? I. Want. You. To.\n\nWith hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch's bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour's your time to live, your last.\n\nTap. Tap.\n\nThrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want to, dying to, die. For all things dying, for all things born. Poor Mrs Purefoy. Hope she's over. Because their wombs.\n\nA liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom's wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.\n\nBut look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha. Lidwell. For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.\n\nOn the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.\n\nWith a cock with a carra.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\nI hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.\n\nThe chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be. Get out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where's my hat. Pass by her. Can leave that Freeman. Letter I have. Suppose she were the? No. Walk, walk, walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice Tisntdall Farrell. Waaaaaaalk.\n\nWell, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O'er ryehigh blue. Ow. Bloom stood up. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have sweated: music. That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card inside. Yes.\n\nBy deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed.\n\nAt Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid. Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous prayer.\n\nBy rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\nPray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.\n\nScaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill to wash it down. Glad I avoided.\n\n\u2014Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus cried. By God, you're as good as ever you were.\n\n\u2014Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad, upon my soul and honour It is.\n\n\u2014Lablache, said Father Cowley.\n\nBen Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering castagnettes in the air.\n\nBig Benaben Dollard. Big Benben. Big Benben.\n\nRrr.\n\nAnd deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all laughing they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer.\n\n\u2014You're looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.\n\nMiss Douce composed her rose to wait.\n\n\u2014Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben's fat back shoulderblade. Fit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his person.\n\nRrrrrrrsss.\n\n\u2014Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.\n\nRichie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward. Uncertainly he waited. Unpaid Pat too.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\nMiss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.\n\n\u2014Mr Dollard, they murmured low.\n\n\u2014Dollard, murmured tankard.\n\nTank one believed: miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the tank.\n\nHe murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that is to say. That was to say he had heard the name of. Dollard, was it? Dollard, yes.\n\nYes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely, murmured Mina. Mr Dollard. And The last rose of summer was a lovely song. Mina loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.\n\n'Tis the last rose of summer dollard left bloom felt wind wound round inside.\n\nGassy thing that cider: binding too. Wait. Postoffice near Reuben J's one and eightpence too. Get shut of it. Dodge round by Greek street. Wish I hadn't promised to meet. Freer in air. Music. Gets on your nerves. Beerpull. Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the. Ben Howth. That rules the world.\n\nFar. Far. Far. Far.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\nUp the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady, with sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy on.\n\nTap blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap by tap.\n\nCowley, he stuns himself with it: kind of drunkenness. Better give way only half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty. You daren't budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop. Fiddlefaddle about notes.\n\nAll a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you never know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year. Queer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys. Seated all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself or the other fellow blowing the bellows. Growl angry, then shriek cursing (want to have wadding or something in his no don't she cried), then all of a soft sudden wee little wee little pipy wind.\n\nPwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom's little wee.\n\n\u2014Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning with fetched pipe. I was with him this morning at poor little Paddy Dignam's...\n\n\u2014Ay, the Lord have mercy on him.\n\n\u2014By the bye there's a tuningfork in there on the...\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\n\u2014The wife has a fine voice. Or had. What? Lidwell asked.\n\n\u2014O, that must be the tuner, Lydia said to Simonlionel first I saw, forgot it when he was here.\n\nBlind he was she told George Lidwell second I saw. And played so exquisitely, treat to hear. Exquisite contrast: bronzelid, minagold.\n\n\u2014Shout! Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Sing out!\n\n\u2014'lldo! cried Father Cowley.\n\nRrrrrr.\n\nI feel I want...\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap\n\n\u2014Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at a headless sardine.\n\nUnder the sandwichbell lay on a bier of bread one last, one lonely, last sardine of summer. Bloom alone.\n\n\u2014Very, he stared. The lower register, for choice.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\nBloom went by Barry's. Wish I could. Wait. That wonderworker if I had. Twentyfour solicitors in that one house. Counted them. Litigation. Love one another. Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of attorney. Goulding, Collis, Ward.\n\nBut for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation: Mickey Rooney's band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home after pig's cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing his band part. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses' skins. Welt them through life, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be what you call yashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.\n\nTap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by Daly's window where a mermaid hair all streaming (but he couldn't see) blew whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn't), mermaid, coolest whiff of all.\n\nInstruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. Even comb and tissuepaper you can knock a tune out of. Molly in her shift in Lombard street west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade made its own, don't you see? Hunter with a horn. Haw. Have you the? Cloche. Sonnez la. Shepherd his pipe. Pwee little wee. Policeman a whistle. Locks and keys! Sweep! Four o'clock's all's well! Sleep! All is lost now. Drum? Pompedy. Wait. I know. Towncrier, bumbailiff. Long John. Waken the dead. Pom. Dignam. Poor little nominedomine. Pom. It is music. I mean of course it's all pom pom pom very much what they call da capo. Still you can hear. As we march, we march along, march along. Pom.\n\nI must really. Fff. Now if I did that at a banquet.

Wonder who was that chap at the grave in the brown macin. O, the whore of the lane!\n\nA frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the day along the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing? Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane. Horn. Who had the? Heehaw shesaw. Off her beat here. What is she? Hope she. Psst! Any chance of your wash. Knew Molly. Had me decked. Stout lady does be with you in the brown costume. Put you off your stroke, that. Appointment we made knowing we'd never, well hardly ever. Too dear too near to home sweet home. Sees me, does she? Looks a fright in the day. Face like dip. Damn her. O, well, she has to live like the rest. Look in here.\n\nIn Lionel Marks's antique saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold dear Henry Flower earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged battered candlesticks melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags. Bargain: six bob. Might learn to play. Cheap. Let her pass. Course everything is dear if you don't want it. That's what good salesman is. Make you buy what he wants to sell. Chap sold me the Swedish razor he shaved me with. Wanted to charge me for the edge he gave it. She's passing now. Six bob.\n\nMust be the cider or perhaps the burgund.\n\nNear bronze from anear near gold from afar they chinked their clinking glasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia's tempting last rose of summer, rose of Castile. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, a fifth: Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and big Ben Dollard.\nTap. A youth entered a lonely Ormond hall.\n\nBloom viewed a gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks's window. Robert Emmet's last words. Seven last words. Of Meyerbeer that is.\n\n\u2014True men like you men.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, Ben.\n\n\u2014Will lift your glass with us.\n\nThey lifted.\n\nTschink. Tschunk.\n\nTip. An unseeing stripling stood in the door. He saw not bronze. He saw not gold. Nor Ben nor Bob nor Tom nor Si nor George nor tanks nor Richie nor Pat. Hee hee hee hee. He did not see.\n\nSeabloom, greaseabloom viewed last words. Softly. When my country takes her place among.\n\nPrrprr.\n\nMust be the bur.\n\nFff! Oo. Rrpr.\n\nNations of the earth. No-one behind.

Who's with me?\"\n(leans back)\nAnd then there are about fifty more\nposts from people who agree to join\nSpartacus-here's boycott of the flick.\n\nJAY\n(grimly)\nI'm gonna kill all these fucks--\n\nHOLDEN\nAh, let it go. Number one, they're a\nbunch of jealous little dicks who\nuse the anonymity of the Net to insult\npeople who're doing what they wish\nthey were doing, and number two,\nthey're not really talking about you\nguys--they talking about Bluntman\nand Chronic.\n\nJAY\nBut they said Jay and Silent Bob!\nThey used our real names. It doesn't\nmatter that there's a comic book\nversion of us and a real version,\n'cause nobody knows we're real in\nreal life.\n\nHOLDEN\nReally.\n\nJAY\nYeah! And all these people who read\nthat shit think the real Jay and\nSilent Bob are a couple of faggots\n'cause of that all these dicks are\nwriting about the comic book Jay and\nSilent Bob! And maybe one night, me\nand Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch,\nand she'll be like \"Oooo! I want to\nsuck youse guys dicks off. What's\nyour names?\"  And I'll be like, \"Jay\nand Silent Bob.\" And she'll be like,\n\"Oh--I read on the Internet that\nyouse guys were little fucking\njerkoffs.\"  And then she goes and\nsucks two other guys's dicks off\ninstead! Well fuck that!  We gotta\nput a stop to these hateful sonsa-\nbitches before they ruin our good\nnames!\n\nHOLDEN\nFirst off, I don't know how good\nyour names really are. Secondly,\nthere's not much you can do about\nstopping this bile. The Internet's\ngiven everyone in America a voice,\nand everyone in American has chosen\nto use that voice to bitch about\nmovies. As long as there's a Bluntman\nand Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are\ngonna have something negative to say\nabout it.  Jay steams, thinking.\nThen, a light dawns on him.\n\nJAY\nBut wait a second--if there wasn't a\nBluntman and Chronic movie, then no\none would be saying shit about Jay\nand Silent Bob, right?\n\nHOLDEN\nThey're not saying anything about\nyou now--they're talking about\nfictional characters!\n\nJAY\n(oblivious to Holden;\nto Bob)\nSo all we gotta do is stop 'em from\nmaking the movie!\n\nHOLDEN\nYeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of\nthousands of dollars in royalties\nyou're due in the process. Are you\nfucking retarded? Look, I'm probably\nnot alone in the opinion that this\nflick is the worst idea since Greedo\nshooting first. I mean, a Jay and\nSilent Bob movie? Who would pay to\nsee that?\n\nHolden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for\na beat. Then--\n\nHOLDEN\nBut since it is happening, you might\nas well just ignore the idiots on\nthe Internet, go find Banky, and get\nyour \"motherfucking movie check.\" As\nyou so succinctly put it. That's\nwhat's important here.\n\nJAY\nNo, Holden McNeil--what's important\nhere is that there's a bunch of\nmotherfuckers we don't even know\ncalling us assholes on the Internet\nto a bunch of teenagers and guys who\ncan't even get laid. Putting a stop\nto that is the most important thing\nwe could ever do.\n(off monitor)\nWhen did it say they're making that\nmovie?\n\nHOLDEN\nThey start this Friday.\n\nJAY\nSo if today's Tuesday, that gives us--\n(counts)\nEight days.\n\nHOLDEN\nIt's more like three days.\n\nJAY\nRight. Three days to stop that stupid\nfucking movie from getting made!\nC'mon, Silent Bob--\n\nJay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.\n\nJAY\nWe're going to Hollywood.\n\nThey stride off. Holden shakes his head.\n\nHOLDEN\nNow that's what I call the Blunt\nleading the Blunt.\n\nEXT. BUS STATION--DAY\n\nJay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled \"Los\nAngeles.\" They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After\na beat, they re-emerge.\n\nJAY\nTickets? Since when did they start\ncharging for the bus?\n\nThey head toward the depot.\n\nJAY\nDidn't we used to ride that shit to\nschool every day for free?\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY\n\nThe bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey.\n\nINT. BUS--SAME\n\nJay makes his way up to the DRIVER.\n\nJAY\nWe in Hollywood yet?\n\nDRIVER\nIt's a three--day ride to Los Angeles,\nsir. We left twenty minutes ago.\n\nJAY\nI didn't ask you about Los Angeles.\nI asked you about Hollywood.\n\nDRIVER\nHollywood's in Los Angeles, sir.\n\nJAY\nDon't change the subject! Are we in\nHollywood yet or not?\n\nDRIVER\nPlease sit down, sir.\n\nJay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat.\n\nJAY\nWhy don't you take your seat Ralph\nKramden--\n\nJay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nI'm fucking bored, man. There ain't\nshit to so on this bus.\n\nSilent Bob mimes jerking off.\n\nJAY\nI already did that. Twice.\n\nSilent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across\nthe aisle and spots a CHILD IN A HELMET playing a handheld\nvideo game. He leans over to him.\n\nJAY\nYo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn.\n\nCHILD\nLeave me alone, little kid.\n\nThe Child gives him the finger. Jay goes wide-eyed, turning\nto Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nThat fuck called me a little kid and\ngave me the finger! Go kick his ass!\n\nSilent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, \"He's\nten years old.\"\n\nJAY\nYou're my muscle, ain'tcha?\n\nSilent Bob kind of nods.\n\nJAY\nSo go open a can of whup-ass on that\nlittle fuck, and get me his game!\n\nSilent Bob sighs and stands. He climbs over Jay into the\naisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and\nregisters doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on.\n\nSilent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches\nfor his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts\npunching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his\nseat, trying to look nonchalant. The Child stops crying. Jay\nlooks at Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nYou're one tough motherfucker, you\nknow that?\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY\n\nThe bus pulls over by the side of the road.\n\nINT. BUS--DAY\n\nThe Bus Driver heads down the aisle toward the back of the\nbus, followed by pissed-off PASSENGERS.\n\nPASSENGER\nThey been in there going on half an\nhour now! Two of them! Doing God\nknows what!\n\nThe Bus Driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts.\n\nDRIVER\nThis bus isn't moving another inch\nunless you clear out of there right\nnow!\n\nNo answer. The Bus Driver bangs on the door harder.\n\nDRIVER\nDO YOU HEAR ME?! OPEN THIS DOOR!\nNOW!!\n\nThe door handle turns, the door swings wide, and massive\namounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the\nbus. The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed\ninto the bathroom, holding a massive joint.\n\nJAY\nUm--I think something's burning back\nhere.\n\nEXT. ROADSIDE--LATER\n\nAs the bus pulls away, Jay and Silent Bob are revealed, left\nbehind.\n\nJAY\nThe whole fucking world's against\nus, dude. I swear to God.\n\nSilent Bob nods. Jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching.\n\nEXT. ROADSIDE--LATER\n\nJay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still.\n\nJAY\nThis sucks balls, man. How come we\nain't getting no rides?\n\nVOICE\n'Cause you're doing it all wrong.\n\nJay and Bob look behind them. There's a GUY hitching as well.\n\nGUY\nYou gotta induce the drivers a little.\n\nJAY\nLike how?\n\nGUY\nLike this.\n\nThe GUY holds out his sign to them. It reads: Will Give Head\nFor Ride.\n\nJAY\nYeah, but what happens when you get\nin the car, and you don't make with\nthe head? Don't they kick your ass\nto the curb?\n\nGUY\nSure--if you don't make with the\nhead.\n\nJay and Bob look at him for a long beat. Then--\n\nJAY\nEww! You eat the cock?!?\n\nGUY\nYeah. If it'll get me a few hundred\nmiles across country. I'll take a\nshot in the mouth.\n\nJAY\nYeah, but we ain't gay.\n\nGUY\nWell, neither am I. But have you\nseen the price of bus tickets lately?\nShit--I don't wanna cough up two\nhundred bucks just to get to Chicago.\n\nJAY\nWell, I don't wanna cough up some\ndude's sperm!\n\nGUY\nDon't be so suburban--this is the\nnew millennium. Gay, straight--it's\nall the same now. There're no more\nlines.\n\nJay draws a line on the ground with his foot.\n\nJAY\nThere's one. On this side of it, we\nain't gay.\n\nGUY\nAll hitchers do this. Why do you\nthink people pick us up? If you get\na ride, it's expected--I don't care\nwho the driver is. It's the first\nrule in the Book.\n\nJAY\nWhat book?\n\nGUY\nThe unwritten Book of the Road.\n\nA TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy\npoints to it, as if to say \"See?\" The passenger-side door\nopens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He\nlooks out the window at Jay and Bob.\n\nGUY\nFollow the rules of the Book, and\nyou'll get where you're going in no\ntime.  Excuse me.\n\nThrough the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go\nface-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers\nsmiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road.\n\nJay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR\npulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window\nand leans toward them.\n\nNUN\nYou two boys need a ride?\n\nINT. CAR--LATER\n\nThe NUN drives, smiling. Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back\nseat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun.\n\nNUN\nYou both don't have to sit back there.\nOne of you can sit up here with me.\n\nSilent Bob shakes his head \"no\" to Jay. Jay shrugs and climbs\nup front.\n\nNUN\nSo where are you boys from?\n\nJAY\nNew Jersey.\n\nNUN\nWhat brings you to Indiana?\n\nJAY\nWe're going to Hollywood.\n\nNUN\nHollywood, hunh? That's a long ways\naway.\n\nJAY\nYeah--we're lucky you picked us up.\n\nNUN\nWell, do unto others. That's what\nthe Book says.\n\nJAY\n(misinterpreting\ncompletely)\nWait a minute--you follow the Book,\ntoo?\n\nNUN\nI live my life by it.\n\nJAY\nReally? You?\n\nNUN\nOf course. You know how lonely it\ngets on the road? Thanks to the Book,\nI'm never alone--if you know what I\nmean.\n\nJAY\nI guess. This guy back there explained\nit to us. But I didn't think you'd\nbe into that.\n\nNUN\nAre you kidding? I've dedicated my\nlife to it. Every hour of every day.\n\nJAY\nShit--you nuns are alright.\n\nNUN\nYou live by the Book, too?\n\nJAY\nYou picked us up, didn't you? I gotta.\n\nNUN\nThat's good to hear. But it takes\ndeed, not words. It's a lot easier\nto say you live by the Book than to\nactually do it.\n(looks at him)\nCan you do it?\n\nJAY\nYou want me to do it right now?\n\nNUN\nNo time like the present, right?\n\nJay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head\n\"no.\" Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and\nstarts to bend down.\n\nJAY\nAlright.\n(he suddenly stops)\nYou hear that? She's not a Catholic.\nShe's a Presbyterian.\n\nJay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed.\n\nEXT. ROADSIDE--DAY\n\nThe Nun's car screeched to the side of the road. Jay gets\nkicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun. Silent\nBob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his\nmouth. He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth.\n\nJAY\nDude--she had seventies bush.\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--NIGHT\n\nJay and Bob continue hitching.\n\nJAY\nI can't believe this shit. Five hours\nand not a single ride. Every day,\nmillions of people hitch to Hollywood\nand stop studios from making movies\nabout 'em. But when you and me try\nit, it's like we're trapped in a\nfucking cartoon!\n\nA familiar-looking VAN pulls up in the other side of the\nraid, The horn beeps.  Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug,\nand race across the street, get in. The van pulls off.\n\nINT. VAN--NIGHT\n\nJay and Bob sit in the back of the can and stare at--\n\nA clean-cut GUY, a Bookish woman in glasses, a red headed\nBeauty, a stoner DUDE, and a GREAT DANE.\n\nJay looks at Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nZoinks, yo\n\nGUY\nAnd now we can finally solve the\nmystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls!\nPull off their masks and let's see\nwho they really are!\n\nBOOKISH\nI don't think they are masks.\n\nBEAUTY\nI don't think they're Hitchhiking\nGirls either.\n\nBOOKISH\nGhouls, you fucking moron. Not Girls.\n(to herself)\nThough I wish they were hitchhiking\ngirls. Sexy, skimpily clad hitchhiking\ngirls--\n\nGUY\nLet's kick them out. We've got a\nmystery to solve.\n\nDUDE\nThe only mystery here is why we take\nour cues from a dick in a neckerchief!\n\nGUY\nKeep it up, Beatnik! I'll feed you\nto the fucking dog!\n\nBEAUTY\n(covering her ears;\nshrieking)\nI CAN'T TAKE ALL THIS FIGHTING!\n\nJAY\nYO!\n\nThe Gang look to Jay and Bob.\n\nJAY\nYouse guys need to turn those frowns\nupside down! And we got just the\nthing for that.\n(pulls out a bag of\njoints)\nWe call them Doobie Snax.\n\nINT. VAN--WEED VISION\n\nAs Jay and Bob toke up, we go all SLO-MO and 70's freaky\n(with the image seeming to SWIM). Through their stoned haze,\nwe see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling\nabout their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken\noff to reveal a man inside a costume.\n\nJay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint\nand look back.  Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total\ndebauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy\ncackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief. Bookish\nand Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other.\nThe Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says--\n\nGREAT DANE\nRi, Ray rand Rirent Rob\n\nThe Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking\nway out of its sheath. It's monstrous. Jay and Bob go wide-\neyed.\n\nJAY\nLook at his fuckin' lipstick!!! He's\ngot a stoner-boner!!!\n\nJay and Bob smile and pass out.\n\nWe cut back to the gang, who now appear as they did prior to\nWeed-Vision. They stare at the O.C. Jay and Bob.\n\nBEAUTY\nI think they passed out.\n\nGUY\nGreat. What do we do with them now?\n\nDUDE\nLet's cut out their kidneys to sell\non the black market and leave them\nin a seedy motel bathtub full of\nice.\n\nBOOKISH\nOh God, not again?\n\nINT. SEEDY MOTEL BATHROOM--NIGHT\n\nJay lies in a bathtub full of ice, screaming. There's a scar\non his back.\n\nEXT. KANSAS CITY PARK--DAY\n\nJay wakes up suddenly, screaming. He startles Bob awake as\nwell, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see\nthe scar. It's not there.\n\nJAY\nHoly shit, I had a horrible dream.\n(looks around)\nYo, I'm hungry. Where can we get\nsome breakfast?\n\nBob looks around, and then locks on something O.C. He points,\nand Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.\n\nEXT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--DAY\n\nAn ESTABLISHING SHOT of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob\nenter.\n\nINT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--SAME\n\nAs the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public\nINTERNET TERMINAL. He tugs at Silent Bob's arm.\n\nJAY\nYo--check that shit out: the Internet.\nLet's see if those fucks said\nsomething new about us and that stupid\nflick.\n\nBob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar\nand types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look\nat the screen and go wide-eyed.\n\nJAY\n\"Any movie based on Jay and Silent\nBob is gonna lick balls, because\nthey both, in fact, lick balls. Namely\neach other's.\"\n\nJay and Silent Bob look at each other, wide-eyed.\n\nJAY\nEww.\n(reading further)\n\"Yes--they are real people. Real\nstupid people. Signed, Darth Randal.\"\n(to Bob)\nMotherfucker! It's time we wrote\nsomething back! Type this shit down.\n\nSilent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates.\n\nJAY\nAll you motherfuckers are gonna pay.\nYou are the ones who are the ball-\nlickers.  We're gonna fuck your\nmothers whole you watch and cry like\nlittle bitches. Once we get to\nHollywood and find those Miramax\nfucks who are making the movie, we're\ngonna make 'em eat our shit, then\nshit our shit, then eat their shit\nwhich is made of our shit that we\nmade 'em eat. Then all you\nmotherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay\nand Silent Bob.\n\nSilent Bob finishes typing and presses \"Return\". He and Jay\nnod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking\nup at the menu board.\n\nJAY\nThat'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat\nour Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get\nback on the road, get to Hollywood,\nand stop that fucking movie from\ngetting made. No more hairy-bush\nnuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye\non the prize, and not let nothing--\nand I mean NOTHING--distract me.\n\nAs Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and\nfreezes.  A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all\nin SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in\nthe World. She's bathed in light, glowing.\n\nShe bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.\n\nJay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then\nat the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's\neyes, getting zero response.\n\nJAY'S POV\n\nThe Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to\nher breasts, then down to her crotch.\n\nJay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle\nof the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss\non her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager\nto get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous\nwith the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.\n\nBut it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to\nSilent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls\nhis eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it\nover Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She\nsmiles at the zombified Jay.\n\nGIRL\n(off cup)\nOh my God. Do you get free refills\nwith that?\n\nJAY\nOh, what--this? I just wear this for\nprotection. You know--so no guys try\nto grab my shit.\n\nGIRL\nHi. I'm Justice.\n\nJAY\n(dreamily)\nAnd I am so fucking yours--\n\nSilent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze.\n\nJAY\nI mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my\nhereto life-mate, Silent Bob.\n\nJUSTICE\nIt's nice to meet you.\n\nJAY\nJustice, hunh? That's a nice name.\n(under his breath, to\nBob)\nJay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F-\nU-C-K-I-N-G--\n(back to Justice)\nSo you come here often?\n\nJUSTICE\nOh, I'm not from around here. My\nfriends and I are taking a road trip,\nand we just stopped to grab something\nto eat.\n\nJAY\nYour friends, hunh? Where they at?\n\nJUSTICE\n(pointing)\nOut there. By that van.\n\nJay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other\ngorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair\naround, looking incredibly sexy.\n\nWithout looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him--\n\nJAY\nDude--I think I just filled the cup.\n\nINT. VAN--DAY\n\nJay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the\nother Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food\nto her friends.\n\nJAY\nLadies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent\nBob are in the Hizz-ouse!!!\n\nSISSY\nWho the fuck are these guys?\n\nJUSTICE\nThis is Jay and Silent Bob.\n(to Jay and Bob)\nGuys, this is Sissy, Missy, and\nChrissy.\n\nCHRISSY\nWhere the fuck did they come from?\n\nJUSTICE\nI met 'em inside. They're gonna hitch\na ride.\n\nSISSY\nI don't know if that's such a great\nidea. Jussy.\n\nJAY\nSure it is, Juggs.\n\nMISSY\nOh my god--he just called Sissy\n\"Juggs\"!\n\nCHRISSY\nI'm on it.\n\nChrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife.\n\nJUSTICE\nChrissy, no!\n\nSissy stops Chrissy, shoving a burger into her hands.\n\nSISSY\nWe're in the middle of suburbia,\nChrissy. Let's try to act like it.\n\nCHRISSY\n\n}\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nAnd what-stupid ass little foul-\nmouthed bitch-boys don't get their\nballs cut off in suburbia?\n\nJAY\n(oblivious)\nWhat's with the knife? We having\ncake or something?\n\nCHRISSY\nHoly shit--he's retarded, to boot.\n\nJAY\n(to Silent Bob)\nYo--she called you retarded.\n\nSISSY\n(to Justice)\nWhat's wrong with you, Justice? You\ndo remember where we're going, don't\nyou?\n\nMISSY\nThat we do have a job to do?\n\nJUSTICE\nThey're just gonna tag along for a\nfew miles. They won't get in the\nway, I promise.\n(cutesy)\nPlease?\n\nSISSY\nFine--they can ride with us. But\nthey're so out of here before we get\nto Boulder.\n\nJUSTICE\nHonest Injun.\n\nCHRISSY\n\"Honest Injun\"?\n(to Sissy)\nI can't believe what a pushover you\nare.\n\nJAY\nAnd I can't believe fine-ass bitches\nlike yourselves eat that shit. Don't\nyou know fast food makes girls fart?\n\nSuddenly, Jay and Bob are parted by BRENT, who's getting\ninto the van.\n\nBRENT\nSay--what's all this talk about\nfarting?\n\nSissy, Missy, and Chrissy immediately go from disgusted to\nsweet and airy, totally switching characters.\n\nSISSY/CHRISSY/MISSY\nHi Brent!\n\nSISSY\nThis is Brent. He's with us, too.\n\nCHRISSY\nBrent, tell these sillies that girls\ndon't fart.\n\nBRENT\nOf course they don't! Only skeevy\nstoners fart.\n\nThe very white Brent puts his hand out to be slapped by Jay\nand Silent Bob.\n\nBRENT\nWhat up, homies?\n(off the Girls)\nWow, Three guys, four girls--\n(to Jay and Bob)\nWhat's the count boys?\n\nJay and Bob look at each other and roll their eyes.\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY\n\nThe van drives down the road. We hear singing from inside.\n\nINT. VAN--DAY\n\nBrent strums a guitar and sings, as the Girls and Jay and\nBob listen, rolling eyes.\n\nBRENT\nHey there mister science-guy. Don't\nspray that aerosol in my eye. For I\ndon't really want to die. I'm a noble\nrabbit!\n\nJAY\nWhat're you guys, like a cover band\nor something?\n\nSISSY\nWe're the Kansas State chapter of\nS.A.A.C.--Students Against Animal\nCruelty.\n\nCHRISSY\nAnd we're on our way to Colorado to\ngive Provasik a piece of our minds!\n\nEveryone lets out a whoop, except Jay and Bob.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck are you bitches babbling\nabout?\n\nBRENT\nHey! Watch the language little boy.\nThere are females present.\n\nJay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts\nthem.\n\nJUSTICE\nProvasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical\nlab where they perform gross\nexperiments on animals.\n\nJAY\nSo, what kind of animals are we\ntalking about here--like bears and\nrhinos?\n\nBRENT\nNo--more like rabbits, dogs, cats...\nheck, even monkeys, If we don't speak\nfor them, who will?\n(touches Justice's\narm)\nRight, Jussy?\n\nJay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition.  After\na beat, he relaxes.\n\nJAY\nHey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you\nover here for a second?\n\nBrent joins Jay, strumming his guitar. Jay addresses him\nconfidentially.\n\nJAY\nBe honest, yo--you're down with this\nfor the fine-ass pussy, right?\n\nBRENT\nI'm down with this because I love\nanimals, stupid.\n\nJAY\nEven sheep?\n\nBRENT\nOf course. Sheep are beautiful\ncreatures.\n\nJAY\nThey are beautiful, aren't they?\n\nBRENT\nOh God, yes.\n\nJAY\nSo then you'd fuck a sheep?\n\nBRENT\nWhat is your damage little boy? You've\ngot a sick and twisted world\nperspective.\n\nJAY\nNo, you misunderstand me, Prince\nValiant. I mean if you were another\nsheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if\nyou were another sheep?\n\nBRENT\nI--suppose so.\n\nJAY\nThat's what I thought.\n(suddenly loudly, to\nall)\nYO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF\nUS! HE JUST SAID HE'D FUCK A SHEEP!\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY\n\nThe side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled\nout of the moving vehicle. Jay throws his guitar at him as\nwell, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off.\n\nJAY\nYA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!!\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--LATER\n\nThe van drives down the road.\n\nINT. VAN--SAME\n\nMissy drives. Sissy sits in the passenger seat. Chrissy kneels\nbetween them.\n\nCHRISSY\nWhat the fuck are we gonna do now?\n\nSISSY\nShut up, I'm thinking.\n\nIn the back, Justice studies some blueprints. Jay joins her,\nand she quickly folds them up.\n\nJAY\nIs Hollywood near where we're going?\n\nJUSTICE\nIs that where you guys are from?\n\nJAY\nCh'yeah, right. Jersey represent!\n\nJUSTICE\nOh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you\nall the way out here?\n\nJAY\nWell, we couldn't hang in front of\nthe Quick Stop no more, 'cause of\nthe strainen-en order, which sucks\nass 'cause it's been like our home\nsince we were kids. Silent Bob even\nbusted his cherry there.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Bob)\nYou did? I'll bet she was a lucky\ngirl.\n\nBob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has\nstrayed.\n\nJAY\nLook, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying\nto tell a story here.\n\nJUSTICE\nSorry.\n\nJAY\nAnyway, we were talking to Brodie\nand he said there's gonna be a\nBluntman and Chronic movie. So we\nwent to see Holden McNeil, and he\nshowed us the Internet, and that's\nwhere we found all these fucking\nlittle jerkoffs were saying shit\nabout us. So we decided to go to\nHollywood and stop the movie from\ngetting made.  And now we're here.\n\nJUSTICE\nWow. I have no idea what you just\nsaid.\n\nJAY\nYeah, I get that a lot. So you like\nanimals, huh?\n\nJUSTICE\nSure.\n\nJAY\nThat's cool. Even snakes?\n\nJUSTICE\nYou can't exclude an animal just\nbecause it's not cuddly. Of course I\nlike snakes.\n\nJAY\nHow about trouser snakes?\n\nJUSTICE\nWhat's a trouser snake?\n\nJust then, a little JAY DEVIL appears on Jay's left shoulder.\n\nJAY DEVIL\n(to Jay)\nWhat the fuck are you waiting for?\nShe went for the setup! Reach in\nyour fucking pants, and pull yer\ncock out, bitch! That's the kinda\nshit girls like!\n\nSuddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right\nshoulder.\n\nJAY DEVIL 2\nRight about here's where the angel's\nsupposed to show up and tell you not\nto pull your dick out. But we bitch-\nslapped that little fuck and sent\nhim packing, so it's smooth sailing.\nLet 'er rip, boy!\n\nThey disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his\nhand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick,\nwhen suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder,\nrubbing a swollen jaw.\n\nJAY ANGEL\nSorry I'm late. So what's the deal\nhere?\n(looks down)\nOh, shit--you're not thinking of\nwhipping your dick out at this fine\npiece of woman, are you?\n\nJay thinks, then nods \"Yes.\" The Jay Angel rolls his eyes,\nand slaps him.\n\nJAY ANGEL\nTell you what: look at Silent Bob.\nSee if he thinks it's a good idea to\nwhip your dick out.\n\nJay looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in\nhis pants to Jay and shakes his head \"no,\" sternly. Jay\nwithdraws his hand from his pants. The Jay Angel nods,\nsatisfied.\n\nJAY ANGEL\nThat's it, boy--put the dick down.\nYou gotta go from the heart, yo. No\nlittle perv bullshit will do for\nthis one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de\nla Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the\nshit out of two suckerpunching little\nbitches. Remember--don't pull your\ndick out until she asks you to.\n(beat)\nOr until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg!\nThe Jay Angel blinks away. Justice\nlooks at Jay, a bit confused.\n\nJAY\nDon't ask.\n(beat)\nSo, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like\nme do to help the animals?\n\nJUSTICE\nYou really don't want to help us--\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\nSure I do. I'd do anything for you.\n\nJustice smiles. Jay tries to recover.\n\nJAY\nI mean, youse guys! I'd do anything\nfor youse guys. For the lift and\nshit.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou sure?\n\nJAY\nSure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I.\nFuck\n\nJUSTICE\nWell--okay. Let me talk it over with\nthe other girls and get back to you.\n\nJAY\nYou do that.\n\nJay takes Justice's hand and kisses it.\n\nJAY\nI'll be right here.\n\nHe winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the\ncan, near Silent Bob.  He's still smiling at Justice and\nwinking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly,\nthen imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls.\n\nJAY\nFuck you. Fatty.\n\nEXT. CONVENIENCE STORY--DAY\n\nThe van pulls up and all pile out, stretching. The Girls\nhead toward the store.  Justice calls over to Jay and Silent\nBob.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou guys want anything from inside?\n\nJAY\nNo, we're cool, thanks hon.\n\nJustice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study\nthe front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a\nplace to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one.\nAfter a beat--\n\nJAY\nIt just ain't the same, is it? This\nplace licks balls compared to Quick\nStop.\n\nSilent Bob shakes his head \"Yeah.\"\n\nJAY\nAnd speaking of licking balls--how\n'bout that Justice chick? She is too\nfine.  And she smells so fucking\npretty. She's got a nice voice, too.\nAnd that body?  Smoking. You know,\nshe never once said \"fuck off,\" when\nI was talking to her, or pulled out\nthe pepper spray, or nothing. I tell\nya, Lunchbox--she could be the one.\n\nINT.

He was our\npatsy!\n\nJUSTICE\nWe'll find someone else. Besides, I\ndidn't see you trying to stop Jay\nfrom throwing him out.\n\nSISSY\nBecause I didn't want to blow our\ncover!\n\nJUSTICE\nCover, shmover--you all hated his\nsongs, too.\n\nCHRISSY\nNot as much as I hate you.\n\nJustice offers Chrissy a cold glance,\n\nCHRISSY\nFuck, if I don't get to kill someone\nsoon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone!\n\nSISSY\n(rubbing Chrissy's\nshoulders)\nDon't mind Chrissy. She's just a\nlittle too wound for sound.\n\nCHRISSY\nThen how about you help me take the\nedge off?\n\nChrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot\nand heavy in the middle of the convenience store. Other\ncustomers regard them wide-eyed.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Customers)\nThey're really good friends.\n\nSISSY\n(TO CHRISSY AND MISSY)\nWould you two knock it off? We're in\nthe fucking heartland here! Try to\nblend!\n\nJUSTICE\nThey already do--she's the milkmaid,\nand she's the cow.\n\nCHRISSY\nOh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow,\nbitch. And now I'm gonna rip your\nhead off and fuck your spine stump.\n\nSISSY\nEnough!\n(calm to Justice)\nWe have a very simple gang here,\nJustice.

I'm\ngonna take Missy into the dirty\nconvenience store bathroom and hate-\nfuck the shit out of her.\n\nChrissy drags Missy off. Justice and Sissy watch them go.\n\nJUSTICE\nAnd you said letting them read all\nthat Anais Nin wouldn't amount to\nanything.\n\nSISSY\nDon't change the subject. You know\nwhat you have to do now, right? Since\nyou let our patsy slip away, you've\ngotta convince the little kid and\nthat fat guy to take his place.\nThey've gotta break into Provasik\nnow.\n\nJUSTICE\nUh-uh!\n\nSISSY\nUh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out\nof this gang. Just use the little\none's crush to convince him, since\nhe's so fucking in love with you.\n\nJUSTICE\nJay? No he's not.\n\nSISSY\nWhat--am I blind?

So you've gotta make\namends.\n\nJUSTICE\nJay is not taking Brent's place as\nthe patsy.\n\nSISSY\nThat kid and his quite friend are\nour only options at this point. Now\nwe got about two hours before we get\nto Boulder. That gives you plenty of\nof time to work on him.\n\nJUSTICE\nI'm not gonna do it.\n\nSISSY\nWhy the fuck not?\n\nJUSTICE\nBecause he's just to so innocent!\n\nJustice looks out the window and smiles, seeing Jay dancing\nalongside Bob.\n\nJUSTICE\nLook at him--\n\nEXT.

Well, that's too bad.\n\nShe smiles at Jay, touches his chin and heads to the front\nof the van. Jay plays it cool until she's out of sight, then\nhumps silent Bob's leg like a dog.\n\nJAY\n(singing)\nI can't believe I'm gonna get some\npussy for stealing a monkey!\n(speaking)\nIf I'd known it was that easy, I'd've\nbeen stealing monkeys since I was\nlike seven and shit.\n\nJay looks at Silent Bob, who clearly disapproves.\n\nJAY\nDon't, motherfucker. Don't you ruin\nthis for me. Me and Justice are gonna\nget married one day, so don't be\ngiving me that \"we-ain't-stealing-no-\nmonkey\" look.  I'm Morris Day; you're\nJerome, bitch. Don't forget that.\nThat girl? That girl's in love with\nme.\n\nUp front, Justice talks to Sissy, while Missy drives.\n\nJUSTICE\nThey're gonna do it.\n\nSISSY\nGood.

You sure you're okay\nwith this?\n\nJAY\nAs sure as I am that you're the\nhottest bitch I ever seen.\n\nChrissy lunges at Jay, Missy holds her back, dragging Chrissy\naway.\n\nJAY\nWhat's twisting that bitch's tits?\n\nJUSTICE\nMaybe it's because women don't like\nto be called \"bitches,\" Jay.\n\nJAY\nThey don't? Well how 'bout \"piece of\nass\"?\n\nJUSTICE\nHow about not.\n\nJAY\nWell, what the fuck am I supposed to\ncall you, then?\n\nJUSTICE\nSomething sweet, you big goof.\nSomething nice.\n\nJAY\n(thinks; then)\nBoo-boo kitty fuck.\n\nJUSTICE\n(laughing)\nOkay.

Knock 'em dead, Tiger.\n\nSissy climbs back into the van.\n\nJAY\n(to Justice)\nSo--can I get a little kiss for good\nluck?\n\nJustice smiles at Jay, then kisses him sweetly on the lips.\n\nJAY\nSo--can I get a little blow job for\ngood luck?\n\nJustice smiles and pulls Jay's mask down. He heads off,\nrevealing Silent Bob behind him, lips puckered, handing in\nmidair. Jay reached back into the frame, pulling Bob out.\nJustice watches them go.\n\nSISSY\nJussy.

While we're executing\nPhase Two, you edit that tape and\ngrab a new car.\n\nMISSY\nNo sweat.\n\nSISSY\nLet's suit up.\n\nEXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT\n\nJay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn,\nstopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN\nout of his coat. He fires it into the air as Jay quickly\ngives the \"metal\" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame.\n\nINT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT\n\nIt's dead quiet and still.

Stopping at the front\ndoor.\n\nSissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures\nelaborately back, racing away into the night. Justice offers\nSissy a look.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou are so gay.\n\nChrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a\ndigital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four\ndifferent digits. The door lock CLICKS open.\n\nSISSY\nOnce we're inside, I want complete\nsilence.\n(holding up high-tech\ndevice)\nMissy whipped this up. It counts our\ndecibel level. If it goes into the\nred--alarm, we're dead. So not even\nthe slightest noise, got it?\n\nJustice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed\nclosely by Chrissy.  Justice lingers at the door, taking one\nlast look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay\nand Bob.\n\nSISSY\n(pokes her head back\nout)\nJustice! Move your ass!\n\nJustice heads inside. We PAN up to reveal a sign that reads:\nBOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE.\n\nINT. PROVASIK TESTING ROOM--NIGHT\n\nJay and Bob stand there, looking around the room.\n\nIt's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking\nANIMALS.  A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his\neyes and hits him.\n\nJAY\nStay frosty, you big fucking softie.\nWe've got a job to do.\n\nSilent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade\nthrough the cages. Jay stops at an EMERGENCY BOX hanging on\nthe wall. Inside it, there's a pistol.\n\nJAY\nCheck this out, Lunchbox. Animal\ntranquilizer. This shit fucks you up\nlike Percocets!\n\nJay elbows the glass, breaking it. He takes the gun out and\ntosses it to Bob.\n\nJAY\nHold this. Later, me and Justice can\nshoot each other with it and fuck\nlike stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg.\n\nSilent Bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat.

At the\nother end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS.\n\nSissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays\nthe air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor,\nwhich rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly,\nwithin the mist, laser beams become apparent.\n\nSissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few\nsteps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs\nforward and does an impressive series of flips down the\nhallway, not touching a single laser beam.\n\nChrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.\n\nOnce Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of\nthe hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture\nto Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series\nof flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm.\n\nChrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.\n\nJustice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to\nChrissy.\n\nChrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams,\nSissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly.\n\nThen, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are\neven more impressive than the other two, including running\nup walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes\nthe last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice,\narms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud,\nmanly FART.\n\nThe decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING\nthrough the building.\n\nCHRISSY\nHoly fuck--the little stoner was\nright--\n\nSissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds. She ours\nthem into a bag, and races back down the hallway, followed\nby Justice and Chrissy.\n\nEXT.

PROVASIK TESTING LAB--NIGHT\n\nJay and Bob carry a large canvas bag between them. Something\nseems to move inside it.

Now\nwe got what we came for, so let's\nget the fuck out!\n\nSilent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn. Jay shakes\nhis head frustrated.\n\nJAY\nYeah, it's sad!

The COPS leap out of their cruisers, guns drawn. Jay\nlooks to Bob, pissed\n\nCOP\nDROP THE BAG! BEFORE THIS THING TURNS\nEXPLOSIVE!\n\nThe counter on the device attached to the van hits \"0,\" and\nthe van BLOWS UP.  Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one\ndirection, the Cops in the other.  On all fours, Jay looks\nat the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye.\n\nJAY\nJustice--\n\nWe crane up from him as he bellows--\n\nJAY\nJUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!!\n\nSilent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still\ncarrying the bag.\n\nEXT.

Uhhh--\n\nAs he climaxes, a ganging at the door disrupts him.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWHAT?! WHAT?! I'M READING!\n\nDEPUTY (O.S.)\nSir, we got a report of a break-in\nat Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing\nlab.\n\nWillenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine.\nThere's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nHave you read this article on the\nmule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I\nwish that was in our jurisdiction--\nI'd shut down every last one of those\nass-cock chuggers, personally.\n\nThe Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then\nat Willenholly.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWhat? \"Ass\" means \"donkey.\"\n\nDEPUTY\nYes, sir.\n(hands him a fax)\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(looks at fax)\nBoulder, hunh?

This\ninvestigation is now under my\njurisdiction.\n\nCOP 1\nOh really? And why is that?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nBecause someone let a whole mess of\nanimals out of their cages, sir.\n\nCOP 1\nWell, we believe that was just a\ndiversionary tactic used to call\nattention away from the real heist\nover here at the Diamond Exchange.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nYeah, right. That's a believable\nscenario. It sounds more like\nsomething out of a bad movie.\n\nWillenholly and the Cop look at the camera. Then, another\nCOP joins them.\n\nCOP 2\nSir, the Provasik people say they've\nrounded all their animals up, except\nfor one: an orangutan.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nListen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our\nfugitive has been on the run for 6\nhours!  Average simian foot speed\nover uneven ground--barring injuries\nor preoccupation with tire tubes,\nmites or bananas--is four miles an\nhour. That gives us a radius of twenty\nmiles.\n\nCOP 3\n(calling out from\ncrowd)\nTwenty-four, sir!\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWhat?\n\nCOP 3\nSix hours times four miles an hour\nis twenty-four.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(doing the math in\nhis head)\nYes. Yes, you're right. My bad. Twenty-\nfour miles. Now what I want out of\nall of you is a hard target search.\n\nCOP 4\nExcuse me, sir?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nYeah?\n\nCOP 4\nWhat does that mean, exactly--a \"hard\ntarget search\"? What's a \"hard\ntarget\"?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWell. It's--a target--that's--hard.\nAnyway--\n\nCOP 4\nSo are you referring to the search's\nlevel of difficulty? Or is the hard\ntarget the monkey?\n\nCOP 3\nOr the people who stole the monkey?\n\nThe COPS now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of\n\"Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,\"etc.\nWillenholly rubs his temples.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nOkay, how about this?

If I was you, I\nwould've drowned his ass in your\nCreek and shit!\n\nJAMES\nI know, Because what--is Josh better\nlooking than me? Fuck, no. I mean,\nwho on earth is better looking that\nme? I ask you.\n\nJAY\nJoey, man! She's too fine! Yo--did\nyou ever get to third base with her?\n\nJAMES\nWell, there was this one time--\n(catching himself)\nWait a second--who are you guys?!\n\nJASON\nThey're our stunt doubles, dumbass.\n(to Jay)\nRight?\n\nJAY\nStunt doubles for what?\n\nJAMES\nThe movie we start shooting in a few\nminutes--Bluntman and Chronic Strike\nBack.\n\nJASON\n(to Bob)\nYou're doubling me. I'm playing\nBluntman, AKA Silent Bill.\n\nJAMES\nBob\n\nJASON\nRight. And he's playing Chronic. AKA\nRay.\n\nJAMES\nJay! Shit, did you even read the\nscript?\n\nJASON\nThere's a script?\n\nJay and Bob stare at them, blankly. Then Jay puts up his\nfinger, indicating they should wait a minute. He gets into a\nhuddle with Silent Bob and Suzanne.\n\nJAY\nThese are the guys who are playing\nus, yo. We take them out, and bickety-\nbam! No movie.\n\nSilent Bob nods at Jay, then Suzanne. Suzanne heads off,\nleaving Jay and Bob to huddle.\n\nJASON\n(off Jay and Bob, to\nJames)\nWhat's with the weird, gay huddle\ngoing on over there?\n\nJAMES\nWhat's gay about it? It's two guys\ntalking in a corner. Man--why are\nyou such a homophobe.\n\nJASON\nI'm not a homophobe.\n\nJAMES\nYou are. You're always calling things\ngay. \"Ooo--look at the gay huddle,\ndude!\"\n\nSuzanne approaches them.\n\nJASON\nHey--look at the monkey.\n\nJAMES\nNext you're going to tell me the\nmonkey's gay.\n\nJASON\nHe's so cute--\n(to Suzanne)\nC'mere. Monkey. C'mere--\n\nSuzanne pulls Jason and James out of the frame.\n\nWhile Jay and Silent Bob continue to huddle, the sounds of a\nbeating are heard, O.C.\n\nJAY\nAlright, here's what we do: start\nswinging, and don't stop until those\nyoung Hollywood fucks are out of\ncommission. Ready? Break!\n\nJay and Bob spin to face Jason and James--only to go wide-\neyed. Suzanne stands atop the fallen actors, who are bloodied\nand beaten and knocked out cold. She holds her hands skyward,\nclasped like a champion.\n\nJAY\nThat's one funky monkey.\n\nSuddenly there's a banging at the door of the dressing room.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nMister Biggs?  Mister Van... Der--\nBeek? This is Security. We've got a\npair of intruders at large, and they\ncrashed through a window we thought\nmight be yours.\n\nJAY\n(to door; deepening\nvoice)\nUh--yeah. They're in here.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nDo they have you hostage? Should we\ncall your publicists?\n\nJAY\nNO! I mean, we kicked those guys'\nasses bad. They're--knocked out.\n\nEXT. DRESSING ROOM--SAME\n\nThe Security Guards stand outside a door marked James.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nGreat work, sirs! If you let us in,\nwe'll take over--\n\nJAY (O.S.)\n(through door)\nNO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in\nhere! Together!\n\nThe Security guard look at one another.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nUh--okay. We'll just be--outside the\ndoor, sirs.\n\nThe Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job\nface to the rest.\n\nINT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY\n\nBob opens an AIR VENT in the wall. He puts Suzanne into it\nand hands her the tranquilizer gun, miming to her. She nods,\nand starts crawling through the ductwork, Bob closes the\nvent again, and starts rifling through a nearby closet.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck are we gonna do?! How\nare we gonna get out of here without\nthem seeing us?\n\nSilent Bob pulls a pair of hangered COSTUMES from the closet,\nsmiling.\n\nEXT. LOT--DAY\n\nThe Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a\nwaiting Cop Car. The pair are still dressed like Jay and\nSilent Bob.\n\nJAMES\nYOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS!\n\nJASON\nHEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M\nTHE PIE-FUCKER.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\n(to Cops)\nHe'll be the pie--in prison.\n\nINT. SOUNDSTAGE HALLWAY--DAY\n\nJay and Bob creep toward a door (we don't see the outfits).\n\nJAY\nThis was a good idea, Lunchbox. In\nthese outfits we're totally incognito.\n\nSuddenly, and A.D. appears, grabbing them by the shoulders.\n\nA.D.\nMister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek?\nGreat--you've changed costumes\nalready. Let's get you to set.\n(pulling them off)\nThe director doesn't like to be kept\nwaiting.\n\nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--BLUNTCAVE SET\n\nIt looks like the Batcave, but it's not. Off to the side,\nnear the monitor and chair setup, a black DIRECTOR eyeballs\nthe hustling, white crew.\n\nDIRECTOR\nLook at all these crackers, Seventy\nmillion dollars and I can't even get\na black grip?\n\nA white P.A. brings a cup of latte to the Director.\n\nP.A.\nHere's your coffee, sir.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(eyes the coffee)\nYou spit in this?  Because I know\nall you white folks are pissed off\nthat the studio'd entrust a multi-\nmillion dollar to a brother.\n\nP.A.\nI didn't spit in it, sir.\n\nDIRECTOR\nThen taste it! Go on!\n\nThe P.A. takes the cup and sips from it. He tries to hand it\nback to the Director.\n\nP.A.\nIt's all good, sir.\n\nDIRECTOR\nNo it ain't all good. Oh, you think\nI want it now, after your lips touched\nthe cup? Get the fuck off my set!\n\nP.A.\nYou the man, sir.\n\nDIRECTOR\nNo you the Man! And that's the\nproblem!\n\nThe Director glares at the scared P.A., as he cautiously\nskulks off. BANKY EDWARDS approaches.\n\nBANKY\nUh, Chaka? Yeah, hi--I'm Banky\nEdwards, the creator of Bluntman and\nChronic. We met a few weeks back.\nI'm the executive producer.\n\nDIRECTOR/CHAKA\nOh--you're the executive producer,\nhunh? Well go \"produce\" me a latte\nno white folks spit in--okay Fucky?\n\nBANKY\nBanky. I just wanted you to know\nthat I respect your work as an artist.\nI'm something of an artist myself. I\nwas the inker on the comic book.\n\nCHAKA\nAn inker? What, like you trace?\n\nBanky's face drops as the A.D. joins them.\n\nA.D.\nBiggs and Van Der Beek are on the\nset, Chaka.\n\nCHAKA\nI don't see 'em. Where are they?\n(into bullhorn)\nWHERE THE FUCK ARE THE STARS OF THIS\nPIECE OF SHIT?!\n\nOn the Bluntcave set, two massive doors open in the fake\nrock. Smoke pours in, and Jay and Silent Bob--now dressed as\nBLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC--step from the darkness. Jay and Bob\nsurvey the set, amazed.\n\nJAY\nThis must've set 'em back a couple\nhundred bucks.\n\nCHAKA\nLook at this shit.\n(off their outfits)\nA gay hood ornament, and the color\nPurple.\n\nJAY\nWho the fuck are you?\n\nCHAKA\nWho the fuck am I? I'm the fucking\ndirector, is who I am. Chaka Luther\nKing. The creator of all of this.\n\nJAY\nWait a sec--I thought Holden and\nBanky created this shit.\n\nCHAKA\nAnd I'm stealing it. I'm taking it\nback for all the shit you people\nhave stolen from us! Did you know, I\ncame up with the idea for Sesame\nStreet before PBS? I was going to\ncall it N.W.P.--Niggaz with Puppets.\n(beat)\nAlright--enough small talk. Let's\nshoot it.\n\nChaka heads back toward his monitor. Jay and Bob are confused.\n\nJAY\nWait, wait, wait!! Aren't you gonna\ndirect us?\n\nCHAKA\nI'll be directing you to the food\nstamps line after I fire your ass,\nif you talk back like that to me\nagain!\n\nJAY\nBut we don't know what we're supposed\nto do here. We didn't even read the\nscript.\n\nCHAKA\nSo? Neither did I. Shit, neither did\nthe studio.\n(pointing O.C.)\nLook man, it's not hard. In this\nscene, the bad guy breaks into the\nBluntcave.  You make up some shit,\nfight him for a while, I film it, I\nyell \"cut,\" and then head back to my\ntrailer, where I got more white women\nwaiting for me there than the first\nlifeboat off the Titanic!\n(confidentially)\nThey all want a part of the movie,\nand I got just the part for 'em.\n\nJay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed, as Chaka heads off.\n\nCHAKA\nLET'S ROLL WITH THE NEW!\n\nA.D. (O.S.)\nQUIET ON THE SET! THIS IS A TAKE!\n\nChaka climbs behind his monitor. The P.A. is waiting for him\nwith another cup of coffee.\n\nP.A.\nI got you another cup of coffee,\nsir. Spit free.\n\nChaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down.\n\nThe Clapper/Loader jumps in front of the startled Jay and\nBob, getting ready.  After a beat, he turns to Silent Bob.\n\nCLAPPER/LOADER\nI just wanna say that I loved when\nyou fucked that pie.\n(calling off)\nBLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC STRIKE BACK,\nSCENE THIRTY-SEVEN, TAKE ONE!\n\nThe clapper/Loader shuts the clapboard and races off. From\nbehind the monitor,\n\nChaka calls out--\n\nCHAKA\nACTION!\n\nJay and Bob (as Bluntman and Chronic) look at each other for\na beat. Then--\n\nJAY/CHRONIC\nUh--Snootchie Bootchies.\n\nSuddenly, the wall to their left explodes. Jay and Bob hit\nthe deck. Through the smoking rubble steps COCK-KNOCKER--the\narch--nemesis of Bluntman and Chronic.  He's a normal-looking\nman with huge, overgrown FISTS.\n\nJAY/CHRONIC\nWhat the fuck?\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\nYou thought I'd never find your\nprecious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp\nKnight? But now you and your sidekick\nare finally in the grasp of Cock-\nKnocker!\n\nJAY/CHRONIC\nWhy do they call you \"Cock-Knocker\"?\n\nCock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls.\nJay drops to his knees, wailing. Cock-Knocker then pulls a\nvibrator-looking device from his cape.  He presses a button\non it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a\nlight saber.\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\nAny last words before I bust your\nballs, Bluntman?\n\nSilent Bob quickly looks right, then left. His eyes fall on--\n\nA wall of armaments, on which hands a SILVER BONG, under the\nplacard: BONG SABER--EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE.\nIt's out of his reach.\n\nSilent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating. He reached his\nhand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick.\n\nSuddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip.\nThe Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive\npose. Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair\nstart light saber dueling.\n\nCHAKA\n(from behind monitor)\nDamn! Now that was one special effect!\nThis picture's gonna make House Party\nlook like House Party Two!\n\nA.D.\nOr House Party Three?\n\nCHAKA\nShut the fuck up!\n\nCock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive\nblade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the\nladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He\nlands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock-\nKnocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on\nhis ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver\na saber kill-shot, when we hear--\n\nJAY (O.S.)\nYO-BITCH-FISTS!\n\nCock-Knocker turns to see--\n\nJay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a\ndouble-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la\nthe Darth Maul light saber in Episode One).\n\nJAY\nCall me Darth Balls. Bunngg.\n\nJay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong\nSaber.\n\nCHAKA\n(from behind the\nmonitor)\nI think George Lucas is going to sue\nsomebody--\n\nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY\n\nWillenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a\nshotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside\nthe flashing red light.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(looking around)\nSo, this is Hollywood?\n(suddenly full of\npurpose)\nLights, camera, action, Jay and Silent\nBob.\n\nWillenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door.\n\nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY\n\nThe door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two\nshots, O.C.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nFREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!!\n\nWillenholly goes wide-eyed.\n\nIt's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a\nkid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a\nBarney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare\nback at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking\nbullet holes in it. Mooby collapses.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nOh my God--\n(to kids)\nUm--sorry. That was supposed to be a\nwarning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm\non the wrong, uh--wrong set.\n\nThe Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the\nO.C. Willenholly.\n\nKID\nYou killed Mooby--\n(to Kids)\nLET'S GET HIM!!!\n\nThe Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as\nhe's attacked.\n\nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME\n\nJay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle.\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\n(breaking character)\nYou are not upstaging me, Van Der\nBeek!\n\nJay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker,\nhacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear\nreactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade\nthe attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other\nhand.\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\n(to O.C. Chaka)\nCHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A\n\"CUT\"!\n\nOn cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's\nhuge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire).\n\nSilent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber,\nJay grins at Cock-Knocker.\n\nJAY\nNow whose balls have been busted,\nbitch?\n\nSuddenly, a gun shot rings out.\n\nAll turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun\nfirst on Jay, then Bob.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nThe C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and\nSilent Bob!\n(revealing badge:\ncalling out)\nEveryone stay calm. I'm a Federal\nWildlife Marshal. These men are the\nleaders of a terrorist organization\nwanted for the abduction of a monkey.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nThey didn't really steal that monkey.\n\nAll turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows.\nWillenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops.\n\nJUSTICE\nIt was just a diversion so we could\nsteal these.\n\nJustice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing\nthem.\n\nJUSTICE\nAnd they're not the leaders of\nC.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nNo--the clit's real. The female orgasm\nis a myth.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Jay)\nAre you guys alright?\n\nJAY\nI thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty\nFuck.\n\nJUSTICE\n(smiling)\nYou remembered.\n(back to business)\nIt was a frame-up, Jay. Sissy. Missy,\nChrissy, and I are international\njewel thieves. We were setting you\nup as a patsy, but I couldn't go\nthrough with it, because I... because\nI love you.\n\nJAY\nYeah? So that means you'll fuck me,\nright?\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nIf she does, it'll be considered\nnecrophilia.\n\nAll turn to see Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy slinking from the\nshadows, guns drawn.\n\nSISSY\nBecause she's gonna be one dead bitch.\n(to Justice)\nHi, Jussy. We catch you at a bad\ntime?\n\nMISSY\nYou should've just let these guys go\ndown, Jussy.\n\nJAY\nHey, I wanted to go down, but I was\nwaiting until I got to know her a\nlittle better. See, there was this\nlittle angel on my shoulder, and he\nsaid--\n\nCHRISSY\nShut the fuck up before I shoot you\nwhere you stand in your pansy red\nbooties.\n\nJAY\n(looking down)\nHoly shit, I am wearing pansy red\nbooties!\n(to Bob)\nMan--why the fuck didn't you tell\nme?\n\nSISSY\nLet's have those diamonds, Jussy.\n\nJUSTICE\nI can't do that, Sissy\n\nSISSY\n(points her gun at\nJay)\nThen lover--boy gets one in the brain.\n\nCHAKA\nYO!\n\nAll turn to look at Chaka.\n\nCHAKA\nWould any of you lovely ladies like\na private audition to be in my movie?\n\nJustice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand. It lands on\nthe ground discharging. Then everyone starts shooting and\nrunning for cover.\n\nJay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile.\n\nMissy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed\ncraft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start\nfiring at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren\ncraft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented\ncan of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are\nout of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and\nreload. From behind his table,\n\nWillenholly yells--\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME?!?! I'M\nJUST A FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL!!!\n\nCHRISSY\nTWO REASONS: ONE--WE'RE WALKING,\nTALKING BAD GIRLS, CLICHES!\n\nMISSY\nAND TWO: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nONLY ON THE OUTSIDE!\n\nThe Girls and Willenholly both pop back up and open fire\nagain.\n\nChaka ducks behind the monitor.\n\nCHAKA\nA shitload of white people with guns?\nTime to get my black ass out of here!\n\nHe races off, passing Justice and Sissy, who circle each\nother defensively, striking kung fu poses.\n\nSISSY\nYou really let me down, Justice.\nThrowing it all away for a little\nstoner with bad pronunciation.\n\nJAY (O.S.)\nHEY!\n\nJUSTICE\n(ignoring him)\nWhat's it gonna be, Sissy? Which\nfighting style do you want me to\nkick your ass in?\n\nSISSY\nAre you kidding me? I taught you all\nall your moves myself. There's not a\nstyle you can bust that I can't defend\nagainst.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou're no match for my \"Shaolin Monk.\"\n\nSISSY\nYeah, but I can bury you with my\n\"Crouching Tiger.\"\n\nJUSTICE\nA little \"Venus's--flytrap\"?\n\nSISSY\nI'll counter with \"Dragon Crane.\"\n\nJUSTICE\nHow about a little \"Bitch, My Man\nAin't Yo Baby's Daddy\"?\n\nSISSY\n(beat; smiles)\nBring it on.\n\nJustice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch\ninto a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and\nscreaming.\n\nBehind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action.\n\nJAY\nYo--I hope one of 'em rips the other\none's shirt off and we see some tit.\n\nBoth Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding. Banky joins\nthem, crawling in on his belly, covering his head.\n\nBANKY\nMister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I\njust wanted to say hi. I'm--\n\nJAY\nBanky fucking Edwards! Just the\nmotherfucker we came to see!\n\nBANKY\n(shocked)\nHoly shit! What the fuck are you\nguys doing here?!\n\nSissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the\nfloor, screeching.  Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.\n\nBANKY\nStop the movie?! Are you crazy?!\n\nJAY\nAll these assholes are calling us\nnames on the Internet, 'cause of\nthis stupid movie!\n\nBANKY\nI feel for you boys--I really do.\nThose Net snipers can be really cruel.\nBut Miramax paid me a shitload of\nmoney for Bluntman and Chronic, so\nit occurs to me that people bad-\nmouthing you on some web-site is\nnone of my FUCKING CONCERN!\n\nSILENT BOB\nOh--but I think it is.\n\nBanky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes.\n\nJAY\nHere we go again--\n\nSILENT BOB\nShut the fuck up.\n(to Banky)\nWe had a deal with you on the comics\nfor likeness rights. And as we're\nnot only the artistic basis but also\nthe character basis for your\nintellectual property, Bluntman and\nChronic, when we said property was\noptioned by Miramax Films you were\nlegally obliged to secure our\npermission to transfer the concept\nto another medium. As you failed to\ndo that, you're in breach of the\noriginal contract--ergo, you find\nyourself in a very actionable\nposition.\n\nBanky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a\nbeat, Jay adds--\n\nJAY\nYeah.\n\nJustice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head\nand kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.\n\nBANKY\nSo, what do you guys want, to go\naway and take your lady friends with\nyou?\n\nJAY\nShitcan this movie so we don't get\ncalled names on the Internet anymore.\n\nBANKY\nEven if there's no movie, people are\nstill free to talk shit about you on\nthe Internet. That's what the\nInternet's for: slandering others\nanonymously.  Stopping the flick\nisn't going to stop that!\n\nIn the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the\nair.\n\nJAY\nWell this isn't fair!  We went to\nHollywood, I fell in love, we stole\na monkey, we got shot at, and got\npunched in the motherfucking nuts!\nWe ain't leaving empty-handed!\n\nOn cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap.\n\nJAY\nWhat's up baby? You look good!\n\nBANKY\nIsn't that your girlfriend's enemy?\n\nJAY\nOh yeah.\n(pushing Sissy off\nhim)\nGet the fuck offa me, pig!\n\nSissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair.\n\nJay, Bob, and Banky continue.\n\nBANKY\nYou guys are gonna ruin my movie\ncareer.\n\nJAY\nWell, we want something for our mental\nanguish.\n\nBANKY\nTell you what: we'll settle this\nmonetarily. I'll give you half of\nwhat I made.\n\nJAY\nHalf?!?\n\nBANKY\nHalf's not good enough?  Fine--I'll\ngive you two-thirds of what I made!\n\nJAY\nFuck-you--you already said half? You\ncan't take it back!\n\nSilent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand.\n\nBANKY\nDone\n\nJustice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing\neach other.\n\nSISSY\nYour shit is so tired, Justice!\n\nJUSTICE\nCall me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH!\n\nJustice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage.\n\nSissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop\nMissy and Chrissy, knocking them out.\n\nWillenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nHello? Truce?\n(beat)\nI think I killed both of them.\n\nSuddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing\na tranquilizer dart in his ass, and SUZANNE standing behind\nhim, holding the gun up in the air.  Justice surveys her\nhandiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the Bluntmobile.\n\nJUSTICE\nC'mon guys. It's over.\n\nJay, Bob, and Banky pop up from behind the car and join her.\n\nJAY\nYo, I was just about to jump in there\nand get your back.\n\nThen, the SOUND of SIRENS rings out in the distance.\n\nJAY\nHoly shit, the cops! We gotta get\nout of here!\n\nJUSTICE\nNo. I'm tired of running.\n\nJustice lifts Willenholly into a sitting position and taps\nhis face.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou awake, Marshal? Marshal?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(tries to move but\ncan't)\nOh my God, I'm paralyzed. The monkey\nshot me in the ass and paralyzed me!\nOh the irony!\n\nJUSTICE\n(off Suzanne's gun)\nYou're not paralyzed. It was just a\ntranquilizer.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nJesus! Tranqued by a little monkey!\nMy friends in the Bureau are never\ngonna let me live this down!\n\nJUSTICE\nYou have friends in the F.B.I.?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(crying)\nThey all made it in, but I failed\nthe exam. Why the hell else do you\nthink I became a Federal Wildlife\nMarshal? 'Cause I'm a joke!\n\nJustice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking.\nThen--\n\nJUSTICE\nMaybe not. I can make you a deal\nthat'll get you into the F.B.I.,\nregardless of test scores.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWhat kind of deal?\n\nJUSTICE\nYou drop the charges against Jay and\nSilent Bob and say you never found\nthe ape.  Make sure the world knows\nthey're not in control of any C.L.I.T.\n\nJAY\nNow wait a second--\n\nJUSTICE\nI'll explain later, Jay\n(to Willenholly)\nIn exchange, I'll give you the\ndiamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy,\nMissy, Chrissy, and myself. But I\nwant a reduced sentence.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nYou'd be willing to do that?\n\nJUSTICE\n(off Jay)\nFor him? I'd be willing to do\nanything.\n\nJustice stands and takes Jay by the hands.\n\nJUSTICE\nI'm an international jewel thief\nwho's facing a jail sentence.\n\nJAY\nThat's alright. I'm a junkie with a\nmonkey.\n\nJUSTICE\nIf I go to prison, will you wait for\nme?\n\nJAY\nI don't know. Will we fuck when you\nget out?\n\nJustice smiles and kisses Jay Passionately. The kiss should\nsay it all, but--\n\nJAY\nDon't change the subject. Will we\nfuck when you get out?\n\nJUSTICE\nSnoogans.\n\nJustice and Jay kiss again.\n\nSuzanne reached up to Silent Bob, who picks her up. She grabs\nhis face and kisses him.\n\nWillenholly looks to Banky.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWow. There's a lot of love in the\nroom.\n\nBANKY\nRegardless of what you may have heard.\nI do not kiss guys.\n\nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE--LATER\n\nJustice and Jay are still kissing, until Willenholly pulls\nher away and loads her into the waiting Cop Car.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nSorry, Justice. We've gotta go.\n(to Jay: friendly)\nHey--stop stealing monkeys.\n\nJAY\nFuck you.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nFair enough.\n\nWillenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the\ncar.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Jay)\nWait for me.\n\nJAY\nWhat--here?\n\nJay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away,\nleaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky.

he never had a chance\nAnd though the doctors said he couldn't live his mama had some faith to give\nAnd they brought him to her and his mama named him Vance\nHe was sick a long time then I used to sit by him\nI'd rub his head he would squeeze my hand\nBut he never cried he'd grit his teeth and smile at me cause he couldn't speak\nAnd that's when I began to respect the little man\nAnd I think Vance was three right about then\nHe started school and one day he came home and at the doorway\nI could tell the little man didn't want to come inside\nHe'd met a girl but her boyfriend Smitty\nHad caught him walkin' home with her and nearly killed Vance\nBut then Vance never cried and the only thing that Smitty hurt was pride\nAnd he said papa do you become a man when you're twenty one\nAnd I said age doesn't make a man a man my son\nHe looked at me so puzzled with eyes so young and kind\nAnd I think Vance was seven about that time\nI guess they say that first love is the very best\nAt least it was with Vance cause he'd scratched Becky on his desk\nBut Becky went with Smitty and Vance was very small\nAnd he used to dream what it'd be like to be tall\nAnd then a few years later Vance came in one day\nAnd told me and his mama that he had to go away\nTo be fitted for a uniform and though his mama shed a tear\nHe kissed her and said he'd see us in two years\nAnd he looked at me and said papa I'm gonna be a man\nWell two years to the day Vance came walkin' in the driveway\nAnd I didn't recognize him from his size till he got near\nHe came in and he hugged his mama\nAnd said hey papa little man wanna go with me somewhere and grab a beer\nSo we're sittin' at this table when this fella at the bar started buggin' Vance\nCallin' him soldier but Vance kept his cool\nAnd he said papa that guy is Smitty and he's to be pitied now\nCause that's the same guy that used to bully me in school\nThen Smitty said the wrong thing when he brought up Becky's name\nAnd Vance finally stood and said boy what did you say\nAnd it did my heart so much good when Vance hit ole Smitty\nAnd it took two of Smitty's friends to carry him away\nWell Vance left the very next mornin' and it was cold and it was snowin'\nAnd from the first life hadn't been much fun\nBut he had finally made a stand and he'd become a self made man\nAnd incidentally he had just turned twenty oneYou might also

rap die klinkt als Kung-Fu\nCasse-toi, ouias, c'tout, c'tout\nIkke loco en m'n goons too\nNiemand gaat hardcore als Guy\nJullie zijn clean, wij zijn vies\nIk heb gerief, gij hebt niets\nKeepin' it

man\nLove\n\n[Verse: Zwangere Guy]\nStond ik altijd in balans dan was mijn leven veel te saai\nRust is wat ik zoek, maar ik hoor vaak te veel lawaai\nGrijp altijd elke kans en dat doe ik till I die\nRook veel minder jonko, but I love it when I'm high, kijk\nHet leven valt hier altijd om te grijpen\nIk kan amper nog ontbijten\nBen van 's ochtends aan het schrijven\n's Avonds laat bezwijken, wil mij altijd zwaar bewijzen\nZie mensen die alsof doen en ook puto's die niet zwijgen\nMa vie c'est comme une chienne, maar zal ze altijd buitenlaten\nWant een mens dat niet vrij rondloopt leeft benauwd of telt zijn dagen\nLuister nu naar raad zoals ik luister naar m'n platen\nOnderscheid mij met de kennis die ik meekreeg van m'n vader\nLa vida loca, maar ik wil geen leven lijk een rockstar\nRappen tot de dood en genieten als ik opsta\nVan 't zelfde vlees en bloed, maar pas op als ik amok maak\n24/7 dat ik constant naar de klok staar\nKennis en begrip iets waar dat ik diep naar graaf\nMijn weg is pas gevonden als ik effe ben verdwaald\nSchrijf amper nog met pen, want ben vergeten hoe dat gaat\nIn een wereld waar het scherm de baas is, zie'k het zwarte schaap\nPompen Conway the machine, Dr. Dr\u00e9 of the JB's\nFunk mijn leven op, all I need dat is muziek\nProduct van de goot werd een rapper met carri\u00e8re\nProbleem is niet de dood maar dat we langer willen blijven\nBen een deel van het probleem, eet vaak vis en te veel vlees\nVlieg over heel de wereld alsof dat het mij niks scheelt\nM'n wagen is verkocht, maar zit nog veel te vaak in Ubers\nNog altijd niets gekocht en ik maak deel uit van de huurders\nKijk, ik hou wel van het drukke stadsleven\nEn sta klaar voor een debat of effe voor de klas te spreken\nZeg me eerlijk wat is't leven als ge niks meer kunt bespreken\nIk wil geven, ik wil nemen\nLekker eten met m'n neven\nJongens hebben hier geen rolpatroon\nLeven van een gangsterdroom\nAmper plaats om rond te lopen, afblazen van hete stoom\nDames worden nagefloten, vuile woorden aangesproken\nKnie\u00ebn in uw ballen moest ik als vrouw op de wereld lopen\nBrenda's got a baby en ze weet niet wat te doen\nKent enkel doctor Google of heeft schrik van grote broer\nGe kunt pissen op de system of ge kunt er iets aan doen\nIk zal vechten voor m'n rechten, als'k iets doe dan doe'k het goe, ja\n[Hook: Zwangere Guy]\nHeb vele situaties niet goed aangenomen\nBen blijven werken, blijven lopen en ben blijven dromen\nWe leven in een wereld waar we blijven kopen\nHoe meer ik wil, hoe minder dat ik slaap op beide oren\nIk ken er velen die te snel hebben voor kaas gekozen\nNu staan ze stil of is het zoeken in een grijze zone\nIk weet nog hoe we speelden in de wijk waar'k woonde\nWe pompten 2pac en we leerden van zijn wijze woorden\n\n[Outro: Zwangere Guy]\nBrussel de stad waar dat al jaren niets meer lukt\nNiks is hier nog gratis en 't systeem vaak te corrupt\nIedereen wilt water, maar ze zagen als het drupt\nEen kraan kan ik nog maken, wat ik haat dat is de druk\nSmaak komt met de jaren en succes wordt weggeplukt\nBij elke fakkel die ik aansteek wordt er weer een brand geblust\nJah Rastafari, King Selassie, aye\nZit met roest in mijn gewrichten maar zal altijd blijven gaan, Guy\n\nTrack 3: SPEKGLAD\n\n[Intro: Zwangere Guy]\nEy, shoutout naar alle beatmakers op BRUTAAL en in de hele wereld\nGe weet what the fuck is up\nWe stappen op de volgende, check\n\n[Verse 1: Zwangere Guy]\nThe realest shit I ever wrote\nHang alleen met mannen van hun woord\nOverleven met de lessen die we leerden in de goot\nSpeelt ge me' mijn kloten, smijt mijn clique u overboord\nOndernemen en niet stressen, knoop het goed in jullie hoofd\nHoef geen sessie bij die COLORS als een ingepakte puto\nDrop liever 16 bij die rotjoch in de studio\nPraat nie over money als het gaat over u bruto\nKijk uit vaffanculo, kus mijn kloten en cornuto\nVoor altijd in het veld, in muziek valt niks te winnen\n's Ochtends sta ik op om in diezelfde pot te pissen\nGing van 'Beter Leven' schrijven naar mijn leven te begrijpen\nIn mijn leven niks veranderd buiten soms eens leren (..)\nPraten is hier zilver en zwijgen is ons goud\nAls losgeslagen wilden in een rot betonnen woud\nDe vraag is nie wa wilde, nee de vraag is wa ge hebt\nGeniet er van, my G, want het is weg voor da ge 't merkt\nGuy\n\n[Verse 2: Jazz]\nJa\nStel geen vragen over wat nu juist het plan is\nMaak moves voor dat Haren een gevang is\nStraathoer met een SOA op de onderlip\nNooit moe, als een junkie die weer zonder zit\nDit is de straat man, wa zijt ge met uw judo\nBang, bang, op de oogleden van Ludo\nStrik de veters van me Asics Rudolph want de man op de hoek kocht een hamer in de Hubo\nIk fuck nie met dat ben laat op het pad, nee\nLoop nie met uw geld rond, vogel voor kat\nBeter, beter, zegt ge niks, er is een kogel voor rat, ja\nBeter blijft ge thuis trainen, hoog ligt de lat\nDit is Brussel op de kaart, rap\nNie ondertiteld omdat iedereen de bars snapt\nSpeel nie of kom met kings in uw kaartpak\nDeel winst, eet wings, BX\nDit is Jazz, brak\n\n[Verse 3: Astrofisiks]\nYes\nDit is uit de goot gekropen, groeien tot gigantisch\nBuitensporig oefenen, tonen ze wie de man is\nZij zoeken naar hun woorden, ik schrijf tekst af op vakantie\nOf met raam open, rijdend, jas aan in de taxi\nDuwen nooit we slepen, sleep het alles in de wacht\nMet een team vol legendes, lever over de medailles\nSchrijven vrij verkozen al de rest die lijkt gevang\nZe spreken nie, ze roepen, zie ze rijmen te gemakkelijk\nNiet de grootste, maar de meest gepassioneerde\nIn een kleine klasse leven we\nHet schrijven, het spreken 't is tussen slijpen en wegen\nVerfijnde syntheses, we weten het\nIk schrijf naast de regels, te veel om te delen\nDeel de kunst in m'n kunnen en neem het aan als een houding\nDe geschiedenis leert het, anticipeer op en bouw het\nIk sukkel nie meer met proberen, maar begrijp waar het fout ging\nOp het punt van te lukken, ik voel de rush bij de goudwinst\n\n[Outro: Zwangere Guy]\nEy, Stikstof in de building sinds 2010 shit man\nShoutout naar Fat Windjacks, ge weet what the fuck is up\nSo naar Stap op de beat\n\nTrack 4: 32 Barz - Remix\n\n[Intro: Zwangere Guy & Freddie Konings]\nEn by the way, ik heb nog een klein cadeautje voor jullie mee\nJullie weten what the fuck is up\nMisschien is het zelf een groot cadeautje\nStikstof, Freddie en sewwes misschien nog een motherfucker\nLet's get it man, ja\nBig up S\nBig up Eu De Bruyne\nBig up Palace Chief, ey\n\n[Verse 1: Freddie Konings]\nYeah\nJe kan het

in G's\nVele mannen zingen Meesterplusser, maar zijn nog altijd op verlies\nVele mannen zingen Meesterplusser, zijn nog altijd op verlies\nVele mannen zingen Meesterplusser, zijn nog altijd op

ever be\nBut I'll be satisfied\nJust knowing you love me\n\n[Verse 3]\nOn the stage of life\nI've played a loser's part\nIt seems like I've been down\nRight from the very start\nEvery time I lift myself\nUp off the ground\nSomething always happens\nTo bring the curtain down\n\n[Chorus]\nBut when your love light shines upon my face\nI'm in a different world\nA world so warm and sweet\nI'm in a

of Lena's dress. He was startled by the dead pallor of her cheeks, by something lifeless in her eyes, which looked at him strangely, without recognition. But to his anxious inquiries she answered reassuringly that there was nothing the matter with her, really. She had felt giddy on rising. She had even had a moment of faintness, after her bath. She had to sit down to wait for it to pass. This had made her late dressing.\n\n\"I didn't try to do my hair. I didn't want to keep you waiting any longer,\" she said.\n\nHe was unwilling to press her with questions about her health, since she seemed to make light of this indisposition. She had not done her hair, but she had brushed it, and had tied it with a ribbon behind. With her forehead uncovered, she looked very young, almost a child, a careworn child; a child with something on its mind.\n\nWhat surprised Heyst was the non-appearance of Wang. The Chinaman had always materialized at the precise moment of his service, neither too soon nor too late. This time the usual miracle failed. What was the meaning of this?\n\nHeyst raised his voice\u2014a thing he disliked doing. It was promptly answered from the compound:\n\n\"Ada tuan!\"\nLena, leaning on her elbow, with her eyes on her plate, did not seem to hear anything. When Wang entered with a tray, his narrow eyes, tilted inward by the prominence of salient cheek-bones, kept her under stealthy observation all the time. Neither the one nor the other of that white couple paid the slightest attention to him and he withdrew without having heard them exchange a single word. He squatted on his heels on the back veranda. His Chinaman's mind, very clear but not far-reaching, was made up according to the plain reason of things, such as it appeared to him in the light of his simple feeling for self-preservation, untrammelled by any notions of romantic honour or tender conscience. His yellow hands, lightly clasped, hung idly between his knees. The graves of Wang's ancestors were far away, his parents were dead, his elder brother was a soldier in the yamen of some Mandarin away in Formosa. No one near by had a claim on his veneration or his obedience. He had been for years a labouring restless vagabond. His only tie in the world was the Alfuro woman, in exchange for whom he had given away some considerable part of his hard-earned substance; and his duty, in reason, could be to no one but himself.\n\nThe scuffle behind the curtain was a thing of bad augury for that Number One for whom the Chinaman had neither love nor dislike. He had been awed enough by that development to hang back with the coffee-pot till at last the white man was induced to call him in. Wang went in with curiosity. Certainly, the white woman looked as if she had been wrestling with a spirit which had managed to tear half her blood out of her before letting her go. As to the man, Wang had long looked upon him as being in some sort bewitched; and now he was doomed. He heard their voices in the room. Heyst was urging the girl to go and lie down again. He was extremely concerned. She had eaten nothing.\n\n\"The best thing for you. You really must!\"\n\nShe sat listless, shaking her head from time to time negatively, as if nothing could be any good. But he insisted; she saw the beginning of wonder in his eyes, and suddenly gave way.\n\n\"Perhaps I had better.\"\n\nShe did not want to arouse his wonder, which would lead him straight to suspicion. He must not suspect!\n\nAlready, with the consciousness of her love for this man, of that something rapturous and profound going beyond the mere embrace, there was born in her a woman's innate mistrust of masculinity, of that seductive strength allied to an absurd, delicate shrinking from the recognition of the naked necessity of facts, which never yet frightened a woman worthy of the name. She had no plan; but her mind, quieted down somewhat by the very effort to preserve outward composure for his sake, perceived that her behaviour had secured, at any rate, a short period of safety. Perhaps because of the similarity of their miserable origin in the dregs of mankind, she had understood Ricardo perfectly. He would keep quiet for a time now. In this momentarily soothing certitude her bodily fatigue asserted itself, the more overpoweringly since its cause was not so much the demand on her strength as the awful suddenness of the stress she had had to meet. She would have tried to overcome it from the mere instinct of resistance, if it had not been for Heyst's alternate pleadings and commands. Before this eminently masculine fussing she felt the woman's need to give way, the sweetness of surrender.\n\n\"I will do anything you like,\" she said.\n\nGetting up, she was surprised by a wave of languid weakness that came over her, embracing and enveloping her like warm water, with a noise in her ears as of a breaking sea.\n\n\"You must help me along,\" she added quickly.\n\nWhile he put his arm round her waist\u2014not by any means an uncommon thing for him to do\u2014she found a special satisfaction in the feeling of being thus sustained. She abandoned all her weight to that encircling and protecting pressure, while a thrill went through her at the sudden thought that it was she who would have to protect him, to be the defender of a man who was strong enough to lift her bodily, as he was doing even then in his two arms. For Heyst had done this as soon as they had crept through the doorway of the room. He thought it was quicker and simpler to carry her the last step or two. He had grown really too anxious to be aware of the effort. He lifted her high and deposited her on the bed, as one lays a child on its side in a cot. Then he sat down on the edge, masking his concern with a smile which obtained no response from the dreamy immobility of her eyes. But she sought his hand, seized it eagerly; and while she was pressing it with all the force of which she was capable, the sleep she needed overtook her suddenly, overwhelmingly, as it overtakes a child in a cot, with her lips parted for a safe, endearing word which she had thought of but had no time to utter.\n\nThe usual flaming silence brooded over Samburan.\n\n\"What in the world is this new mystery?\" murmured Heyst to himself, contemplating her deep slumber.\nIt was so deep, this enchanted sleep, that when some time afterwards he gently tried to open her fingers and free his hand, he succeeded without provoking the slightest stir.\n\n\"There is some very simple explanation, no doubt,\" he thought, as he stole out into the living-room.\n\nAbsent-mindedly he pulled a book out of the top shelf, and sat down with it; but even after he had opened it on his knee, and had been staring at the pages for a time, he had not the slightest idea of what it was about. He stared and stared at the crowded, parallel lines. It was only when, raising his eyes for no particular reason, he saw Wang standing motionless on the other side of the table, that he regained complete control of his faculties.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he said, as if suddenly reminded of a forgotten appointment of a not particularly welcome sort.\n\nHe waited a little, and then, with reluctant curiosity, forced himself to ask the silent Wang what he had to say. He had some idea that the matter of the vanished revolver would come up at last; but the guttural sounds which proceeded from the Chinaman did not refer to that delicate subject. His speech was concerned with cups, saucers, plates, forks, and knives. All these things had been put away in the cupboards on the back veranda, where they belonged, perfectly clean, \"all plopel.\" Heyst wondered at the scrupulosity of a man who was about to abandon him; for he was not surprised to hear Wang conclude the account of his stewardship with the words:\n\n\n\"I go now.\"\n\n\"Oh! You go now?\" said Heyst, leaning back, his book on his knees.\n\n\"Yes. Me no likee. One man, two man, three man\u2014no can do! Me go now.\"\n\n\"What's frightening you away like this?\" asked Heyst, while through his mind flashed the hope that something enlightening might come from that being so unlike himself, taking contact with the world with a simplicity and directness of which his own mind was not capable. \"Why?\" he went on. \"You are used to white men. You know them well.\"\n\n\"Yes. Me savee them,\" assented Wang inscrutably. \"Me savee plenty.\"\n\nAll that he really knew was his own mind. He had made it up to withdraw himself and the Alfuro woman from the uncertainties of the relations which were going to establish themselves between those white men. It was Pedro who had been the first cause of Wang's suspicion and fear. The Chinaman had seen wild men. He had penetrated, in the train of a Chinese pedlar, up one or two of the Bornean rivers into the country of the Dyaks. He had also been in the interior of Mindanao, where there are people who live in trees\u2014savages, no better than animals; but a hairy brute like Pedro, with his great fangs and ferocious growls, was altogether beyond his conception of anything that could be looked upon as human. The strong impression made on him by Pedro was the prime inducement which had led Wang to purloin the revolver. Reflection on the general situation, and on the insecurity of Number One, came later, after he had obtained possession of the revolver and of the box of cartridges out of the table drawer in the living-room.\n\n\"Oh, you savee plenty about white men,\" Heyst went on in a slightly bantering tone, after a moment of silent reflection in which he had confessed to himself that the recovery of the revolver was not to be thought of, either by persuasion or by some more forcible means. \"You speak in that fashion, but you are frightened of those white men over there.\"\n\n\"Me no flightened,\" protested Wang raucously, throwing up his head\u2014which gave to his throat a more strained, anxious appearance than ever. \"Me no likee,\" he added in a quieter tone. \"Me velly sick.\"\nHe put his hand over the region under the breast-bone.\n\n\"That,\" said Heyst, serenely positive, \"belong one piecee lie. That isn't proper man-talk at all. And after stealing my revolver, too!\"\n\nHe had suddenly decided to speak about it, because this frankness could not make the situation much worse than it was. He did not suppose for a moment that Wang had the revolver anywhere about his person; and after having thought the matter over, he had arrived at the conclusion that the Chinaman never meant to use the weapon against him. After a slight start, because the direct charge had taken him unawares, Wang tore open the front of his jacket with a convulsive show of indignation.\n\n\"No hab got. Look see!\" he mouthed in pretended anger.\n\nHe slapped his bare chest violently; he uncovered his very ribs, all astir with the panting of outraged virtue; his smooth stomach heaved with indignation. He started his wide blue breeches flapping about his yellow calves. Heyst watched him quietly.\n\n\"I never said you had it on you,\" he observed, without raising his voice; \"but the revolver is gone from where I kept it.\"\n\n\"Me no savee levolvel,\" Wang said obstinately.\n\nThe book lying open on Heyst's knee slipped suddenly and he made a sharp movement to catch it up. Wang was unable to see the reason of this because of the table, and leaped away from what seemed to him a threatening symptom. When Heyst looked up, the Chinaman was already at the door facing the room, not frightened, but alert.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Heyst.\n\nWang nodded his shaven head significantly at the curtain closing the doorway of the bedroom.\n\n\"Me no likee,\" he repeated.\n\n\"What the devil do you mean?\" Heyst was genuinely amazed. \"Don't like what?\"\n\nWang pointed a long lemon-coloured finger at the motionless folds.\n\n\"Two,\" he said.\n\n\"Two what? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Suppose you savee, you no like that fashion. Me savee plenty. Me go now.\"\n\nHeyst had risen from his chair, but Wang kept his ground in the doorway for a little longer. His almond-shaped eyes imparted to his face an expression of soft and sentimental melancholy. The muscles of his throat moved visibly while he uttered a distinct and guttural \"Goodbye\" and vanished from Number One's sight.\n\nThe Chinaman's departure altered the situation. Heyst reflected on what would be best to do in view of that fact. For a long time he hesitated; then, shrugging his shoulders wearily, he walked out on the veranda, down the steps, and continued at a steady gait, with a thoughtful mien, in the direction of his guests' bungalow. He wanted to make an important communication to them, and he had no other object\u2014least of all to give them the shock of a surprise call. Nevertheless, their brutish henchman not being on watch, it was Heyst's fate to startle Mr. Jones and his secretary by his sudden appearance in the doorway. Their conversation must have been very interesting to prevent them from hearing the visitor's approach. In the dim room\u2014the shutters were kept constantly closed against the heat\u2014Heyst saw them start apart. It was Mr. Jones who spoke:\n\n\"Ah, here you are again! Come in, come in!\"\n\nHeyst, taking his hat off in the doorway, entered the room.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1516090", "artist_names": "Frank Sinatra", "full_title": "My Way Of Life by\u00a0Frank\u00a0Sinatra", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/da9e505e2b2c807d28e363b9fdf9ff05.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/da9e505e2b2c807d28e363b9fdf9ff05.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1516090, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429893775, "path": "/Frank-sinatra-my-way-of-life-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Frank-sinatra-my-way-of-life-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1968, "month": 11, "day": 12}, "release_date_for_display": "November 12, 1968", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Nov. 12, 1968", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/da9e505e2b2c807d28e363b9fdf9ff05.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/da9e505e2b2c807d28e363b9fdf9ff05.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "My Way Of Life", "title_with_featured": "My Way Of Life", "updated_by_human_at": 1664711738, "url": "https://genius.com/Frank-sinatra-my-way-of-life-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/824", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/10ddb50540e37c16b9f320ca4991a1fb.369x136x1.jpg", "id": 824, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5f746dbf6c41747811e11452bfabb552.490x490x1.jpg", "index_character": "f", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Frank Sinatra", "slug": "Frank-sinatra", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Frank-sinatra"}, "artist": "Frank Sinatra", "lyrics": "My Way Of Life LyricsGotta have you near all the time, with your dreams wrapped up in mine\nGotta be a part of your soul and your heart all the time\nNothing in the world that I do means a thing without you\nI'm just half alive in my struggle to survive without you\nYou are my way of life, the only way I know, you are my way of life\nI'll never let you go, never let you out of my sight, be it day, be it night\nYou belong to me, that's the way it will, be wrong or right\nI don't need crowds at my door, the applause from the floor\nAll I need is you and the love we once knew, nothing more\nYou are my way of life, the only way I know, make me your way of lifeYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/980437", "artist_names": "William Bell (Ft.

Only a little while back, when I was riding and suffering, what a heaven this peace, this rest, this sweet serenity in this secluded shady nook by this purling stream would have seemed, where I could keep perfectly comfortable all the time by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then; yet already I was getting dissatisfied; partly because I could not light my pipe\u2014for, although I had long ago started a match factory, I had forgotten to bring matches with me\u2014and partly because we had nothing to eat. Here was another illustration of the childlike improvidence of this age and people. A man in armor always trusted to chance for his food on a journey, and would have been scandalized at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear. There was probably not a knight of all the Round Table combination who would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing as that on his flagstaff. And yet there could not be anything more sensible. It had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches into my helmet, but I was interrupted in the act, and had to make an excuse and lay them aside, and a dog got them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Night approached, and with it a storm. The darkness came on fast. We must camp, of course. I found a good shelter for the demoiselle under a rock, and went off and found another for myself. But I was obliged to remain in my armor, because I could not get it off by myself and yet could not allow Alisande to help, because it would have seemed so like undressing before folk. It would not have amounted to that in reality, because I had clothes on underneath; but the prejudices of one's breeding are not gotten rid of just at a jump, and I knew that when it came to stripping off that bob-tailed iron petticoat I should be embarrassed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the storm came a change of weather; and the stronger the wind blew, and the wilder the rain lashed around, the colder and colder it got. Pretty soon, various kinds of bugs and ants and worms and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside my armor to get warm; and while some of them behaved well enough, and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet, the majority were of a restless, uncomfortable sort, and never stayed still, but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what; especially the ants, which went tickling along in wearisome procession from one end of me to the other by the hour, and are a kind of creatures which I never wish to sleep with again. It would be my advice to persons situated in this way, to not roll or thrash around, because this excites the interest of all the different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want to turn out and see what is going on, and this makes things worse than they were before, and of course makes you objurgate harder, too, if you can. Still, if one did not roll and thrash around he would die; so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other; there is no real choice. Even after I was frozen solid I could still distinguish that tickling, just as a corpse does when he is taking electric treatment. I said I would never wear armor after this trip.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All those trying hours whilst I was frozen and yet was in a living fire, as you may say, on account of that swarm of crawlers, that same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my tired head: How do people stand this miserable armor? How have they managed to stand it all these generations? How can they sleep at night for dreading the tortures of next day?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the morning came at last, I was in a bad enough plight: seedy, drowsy, fagged, from want of sleep; weary from thrashing around, famished from long fasting; pining for a bath, and to get rid of the animals; and crippled with rheumatism. And how had it fared with the nobly born, the titled aristocrat, the Demoiselle Alisande la Carteloise? Why, she was as fresh as a squirrel; she had slept like the dead; and as for a bath, probably neither she nor any other noble in the land had ever had one, and so she was not missing it. Measured by modern standards, they were merely modified savages, those people. This noble lady showed no impatience to get to breakfast\u2014and that smacks of the savage, too. On their journeys those Britons were used to long fasts, and knew how to bear them; and also how to freight up against probable fasts before starting, after the style of the Indian and the anaconda. As like as not, Sandy was loaded for a three-day stretch.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were off before sunrise, Sandy riding and I limping along behind. In half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded as a road. They were as humble as animals to me; and when I proposed to breakfast with them, they were so flattered, so overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that at first they were not able to believe that I was in earnest. My lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side; she said in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the other cattle\u2014a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely because it referred to them, and not because it insulted or offended them, for it didn't. And yet they were not slaves, not chattels. By a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen. Seven-tenths of the free population of the country were of just their class and degree: small \"independent\" farmers, artisans, etc.; which is to say, they were the nation, the actual Nation; they were about all of it that was useful, or worth saving, or really respect-worthy, and to subtract them would have been to subtract the Nation and leave behind some dregs, some refuse, in the shape of a king, nobility and gentry, idle, unproductive, acquainted mainly with the arts of wasting and destroying, and of no sort of use or value in any rationally constructed world.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, by ingenious contrivance, this gilded minority, instead of being in the tail of the procession where it belonged, was marching head up and banners flying, at the other end of it; had elected itself to be the Nation, and these innumerable clams had permitted it so long that they had come at last to accept it as a truth; and not only that, but to believe it right and as it should be. The priests had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state of things was ordained of God; and so, not reflecting upon how unlike God it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms, and especially such poor transparent ones as this, they had dropped the matter there and become respectfully quiet.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in a formerly American ear. They were freemen, but they could not leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his permission; they could not prepare their own bread, but must have their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his bakery, and pay roundly for the same; they could not sell a piece of their own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the proceeds, nor buy a piece of somebody else's without remembering him in cash for the privilege; they had to harvest his grain for him gratis, and be ready to come at a moment's notice, leaving their own crop to destruction by the threatened storm; they had to let him plant fruit trees in their fields, and then keep their indignation to themselves when his heedless fruit-gatherers trampled the grain around the trees; they had to smother their anger when his hunting parties galloped through their fields laying waste the result of their patient toil; they were not allowed to keep doves themselves, and when the swarms from my lord's dovecote settled on their crops they must not lose their temper and kill a bird, for awful would the penalty be; when the harvest was at last gathered, then came the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it: first the Church carted off its fat tenth, then the king's commissioner took his twentieth, then my lord's people made a mighty inroad upon the remainder; after which, the skinned freeman had liberty to bestow the remnant in his barn, in case it was worth the trouble; there were taxes, and taxes, and taxes, and more taxes, and taxes again, and yet other taxes\u2014upon this free and independent pauper, but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop, none upon the wasteful nobility or the all-devouring Church; if the baron would sleep unvexed, the freeman must sit up all night after his day's work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet; if the freeman's daughter\u2014but no, that last infamy of monarchical government is unprintable; and finally, if the freeman, grown desperate with his tortures, found his life unendurable under such conditions, and sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge, the gentle Church condemned him to eternal fire, the gentle law buried him at midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through his back, and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work on their lord the bishop's road three days each\u2014gratis; every head of a family, and every son of a family, three days each, gratis, and a day or so added for their servants. Why, it was like reading about France and the French, before the ever memorable and blessed Revolution, which swept a thousand years of such villany away in one swift tidal-wave of blood\u2014one: a settlement of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell. There were two \"Reigns of Terror,\" if we would but remember it and consider it; the one wrought murder in hot passion, the other in heartless cold blood; the one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our shudders are all for the \"horrors\" of the minor Terror, the momentary Terror, so to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe, compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty, and heart-break? What is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake? A city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all France could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror\u2014that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast and their talk with me, were as full of humble reverence for their king and Church and nobility as their worst enemy could desire. There was something pitifully ludicrous about it. I asked them if they supposed a nation of people ever existed, who, with a free vote in every man's hand, would elect that a single family and its descendants should reign over it forever, whether gifted or boobies, to the exclusion of all other families\u2014including the voter's; and would also elect that a certain hundred families should be raised to dizzy summits of rank, and clothed on with offensive transmissible glories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the nation's families\u2014including his own .\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They all looked unhit, and said they didn't know; that they had never thought about it before, and it hadn't ever occurred to them that a nation could be so situated that every man could have a say in the government. I said I had seen one\u2014and that it would last until it had an Established Church. Again they were all unhit\u2014at first. But presently one man looked up and asked me to state that proposition again; and state it slowly, so it could soak into his understanding. I did it; and after a little he had the idea, and he brought his fist down and said he didn't believe a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down in the mud and dirt in any such way; and that to steal from a nation its will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes. I said to myself:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This one's a man. If I were backed by enough of his sort, I would make a strike for the welfare of this country, and try to prove myself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change in its system of government.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one's country, not to its institutions or its office-holders. The country is the real thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing to watch over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions are extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body from winter, disease, and death. To be loyal to rags, to shout for rags, to worship rags, to die for rags\u2014that is a loyalty of unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs to monarchy, was invented by monarchy; let monarchy keep it. I was from Connecticut, whose Constitution declares \"that all political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit; and that they have at all times an undeniable and indefeasible right to alter their form of government in such a manner as they may think expedient.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under that gospel, the citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealth's political clothes are worn out, and yet holds his peace and does not agitate for a new suit, is disloyal; he is a traitor. That he may be the only one who thinks he sees this decay, does not excuse him; it is his duty to agitate anyway, and it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see the matter as he does.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now here I was, in a country where a right to say how the country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each thousand of its population. For the nine hundred and ninety-four to express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and propose to change it, would have made the whole six shudder as one man, it would have been so disloyal, so dishonorable, such putrid black treason. So to speak, I was become a stockholder in a corporation where nine hundred and ninety-four of the members furnished all the money and did all the work, and the other six elected themselves a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends. It seemed to me that what the nine hundred and ninety-four dupes needed was a new deal. The thing that would have best suited the circus side of my nature would have been to resign the Boss-ship and get up an insurrection and turn it into a revolution; but I knew that the Jack Cade or the Wat Tyler who tries such a thing without first educating his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutely certain to get left. I had never been accustomed to getting left, even if I do say it myself. Wherefore, the \"deal\" which had been for some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite different pattern from the Cade-Tyler sort.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So I did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat munching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of human sheep, but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him. After I had finished, I got him to lend me a little ink from his veins; and with this and a sliver I wrote on a piece of bark\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Put him in the Man-factory\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and gave it to him, and said:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Take it to the palace at\nCamelot and give it into the hands of Amyas le Poulet, whom I call Clarence, and he will understand.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He is a priest, then,\" said the man, and some of the enthusiasm went out of his face.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How\u2014a priest? Didn't I tell you that no chattel of the Church, no bond-slave of pope or bishop can enter my Man-Factory? Didn't I tell you that you couldn't enter unless your religion, whatever it might be, was your own free property?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Marry, it is so, and for that I was glad; wherefore it liked me not, and bred in me a cold doubt, to hear of this priest being there.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But he isn't a priest, I tell you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The man looked far from satisfied. He said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He is not a priest, and yet can read?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He is not a priest and yet can read\u2014yes, and write, too, for that matter. I taught him myself.\" The man's face cleared. \"And it is the first thing that you yourself will be taught in that Factory\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I? I would give blood out of my heart to know that art. Why, I will be your slave, your\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No you won't, you won't be anybody's slave. Take your family and go along. Your lord the bishop will confiscate your small property, but no matter. Clarence will fix you all right.\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/226027", "artist_names": "Neil Diamond", "full_title": "Two-Bit Manchild

That's nice to be given advice when I paint it\nHave twice much the fame, and\nI can't even comprehend that much in the future\nHatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor\nEnter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder\nStealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter\nProcrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer\nNo willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser\n\n[Verse 4]\nSittin' alone at 3 AM\nChillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend\nMan, this shit is too wild, I \"must behave, Ben\"\nThat's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when\nI'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence\nAccomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?\n-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me\nLuckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me\nI hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it\nI hope that one day, you'll see we made it\nNo, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it\nI'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest\nThat is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'\nI'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'\nI'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside\nGuessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind\n[Hook 1]\nAnd I'm in time\n-Workin' all my life, get that in line\nI'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out\nNobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline\nI'm on the incline, I'm on the incline\nStay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine\nI'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline\nNobody can really understand how my shit climb\n\n[Verse 5]\nHave I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet\nI'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead\nI stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous\nWho is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?\nWhy the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do\nI don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, \"Bye\", to you\nHey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do\nYou have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue\nYou gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset\nSet headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead\nI guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed\nImpressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said\nBut I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song\nDo right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron\nYou try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes\nSome straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline\n\n[Interlude 1]\nWater break\nI got a lot to say\nIt's been eleven minutes so far\nActually, it hasn't, it's been shorter\n\n[Verse 6]\nHow can\nI have a believable meaning\nWhen all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury\nNobody seen it or  greet it?\nBut what if it's different? I mean, it's all seeming to be\nAnd it's in inconceivable dreaming\nI know it's so unbelievable, being\nStuck in this rare unachievable feeling\nThey givin' me something, I ended up leaving\nThey givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'\nNo positive side, ended up seeing\nWhat life could be like from a  different lead in\nThank God for a cover zone\nSo I know when and where to cross it\nAll over the place\nI'm surprised I haven't lost it\n\n[Hook 2]\nYeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh\nLivin' to the max now\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down\nGo till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out\nAfter, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out\nBut I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout\n\n[Verse 7]\nOkay, it's time to go fast\nSo sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it\nAbout time, but maybe you're mad I said it\nYou gon' pay attention, cash or credit?\nI have to let it go back a second\nI have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit\nNow we're back in the middle of the track and fed it\nMix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it\nWe moved on, walked past the exit\nWant you to come back and pass a message\n-Never pack bags and trash, you left it\nKinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it\nMoney, never am glad I spent it\nIf I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it\nIf you ever feel bad or sad, accept it\nThink back to the track and the rap that Ben did\nYeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it\nIf this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus\nI'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this\nVoice is more powerful than a million instruments\nSuddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else\nPeople want me to grow because of you\nBut I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better\nThan the people that never had trust in me\nYeah, uh\n\n[Hook 3]\nAnd I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah\nLivin' to the max now, uh\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds\n\n[Verse 8]\nSpeak up, and they're messing with the track now\nPeople are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short\nLooking back at you when you're missing all the cash now\nAnd I'm mad at the fact that\nI'm not in my right mind\nMeant to be a half-decent rapper\nBut I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time\nLookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find\nLookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime\nI find so much life\nI wonder why I can't just find mine\nGot so many confusing questions\nSo much knowledge, I can't use the lessons\nI'm emerging out with a new profession\nI'ma do the best with my new perfection\nAnd I'm doin' it\nI'm moving onto this future shit\nThese hooligans are complete fools in that\nThey just don't understand that I am through with it\nImprovin' it, I'm improvin' it\nI got my brain, and I'm usin' it\nAnd I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin'\nAnd makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits\nYou're clueless\nNinety percent of y'all ignorant\nKeeping your minds oh-so limited\nGet off your high horse, because it is time to figure it out\nSeeming so close, I can picture it now\nSuccess in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now\nEnvisioning deeper ambitions, and now\nI'ma get to it, that is what living's about\n\n[Interlude 2]\nUh, God!\nUh\nMy voice is gone already, shit\nAlright, ayy, ayy, ayy\n\n[Verse 9]\nThink I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches\nAdolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us\nMakin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die\nMakin' you hang your head low, but say, \"Reach for the skies\"\nLife is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies\nI'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes\nI feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry\nWith all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try\nYeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply\nTryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry\nFuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, \"Why?\"\nSo I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh\nLike, oh well, I can say that I tried\nHopped into life and then I stayed for the ride\nSo many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside\nAnd I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn\nThis reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.\u200b\nI'm screamin', \"Hi\" to the sky up with a smile on my face\nNow I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace\nAll of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place\nSwept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace\nAnd now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet\nI used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic\nRecently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it\nSee my friends from kindergarten go to rehab\nThat's the type of shit that makes you think back\nTo simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds\nBefore reality could ground us, we would live in the skies\nAnd as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)\nMan, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist\nI felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist\nAnd now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit\nYou only look at what you got once you see that it's lost\nAnd life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce\nDon't understand rappers braggin', \"I got that paper on me\"\nMan, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me\nSo what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?\nTo me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money\nRain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study\nAnd write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn\nLike Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize\nThese Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's\nThis is a natural high\nI see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies\nI wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried\nThey say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie\nThey think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid\nAs DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive\nThrew out half of my album, it wasn't good enough\nShit, I mean it still isn't good enough\nI'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt\nBut I guess I am not full enough, damn\nI swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel\nMan, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal\nMan, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real\nThirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel\nYeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement\nYeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent\nEvery day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest\nAnd if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted\nMost of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me\nSo when I die, I know I left us with something to leave\nSo when I wake up in the morning with something to see\nYeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be\n\n[Verse 10]\nBenny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said\nIf you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-\nMany want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant\nGot iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence\nYeah, I know I'm way too cocky\nBut I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out\nSo when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better\nThat's benefit of the doubt\nI've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom\nIt's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often\nAnd I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around\nAlways stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-\nYeah, this is freedom of speech\nTryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace\nSacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree\nOpportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-\nNah, I'm just tryna find some clarity\nApparently, it all has to do with popularity\nThere will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to\nWhat is carefully being prepared to me\nSometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity\nI'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least\n\n[Verse 11]\nGiving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see\nEveryone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy\n'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case\nShot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass\nOff of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say\nAnd at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say\nSo let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages\nSeeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand\nThat I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest\nEntertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in\n\n[Verse 12]\n-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize\nStart an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try\nThat's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'\nWith the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon\nBut I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'\nLimited ability with little humility\nBut whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me\nI'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history\nTryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me\nTryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg\nYou beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me\nShowin' up on your device, control/option/delete\nConsider myself elite, measure myself in retweets\nI be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me\nInstead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout\nI'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house\nTryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch\nI'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out\nInto reality, in normality actually happily\nFound myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?\n'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing\nNothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing\nNot complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it\nLove sleepin' and just usin' the internet\nBut my time is limited, and I better figure this\nBefore I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips\nAnd let me just tell you what I have came to do\nTryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to\nTryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo\nAnd say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through\nAnd if a major record label is looking at me\nI'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats\nI can rap fast, and rap slow\nI may make mistakes but everyone, has, so\nI'm like MJ back when he had the afro\nAlso, I'm not black, so... maybe not\nBut before everyone gets angry, stop\nI'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block\nAll the people who keep on going crazy off\n'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got\nA lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker\nWith some dominant teachers\nI deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers\nI'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager\nThey be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it\nTo know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid\nSo when you're nearin' this, please let me know\nWhen I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go\nHear the metronome combined in the compilation\nTo unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation\nBut that is just a dream, and probably a combination\nOf a big ego and false encouragement on the way in\nBut when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game\nI was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name\nBut when you think about it, it is all insane\nWhat can be created from chemicals in this brain\nBut when you look at me, you lackin' respect\nWhen I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest\nHas in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step\nUntil I'm on the same stage, and you have it again\nBut, but when you think about the hall-of-fame\nYou think about how people used to sit and call you names\nAnd you check and wonder if it will be all the same\nStep back into reality, it all remains, damn\n\n[Interlude 3]\nAlright, I just spilled water on my computer right now\nOn my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit\nHold on, uh\nGoddamn it\n\n[Verse 13]\nMy lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean\nThis is off the top, I don't need to use no machines\nHold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever\nBut I am very clever, okay, okay\nI'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too\nThese are some shit' that you can drink to\nBut drink water unless you're of age\nYou know what I'm sayin'? Ayy\n\n[Interlude 4]\nOkay, okay\nUh\nUh\nAyy\n\n[Verse 14]\nI feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous\n-Most of humanity's made of idiots\nI barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?\nYou think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?\nPlease... what I do is barely poetry\nThere's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me\nBut still consider me confident\nStill consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness\nBut honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably\nIt is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling\nInto awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'\nIt's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening\nIt's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake\nI close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away\nYeah, we're just tryna find that great escape\nTo get away from how we're living life day-to-day\nSome people find it in a drink or in a cup\nOr in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love\nBut all I know is that it's tough\nAnd all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much\n\n[Verse 15]\nI'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?\nThese kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players\nThat shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low\nGot amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show\nWhat I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype\nAnd I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life\n-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights\nAhead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night\n-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass\n-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast\nRemember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it\nAnd say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected\nTake a deep breath, 'cause I need that\nMost of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast\nMy bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors\nYou want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards\nSay that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this\nI'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit\nTryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day\n'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?\nI'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go\nI'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own\nI'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit\nReason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch\nMeaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it\nPleasin' these liars, they've peaked, and so now they're recedin' agreein' to be a live without leading it\nFlow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break\nWe all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day\n'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it\nYou know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments\nAll of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em\nStart a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it\nBreaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it\nI know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'\nUnder the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'\nI found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it\nI try to go slow, but it don't work\n-Gettin' better, and that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure\nYou're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners\nThis is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre\nHah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough\nForgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up\nMy chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us\nAnd so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up\n-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back\nRemember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that\nHit me up when you're done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming\nListen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding\nWe run, grinding, you know we do, we got the shit that we're goin' through\nThese lyrics go over you, you  don't listen, so you don't know it's true\n'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred\nShoutout to Didac and Momo and the others\nShit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family\nShoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me\nYeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh\nBetter trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack\nStarted off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me\nIn the past, I never anticipated what there would be\nAnd see ya, so long now, off to the end of the song now\nSee ya next at five-hundred and a million, it's on now\n\n[Interlude 5]\nIt's on now\nOh shit, I'm almost out of water\nThis is a hard- this a- real challenge\nThis like, physically difficult, ayy\n\n[Hook 4]\nWhen I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra\nNow everybody telling me I don't perform enough\nMy math teacher told me that I'd never be shit\nAnd now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula\nI got the formula, I got the formula\nYou got the sauce, but goddamn, I got the formula, ayy\nPeople always asking Ben, \"Why you record so much?\"\nI got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up\n\n[Verse 16]\nFormula, like I'm Mr. Krabs\nI change and transform it up, you stuck in the past\nYeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab\nUh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag\nAnd now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'\nPeople love to criticize me for the life I've had\nThey make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'\nI make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy\nUh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie\nAnd I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami\nWanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'\nTryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies\nAyy, still saying, \"Who would'a thought?\", like, who would'a guessed it?\nHaven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing\nIf you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:\nWant the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook\n\n[Verse 17]\nAyy, they doubt a fucker with a dream\nLooking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah\nLooking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens\nSerpent's told you, \"No,\" and it's like nothing's as it seems\nGod damn, I guess I really thought he was the man\nI guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham\nAll that cash he stocked was from a scam\nAll the views he got was from some spam\nI've been living like, \"Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?\nWhy ain't he just sticking to the plan?\nHow has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?\"\nI don't get it, I don't really understand\nI've been living like, \"Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram\nI'll do better if I study my exams, do I really wanna stand\nNext to all these average fucking sad duds?\"\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\n\n[Hook 5]\nYeah\nHate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\nAyy\nJust because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup\nUh, uh, uh\nFeel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones\nAnd so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he\n\n[Verse 18]\n'Cause he been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine\nI've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap\nThat shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now\nI'm making a- minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I'm needin' to figure this out\nHow did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday\nAnd I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away\nBut I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one\n\n[Verse 19]\nBy now, if you're still watching this shit\nYou are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit\nBut we ain't over, we ain't done, though\nAm I takin' a break? Are you dumb, bro?\nWell, we nearin' 10K, but I still need 30K\nWhile all you sit around, I would rather work than play\nLyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae\nHit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates\n\n[Interlude 6]\nThat was actually a pretty good bar\nI just wrote that like, right- a second ago, before I recorded this\nAyy, ayy\nYou know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh\n\n[Hook 6]\nSometimes, I don't know what to think\nSometimes, I don't know what'll\nMake it okay, make it okay\nI'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy\n\n[Verse 20]\nUh, I wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering\nAll these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen\nAll accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence\nOften is the result of falling under consciousness\nYou'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives\nYou're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie\nAnd I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty\nFearing that, one day ,you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me\nNo, will I tell you? No, never- I think I'm so clever\nBut in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better\nBut I don't ever\nWant to go to show, just one mo' letter\nI'm a go-getter, I go get A's and get grades\nAnd get A's, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid\nUh... my life is so unusual\nTo most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable\nCan't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral\nI'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero\nUh, but you know that I'm capable\nYou know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available\nFeeling so unique and I think it's not explainable\nNo one hears my lyrics, and says, \"OMG, relatable!\"\nNo, that's not what I'm here to give\nBeen waiting years for this, you're about to experience\nSomething that I've spent time, money and thought on\nLearned about all the times money had thought wrong\nKinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long\nI ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot\n-Out on the inside, see me on the outside\nAlways think I'm positive, and never see the downsides\nIt's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it\nGet your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it\n\n[Interlude 7]\nOkay\nOkay, okay, we're like thirty minutes in\nThirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro\nFuck\n\n[Verse 21]\nYeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware\nI'm like the 'e' that equals all other emcees squared\nI'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs\nBut y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared\nI got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it\nShoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip\nMan, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders\nIt's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip\nDamn, I got a crazy ass work ethic\nBlocked out south east and west, leave in one direction\nI finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it\nFuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection\nWe all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons\nLike a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'\nWanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly\nAnd I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar\nCan't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'\nYeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person\nI base my motivation on my favorite angels words a-\n-bout how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain\n\n[Verse 22]\nYou keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high\nWanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy\nCan't deny I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize\nHow it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize\nAnd analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed\nAnd take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise\nAmerica is very nice, but I'd like to see the world\nBut I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl\n\n[Verse 23]\nIn a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends\nCrazy Ben is just chillin' with them women, you know they be tens\nThey be tens or more, they be tens or more\nI like to talk to all these people 'cause they marvel at my metaphors\nIt's free speech, I can say what I want\nBut these listenin' are tryna make me pay for my talk\nThey don't like what I'm doin', they don't appreciate the banter\nI get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh\nMotherfucker, I'ma live for the right time\nFuck that, I'ma live for the moment\nSitting here in the middle of the night time\nMy mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin'\nDamn, I've been livin' in a headache\nBitches never listenin', they saying that they ready\nBut I can never believe them\nGot these goals and they can never achieve 'em\nHow can your dreams come true if you ain't willin' to dream 'em?\nDamn, that's a lot of shit to think about\nSuddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering\nWhat I'm doin', next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out\nMade some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh\nGot these dreams that I'm livin' out\nIn my mind's eye, givin' out lots of songs with responses\nThat I never pictured, wow, damn, damn\nThis beat's way too holy to rap over\nMental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower\nYour raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance\nLike a printer without toner, y'all fillin' pages that have nothin'\nOoh, but I have got somethin' to tell you\nI ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you\nSpeakin' from late nights, I'm thinkin' of Drake's life\nWatching these interviews, thinkin' one day I might\nBe on that stage right beside all these players\nShit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers\nI'll prove it in music I use to influence\nI do this way harder than people assumin'\nResumin' my writin', viewin' this lightin'\nThat puts me to be in the view of the hidin'\nI do what they're likin', but that makes 'em hate me\nNo matter what I do, they just mistake the\nReason I'm flowin', the reason I start up\nNot just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks\nAnd- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place\nMost to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste\nI'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh\nI just need a home run, I already loaded bases\nI have got so many cases\nBeen visiting, living in so many places\nExperiences that I made me to Emmy\nBen, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me\nBe me, I ain't greedy or needy\nBelieve me, I just want to be on your TV\nGet on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase\nDamn, yeah, I've been looking at their space\nAnd, one day, I'll be there\nI know what I'm doin', I'm already prepared\n\n[Verse 24]\nI've been waiting like thirty-thousand years\nTryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear\nI'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career\nI'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here\nNow I earned it, and I'm here to stay\nI'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play\nNot even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame\nNot really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day\nI don't know- I look at the future nostalgically\nI'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me\nUndoubtably know how to be what I am about to be\nTo say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me\n\n[Verse 25]\nRecently, I have been feeling alienated\nMy songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em\nBut, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different\nHate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it\n\n[Verse 26]\nPeople say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen\nAll will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene\nY'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty\nPromise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?\nTrapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages\nWhen I would rap on the stages, and now, I laugh at those days, and\nI'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song\nMove along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns\nWho could bomb this whole place up with one great lung?\nOne great tongue, I am that one great one\nOn vacation, I vacate to a location\nFar away from where people just may run\nA light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun\nOh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young\nI can murder this beat with no gun, go run\nI've too many problems to handle, here, hold one\nI just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks\nAnd now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk\nWas a great song, catchy at first, but that radio station\nPlaying it, making it just get to the worst\nMy head's gonna burst if I hear it again, and I'm sure\nI'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth\nAnd now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it\nNow the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah\n\n[Verse 27]\nGood rappers never get to see the light of day\nBut when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away\nI'll obey... nah, whatever, man, what is this?\nI'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business\nNobody witness anything better than when I am showing you this shit\nKnow I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, \"Oh, this kid is big\"\nKnow how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen\nTill I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah\nAnd when I'm, uh... I'm telling y'all that I got a story\nGod ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory\nNot visually, typically, the original me\nSo unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally\nDamn, that was fast, felt so jammed till I unpacked\nAnd I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track\nAnd I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real\nWhenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel\nSo different, and I'm loving it, time to change and discover it\nTime to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it\nI always talk to them other kids, them other kids couldn't understand me\nOne path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B\n\n[Interlude 9]\nI wrote that one a long time ago\nThat was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again\nBut you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty\nI- actually... classic!\n\n[Verse 28]\nWe just living in the solar system\nOne big world here to hold the wisdom\nOne big jail to control the victims\nWe're all here, tryna find a soul in rhythm\nA voice in writing and a choice deciding\nWhether or not to follow what the boys are likin'\nWhat the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to\nThink about who you are, and it's so true\nThink about the people who you think have really known you\nDo they really know you? Do you even know you?\nDamn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet\nSometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be\nAnd lately, it seems to make the extremes\nSo prominent and dominant in making big dreams\nI'm seeing aliens scream\nWhen I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing\nBut I'm just tryna make it in life\nFuck you to people who be saying it like\nI ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike\nI'm chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite\nThe fact that I'm young and little bit nerdy\nAnd I know a lot of people would consider me early\nI'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches\nTryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens\nI'm just me, no, I ain't a victim to hurting\nI just see all the people living and burning\nSo be free, time to be a little bit nervous\nIt don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing\nAnd I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it\nGuessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid\nSo I'll see ya 'round, underachievers\nHop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man\n\n[Hook 8]\nSo basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me\nI'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z\nAnd, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three\nBut now, what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?\n\n[Verse 29]\nI've been see' 'ple- misusing their fans, like crooks\nManipulating their audience to catch that hook\nThey'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-\nYou can feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha\nBut no shots fired, though\nNothing wrong with a little bit of lying though\nI mean... look at Fox News\nThat's the whole premise of their entire show\nBut no political shit, I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist\nMakin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits\nI got a lot of digital prints, man, your own homedog is a literal bitch\nBut I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable, 'cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids\nI got time! Maybe a little too much of it\nBut you know that I'm tryna move up a bit\nPeople look at me and say my potential has\nGot a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it\nSo fire, can't handle me with oven mitts\nUnderground, blessed if you discovered it\nFlow is so unique, I got so much to do\nNot like any other kid\n\n[Hook 9]\nAyy, yo, what you say, though?\nYeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though\nYeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low\nYou know I'm comin' to them checks like Usain Bolt\n\n[Verse 30]\nWait so, inhale the fumes while I paint this\nPicture: me, I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious\nTryna make my moves while they huge and they famous\nI knew this shit I couldn't do, I was jaded\nNow, somehow, I'm next up, yeah, I'm blessed up\nNow I wake up and I'm fly, I don't dress up\nNow I'm fly and my opponents better catch up\nI get my checks, uh, all y'all need to step up\nI-I-I-I-I-I- remember tryna practice my cadence\nIn tracks I was makin', I had to be patient\nEverybody said that shit was trash, and they were right\nBut I turned that shit and made a right, shit is day and night\nNow I gotta take a flight to Vegas, might not stay the night\nEverybody see me eatin', now they wanna take a bite\nSo I'm like, \"Okay... no way\"\nYeah, when it comes to this shit, man, I don't play\nI'm like Houdini in my Ghost, you can't see me, I'm gone\nBall so hard, I gotta wear my Yeezys to prom\nYouTube bitches asking me to retweet they song\nI'm the reason people got Spotify Premium on\n\n[Hook 9]\nLike, ayy, yo, what you say, though?\nYeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though\nYeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low\nYou know I'm runnin' to them checks like Usain Bolt\n\n[Verse 31]\nSo I'm like okay, nah, no way\nWhen it comes to that shit, man, I don't play\nIf you ask me how I got it I will say\nI got the drive, yeah, really get out of the roadway, uh\n\n[Interlude 8]\nDamn\nSome of these\nAre too slow and also too fast\nWhatever\n\n[Verse 31]\nI'm out of order, three hoes like I'm Santa Claus\nPull up on your bitch, Bape hoodie with a camouflage\nHey now, yo, what's the play now?\nI'm tryna slide, I ain't talkin' 'bout a playground\nYeah, I remember all them days I would stay down\n20K's chillin' in my PayPal\nSo what the fuck you wanna say- you wanna say now?

I guess I missed your plan\nMe, I'm just searchin' for that truest shit, where is it, man?\nI'll never know, just wanted you to help me understand\nI need some closure because, truthfully, I give a damn, I give a damn\nPlenty of fish in the sea, but see, I ain't no fisherman\nSee, I'm a middleman, a businessman, and this means business, man\nDiggin' in the sand, lookin for a reason, I'm not kiddin', man\n\n[Verse 32]\nHow am I gonna let all of this get to me?\nBeen a few months since you texted me\nShit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity\nAin't no way that this can get to me\nAnd in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter\nBut right now, it's feeling like everything\nThe more I talk about it, it just gets sadder\n'Member thinkin' about a wedding ring\nBut now I'm thinkin' 'bout so many things\nWhat did I do to deserve it?\nThis shit the most petty of petty things\nI'll stick with how nobody's perfect\nLike all of my life, I'll forget about it\nAnd all of the things that I said about it\nBut why the fuck did I get blocked?\nI just cannot wrap my head around it\n\n[Interlude 11]\nI just can't wrap my head around it\nNow I'm just getting bored, I'm just fuckin' up all the flows\nJust for the fun of it\nIf you're still watchin' this shit, uh, comment, uh...\nComment \"Arrowhead water\" in the comments\nAnd let me know what-what would you rate this out of ten\nGive me a rating, that way know that you're real-\nThat you're real one, you know what I'm sayin'? Alright, here we go\n\n[Verse 33]\nSpectacular speculations\n-Havin' some reservations\nImaginin' all the statements\n-Travellin' through these places\nBack in, then buy some passionate\nTrashin' of reputations\nThey actually don't have facts, and\nReality left them baseless\nI wish that we left 'em nameless\n-'Sociate 'em with faces\nMake judgments from expectations\nAnd watch as their heads are shaking\n-People want me to crumble\nAnd turn to some medication\nTo fuck up my motivation\nAnd focus on education\n\n[Hook 10]\nBut I'm petty, petty, petty, petty\nThat's all they really ever tell me\nSo many times that you convince me of shit\nThat I swear you could've won an Emmy\nI got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram\nAnd I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand\nI think t' 'ove is eith-either gold or a scam\nAnd you never really know till the end, like, how all this began\n\n[Verse 34]\nI've been comin' at this as a man\nTrying to figure out where I fit into the plan\nHow does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly\nAnd I don't wanna hear about this shit again\nI guess that's the way it goes when they stalk me\nAnd do anything to try and stop me\nI did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes\nWhen a basic bitch try to block me, uh\n\n[Verse 35]\nLivin' life, but you're stayin' the same\nHow you expect yourself to go take the fame\nMake your name, but you don't take the pain\nYou wanna be unique but not make a change\nLike, what? How you expect to go through this\nThink about the goals, man, why you wanna do this\nSo stupid and useless if you never lose it\nRisk yourself a little for the movement- when did I write-\nThis ain't the Ode to Joy, this the ode to success\nDon't know if there is a God, but I know that I'm blessed\nAnd I'm open to \"No\" and I'm open to \"Yes\"\nI'll do whatever I can to go to the best\nThat will go to the right and go to the left\nNo doubt I'ma show up at night instead of goin' to bed\nWhen I know that I'm right, I'm explodin' my chest\nI keep on loadin' the time and it goes over my head\nI think \"No, why do I even try these things?\nI need shiny things like diamond rings\nAnd flying rings and pricey bling- uh\nThat is what drives these strings\nI'm so- I'm so lively and lazy at the same time\nSayin' somethin' sane and crazy in the same rhyme\nNever go to practice, don't phase me till it's gametime\nLearnin' this life will amaze me, how I made my\nDay, find a minute, I'm livin', winnin' and willin'\nTo spit rhythm and chillin', they get so pissed with me, I'm either villain\nNo, they not kiddin', and no, I'm not quittin', I know I'm just sittin'\nSittin' with a dream, and maybe\nMaybe just see then, see then where the dream could take me\nBut I know it can't, I know it takes luck, I'm angry!\nWhy am I just the B of the A-team\nAt the feet of the mainstream? Man, I dream for this daydream!\nUh, and I believe that I'm makin'\nCease for the takin', it's me in the train, and\nI see that I'm breakin', my knees aren't place and\nI keep on thinkin' that I'm being amazin'\nBut I'm improvin', I know it's just a slow climb\nPushin' myself, yeah, I'll be there in no time\nSo I'm movin', I'm movin' till I get there\nGet where?

Ayy\nLet's gom random shit, ayy\n\n[Verse 39]\nI take no credit for anything that I do\nThat's how I live life with a positive attitude\nThat's why I've seem pissed, but I'm never gettin' mad at you\nThat's the reason that people mirror my attributes\nWhat I contribute to the world is\nSome crazy shit nobody else's world did\nAnd I'm just tryin' to spread some peaces love\nBut, man, it's really hard, 'cause you need some luck\nI've been waitin', 'cause this is\nThe best time for me to be layin' out of business, uh\nAnd I'm breathin' in the air, but it all tastes tainted\nWhen all of this time is wasted, really ain't wasted\n\n[Interlude 14]\nThis is trash, I have- don't know when I wrote this\nI think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-\nThis is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this\nLet's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this\n\n[Verse 40]\nIt's bumpin', bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'\nYou leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'\nI'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'\nThat's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion\nMan, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm\nDroppin' my head, fancy snares, then when it hits 'em\nIt really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me\nBass and a good groove is really a great recipe\nCan't mess with me, no one- feelin' too good in the moment\nFeelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over\nAnd I'm noddin' yes, and then I am applaudin' next\nAnd then, I'm tryna to mentally send God a text\nLike, \"Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real\nBut, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel\nLike a god\u2014 well, you get what I'm sayin'?\"\nAnd goddamn, I just can't really express when I'm playing\n\n[Hook]\nI said it's bumpin', uh- y'all just go for a ride\nWe feelin' good at the top, man, we more than high\nYeah, we be feelin' it, know that this the realest shit\nAll the pain, this is healin' it, love it, I'm never leavin' it\nIt's bumpin'\n\n[Verse 41]\nReally, this is bumpin' to me\nYou ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave\nBut this is something to me, so don't come runnin' to me\nI said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream\nNo, never mind, probably not\nBut I constantly got energy that's lost in my thoughts\nAnd I'm not gonna stop, and yes, this may be costing a lot\nBut lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot\nAnd no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this, I'm still trying to master this\n'Cause now, I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid\nThe fact of it is that it is really just a giant hobby\nSomething for me to be original, not a lyin' copy\nTryna make some shit where you can really get your head nodding\nVerses so fire that- 's when it's done, it's- left sobbing\nBlah, blah, blah, it's uh- we just a work-in-progress\nSome of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense\nBut now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'\nSee me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjustin', see me bluffin'\nEvery day, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do\nListen to some good shit, tryna make a substitute\nI got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too\nWho just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who\nBut all I know is that we find a safety in rhythm\nAnd that is the reason that I am making a shipment\nI said it's bumpin'\n\n[Interlude 15]\nNearin'- we're nearin' an hour\nIf you're still watchin' this shit, I love you, I actually, like, love you\nLong time, okay\n\n[Hook 13]\nI said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her\nHopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna\nMove with it, ride with it\nIt's my life, the only burden is the time limit\nFuck it, I'm livin', ayy, I said, \"Fuck it, I'm livin'\"\nPeople getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'\nJust because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it\nJust because your life stucks, stop corrupting mine with it\nI messed-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good\nJust because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, ayy\nAyy, ayy, uh\nJust because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, uh\n\n[Verse 42]\nAnd how am I meant to keep my workflow up?\nIf a girl shows up, all my world blows up\nI'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest\nTryna find a brand new motherfuckin' deal\nAll you bitches fake, all my numbers real\nAll my shit is punchin' in your stomach, like a meal\nAm I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?\nIt's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing\nNow, it's scary for a king, damn, I said, it's scary for a king, even\nThey call me odd, but I bring even\nI bring reason to believe, and you're eatin' it up for free, and\nThe meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between 'em, I don't show seasons\nYeah, I am me no matter what, and that can grow pleasin'\nI'm barely close to anybody, I don't know people\nMan, I don't know people who so equal\nI don't know nobody who doesn't own evil\nMan, that is just a truth and a lie\nA truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky\nOr a suit and a tie, yeah, I'm new to this life, I'm new to my mind\nNew to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise\nAnd uh, I'm- lookin' at all of this shit\nOh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this\nYou get discouraged for one minute\nAnd the next one, you be callin' it quits\nAnd I'll probably get rich If I focus enough\nYou close-minded, let's open it up\nAnd all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'\nBut they do not know what is up\nUh, I just wish\nThat they'd go away\nAnd I won't obey\nNo, I will never ever show the way\nAnd I will try to mask it up\nWith other jokes on fucking jokes\nAlways playin' G'\nBut now I'm movin' onto other notes\n\n[Interlude 16]\nMy voice is fucking hurting\nIt's hurting a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training\nSo I don't know how to- just do this for a long period of time\nWithout causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?\nMan, I just live it up\nI'm gonna go a little bit quieter now\nUh-huh\nYeah\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAll of these people keep on changin'\nAll of these times and different phases\nAll of these lights on all these stages\nAll of these sights is so amazing\nYeah, I've seen at least a million faces\nA million times, a million places\nBut when it's all said and done\nI look and I wonder why, uh\n\n[Verse 43]\nEveryone knows that it's so amazing\nAll the support is my motivation\nCompared to the big people at the Capital\nMy name is spelt in lower cases\nPeople loved me before I made it\nPeople liked it before they watched it\nI'm wantin' way too much more than I have\nAnd I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it\nMan on a mission, and I g- vision\nOf talking a lot of wisdom, man, I gotta listen\nGotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow\nI'll be the teacher when they need the feature\nGot flow, and it's so damn crazy\nPeople consider me so amazing\nI'm holding control and then folding them verses\nIt hurts because I am on loaded bases\nAdvanced shit, I know the basics\nAlready know them, they're overrated\nMeanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hopin'\n'Cause now I am open for game, and\nI'm charged up\nI ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior\nSo many people they know the players\nDon't know the game and don't know the makers\nDon't know the fakers, but who cares?\nI'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater\nI'm here to go move and just go on the layers\nAnd bitch, I am going so later\nI got time\nMy own lyrics, I got mine\nAnd I'm on time for the wrong lines\nAnd I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go\n\n[Hook 14]\nI've been all on my own\nAll on my own, people keep calling my phone\nWanting to know when I'll be the star of the show\nBut I'm all my own, yeah\nAnd I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it\n'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-\nThe ghost of me is haunting the throne\nSo I'll make it there all on my own\n\n[Verse 44]\nMy intermission is mixing with intermissions\nAnd following intuition conflicting with my decision\nAnd it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval\nAnd it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful\nAnd it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you\nAppearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement\nTo a new type of thing that you can gain from\nTo push away the past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago-\n\n[Interlude 17]\nOh, holy shit!\nI actually reached the end of the beat\nBut I still have, like\nTen-thousand more words\nHold on, I gotta pause this\nHold on, three, it's still one take\n\n[Verse 45]\n-Past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago\nLook at where we been, but imagine where one can go\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nWe now know how much money you can give for a lie\nGive for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?\nWhat's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?\nSo, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen\nAlways been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man\n\n[Hook 15]\nYeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch\nUh, I ain't the star of the show, bitch\n\n[Verse 46]\nI know like four people who truly respect the grind\nAnd it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme\nAnd then if time is money then free time ain't really free\nAnd all my fan' pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me\n-Stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree\nI want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me\nIn the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me\nBigger than you, bigger than anybody in history\nThe challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize\nTo satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time\nAnd luckily, I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time\nTo learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind\nI'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got\nSeveral different things to potentially make my job\nI want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs\nAnd also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks\nA million- shit, all we ever want is more, really\nAnd once I get three million, I want four milli'\nIt's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle\nWe can never be happy, but that is so vital\n\n[Interlude 18]\nUh\nThose are actually some good lyrics, uh\n\n[Verse 47]\nRebirth, feet hit the earth, my knees hurt\nThey're weaker than previously, her\nBreathing seems to be burnt like free CDs were\nBefore we could be searched, I'm like \"Please, just please work\"\nLike a lenient slave owner\u2014 that's edgy, like gravestones, oh, you get me\nI saved dough for a Bentley, t'ere more than a Chevy\nI play- I play-\n-Who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy?\nUh, I've been tryin' to prove to all of the people I knew who didn't like what I do\nDisgusted like, \"Ew\", yeah, this shit goes outta you, plans have now all become true\nI'm seeing them through, man, that's the reason I do, all of the things that I do\nIt's not for a crew, not for a god or a demon, I've really been needing a clue\nFillin' these shoes, reading these pieces and news, damn, this shit really is screwed\nIt gives me the blues whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh\nBut if ignorance is really bliss, then why this ignorance be killin' kids?\nAnd why this ignorance that's clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent?\nThat shit really is ridiculous, it's magnificently fucked up\nBut nobody wants to tough it up, I haven't seen it goin' down, it's comin' up\nL\u2014\n\n[Verse 48]\n\u2014cay to the Vatican, havin' them\nGood times and bad times with New Romans, do that again, well, that was when\nI was so young, too young to really know fun\nBut so what? I guess that's what happens when you grow up\nDry your eyes and wipe your nose up\nJust keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge\nBut we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate\nSuch a twisted system that we've been given to operate\nI've been really thinkin' and figurin' out who's not a fake\nWash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed\nYeah, and now we lookin', it's so far away\nAnd it's so far away\n\n[Hook 16]\nThis a civil war\nIt's a fuckin' civil war\nYeah, we be aimin' to the peace\nSo what we killin' for?\nYeah, anymore\nWhat we even livin' for?\nYeah, they be murderin' for peace\nThat is a civil war\n\n[Verse 49]\nYou know- you know they be lookin' at me right now\nLike the sewer system, they about to pipe down\nI've been writin' my essays, my webpage\nYeah, I call that a new construction site now\nBlue's Clues, man, I think I gotta find out\nAll these questions, man, I really wanna hide out\nOr I wanna drop out, maybe learn a lot 'bout\nMy shit before I wait to see it die out\nDamn, I-I just wanna go along\nI'm holdin' strong, I know- I know I'm not the boldest one\nI'm old enough, I'm growin' up, bars so sick, they throwin' up\nThey know what's up, now, I'm in the- now I'm really doin' the\nDoin' in the big leagues like I got drafted\nBefore the year-round hype over March Madness\nWanna get it to where these girls strippin' down\nLike it's no big deal, like we takin' liberal arts classes\nThey be sayin', \"Damn, Ben really got savage\"\nNo, but unlike you, I am not average-\n\n[Interlude 19]\nHold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental\nThis is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick\nI'm gonna fix it, take a pause\nUh, yeah, ayy\n\n[Verse 50]\nI'm addicted to the screen and the validations\nOf people who are thirteen in another nation\nI've been looking for acceptance in the message\nOr a comment on a video, it seems to be wasted\nLike Internet track meets, they erased it\nLook at this shit, I've just recently made it\nThat how it goes when I'm beatin' and breathin'\nAcheivin' and keep on succeedin', they hate it\nY'all lousy and can't breathe all that smoke, bro\nYou doubt me, but you'll see where I go, so\nAllow me to break free from my own dome\nTo get out and be me, believe in my own zone\nThings become intense in the heat of the ozone\nIt's surroundin' me, I need to go home, so\nCan I pretty please just be al-alone?\nNobody to retweet, delete on my home phone\nI ain't gon'-I ain't gon' hop on that drug shit\nWhen they all claimin' they love it, uh\nI ain't gon' hop on that loud shit\nWhen I know I ain't about it, uh\nYeah, they cannot take this away now\nThey have something to say now\nYou cannot order this shit on a takeout\nAll of these bitches is fake now\n\n[Verse 51]\n\u2014My clothes is Japanese, I wear it casually\nAnd I'm a killer on the mic, might cause a couple casualties\n-All I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary\nMan, I said, \"Fuck the peanut gallery, I got a fuckin' allergy\"\nTrappin' out my PayPal, make it Friends and Family\nNow I'm so hot, I need some oven mitts, ain't safe to handle me\nNow I made my checks from Spotify, they pay me handsomely\nI got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity, okay\nEverybody 'round me, they been wasting my time, ayy\nPull up to the functions, see they face when I rhyme, ayy\nEveryone's a critic on my case all the time\nDo it by myself, I don't need a way to get signed\n\n[Hook 17]\nBitch, I'm clouted up, yeah, I'm clouted up, ayy\nGet my numbers up, gotta add 'em up, ayy\nUntil I get it, I ain't never packin' up, no\nAnd they all comin' for my blood like Dracula, ayy\n\n[Verse 52]\nOkay, I'm backin' this, not maskin' shit, now everybody wanna go package shit\nI don't give a fuck, you know I'm abstinent, I'ma fuck the whole game up on accident\nWait a minute, shit, I'm too passionate, so they stand up for my anthems, no Kaepernick\n'Member when they used to all laugh at this, now they hit me up like, \"What the fuck's happenin'?\nYeah, I had to sacrifice a lot of sleep\nBecause a lot of people want a lot from me\nYeah, standing in the way of who I wanna be\nNow random strangers recognize me when I cross the street\n\n[Verse 53]\nSo many memories, do you remember these\nMoments way back in the time?\nTrapped in the back of my mind\nI am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find\nSo much experience now that I'm passing the lines\nNow that I'm grasping the signs\nI have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide\nNo, I've got nothing to hide\nBitch, I am stuck, left behind\nI need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride\nFill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now\nPuttin' it off to the side\nFeeling alive, yes, I am breathing the air\nAnd I'm feeling so careless, but I can't\nLet go\nDamn\nEvery morning\nI'm wanting to drop out\nBut I can't stop now\nI put too much work in this shit to go pop out\nSo I walk down five different paths every day\nJust need the one, it's only begun\nNo, I'm not going away\nNo, I'm not gonna- 's uh- say\nThat this shit is going badly at all\nI'm glad that I fall\nI love the ref, but I am mad at the call\nI'm mad at the call\nYeah, I'm having it all, I'm traveling far\nAnd I'm practicing hard\nNever goin' back to the start, never goin' back to the start\n\n[Verse 54]\nUh, yeah\nPutting my mind on the table\nNo, I am so able, I'm lining the cables\nI got the horsepower, but tied to the stables, get by with no label\nI do the mixing and mastering\nWriting and rapping and making it happen, I'm\nEating my cake, and I'm having it\nReal emotion, I'm tapping in, passionate\nAnd I am working my hardest\nIt's already started, yes, I am

"Detroit Vs Everybody (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: The Godfather sample]\n\"Don't you ever forget. Don't you ever take sides with anyone against the family. Do you hear me? Ever.\"\n\n[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]\nTell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Static)\nI swear I love my city, I just want a little (Static)\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Static)\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\n[Verse 1: Trick Trick]\nWhat up doe, everybody? I'm Detroit\nSo it's me vs. everybody if you ain't Detroit\nWe all hood, we love the gun smoke\nA message from air traffic control\nI'm doin' them niggas bold\nTakin' it back to when rappers got beat up out their clothes\nTreat 'em like little hoes\nUsed to wake up to snitches swingin' from light poles\nWhen the booger sugar  took a light dose\nShout out to every nigga that ever made money over in Brightmoor\nWith the white folks, in the window like a psycho\nPuttin' the perfect play together; maestro\nAnd since it's so cold in the D, if you don't come to see me\nYou might fuck around and see a nigga ice go\nHad a lil' homie, run up on him with a knife though\nAiight ho, watch the big homie on the roof with the rifle\nWho might go loco and shoot for nothin'\nWill go postal with you for somethin'\nAnd I'm willin' to give it to keep the counterfeits up out of my city\nAsk around and they all know Tricky\nStill pull it together for the kitty\nPour a little liquor for Biggie\nAnd Frank Nitti on the Mickey, send 'em to Diddy\nTried to get me a spot on the Revolt\nSwitch a man's past from the revolt\nTouchin' mothafuckas with the remote\nThink your man sleepin' out here but nigga please, he woke\n[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]\nTell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Static)\nI swear I love my city, I just want a little (Static)\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Static)\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\n[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]\nAyo east side, raised on that east side\nWhen we just throw our pinkies up along with the peace sign\nFairview street sign, who the fuck are these guys?\nNiggas want war, we make 'em feel it, touch their G spot\nMy grandma sold pies and I ain't talkin' 'bout no key lime\nJunkies at the side door, make sure that ain't 5-0\nThey done set her up, they done hit her with that combo\nThey done let the dogs out, house smellin' like Pine Sol\nThat was on the north end, I was on the porch then\nGrandma what you cookin' up? Grandma why that fork bent?\nGrandma where my mom at? Now I want her, beep her up\nAlways imagined we was poor and that her feet was up\nJordans, yeah we had 'em on, bitch it wasn't no teasin' us\nRemember me and Pooh was in the window eatin' peanut butter\nDamn I miss my cousin, I'm like R.I.P. to Trina's son\nI'm from where it ain't no love, everybody need a gun, yuh\n\n[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]\nDetroit V.S. everybody, P.S\nFuck y'all too, we don't care what y'all do\nStill, you can't deny the real\nTime reveal, society squeals and the society kill\nMoney motivated though we take it\nThese cats are overrated, severely, poppin' up yearly\nThen they disappear within the same year\nLike it never happened, them niggas just rappin' barely\nI'm a shooter, loadin' my magazine and throw the book at 'em\nLike a prosecutor, the Glock'll do you like a college tutor\nCause right after class\nI teach a mothafucka somethin' and watch him pass\nGraduation, I rattle cages\nWe make some uncomfortable, I didn't grow up like the Huxtables\nWest 7th where those drugs'll move nonstop\nSoft white or hard rock, get everybody in your yard shot\nYou'll get a feel for my city when I send the welcoming committee\nWith the 50 calibers and the smoke grey Dodge Challengers\nYou frown on your face, we'll kick it pretty\nWhen I grip the semi, you better have some grip to give me\nOr the steel smokes, you cats are real jokes\nYou bitch niggas, smack your face numb like you feel coke\nUntil you get the big picture, mothafucka\nYou might also like[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]\nTell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Static)\nI swear I love my city, I just want a little (Static)\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Static)\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\n[Verse 4: Black Milk]\nLet the celebration kick off\nThis that point in the party where that person start pointin'\nThat pistol because they're pissed off\nShots lick off, fire spit off\nThis track put a fire up under me like rockets when they lift off\nThe map, these rappers that recite raps\nWe don't believe 'em like that\nDeadbeat dad sayin' that he'll be right back\nBut city that's rough and looked at as them black sheeps\nWith them rap sheets that's long as track meets\nSo let's take a stroll, come follow me down these back streets\nWhere blacks and the trap meet\nKillers and dealers that had dreams to be athletes\nBut them dreams got put in the back seat\nAnd makin' fast funds the shotgun\nGot some homies that's still in the hood, life finna twirl\nThey ask me \"what is it like to see the rest of the world?\"\nAway from the block, away from the gutter\nAll they know is the blocks and watchin' for cops undercover\nSo what you have here, some niggas that's never had a fear they couldn't face\nTougher than '89 Laimbeer in the paint\nPosted, Chuck D coachin', never laid up\nCity soil that made us\n7 mile with the players, Puritan and PA-ers\n[?] where the bullets strayin'\nFenkell where the bodies layin'\n6th mile where them hollows sprayin'\nWoodward where they ain't playin'\nSchoolcraft you find that mayhem where hollows holler in the AM\nGratiot where grandma's stayin'\nNeighborhood that's decayin'\nNiggas pockets is light so that light bill they're never payin'\nSo fam don't let your lips talk, that could be your pitfall\nAnd get you sprayed on like murals on side of brick walls\nDudes watchin' waitin' for you to get sloppy\nLike a hitman lurkin' in the shadows with his shotty\nOut here screamin' \"Let's go\", yeah my nigga X know\nCity where the TECs blow but we ain't talkin' techno\n[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]\nTell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Static)\nI swear I love my city, I just want a little (Static)\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Static)\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\n[Verse 5: Sino]\nI'm stumblin' in my Detroit fitted, bitch\nAnybody want some beef then we with it, bitch\nShit, see in the Mitten all my niggas 'bout that action\nMight be 30 niggas with me, every nigga with me packin'\nNo fly zone, shit, just for pussies on that fuck shit\nDirty glove, boy this ain't the city to be fucked with\nShout out my uncle Trick, you get to trippin', he gon' dump quick\nMy city verses everybody (you gotta kill everybody!)\nBoy, RIP to Blade, I hope he hear this\nI swear if Ron was free, he'd be the first nigga to kill this\nStreet nigga, give me a ki' and I'ma deal it\nBetter give a nigga his cash or you can feel it\nWhat up Em, signed the city to Shady and fuck it\nThey say the world is a bitch, I'ma keep on fuckin' it\nMy city on my back and I'ma keep on runnin' it\nStill got that chopper on the back seat, ain't shit sweet, boy\n\n[Verse 6: Marv Won]\n40287, I'm out that black bottom\nIf they don't fuck with the boy, I bet the crack got 'em\nIt's enough two faces here to attack Gotham\nAnd ain't nobody a ho until the MACs spot 'em\nDot 'em, play possum, no brave option\nAll of mine yay choppin' and K shoppin'\nThe nerdiest nigga here can play the part of a goon\nTransplant your killers if it ain't no heart in the room\nWait 'til he sugar sharp and then throw salt in the wound\nThese red beams'll turn your white party maroon\nI got a pair of gators that I hardly wear\nNigga I will kill you over these Cartiers\nI got a couple bands with the dice on the floor\nWhen I was 9, boy I could tell you the price of a bow\nListen, full length minks just to show we stuntin'\nBrother you know it's nothin'\nNigga I'm Coleman Young'in, tell 'em!\n\n[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]\nTell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Static)\nI swear I love my city, I just want a little (Static)\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Static)\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\n[Verse 7: Payroll Giovanni]\nI'm from the west side blocks where we roll in spots\nAnd have blow blowout sales to blow out a watch\nYoung niggas gettin' popped cause of the clique they claim\nAnd in most homicides, it's a bitch to blame\nMy future plan's to stay froze 'til my wrist complains\nIf rap fails, I'm whippin' coke 'til the brick complains\nIn the new 6 switchin' lanes, probably with big kis\nAin't talkin' coffee when I say the trunk is where the big be\nYou see that D right above where my lid be\nCan't trust a soul, well that's how these streets did me\nI bossed up from setbacks by luck, I rep that\nAin't scared of nigga's shit, I'm from Detroit, I expect that\n\n[Verse 8: Hydro]\nLook I'm from Detroit, bitch\nWhere we crack heads and we break bails\nInspired by the dopeman that pack hammers and make sales\nDreaming of a rollie, a coupe, a crib off of lake trails\nThey quick to take a trip with so much weight that it'd break scales\nYoung boys wilding, with a chopper they'll make hail\nScreaming \"fuck the cops\" and quick to pop off like some fake nails\nShout out to my strippers with 30 inches and fake tails\nAnd pounds of the cookie like I was running a bake sale\nHolla if you need it, I got it, just come and ask the man\nTry me and get cheddar on your head just like a Packer fan\nRiding down your mama street with tints on a blacker van\nAnd turn your block into a war zone like we in Pakistan\nNobody I can call on, it's ball or get balled on\nWrists full of that shit you niggas can slip and fall on\nWhy the fuck you hating us when we can put them all on?\nAnd they can help their little mans and they can hit the mall strong\nIt's 7 Mile 'till I die, raised by some street niggas\nFuck friends, ain't got none, I'm dolo with this heat, nigga\nBoogers in my watch face, my wrists be looking slimy\nOnce I fuck she's like my seatbelt, I put that bitch behind me, nigga\n\n[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]\nTell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Static)\nI swear I love my city, I just want a little (Static)\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Static)\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\n[Verse 9: Big Gov]\nMy timing was perfect, designed to be worshiped\nLike Jesus as a fetus\nWas destined to earn my stripes like Adidas\nNeedless to say I'm the sniper\nPick us off, niggas soft\nWhile they spitting bars in the middle of a cypher\nI'm from the same hood as Big Meech and Big T\nSo miss me with ho shit or end up on this street\nHome of the big three; big cuffs, big guns, big chips\nWhere broke niggas get hood rich off of quick flips\nI'm from the city where the bitches even gangster\nSuck a nigga dick, get her robbed, tell 'em thank you\nWe don't fuck with you outsiders, learn who to talk to\nOr get stomped for feeling like the man when you walk through\nAnd I don't even walk around with my chest out\nBut know it's drama when you see me with my vest out\nMy next route is finding out where you rest at\nCatch you sleep, make the crime scene where you slept at\nAnd the next cat who disrespect my city on some rap shit\nI'm on his ass like cellulite on a fat bitch\nThis shit is drastic and you ain't gotta ask if\nA nigga come disrespectful, he leaving out in a casket\n\n[Verse 10: Boldy James]\nDetroit VS everybody, that's me against the world\nI might not sell a cop, but who need a brick or girl?\nA thousand grams on my cock, later alligator\nMoist of the aviator, cardi sipping activator\nNever been a punk, faker or a lean whipper\nSteady packing eighters in a one paper king swish\nConcrete, definition of real street nigga\nWhole hood know that I'm the only real D nigga\nThat really mean it when you hear me say I am Detroit\nCan hear it in my voice, my fault Em and Royce\nFor being four days late turning my verse in\nBut me and Ready Rock was in the spot putting that work in\nWhat was you doing before you ever touched your first ten?\nI was in the streets with my peeps getting them chirps in\nText me when the work gone, I text him back the work end\nTryna get my hands on the pack when they first in\nOn my Captain Planet I possess earth, wind and fire\nBut you being a liar is the worst sin\nKeep throwing rocks at the throne with a glass chin\nI'm still that same nigga on the corner with a half grin\nI never let these niggas use my ears for no trash cans\nBeen selling dope for too long, it's time to cash in\nKing James, before this rap shit I had street fame\nAnd the keys to the city on my key chain\n\n[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]\nTell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Static)\nI swear I love my city, I just want a little (Static)\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Static)\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\n[Verse 11: Kid Vishis]\nWhoever said Vishis phony, get to know me\nOur hollows'll make a rapper drop the mic, no diss to Joey\nGuns of all sizes, I fire and get smokey\nRiding with the biggest ratchet on the car dash, I call it Khloe\nYou think you hard? I think you doughey\nHis guts'll fall out looking like someone stuck a knife in a stoagie\nHomie, you owe me your life\nI'm Columbine balling, throwing a stripe\nWiping you out and bounce like a thief in the night\nI now control machinery, it's like real steel\nGun ductaped to the tires, that mean I will kill\nThey say I'm fooling to 'em\nThey asked me for a hot sixteen\nSo I lit my notebook on fire and threw it to 'em\nHere's a DeJ Loaf punchline\nI kill your whole family and leave a red trail, that's your bloodline\nTry me, I bust nines\nStick a clock in his mouth and make him chew\nYeah, nigga, it's crunch time\n\n[Verse 12: Big Herk]\nWe got them choppers, how a nigga with a knife gon' win?\nY'all just shooting the breeze, they done let a cyclone in\nThis what happen when little mama boys trapped grown men\nLyrically ahead of my time like the iPhone 10\nAnd why Detroit always get a bad name?\nMy City ready to blow like we hit a gas main\nThese niggas thinking they dope, but their shit a tad lame\nMan, their pen and pad game more like Trinidad James\nFuck you and whoever you run with\nI'm on that BS, I'm still in the middle with dumb shit\nI'm a beast, everything you hear me spit real tight\nYour flow wack, it's out of Egypt, nigga, it's real light (get it?)\nI'mma keep it real, niggas can't fuck with me\nIt's like I contracted Ebola, they ain't touching me\nDetroit VS Everybody, niggas know we started that\nNow every city all across the world want a part of this\n\n[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]\nTell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Static)\nI swear I love my city, I just want a little (Static)\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Static)\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\n[Verse 13: Icewear Vezzo]\nStreet niggas smarter than Kwame, bustin'

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)\n\n(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)\n\nLONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.\n\n(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!\n\nJOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

Down with Bloom!\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.)

Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill.

He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah!

Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O!

Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls.

Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches.

Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.)

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks.

Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding.

Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/766531", "artist_names": "Aretha Franklin", "full_title": "You Send Me

up two flights of staircase\nSquirmin' into Papa's embrace\nAnd his whiskers warm on their face\nWhere's it gone?\nOh, where's it gone?\nTwo floors above the butcher\nFirst door on the right\nAnd life filled to the brim\nAs I stood by my window\nAnd looked out on those\nBrooklyn Roads\n\nI can still recall\nThe smells of cookin' in the hallways\nRubbers drying in the doorways\nAnd report cards I was always\nAfraid to show\n\nMama'd come to school\nAnd as I sit there softly crying\nTeacher'd say, \"He's just not trying\nGot a good head if he'd apply it\nBut you know yourself\nIt's always

LyricsO ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,\nHolland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,\nI pray ye flog them upon all occasions,\nIt mends their morals, never mind the pain:\nThe best of mothers and of educations\nIn Juan's case were but employ'd in vain,\nSince, in a way that 's rather of the oddest, he\nBecame divested of his native modesty.\n\nHad he but been placed at a public school,\nIn the third form, or even in the fourth,\nHis daily task had kept his fancy cool,\nAt least, had he been nurtured in the north;\nSpain may prove an exception to the rule,\nBut then exceptions always prove its worth\u2014\nA lad of sixteen causing a divorce\nPuzzled his tutors very much, of course.\nI can't say that it puzzles me at all,\nIf all things be consider'd: first, there was\nHis lady\u2014mother, mathematical,\nA\u2014never mind; his tutor, an old ass;\nA pretty woman (that 's quite natural,\nOr else the thing had hardly come to pass);\nA husband rather old, not much in unity\nWith his young wife\u2014a time, and opportunity.\n\nWell\u2014well, the world must turn upon its axis,\nAnd all mankind turn with it, heads or tails,\nAnd live and die, make love and pay our taxes,\nAnd as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;\nThe king commands us, and the doctor quacks us,\nThe priest instructs, and so our life exhales,\nA little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,\nFighting, devotion, dust,\u2014perhaps a name.\n\nI said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz\u2014\nA pretty town, I recollect it well\u2014\n'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is\n(Or was, before Peru learn'd to rebel),\nAnd such sweet girls\u2014I mean, such graceful ladies,\nTheir very walk would make your bosom swell;\nI can't describe it, though so much it strike,\nNor liken it\u2014I never saw the like:\nAn Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb\nNew broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,\nNo\u2014none of these will do;\u2014and then their garb!\nTheir veil and petticoat\u2014Alas! to dwell\nUpon such things would very near absorb\nA canto\u2014then their feet and ankles,\u2014well,\nThank Heaven I 've got no metaphor quite ready\n(And so, my sober Muse\u2014come, let 's be steady\u2014\n\nChaste Muse!\u2014well, if you must, you must)\u2014the veil\nThrown back a moment with the glancing hand,\nWhile the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,\nFlashes into the heart:\u2014All sunny land\nOf love! when I forget you, may I fail\nTo\u2014say my prayers\u2014but never was there plann'd\nA dress through which the eyes give such a volley,\nExcepting the Venetian Fazzioli.\n\nBut to our tale: the Donna Inez sent\nHer son to Cadiz only to embark;\nTo stay there had not answer'd her intent,\nBut why?\u2014we leave the reader in the dark\u2014\n'T was for a voyage that the young man was meant,\nAs if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,\nTo wean him from the wickedness of earth,\nAnd send him like a dove of promise forth.\nDon Juan bade his valet pack his things\nAccording to direction, then received\nA lecture and some money: for four springs\nHe was to travel; and though Inez grieved\n(As every kind of parting has its stings),\nShe hoped he would improve\u2014perhaps believed:\nA letter, too, she gave (he never read it)\nOf good advice\u2014and two or three of credit.\n\nIn the mean time, to pass her hours away,\nBrave Inez now set up a Sunday school\nFor naughty children, who would rather play\n(Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;\nInfants of three years old were taught that day,\nDunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:\nThe great success of Juan's education,\nSpurr'd her to teach another generation.\n\nJuan embark'd\u2014the ship got under way,\nThe wind was fair, the water passing rough:\nA devil of a sea rolls in that bay,\nAs I, who 've cross'd it oft, know well enough;\nAnd, standing upon deck, the dashing spray\nFlies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:\nAnd there he stood to take, and take again,\nHis first\u2014perhaps his last\u2014farewell of Spain.\n\nI can't but say it is an awkward sight\nTo see one's native land receding through\nThe growing waters; it unmans one quite,\nEspecially when life is rather new:\nI recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,\nBut almost every other country 's blue,\nWhen gazing on them, mystified by distance,\nWe enter on our nautical existence.\n\nSo Juan stood, bewilder'd on the deck:\nThe wind sung, cordage strain'd, and sailors swore,\nAnd the ship creak'd, the town became a speck,\nFrom which away so fair and fast they bore.\nThe best of remedies is a beef-steak\nAgainst sea-sickness: try it, sir, before\nYou sneer, and I assure you this is true,\nFor I have found it answer\u2014so may you.\n\nDon Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,\nBeheld his native Spain receding far:\nFirst partings form a lesson hard to learn,\nEven nations feel this when they go to war;\nThere is a sort of unexprest concern,\nA kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar:\nAt leaving even the most unpleasant people\nAnd places, one keeps looking at the steeple.\n\nBut Juan had got many things to leave,\nHis mother, and a mistress, and no wife,\nSo that he had much better cause to grieve\nThan many persons more advanced in life;\nAnd if we now and then a sigh must heave\nAt quitting even those we quit in strife,\nNo doubt we weep for those the heart endears\u2014\nThat is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.\n\nSo Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews\nBy Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:\nI 'd weep,\u2014but mine is not a weeping Muse,\nAnd such light griefs are not a thing to die on;\nYoung men should travel, if but to amuse\nThemselves; and the next time their servants tie on\nBehind their carriages their new portmanteau,\nPerhaps it may be lined with this my canto.\n\nAnd Juan wept, and much he sigh'd and thought,\nWhile his salt tears dropp'd into the salt sea,\n'Sweets to the sweet' (I like so much to quote;\nYou must excuse this extract, 't is where she,\nThe Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought\nFlowers to the grave); and, sobbing often, he\nReflected on his present situation,\nAnd seriously resolved on reformation.\n\n'Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!' he cried,\n'Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,\nBut die, as many an exiled heart hath died,\nOf its own thirst to see again thy shore:\nFarewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!\nFarewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,\nFarewell, too, dearest Julia!\u2014(Here he drew\nHer letter out again, and read it through.)\n\n'And, oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear\u2014\nBut that 's impossible, and cannot be\u2014\nSooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,\nSooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,\nThan I resign thine image, oh, my fair!\nOr think of any thing excepting thee;\nA mind diseased no remedy can physic\n(Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).\n\n'Sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),\nO, Julia! what is every other wo?\n(For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;\nPedro, Battista, help me down below.)\nJulia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)\u2014\nO, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)\u2014\nBeloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!'\n(Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)\n\nHe felt that chilling heaviness of heart,\nOr rather stomach, which, alas! attends,\nBeyond the best apothecary's art,\nThe loss of love, the treachery of friends,\nOr death of those we dote on, when a part\nOf us dies with them as each fond hope ends:\nNo doubt he would have been much more pathetic,\nBut the sea acted as a strong emetic. I\n\nLove 's a capricious power: I 've known it hold\nOut through a fever caused by its own heat,\nBut be much puzzled by a cough and cold,\nAnd find a quincy very hard to treat;\nAgainst all noble maladies he 's bold,\nBut vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,\nNor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,\nNor inflammations redden his blind eye.\n\nBut worst of all is nausea, or a pain\nAbout the lower region of the bowels;\nLove, who heroically breathes a vein,\nShrinks from the application of hot towels,\nAnd purgatives are dangerous to his reign,\nSea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else\nCould Juan's passion, while the billows roar,\nResist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?\n\nThe ship, call'd the most holy 'Trinidada,'\nWas steering duly for the port Leghorn;\nFor there the Spanish family Moncada\nWere settled long ere Juan's sire was born:\nThey were relations, and for them he had a\nLetter of introduction, which the morn\nOf his departure had been sent him by\nHis Spanish friends for those in Italy.\n\nHis suite consisted of three servants and\nA tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,\nWho several languages did understand,\nBut now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,\nAnd rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,\nHis headache being increased by every billow;\nAnd the waves oozing through the port-hole made\nHis berth a little damp, and him afraid.\n\n'T was not without some reason, for the wind\nIncreased at night, until it blew a gale;\nAnd though 't was not much to a naval mind,\nSome landsmen would have look'd a little pale,\nFor sailors are, in fact, a different kind:\nAt sunset they began to take in sail,\nFor the sky show'd it would come on to blow,\nAnd carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.\n\nAt one o'clock the wind with sudden shift\nThrew the ship right into the trough of the sea,\nWhich struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,\nStarted the stern-post, also shatter'd the\nWhole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift\nHerself from out her present jeopardy,\nThe rudder tore away: 't was time to sound\nThe pumps, and there were four feet water found.\n\nOne gang of people instantly was put\nUpon the pumps and the remainder set\nTo get up part of the cargo, and what not;\nBut they could not come at the leak as yet;\nAt last they did get at it really, but\nStill their salvation was an even bet:\nThe water rush'd through in a way quite puzzling,\nWhile they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,\n\nInto the opening; but all such ingredients\nWould have been vain, and they must have gone down,\nDespite of all their efforts and expedients,\nBut for the pumps: I 'm glad to make them known\nTo all the brother tars who may have need hence,\nFor fifty tons of water were upthrown\nBy them per hour, and they had all been undone,\nBut for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.\n\nAs day advanced the weather seem'd to abate,\nAnd then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,\nAnd keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet\nKept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.\nThe wind blew fresh again: as it grew late\nA squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,\nA gust\u2014which all descriptive power transcends\u2014\nLaid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.\n\nThere she lay motionless, and seem'd upset;\nThe water left the hold, and wash'd the decks,\nAnd made a scene men do not soon forget;\nFor they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,\nOr any other thing that brings regret,\nOr breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:\nThus drownings are much talk'd of by the divers,\nAnd swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.\n\nImmediately the masts were cut away,\nBoth main and mizen; first the mizen went,\nThe main-mast follow'd: but the ship still lay\nLike a mere log, and baffled our intent.\nForemast and bowsprit were cut down, and they\nEased her at last (although we never meant\nTo part with all till every hope was blighted),\nAnd then with violence the old ship righted.\n\nIt may be easily supposed, while this\nWas going on, some people were unquiet,\nThat passengers would find it much amiss\nTo lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;\nThat even the able seaman, deeming his\nDays nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,\nAs upon such occasions tars will ask\nFor grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.\n\nThere 's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms\nAs rum and true religion: thus it was,\nSome plunder'd, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,\nThe high wind made the treble, and as bas\nThe hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms\nOf all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:\nStrange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,\nClamour'd in chorus to the roaring ocean.\n\nPerhaps more mischief had been done, but for\nOur Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,\nGot to the spirit-room, and stood before\nIt with a pair of pistols; and their fears,\nAs if Death were more dreadful by his door\nOf fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,\nKept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,\nThought it would be becoming to die drunk.\n\n'Give us more grog,' they cried, 'for it will be\nAll one an hour hence.' Juan answer'd, 'No!\n'T is true that death awaits both you and me,\nBut let us die like men, not sink below\nLike brutes;'\u2014and thus his dangerous post kept he,\nAnd none liked to anticipate the blow;\nAnd even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,\nWas for some rum a disappointed suitor.\n\nThe good old gentleman was quite aghast,\nAnd made a loud and pious lamentation;\nRepented all his sins, and made a last\nIrrevocable vow of reformation;\nNothing should tempt him more (this peril past)\nTo quit his academic occupation,\nIn cloisters of the classic Salamanca,\nTo follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.\n\nBut now there came a flash of hope once more;\nDay broke, and the wind lull'd: the masts were gone,\nThe leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,\nThe vessel swam, yet still she held her own.\nThey tried the pumps again, and though before\nTheir desperate efforts seem'd all useless grown,\nA glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale\u2014\nThe stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a sail.\n\nUnder the vessel's keel the sail was past,\nAnd for the moment it had some effect;\nBut with a leak, and not a stick of mast,\nNor rag of canvas, what could they expect?\nBut still 't is best to struggle to the last,\n'T is never too late to be wholly wreck'd:\nAnd though 't is true that man can only die once,\n'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.\n\nThere winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,\nWithout their will, they carried them away;\nFor they were forced with steering to dispense,\nAnd never had as yet a quiet day\nOn which they might repose, or even commence\nA jurymast or rudder, or could say\nThe ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,\nStill swam\u2014though not exactly like a duck.\n\nThe wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,\nBut the ship labour'd so, they scarce could hope\nTo weather out much longer; the distress\nWas also great with which they had to cope\nFor want of water, and their solid mess\nWas scant enough: in vain the telescope\nWas used\u2014nor sail nor shore appear'd in sight,\nNought but the heavy sea, and coming night.\n\nAgain the weather threaten'd,\u2014again blew\nA gale, and in the fore and after hold\nWater appear'd; yet, though the people knew\nAll this, the most were patient, and some bold,\nUntil the chains and leathers were worn through\nOf all our pumps:\u2014a wreck complete she roll'd,\nAt mercy of the waves, whose mercies are\nLike human beings during civil war.\n\nThen came the carpenter, at last, with tears\nIn his rough eyes, and told the captain he\nCould do no more: he was a man in years,\nAnd long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,\nAnd if he wept at length, they were not fears\nThat made his eyelids as a woman's be,\nBut he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,\u2014\nTwo things for dying people quite bewildering.\n\nThe ship was evidently settling now\nFast by the head; and, all distinction gone,\nSome went to prayers again, and made a vow\nOf candles to their saints\u2014but there were none\nTo pay them with; and some look'd o'er the bow;\nSome hoisted out the boats; and there was one\nThat begg'd Pedrillo for an absolution,\nWho told him to be damn'd\u2014in his confusion.\n\nSome lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on\nTheir best clothes, as if going to a fair;\nSome cursed the day on which they saw the sun,\nAnd gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;\nAnd others went on as they had begun,\nGetting the boats out, being well aware\nThat a tight boat will live in a rough sea,\nUnless with breakers close beneath her lee.\n\nThe worst of all was, that in their condition,\nHaving been several days in great distress,\n'T was difficult to get out such provision\nAs now might render their long suffering less:\nMen, even when dying, dislike inanition;\nTheir stock was damaged by the weather's stress:\nTwo casks of biscuit and a keg of butter\nWere all that could be thrown into the cutter.\n\nBut in the long-boat they contrived to stow\nSome pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;\nWater, a twenty-gallon cask or so;\nSix flasks of wine; and they contrived to get\nA portion of their beef up from below,\nAnd with a piece of pork, moreover, met,\nBut scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon\u2014\nThen there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.\n\nThe other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had\nBeen stove in the beginning of the gale;\nAnd the long-boat's condition was but bad,\nAs there were but two blankets for a sail,\nAnd one oar for a mast, which a young lad\nThrew in by good luck over the ship's rail;\nAnd two boats could not hold, far less be stored,\nTo save one half the people then on board.\n\n'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down\nOver the waste of waters; like a veil,\nWhich, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown\nOf one whose hate is mask'd but to assail,\nThus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,\nAnd grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,\nAnd the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear\nBeen their familiar, and now Death was here.\n\nSome trial had been making at a raft,\nWith little hope in such a rolling sea,\nA sort of thing at which one would have laugh'd,\nIf any laughter at such times could be,\nUnless with people who too much have quaff'd,\nAnd have a kind of wild and horrid glee,\nHalf epileptical and half hysterical:\u2014\nTheir preservation would have been a miracle.\n\nAt half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,\nAnd all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,\nThat still could keep afloat the struggling tars,\nFor yet they strove, although of no great use:\nThere was no light in heaven but a few stars,\nThe boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;\nShe gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,\nAnd, going down head foremost\u2014sunk, in short.\n\nThen rose from sea to sky the wild farewell\u2014\nThen shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave,\nThen some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,\nAs eager to anticipate their grave;\nAnd the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,\nAnd down she suck'd with her the whirling wave,\nLike one who grapples with his enemy,\nAnd strives to strangle him before he die.\n\nAnd first one universal shriek there rush'd,\nLouder than the loud ocean, like a crash\nOf echoing thunder; and then all was hush'd,\nSave the wild wind and the remorseless dash\nOf billows; but at intervals there gush'd,\nAccompanied with a convulsive splash,\nA solitary shriek, the bubbling cry\nOf some strong swimmer in his agony.\n\nThe boats, as stated, had got off before,\nAnd in them crowded several of the crew;\nAnd yet their present hope was hardly more\nThan what it had been, for so strong it blew\nThere was slight chance of reaching any shore;\nAnd then they were too many, though so few\u2014\nNine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,\nWere counted in them when they got afloat.\n\nAll the rest perish'd; near two hundred souls\nHad left their bodies; and what 's worse, alas!\nWhen over Catholics the ocean rolls,\nThey must wait several weeks before a mass\nTakes off one peck of purgatorial coals,\nBecause, till people know what 's come to pass,\nThey won't lay out their money on the dead\u2014\nIt costs three francs for every mass that 's said.\n\nJuan got into the long-boat, and there\nContrived to help Pedrillo to a place;\nIt seem'd as if they had exchanged their care,\nFor Juan wore the magisterial face\nWhich courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair\nOf eyes were crying for their owner's case:\nBattista; though (a name call'd shortly Tita),\nWas lost by getting at some aqua-vita.\n\nPedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,\nBut the same cause, conducive to his loss,\nLeft him so drunk, he jump'd into the wave\nAs o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,\nAnd so he found a wine-and-watery grave;\nThey could not rescue him although so close,\nBecause the sea ran higher every minute,\nAnd for the boat\u2014the crew kept crowding in it.\n\nA small old spaniel,\u2014which had been Don Jose's,\nHis father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,\nFor on such things the memory reposes\nWith tenderness\u2014stood howling on the brink,\nKnowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),\nNo doubt, the vessel was about to sink;\nAnd Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd\nOff, threw him in, then after him he leap'd.\n\nHe also stuff'd his money where he could\nAbout his person, and Pedrillo's too,\nWho let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,\nNot knowing what himself to say, or do,\nAs every rising wave his dread renew'd;\nBut Juan, trusting they might still get through,\nAnd deeming there were remedies for any ill,\nThus re-embark'd his tutor and his spaniel.\n\n'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,\nThat the sail was becalm'd between the seas,\nThough on the wave's high top too much to set,\nThey dared not take it in for all the breeze:\nEach sea curl'd o'er the stern, and kept them wet,\nAnd made them bale without a moment's ease,\nSo that themselves as well as hopes were damp'd,\nAnd the poor little cutter quickly swamp'd.\n\nNine souls more went in her: the long-boat still\nKept above water, with an oar for mast,\nTwo blankets stitch'd together, answering ill\nInstead of sail, were to the oar made fast:\nThough every wave roll'd menacing to fill,\nAnd present peril all before surpass'd,\nThey grieved for those who perish'd with the cutter,\nAnd also for the biscuit-casks and butter.\n\nThe sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign\nOf the continuance of the gale: to run\nBefore the sea until it should grow fine,\nWas all that for the present could be done:\nA few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine\nWere served out to the people, who begun\nTo faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,\nAnd most of them had little clothes but rags.\n\nThey counted thirty, crowded in a space\nWhich left scarce room for motion or exertion;\nThey did their best to modify their case,\nOne half sate up, though numb'd with the immersion,\nWhile t'other half were laid down in their place\nAt watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian\nAgue in its cold fit, they fill'd their boat,\nWith nothing but the sky for a great coat.\n\n'T is very certain the desire of life\nProlongs it: this is obvious to physicians,\nWhen patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,\nSurvive through very desperate conditions,\nBecause they still can hope, nor shines the knife\nNor shears of Atropos before their visions:\nDespair of all recovery spoils longevity,\nAnd makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.\n\n'T is said that persons living on annuities\nAre longer lived than others,\u2014God knows why,\nUnless to plague the grantors,\u2014yet so true it is,\nThat some, I really think, do never die;\nOf any creditors the worst a Jew it is,\nAnd that 's their mode of furnishing supply:\nIn my young days they lent me cash that way,\nWhich I found very troublesome to pay.\n\n'T is thus with people in an open boat,\nThey live upon the love of life, and bear\nMore than can be believed, or even thought,\nAnd stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;\nAnd hardship still has been the sailor's lot,\nSince Noah's ark went cruising here and there;\nShe had a curious crew as well as cargo,\nLike the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.\n\nBut man is a carnivorous production,\nAnd must have meals, at least one meal a day;\nHe cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,\nBut, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;\nAlthough his anatomical construction\nBears vegetables, in a grumbling way,\nYour labouring people think beyond all question,\nBeef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.\n\nAnd thus it was with this our hapless crew;\nFor on the third day there came on a calm,\nAnd though at first their strength it might renew,\nAnd lying on their weariness like balm,\nLull'd them like turtles sleeping on the blue\nOf ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,\nAnd fell all ravenously on their provision,\nInstead of hoarding it with due precision.\n\nThe consequence was easily foreseen\u2014\nThey ate up all they had, and drank their wine,\nIn spite of all remonstrances, and then\nOn what, in fact, next day were they to dine?\nThey hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!\nAnd carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,\nBut as they had but one oar, and that brittle,\nIt would have been more wise to save their victual.\n\nThe fourth day came, but not a breath of air,\nAnd Ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:\nThe fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,\nThe sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild\u2014\nWith their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)\nWhat could they do? and hunger's rage grew wild:\nSo Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,\nWas kill'd and portion'd out for present eating.\n\nOn the sixth day they fed upon his hide,\nAnd Juan, who had still refused, because\nThe creature was his father's dog that died,\nNow feeling all the vulture in his jaws,\nWith some remorse received (though first denied)\nAs a great favour one of the fore-paws,\nWhich he divided with Pedrillo, who\nDevour'd it, longing for the other too.\n\nThe seventh day, and no wind\u2014the burning sun\nBlister'd and scorch'd, and, stagnant on the sea,\nThey lay like carcasses; and hope was none,\nSave in the breeze that came not; savagely\nThey glared upon each other\u2014all was done,\nWater, and wine, and food,\u2014and you might see\nThe longings of the cannibal arise\n(Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.\n\nAt length one whisper'd his companion, who\nWhisper'd another, and thus it went round,\nAnd then into a hoarser murmur grew,\nAn ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;\nAnd when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,\n'T was but his own, suppress'd till now, he found:\nAnd out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,\nAnd who should die to be his fellow's food.\n\nBut ere they came to this, they that day shared\nSome leathern caps, and what remain'd of shoes;\nAnd then they look'd around them and despair'd,\nAnd none to be the sacrifice would choose;\nAt length the lots were torn up, and prepared,\nBut of materials that much shock the Muse\u2014\nHaving no paper, for the want of better,\nThey took by force from Juan Julia's letter.\n\nThe lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed,\nIn silent horror, and their distribution\nLull'd even the savage hunger which demanded,\nLike the Promethean vulture, this pollution;\nNone in particular had sought or plann'd it,\n'T was nature gnaw'd them to this resolution,\nBy which none were permitted to be neuter\u2014\nAnd the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.\n\nHe but requested to be bled to death:\nThe surgeon had his instruments, and bled\nPedrillo, and so gently ebb'd his breath,\nYou hardly could perceive when he was dead.\nHe died as born, a Catholic in faith,\nLike most in the belief in which they 're bred,\nAnd first a little crucifix he kiss'd,\nAnd then held out his jugular and wrist.\n\nThe surgeon, as there was no other fee,\nHad his first choice of morsels for his pains;\nBut being thirstiest at the moment, he\nPreferr'd a draught from the fast-flowing veins:\nPart was divided, part thrown in the sea,\nAnd such things as the entrails and the brains\nRegaled two sharks, who follow'd o'er the billow\u2014\nThe sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.\n\nThe sailors ate him, all save three or four,\nWho were not quite so fond of animal food;\nTo these was added Juan, who, before\nRefusing his own spaniel, hardly could\nFeel now his appetite increased much more;\n'T was not to be expected that he should,\nEven in extremity of their disaster,\nDine with them on his pastor and his master.\n\n'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,\nThe consequence was awful in the extreme;\nFor they, who were most ravenous in the act,\nWent raging mad\u2014Lord! how they did blaspheme!\nAnd foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,\nDrinking salt water like a mountain-stream,\nTearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,\nAnd, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.\n\nTheir numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,\nAnd all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;\nAnd some of them had lost their recollection,\nHappier than they who still perceived their woes;\nBut others ponder'd on a new dissection,\nAs if not warn'd sufficiently by those\nWho had already perish'd, suffering madly,\nFor having used their appetites so sadly.\n\nAnd next they thought upon the master's mate,\nAs fattest; but he saved himself, because,\nBesides being much averse from such a fate,\nThere were some other reasons: the first was,\nHe had been rather indisposed of late;\nAnd that which chiefly proved his saving clause\nWas a small present made to him at Cadiz,\nBy general subscription of the ladies.\n\nOf poor Pedrillo something still remain'd,\nBut was used sparingly,\u2014some were afraid,\nAnd others still their appetites constrain'd,\nOr but at times a little supper made;\nAll except Juan, who throughout abstain'd,\nChewing a piece of bamboo and some lead:\nAt length they caught two boobies and a noddy,\nAnd then they left off eating the dead body.\n\nAnd if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,\nRemember Ugolino condescends\nTo eat the head of his arch-enemy\nThe moment after he politely ends\nHis tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea\n'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,\nWhen shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,\nWithout being much more horrible than Dante.\n\nAnd the same night there fell a shower of rain,\nFor which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth\nWhen dried to summer dust; till taught by pain\nMen really know not what good water 's worth;\nIf you had been in Turkey or in Spain,\nOr with a famish'd boat's-crew had your berth,\nOr in the desert heard the camel's bell,\nYou 'd wish yourself where Truth is\u2014in a well.\n\nIt pour'd down torrents, but they were no richer\nUntil they found a ragged piece of sheet,\nWhich served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,\nAnd when they deem'd its moisture was complete\nThey wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher\nMight not have thought the scanty draught so sweet\nAs a full pot of porter, to their thinking\nThey ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.\n\nAnd their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,\nSuck'd in the moisture, which like nectar stream'd;\nTheir throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,\nAs the rich man's in hell, who vainly scream'd\nTo beg the beggar, who could not rain back\nA drop of dew, when every drop had seem'd\nTo taste of heaven\u2014If this be true, indeed\nSome Christians have a comfortable creed.\n\nThere were two fathers in this ghastly crew,\nAnd with them their two sons, of whom the one\nWas more robust and hardy to the view,\nBut he died early; and when he was gone,\nHis nearest messmate told his sire, who threw\nOne glance at him, and said, 'Heaven's will be done!\nI can do nothing,' and he saw him thrown\nInto the deep without a tear or groan.\n\nThe other father had a weaklier child,\nOf a soft cheek and aspect delicate;\nBut the boy bore up long, and with a mild\nAnd patient spirit held aloof his fate;\nLittle he said, and now and then he smiled,\nAs if to win a part from off the weight\nHe saw increasing on his father's heart,\nWith the deep deadly thought that they must part.\n\nAnd o'er him bent his sire, and never raised\nHis eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam\nFrom his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,\nAnd when the wish'd-for shower at length was come,\nAnd the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,\nBrighten'd, and for a moment seem'd to roam,\nHe squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain\nInto his dying child's mouth\u2014but in vain.\n\nThe boy expired\u2014the father held the clay,\nAnd look'd upon it long, and when at last\nDeath left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay\nStiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,\nHe watch'd it wistfully, until away\n'T was borne by the rude wave wherein 't was cast;\nThen he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,\nAnd gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.\n\nNow overhead a rainbow, bursting through\nThe scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,\nResting its bright base on the quivering blue;\nAnd all within its arch appear'd to be\nClearer than that without, and its wide hue\nWax'd broad and waving, like a banner free,\nThen changed like to a bow that 's bent, and then\nForsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck'd men.\n\nIt changed, of course; a heavenly chameleon,\nThe airy child of vapour and the sun,\nBrought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,\nBaptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,\nGlittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,\nAnd blending every colour into one,\nJust like a black eye in a recent scuffle\n(For sometimes we must box without the muffle).\n\nOur shipwreck'd seamen thought it a good omen\u2014\nIt is as well to think so, now and then;\n'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,\nAnd may become of great advantage when\nFolks are discouraged; and most surely no men\nHad greater need to nerve themselves again\nThan these, and so this rainbow look'd like hope\u2014\nQuite a celestial kaleidoscope.\n\nAbout this time a beautiful white bird,\nWebfooted, not unlike a dove in size\nAnd plumage (probably it might have err'd\nUpon its course), pass'd oft before their eyes,\nAnd tried to perch, although it saw and heard\nThe men within the boat, and in this guise\nIt came and went, and flutter'd round them till\nNight fell: this seem'd a better omen still.\n\nBut in this case I also must remark,\n'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,\nBecause the tackle of our shatter'd bark\nWas not so safe for roosting as a church;\nAnd had it been the dove from Noah's ark,\nReturning there from her successful search,\nWhich in their way that moment chanced to fall,\nThey would have eat her, olive-branch and all.\n\nWith twilight it again came on to blow,\nBut not with violence; the stars shone out,\nThe boat made way; yet now they were so low,\nThey knew not where nor what they were about;\nSome fancied they saw land, and some said 'No!'\nThe frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt\u2014\nSome swore that they heard breakers, others guns,\nAnd all mistook about the latter once.\n\nAs morning broke, the light wind died away,\nWhen he who had the watch sung out and swore,\nIf 't was not land that rose with the sun's ray,\nHe wish'd that land he never might see more;\nAnd the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,\nOr thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;\nFor shore it was, and gradually grew\nDistinct, and high, and palpable to view.\n\nAnd then of these some part burst into tears,\nAnd others, looking with a stupid stare,\nCould not yet separate their hopes from fears,\nAnd seem'd as if they had no further care;\nWhile a few pray'd (the first time for some years)\u2014\nAnd at the bottom of the boat three were\nAsleep: they shook them by the hand and head,\nAnd tried to awaken them, but found them dead.\n\nThe day before, fast sleeping on the water,\nThey found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,\nAnd by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,\nWhich yielded a day's life, and to their mind\nProved even still a more nutritious matter,\nBecause it left encouragement behind:\nThey thought that in such perils, more than chance\nHad sent them this for their deliverance.\n\nThe land appear'd a high and rocky coast,\nAnd higher grew the mountains as they drew,\nSet by a current, toward it: they were lost\nIn various conjectures, for none knew\nTo what part of the earth they had been tost,\nSo changeable had been the winds that blew;\nSome thought it was Mount AEtna, some the highlands,\nOf Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.\n\nMeantime the current, with a rising gale,\nStill set them onwards to the welcome shore,\nLike Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:\nTheir living freight was now reduced to four,\nAnd three dead, whom their strength could not avail\nTo heave into the deep with those before,\nThough the two sharks still follow'd them, and dash'd\nThe spray into their faces as they splash'd.\n\nFamine, despair, cold, thirst, and heat, had done\nTheir work on them by turns, and thinn'd them to\nSuch things a mother had not known her son\nAmidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;\nBy night chill'd, by day scorch'd, thus one by one\nThey perish'd, until wither'd to these few,\nBut chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,\nIn washing down Pedrillo with salt water.\n\nAs they drew nigh the land, which now was seen\nUnequal in its aspect here and there,\nThey felt the freshness of its growing green,\nThat waved in forest-tops, and smooth'd the air,\nAnd fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen\nFrom glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare\u2014\nLovely seem'd any object that should sweep\nAway the vast, salt, dread, eternal deep.\n\nThe shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,\nAnd girt by formidable waves; but they\nWere mad for land, and thus their course they ran,\nThough right ahead the roaring breakers lay:\nA reef between them also now began\nTo show its boiling surf and bounding spray,\nBut finding no place for their landing better,\nThey ran the boat for shore,\u2014and overset her.\n\nBut in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,\nJuan to lave his youthful limbs was won't;\nAnd having learnt to swim in that sweet river,\nHad often turn'd the art to some account:\nA better swimmer you could scarce see ever,\nHe could, perhaps, have pass'd the Hellespont,\nAs once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)\nLeander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.\n\nSo here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,\nHe buoy'd his boyish limbs, and strove to ply\nWith the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,\nThe beach which lay before him, high and dry:\nThe greatest danger here was from a shark,\nThat carried off his neighbour by the thigh;\nAs for the other two, they could not swim,\nSo nobody arrived on shore but him.\n\nNor yet had he arrived but for the oar,\nWhich, providentially for him, was wash'd\nJust as his feeble arms could strike no more,\nAnd the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 't was dash'd\nWithin his grasp; he clung to it, and sore\nThe waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;\nAt last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he\nRoll'd on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:\n\nThere, breathless, with his digging nails he clung\nFast to the sand, lest the returning wave,\nFrom whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,\nShould suck him back to her insatiate grave:\nAnd there he lay, full length, where he was flung,\nBefore the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,\nWith just enough of life to feel its pain,\nAnd deem that it was saved, perhaps in vain.\n\nWith slow and staggering effort he arose,\nBut sunk again upon his bleeding knee\nAnd quivering hand; and then he look'd for those\nWho long had been his mates upon the sea;\nBut none of them appear'd to share his woes,\nSave one, a corpse, from out the famish'd three,\nWho died two days before, and now had found\nAn unknown barren beach for burial ground.\n\nAnd as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,\nAnd down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand\nSwam round and round, and all his senses pass'd:\nHe fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand\nDroop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),\nAnd, like a wither'd lily, on the land\nHis slender frame and pallid aspect lay,\nAs fair a thing as e'er was form'd of clay.\n\nHow long in his damp trance young Juan lay\nHe knew not, for the earth was gone for him,\nAnd Time had nothing more of night nor day\nFor his congealing blood, and senses dim;\nAnd how this heavy faintness pass'd away\nHe knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,\nAnd tingling vein, seem'd throbbing back to life,\nFor Death, though vanquish'd, still retired with strife.\n\nHis eyes he open'd, shut, again unclosed,\nFor all was doubt and dizziness; he thought\nHe still was in the boat and had but dozed,\nAnd felt again with his despair o'erwrought,\nAnd wish'd it death in which he had reposed;\nAnd then once more his feelings back were brought,\nAnd slowly by his swimming eyes was seen\nA lovely female face of seventeen.\n\n'T was bending dose o'er his, and the small mouth\nSeem'd almost prying into his for breath;\nAnd chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth\nRecall'd his answering spirits back from death;\nAnd, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe\nEach pulse to animation, till beneath\nIts gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh\nTo these kind efforts made a low reply.\n\nThen was the cordial pour'd, and mantle flung\nAround his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm\nRaised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;\nAnd her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,\nPillow'd his death-like forehead; then she wrung\nHis dewy curls, long drench'd by every storm;\nAnd watch'd with eagerness each throb that drew\nA sigh from his heaved bosom\u2014and hers, too.\n\nAnd lifting him with care into the cave,\nThe gentle girl and her attendant,\u2014one\nYoung, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,\nAnd more robust of figure,\u2014then begun\nTo kindle fire, and as the new flames gave\nLight to the rocks that roof'd them, which the sun\nHad never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er\nShe was, appear'd distinct, and tall, and fair.\n\nHer brow was overhung with coins of gold,\nThat sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair\u2014\nHer clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll'd\nIn braids behind; and though her stature were\nEven of the highest for a female mould,\nThey nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air\nThere was a something which bespoke command,\nAs one who was a lady in the land.\n\nHer hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes\nWere black as death, their lashes the same hue,\nOf downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies\nDeepest attraction; for when to the view\nForth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,\nNe'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;\n'T is as the snake late coil'd, who pours his length,\nAnd hurls at once his venom and his strength.\n\nHer brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye\nLike twilight rosy still with the set sun;\nShort upper lip\u2014sweet lips! that make us sigh\nEver to have seen such; for she was one\nFit for the model of a statuary\n(A race of mere impostors, when all 's done\u2014\nI 've seen much finer women, ripe and real,\nThan all the nonsense of their stone ideal).\n\nI 'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just\nOne should not rail without a decent cause:\nThere was an Irish lady, to whose bust\nI ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was\nA frequent model; and if e'er she must\nYield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,\nThey will destroy a face which mortal thought\nNe'er compass'd, nor less mortal chisel wrought.\n\nAnd such was she, the lady of the cave:\nHer dress was very different from the Spanish,\nSimpler, and yet of colours not so grave;\nFor, as you know, the Spanish women banish\nBright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave\nAround them (what I hope will never vanish)\nThe basquina and the mantilla, they\nSeem at the same time mystical and gay.\n\nBut with our damsel this was not the case:\nHer dress was many-colour'd, finely spun;\nHer locks curl'd negligently round her face,\nBut through them gold and gems profusely shone:\nHer girdle sparkled, and the richest lace\nFlow'd in her veil, and many a precious stone\nFlash'd on her little hand; but, what was shocking,\nHer small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.\n\nThe other female's dress was not unlike,\nBut of inferior materials: she\nHad not so many ornaments to strike,\nHer hair had silver only, bound to be\nHer dowry; and her veil, in form alike,\nWas coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;\nHer hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes\nAs black, but quicker, and of smaller size.\n\nAnd these two tended him, and cheer'd him both\nWith food and raiment, and those soft attentions,\nWhich are (as I must own) of female growth,\nAnd have ten thousand delicate inventions:\nThey made a most superior mess of broth,\nA thing which poesy but seldom mentions,\nBut the best dish that e'er was cook'd since Homer's\nAchilles ordered dinner for new comers.\n\nI 'll tell you who they were, this female pair,\nLest they should seem princesses in disguise;\nBesides, I hate all mystery, and that air\nOf clap-trap which your recent poets prize;\nAnd so, in short, the girls they really were\nThey shall appear before your curious eyes,\nMistress and maid; the first was only daughter\nOf an old man who lived upon the water.\n\nA fisherman he had been in his youth,\nAnd still a sort of fisherman was he;\nBut other speculations were, in sooth,\nAdded to his connection with the sea,\nPerhaps not so respectable, in truth:\nA little smuggling, and some piracy,\nLeft him, at last, the sole of many masters\nOf an ill-gotten million of piastres.\n\nA fisher, therefore, was he,\u2014though of men,\nLike Peter the Apostle,\u2014and he fish'd\nFor wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,\nAnd sometimes caught as many as he wish'd;\nThe cargoes he confiscated, and gain\nHe sought in the slave-market too, and dish'd\nFull many a morsel for that Turkish trade,\nBy which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.\n\nHe was a Greek, and on his isle had built\n(One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)\nA very handsome house from out his guilt,\nAnd there he lived exceedingly at ease;\nHeaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,\nA sad old fellow was he, if you please;\nBut this I know, it was a spacious building,\nFull of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.\n\nHe had an only daughter, call'd Haidee,\nThe greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;\nBesides, so very beautiful was she,\nHer dowry was as nothing to her smiles:\nStill in her teens, and like a lovely tree\nShe grew to womanhood, and between whiles\nRejected several suitors, just to learn\nHow to accept a better in his turn.\n\nAnd walking out upon the beach, below\nThe cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,\nInsensible,\u2014not dead, but nearly so,\u2014\nDon Juan, almost famish'd, and half drown'd;\nBut being naked, she was shock'd, you know,\nYet deem'd herself in common pity bound,\nAs far as in her lay, 'to take him in,\nA stranger' dying, with so white a skin.\n\nBut taking him into her father's house\nWas not exactly the best way to save,\nBut like conveying to the cat the mouse,\nOr people in a trance into their grave;\nBecause the good old man had so much 'nous,'\nUnlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,\nHe would have hospitably cured the stranger,\nAnd sold him instantly when out of danger.\n\nAnd therefore, with her maid, she thought it best\n(A virgin always on her maid relies)\nTo place him in the cave for present rest:\nAnd when, at last, he open'd his black eyes,\nTheir charity increased about their guest;\nAnd their compassion grew to such a size,\nIt open'd half the turnpike-gates to heaven\n(St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).\n\nThey made a fire,\u2014but such a fire as they\nUpon the moment could contrive with such\nMaterials as were cast up round the bay,\u2014\nSome broken planks, and oars, that to the touch\nWere nearly tinder, since so long they lay\nA mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;\nBut, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,\nThat there was fuel to have furnish'd twenty.\n\nHe had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,\nFor Haidee stripped her sables off to make\nHis couch; and, that he might be more at ease,\nAnd warm, in case by chance he should awake,\nThey also gave a petticoat apiece,\nShe and her maid\u2014and promised by daybreak\nTo pay him a fresh visit, with a dish\nFor breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.\n\nAnd thus they left him to his lone repose:\nJuan slept like a top, or like the dead,\nWho sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),\nJust for the present; and in his lull'd head\nNot even a vision of his former woes\nThrobb'd in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread\nUnwelcome visions of our former years,\nTill the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.\n\nYoung Juan slept all dreamless:\u2014but the maid,\nWho smooth'd his pillow, as she left the den\nLook'd back upon him, and a moment stay'd,\nAnd turn'd, believing that he call'd again.\nHe slumber'd; yet she thought, at least she said\n(The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),\nHe had pronounced her name\u2014but she forgot\nThat at this moment Juan knew it not.\n\nAnd pensive to her father's house she went,\nEnjoining silence strict to Zoe, who\nBetter than her knew what, in fact, she meant,\nShe being wiser by a year or two:\nA year or two 's an age when rightly spent,\nAnd Zoe spent hers, as most women do,\nIn gaining all that useful sort of knowledge\nWhich is acquired in Nature's good old college.\n\nThe morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still\nFast in his cave, and nothing clash'd upon\nHis rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,\nAnd the young beams of the excluded sun,\nTroubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;\nAnd need he had of slumber yet, for none\nHad suffer'd more\u2014his hardships were comparative\nTo those related in my grand-dad's 'Narrative.'\n\nNot so Haidee: she sadly toss'd and tumbled,\nAnd started from her sleep, and, turning o'er\nDream'd of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,\nAnd handsome corpses strew'd upon the shore;\nAnd woke her maid so early that she grumbled,\nAnd call'd her father's old slaves up, who swore\nIn several oaths\u2014Armenian, Turk, and Greek\u2014\nThey knew not what to think of such a freak.\n\nBut up she got, and up she made them get,\nWith some pretence about the sun, that makes\nSweet skies just when he rises, or is set;\nAnd 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks\nBright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet\nWith mist, and every bird with him awakes,\nAnd night is flung off like a mourning suit\nWorn for a husband,\u2014or some other brute.\n\nI say, the sun is a most glorious sight,\nI 've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late\nI have sat up on purpose all the night,\nWhich hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;\nAnd so all ye, who would be in the right\nIn health and purse, begin your day to date\nFrom daybreak, and when coffin'd at fourscore,\nEngrave upon the plate, you rose at four.\n\nAnd Haidee met the morning face to face;\nHer own was freshest, though a feverish flush\nHad dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race\nFrom heart to cheek is curb'd into a blush,\nLike to a torrent which a mountain's base,\nThat overpowers some Alpine river's rush,\nChecks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;\nOr the Red Sea\u2014but the sea is not red.\n\nAnd down the cliff the island virgin came,\nAnd near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,\nWhile the sun smiled on her with his first flame,\nAnd young Aurora kiss'd her lips with dew,\nTaking her for a sister; just the same\nMistake you would have made on seeing the two,\nAlthough the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,\nHad all the advantage, too, of not being air.\n\nAnd when into the cavern Haidee stepp'd\nAll timidly, yet rapidly, she saw\nThat like an infant Juan sweetly slept;\nAnd then she stopp'd, and stood as if in awe\n(For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept\nAnd wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,\nShould reach his blood, then o'er him still as death\nBent with hush'd lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.\n\nAnd thus like to an angel o'er the dying\nWho die in righteousness, she lean'd; and there\nAll tranquilly the shipwreck'd boy was lying,\nAs o'er him the calm and stirless air:\nBut Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,\nSince, after all, no doubt the youthful pair\nMust breakfast\u2014and betimes, lest they should ask it,\nShe drew out her provision from the basket.\n\nShe knew that the best feelings must have victual,\nAnd that a shipwreck'd youth would hungry be;\nBesides, being less in love, she yawn'd a little,\nAnd felt her veins chill'd by the neighbouring sea;\nAnd so, she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle;\nI can't say that she gave them any tea,\nBut there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,\nWith Scio wine,\u2014and all for love, not money.\n\nAnd Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and\nThe coffee made, would fain have waken'd Juan;\nBut Haidee stopp'd her with her quick small hand,\nAnd without word, a sign her finger drew on\nHer lip, which Zoe needs must understand;\nAnd, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,\nBecause her mistress would not let her break\nThat sleep which seem'd as it would ne'er awake.\n\nFor still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek\nA purple hectic play'd like dying day\nOn the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak\nOf sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,\nWhere the blue veins look'd shadowy, shrunk, and weak;\nAnd his black curls were dewy with the spray,\nWhich weigh'd upon them yet, all damp and salt,\nMix'd with the stony vapours of the vault.\n\nAnd she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,\nHush'd as the babe upon its mother's breast,\nDroop'd as the willow when no winds can breathe,\nLull'd like the depth of ocean when at rest,\nFair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,\nSoft as the callow cygnet in its nest;\nIn short, he was a very pretty fellow,\nAlthough his woes had turn'd him rather yellow.\n\nHe woke and gazed, and would have slept again,\nBut the fair face which met his eyes forbade\nThose eyes to close, though weariness and pain\nHad further sleep a further pleasure made;\nFor woman's face was never form'd in vain\nFor Juan, so that even when he pray'd\nHe turn'd from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,\nTo the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.\n\nAnd thus upon his elbow he arose,\nAnd look'd upon the lady, in whose cheek\nThe pale contended with the purple rose,\nAs with an effort she began to speak;\nHer eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,\nAlthough she told him, in good modern Greek,\nWith an Ionian accent, low and sweet,\nThat he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.\n\nNow Juan could not understand a word,\nBeing no Grecian; but he had an ear,\nAnd her voice was the warble of a bird,\nSo soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,\nThat finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;\nThe sort of sound we echo with a tear,\nWithout knowing why\u2014an overpowering tone,\nWhence Melody descends as from a throne.\n\nAnd Juan gazed as one who is awoke\nBy a distant organ, doubting if he be\nNot yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke\nBy the watchman, or some such reality,\nOr by one's early valet's cursed knock;\nAt least it is a heavy sound to me,\nWho like a morning slumber\u2014for the night\nShows stars and women in a better light.\n\nAnd Juan, too, was help'd out from his dream,\nOr sleep, or whatso'er it was, by feeling\nA most prodigious appetite: the steam\nOf Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing\nUpon his senses, and the kindling beam\nOf the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling\nTo stir her viands, made him quite awake\nAnd long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.\n\nBut beef is rare within these oxless isles;\nGoat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton;\nAnd, when a holiday upon them smiles,\nA joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:\nBut this occurs but seldom, between whiles,\nFor some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;\nOthers are fair and fertile, among which\nThis, though not large, was one of the most rich.\n\nI say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking\nThat the old fable of the Minotaur\u2014\nFrom which our modern morals rightly shrinking\nCondemn the royal lady's taste who wore\nA cow's shape for a mask\u2014was only (sinking\nThe allegory) a mere type, no more,\nThat Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,\nTo make the Cretans bloodier in battle.\n\nFor we all know that English people are\nFed upon beef\u2014I won't say much of beer,\nBecause 't is liquor only, and being far\nFrom this my subject, has no business here;\nWe know, too, they very fond of war,\nA pleasure\u2014like all pleasures\u2014rather dear;\nSo were the Cretans\u2014from which I infer\nThat beef and battles both were owing to her.\n\nBut to resume. The languid Juan raised\nHis head upon his elbow, and he saw\nA sight on which he had not lately gazed,\nAs all his latter meals had been quite raw,\nThree or four things, for which the Lord he praised,\nAnd, feeling still the famish'd vulture gnaw,\nHe fell upon whate'er was offer'd, like\nA priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.\n\nHe ate, and he was well supplied: and she,\nWho watch'd him like a mother, would have fed\nHim past all bounds, because she smiled to see\nSuch appetite in one she had deem'd dead;\nBut Zoe, being older than Haidee,\nKnew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)\nThat famish'd people must be slowly nurst,\nAnd fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.\n\nAnd so she took the liberty to state,\nRather by deeds than words, because the case\nWas urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate\nHad made her mistress quit her bed to trace\nThe sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,\nUnless he wish'd to die upon the place\u2014\nShe snatch'd it, and refused another morsel,\nSaying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.\n\nNext they\u2014he being naked, save a tatter'd\nPair of scarce decent trowsers\u2014went to work,\nAnd in the fire his recent rags they scatter'd,\nAnd dress'd him, for the present, like a Turk,\nOr Greek\u2014that is, although it not much matter'd,\nOmitting turban, slippers, pistols, dirk,\u2014\nThey furnish'd him, entire, except some stitches,\nWith a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.\n\nAnd then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,\nBut not a word could Juan comprehend,\nAlthough he listen'd so that the young Greek in\nHer earnestness would ne'er have made an end;\nAnd, as he interrupted not, went eking\nHer speech out to her protege and friend,\nTill pausing at the last her breath to take,\nShe saw he did not understand Romaic.\n\nAnd then she had recourse to nods, and signs,\nAnd smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,\nAnd read (the only book she could) the lines\nOf his fair face, and found, by sympathy,\nThe answer eloquent, where soul shines\nAnd darts in one quick glance a long reply;\nAnd thus in every look she saw exprest\nA world of words, and things at which she guess'd.\n\nAnd now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,\nAnd words repeated after her, he took\nA lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,\nNo doubt, less of her language than her look:\nAs he who studies fervently the skies\nTurns oftener to the stars than to his book,\nThus Juan learn'd his alpha beta better\nFrom Haidee's glance than any graven letter.\n\n'T is pleasing to be school'd in a strange tongue\nBy female lips and eyes\u2014that is, I mean,\nWhen both the teacher and the taught are young,\nAs was the case, at least, where I have been;\nThey smile so when one 's right, and when one 's wrong\nThey smile still more, and then there intervene\nPressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;\u2014\nI learn'd the little that I know by this:\n\nThat is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,\nItalian not at all, having no teachers;\nMuch English I cannot pretend to speak,\nLearning that language chiefly from its preachers,\nBarrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week\nI study, also Blair, the highest reachers\nOf eloquence in piety and prose\u2014\nI hate your poets, so read none of those.\n\nAs for the ladies, I have nought to say,\nA wanderer from the British world of fashion,\nWhere I, like other 'dogs, have had my day,'\nLike other men, too, may have had my passion\u2014\nBut that, like other things, has pass'd away,\nAnd all her fools whom I could lay the lash on:\nFoes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me\nBut dreams of what has been, no more to be.\n\nReturn we to Don Juan. He begun\nTo hear new words, and to repeat them; but\nSome feelings, universal as the sun,\nWere such as could not in his breast be shut\nMore than within the bosom of a nun:\nHe was in love,\u2014as you would be, no doubt,\nWith a young benefactress,\u2014so was she,\nJust in the way we very often see.\n\nAnd every day by daybreak\u2014rather early\nFor Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest\u2014\nShe came into the cave, but it was merely\nTo see her bird reposing in his nest;\nAnd she would softly stir his locks so curly,\nWithout disturbing her yet slumbering guest,\nBreathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,\nAs o'er a bed of roses the sweet south.\n\nAnd every morn his colour freshlier came,\nAnd every day help'd on his convalescence;\n'T was well, because health in the human frame\nIs pleasant, besides being true love's essence,\nFor health and idleness to passion's flame\nAre oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons\nAre also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,\nWithout whom Venus will not long attack us.\n\nWhile Venus fills the heart (without heart really\nLove, though good always, is not quite so good),\nCeres presents a plate of vermicelli,\u2014\nFor love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood,\u2014\nWhile Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:\nEggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;\nBut who is their purveyor from above\nHeaven knows,\u2014it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.\n\nWhen Juan woke he found some good things ready,\nA bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes\nThat ever made a youthful heart less steady,\nBesides her maid's as pretty for their size;\nBut I have spoken of all this already\u2014\nAnd repetition 's tiresome and unwise,\u2014\nWell\u2014Juan, after bathing in the sea,\nCame always back to coffee and Haidee.\n\nBoth were so young, and one so innocent,\nThat bathing pass'd for nothing; Juan seem'd\nTo her, as 'twere, the kind of being sent,\nOf whom these two years she had nightly dream'd,\nA something to be loved, a creature meant\nTo be her happiness, and whom she deem'd\nTo render happy; all who joy would win\nMust share it,\u2014Happiness was born a twin.\n\nIt was such pleasure to behold him, such\nEnlargement of existence to partake\nNature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,\nTo watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:\nTo live with him forever were too much;\nBut then the thought of parting made her quake;\nHe was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast\nLike a rich wreck\u2014her first love, and her last.\n\nAnd thus a moon roll'd on, and fair Haidee\nPaid daily visits to her boy, and took\nSuch plentiful precautions, that still he\nRemain'd unknown within his craggy nook;\nAt last her father's prows put out to sea\nFor certain merchantmen upon the look,\nNot as of yore to carry off an Io,\nBut three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.\n\nThen came her freedom, for she had no mother,\nSo that, her father being at sea, she was\nFree as a married woman, or such other\nFemale, as where she likes may freely pass,\nWithout even the incumbrance of a brother,\nThe freest she that ever gazed on glass;\nI speak of Christian lands in this comparison,\nWhere wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.\n\nNow she prolong'd her visits and her talk\n(For they must talk), and he had learnt to say\nSo much as to propose to take a walk,\u2014\nFor little had he wander'd since the day\nOn which, like a young flower snapp'd from the stalk,\nDrooping and dewy on the beach he lay,\u2014\nAnd thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,\nAnd saw the sun set opposite the moon.\n\nIt was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,\nWith cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,\nGuarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,\nWith here and there a creek, whose aspect wore\nA better welcome to the tempest-tost;\nAnd rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,\nSave on the dead long summer days, which make\nThe outstretch'd ocean glitter like a lake.\n\nAnd the small ripple spilt upon the beach\nScarcely o'erpass'd the cream of your champagne,\nWhen o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,\nThat spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!\nFew things surpass old wine; and they may preach\nWho please,\u2014the more because they preach in vain,\u2014\nLet us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,\nSermons and soda-water the day after.\n\nMan, being reasonable, must get drunk;\nThe best of life is but intoxication:\nGlory, the grape, love, gold, in these are sunk\nThe hopes of all men, and of every nation;\nWithout their sap, how branchless were the trunk\nOf life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:\nBut to return,\u2014Get very drunk; and when\nYou wake with headache, you shall see what then.\n\nRing for your valet\u2014bid him quickly bring\nSome hock and soda-water, then you 'll know\nA pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;\nFor not the bless'd sherbet, sublimed with snow,\nNor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,\nNor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,\nAfter long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,\nVie with that draught of hock and soda-water.\n\nThe coast\u2014I think it was the coast that\nWas just describing\u2014Yes, it was the coast\u2014\nLay at this period quiet as the sky,\nThe sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,\nAnd all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,\nAnd dolphin's leap, and little billow crost\nBy some low rock or shelve, that made it fret\nAgainst the boundary it scarcely wet.\n\nAnd forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,\nAs I have said, upon an expedition;\nAnd mother, brother, guardian, she had none,\nSave Zoe, who, although with due precision\nShe waited on her lady with the sun,\nThought daily service was her only mission,\nBringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,\nAnd asking now and then for cast-off dresses.\n\nIt was the cooling hour, just when the rounded\nRed sun sinks down behind the azure hill,\nWhich then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,\nCircling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,\nWith the far mountain-crescent half surrounded\nOn one side, and the deep sea calm and chill\nUpon the other, and the rosy sky,\nWith one star sparkling through it like an eye.\n\nAnd thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,\nOver the shining pebbles and the shells,\nGlided along the smooth and harden'd sand,\nAnd in the worn and wild receptacles\nWork'd by the storms, yet work'd as it were plann'd,\nIn hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,\nThey turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,\nYielded to the deep twilight's purple charm.\n\nThey look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow\nSpread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;\nThey gazed upon the glittering sea below,\nWhence the broad moon rose circling into sight;\nThey heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,\nAnd saw each other's dark eyes darting light\nInto each other\u2014and, beholding this,\nTheir lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;\n\nA long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love,\nAnd beauty, all concentrating like rays\nInto one focus, kindled from above;\nSuch kisses as belong to early days,\nWhere heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,\nAnd the blood 's lava, and the pulse a blaze,\nEach kiss a heart-quake,\u2014for a kiss's strength,\nI think, it must be reckon'd by its length.\n\nBy length I mean duration; theirs endured\nHeaven knows how long\u2014no doubt they never reckon'd;\nAnd if they had, they could not have secured\nThe sum of their sensations to a second:\nThey had not spoken; but they felt allured,\nAs if their souls and lips each other beckon'd,\nWhich, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung\u2014\nTheir hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.\n\nThey were alone, but not alone as they\nWho shut in chambers think it loneliness;\nThe silent ocean, and the starlight bay,\nThe twilight glow which momently grew less,\nThe voiceless sands and dropping caves, that lay\nAround them, made them to each other press,\nAs if there were no life beneath the sky\nSave theirs, and that their life could never die.\n\nThey fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,\nThey felt no terrors from the night, they were\nAll in all to each other: though their speech\nWas broken words, they thought a language there,\u2014\nAnd all the burning tongues the passions teach\nFound in one sigh the best interpreter\nOf nature's oracle\u2014first love,\u2014that all\nWhich Eve has left her daughters since her fall.\n\nHaidde spoke not of scruples, ask'd no vows,\nNor offer'd any; she had never heard\nOf plight and promises to be a spouse,\nOr perils by a loving maid incurr'd;\nShe was all which pure ignorance allows,\nAnd flew to her young mate like a young bird;\nAnd, never having dreamt of falsehood, she\nHad not one word to say of constancy.\n\nShe loved, and was beloved\u2014she adored,\nAnd she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,\nTheir intense souls, into each other pour'd,\nIf souls could die, had perish'd in that passion,\u2014\nBut by degrees their senses were restored,\nAgain to be o'ercome, again to dash on;\nAnd, beating 'gainst his bosom, Haidee's heart\nFelt as if never more to beat apart.\n\nAlas! they were so young, so beautiful,\nSo lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour\nWas that in which the heart is always full,\nAnd, having o'er itself no further power,\nPrompts deeds eternity can not annul,\nBut pays off moments in an endless shower\nOf hell-fire\u2014all prepared for people giving\nPleasure or pain to one another living.\n\nAlas! for Juan and Haidee! they were\nSo loving and so lovely\u2014till then never,\nExcepting our first parents, such a pair\nHad run the risk of being damn'd for ever;\nAnd Haidee, being devout as well as fair,\nHad, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,\nAnd hell and purgatory\u2014but forgot\nJust in the very crisis she should not.\n\nThey look upon each other, and their eyes\nGleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps\nRound Juan's head, and his around her lies\nHalf buried in the tresses which it grasps;\nShe sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,\nHe hers, until they end in broken gasps;\nAnd thus they form a group that 's quite antique,\nHalf naked, loving, natural, and Greek.\n\nAnd when those deep and burning moments pass'd,\nAnd Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,\nShe slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,\nSustain'd his head upon her bosom's charms;\nAnd now and then her eye to heaven is cast,\nAnd then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,\nPillow'd on her o'erflowing heart, which pants\nWith all it granted, and with all it grants.\n\nAn infant when it gazes on a light,\nA child the moment when it drains the breast,\nA devotee when soars the Host in sight,\nAn Arab with a stranger for a guest,\nA sailor when the prize has struck in fight,\nA miser filling his most hoarded chest,\nFeel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping\nAs they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.\n\nFor there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,\nAll that it hath of life with us is living;\nSo gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,\nAnd all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;\nAll it hath felt, inflicted, pass'd, and proved,\nHush'd into depths beyond the watcher's diving:\nThere lies the thing we love with all its errors\nAnd all its charms, like death without its terrors.\n\nThe lady watch'd her lover\u2014and that hour\nOf Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude,\nO'erflow'd her soul with their united power;\nAmidst the barren sand and rocks so rude\nShe and her wave-worn love had made their bower,\nWhere nought upon their passion could intrude,\nAnd all the stars that crowded the blue space\nSaw nothing happier than her glowing face.\n\nAlas! the love of women! it is known\nTo be a lovely and a fearful thing;\nFor all of theirs upon that die is thrown,\nAnd if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring\nTo them but mockeries of the past alone,\nAnd their revenge is as the tiger's spring,\nDeadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real\nTorture is theirs, what they inflict they feel.\n\nThey are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,\nIs always so to women; one sole bond\nAwaits them, treachery is all their trust;\nTaught to conceal, their bursting hearts despond\nOver their idol, till some wealthier lust\nBuys them in marriage\u2014and what rests beyond?\nA thankless husband, next a faithless lover,\nThen dressing, nursing, praying, and all 's over.\n\nSome take a lover, some take drams or prayers,\nSome mind their household, others dissipation,\nSome run away, and but exchange their cares,\nLosing the advantage of a virtuous station;\nFew changes e'er can better their affairs,\nTheirs being an unnatural situation,\nFrom the dull palace to the dirty hovel:\nSome play the devil, and then write a novel.\n\nHaidee was Nature's bride, and knew not this;\nHaidee was Passion's child, born where the sun\nShowers triple light, and scorches even the kiss\nOf his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one\nMade but to love, to feel that she was his\nWho was her chosen: what was said or done\nElsewhere was nothing. She had naught to fear,\nHope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.\n\nAnd oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!\nHow much it costs us! yet each rising throb\nIs in its cause as its effect so sweet,\nThat Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob\nJoy of its alchymy, and to repeat\nFine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job\nTo make us understand each good old maxim,\nSo good\u2014I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.\n\nAnd now 't was done\u2014on the lone shore were plighted\nTheir hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed\nBeauty upon the beautiful they lighted:\nOcean their witness, and the cave their bed,\nBy their own feelings hallow'd and united,\nTheir priest was Solitude, and they were wed:\nAnd they were happy, for to their young eyes\nEach was an angel, and earth paradise.\n\nO, Love! of whom great Caesar was the suitor,\nTitus the master, Antony the slave,\nHorace, Catullus, scholars, Ovid tutor,\nSappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave\nAll those may leap who rather would be neuter\n(Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)\u2014\nO, Love! thou art the very god of evil,\nFor, after all, we cannot call thee devil.\n\nThou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,\nAnd jestest with the brows of mightiest men:\nCaesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,\nHave much employ'd the muse of history's pen;\nTheir lives and fortunes were extremely various,\nSuch worthies Time will never see again;\nYet to these four in three things the same luck holds,\nThey all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.\n\nThou mak'st philosophers; there 's Epicurus\nAnd Aristippus, a material crew!\nWho to immoral courses would allure us\nBy theories quite practicable too;\nIf only from the devil they would insure us,\nHow pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),\n'Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?'\nSo said the royal sage Sardanapalus.\n\nBut Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?\nAnd should he have forgotten her so soon?\nI can't but say it seems to me most truly\nPerplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon\nDoes these things for us, and whenever newly\nStrong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,\nElse how the devil is it that fresh features\nHave such a charm for us poor human creatures?\n\nI hate inconstancy\u2014I loathe, detest,\nAbhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made\nOf such quicksilver clay that in his breast\nNo permanent foundation can be laid;\nLove, constant love, has been my constant guest,\nAnd yet last night, being at a masquerade,\nI saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,\nWhich gave me some sensations like a villain.\n\nBut soon Philosophy came to my aid,\nAnd whisper'd, 'Think of every sacred tie!'\n'I will, my dear Philosophy!' I said,\n'But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!\nI'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,\nOr neither\u2014out of curiosity.'\n'Stop!' cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian\n(Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian);\n\n'Stop!' so I stopp'd.\u2014But to return: that which\nMen call inconstancy is nothing more\nThan admiration due where nature's rich\nProfusion with young beauty covers o'er\nSome favour'd object; and as in the niche\nA lovely statue we almost adore,\nThis sort of adoration of the real\nIs but a heightening of the 'beau ideal.'\n\n'T is the perception of the beautiful,\nA fine extension of the faculties,\nPlatonic, universal, wonderful,\nDrawn from the stars, and filter'd through the skies,\nWithout which life would be extremely dull;\nIn short, it is the use of our own eyes,\nWith one or two small senses added, just\nTo hint that flesh is form'd of fiery dust.\n\nYet 't is a painful feeling, and unwilling,\nFor surely if we always could perceive\nIn the same object graces quite as killing\nAs when she rose upon us like an Eve,\n'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling\n(For we must get them any how or grieve),\nWhereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,\nHow pleasant for the heart as well as liver!\n\nThe heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,\nBut changes night and day, too, like the sky;\nNow o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,\nAnd darkness and destruction as on high:\nBut when it hath been scorch'd, and pierced, and riven,\nIts storms expire in water-drops; the eye\nPours forth at last the heart's blood turn'd to tears,\nWhich make the English climate of our years.\n\nThe liver is the lazaret of bile,\nBut very rarely executes its function,\nFor the first passion stays there such a while,\nThat all the rest creep in and form a junction,\nLife knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil,\u2014\nRage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction,\u2014\nSo that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,\nLike earthquakes from the hidden fire call'd 'central,'\n\nIn the mean time, without proceeding more\nIn this anatomy, I 've finish'd now\nTwo hundred and odd stanzas as before,\nThat being about the number I 'll allow\nEach canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;\nAnd, laying down my pen, I make my bow,\nLeaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead\nFor them and theirs with all who deign to read.4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/907562", "artist_names": "Guy Marks", "full_title": "Loving You Has Made Me Bananas by\u00a0Guy\u00a0Marks",

ELLE\u2019S ROOM\n\"Perfect Day\" by Hoku plays as the credits play over\u2005shots\u2005of Elle getting\u2005ready for her day while a\u2005woman rides a bike through the CULA campus to the\u205fDelta\u205fNu\u205fsorority. The woman\u205farrives at Delta\u205fNu and hands a letter addressed to Elle to one of Elle\u2019s sorority sisters. The camera follows the sister through the sorority as we are treated to shots of Elle\u2019s things. Other sisters sign the card for Elle. Finally, two of Elle\u2019s sisters, Serena and Margot, pass the envelope underneath her door. Elle\u2019s dog Bruiser goes for the letter and brings it to her. She\u2019s talking on the phone.\n\nELLE: I love that restaurant! I heard Madonna went into labor there. Oh, gosh! I have to go shopping! I'll see you tonight. Bye.\n\nElle hangs up her phone.\n\nELLE: Bruiser, what's this?\nShe takes the letter out and reads it.\n\nELLE: \"Good luck tonight. Elle and Warner forever.\" Oh, that's so cute.\n\nShe blows a kiss to a framed photo of Warner.\nCUT TO: EXT. COMMON AREA\nElle approaches Serena and Margot.\n\nELLE: Oh, my gosh! You guys are so sweet! But I'm not positive it'll happen tonight.\n\nSERENA: Hello! He just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got the rock.\n\nMARGOT: Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six-carat diamond.\n\nELLE: Do you really think?\n\nSERENA: I can't believe you're getting engaged!\n\nELLE: Oh, my gosh\u2026 you guys have to help me pick out the perfect outfit.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BOUTIQUE\nBruiser watches from Elle\u2019s purse as Serena and Margot help Elle pick out a dress.\nMARGOT: Come on! I think you should go with the red. It's the color of confidence.\n\nSERENA: I don't understand why you're disregarding your signature color.\n\nELLE: He's proposing. I can't look like I would on any other date. This is the date. The night I'll always remember. I want to look special. Bridal. But not like I expect anything.\n\nOne of the store employees watches them and turns to one of her coworkers.\n\nEMPLOYEE: There's nothing I love more than a dumb blonde with daddy's plastic.\n\nShe rips the tag off of a red dress and brings it over to Elle.\n\nEMPLOYEE: Did you see this one? We just got it in yesterday.\n\nELLE: Is this low-viscosity rayon?\n\nEMPLOYEE: Yes. Of course.\n\nELLE: With a half-loop top-stitching on the hem?\n\nEMPLOYEE: Absolutely. It's one of a kind.\n\nElle hands the dress back.\n\nELLE: It's impossible to use a half-loop top-stitching on low-viscosity rayon. It would snag the fabric. And you didn't just get it in. I saw it in the June Vogue a year ago. So if you're trying to sell it  to me for full price you picked the wrong girl.\nThe employee\u2019s face falls.\n\nMARGOT: Ow.\n\nThe employee walks away. Elle\u2019s sisters join her in front of the mirror.\n\nELLE: Girls, this is it. In a few hours I'll be the future Mrs. Warner Huntington III.\n\nThey all get excited.\nCUT TO: EXT. DELTA NU\nWarner knocks on the door of the sorority. One of the sisters answers and lets him in.\n\nWARNER: Hello.\n\nHe walks further in. Elle comes down the stairs in a red dress, accompanied by Bruiser.\n\nWARNER: Wow. You look so beautiful.\n\nELLE: So do you.\n\nThe camera pans to show many of the sorority sisters watching the couple from a few feet away. Elle and Warner kiss.\n\nWARNER: Let's get out of here.\n\nWarner walks away as Elle and her sisters watch. They help her with some last minute preparations and ogle as she leaves.\nCUT TO: INT. RESTAURANT\nElle and Warner sit at a table in a restaurant. A waiter opens a bottle of wine for them and pours it.\n\nELLE: Must be strange having such perfect eyes.\n\nWARNER: God, you're so wonderful. Elle, thank you.\n\nELLE: Here's to us.\n\nWARNER: To us.\n\nThey clink their wine glasses together.\n\nWARNER: Elle\u2026\n\nELLE: Yes?\n\nWARNER: One of the reasons I wanted to come here tonight was to discuss our future.\n\nELLE: And I am fully amenable to that discussion.\n\nWARNER: Good. Well, you know how we've been having all kinds of fun lately?\n\nELLE: Yeah.\n\nWARNER: Well, Harvard is gonna be different. Law school is a completely different world and I need to be serious.\n\nELLE: Of course.\n\nWARNER: I mean, my family expects a lot from me.\n\nELLE: Right.\n\nWARNER: I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office someday.\n\nELLE: And I fully support that, Warner. You know that.\n\nWARNER: Absolutely. But the thing is if I'm going to be a senator by the time I'm thirty I need to stop dicking around.\n\nELLE: Warner, I completely agree.\n\nWARNER: Well, that's why I think it's time for us. Elle, pooh bear...\n\nThey speak over each other.\n\nELLE: I do.\n\nWARNER: I think we should break up.\n\nThere\u2019s a pause as Elle registers what Warner has said.\n\nELLE: What?\n\nWARNER: Well, I've been thinking about it, and it's the right thing to do.\n\nELLE: You're breaking up with me? I thought you were proposing.\n\nWARNER: Proposing? Elle, if I'm going to be a senator, well, I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn.\n\nELLE: You're breaking up with me because I'm too blonde?\n\nWARNER: No. That's not entirely true.\n\nELLE: Then what? My boobs are too big?\n\nPeople at other tables begin glancing over at Elle and Warner.\n\nWARNER: Elle, your boobs are fine.\n\nELLE: So when you said that you would always love me you were just dicking around?\n\nAs he talks, Elle begins crying.\n\nWARNER: Elle, I do love you. I just can't marry you. You have no idea of the pressure that I am under. My family has five generations of senators. My brother's in the top three at Yale Law. And he just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for Christ's sake.\n\nElle\u2019s distressed crying gets louder. Warner makes eye contact with one of the couples watching.\n\nWARNER: Bad salad. Sweetie\u2026 Pooh bear?\n\nElle looks at him in disgust and then gets up and leaves.\n\nWARNER: It's not like I have a choice here, sweetheart! Okay\u2026 you get the car, I'll get the check.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. STREET\nElle is walking back to campus alone. Her crying has ruined her makeup. Warner pulls up in his car.\n\nWARNER: Let me take you home.\n\nELLE: No!\n\nWARNER: Elle, believe me. I never expected to do this\u2026 but I think it's the right thing.\n\nELLE: How can it be the right thing when we're not together?\n\nWARNER: Well, I have to think of my future, and what my family expects of me.\n\nELLE: So you're breaking up with me\u2026 because you're afraid your family won't like me? Everybody likes me.\n\nWARNER: Well, East coast people are different.\n\nELLE: Because I'm not a Vanderbilt, suddenly I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! Most people would agree that's a lot better than some stinky old Vanderbilt!\n\nWARNER: I told you. I need someone serious.\n\nELLE: But I'm seriously in love with you. Isn't that enough?\n\nWARNER: Pooh bear, just get in the car.\n\nELLE: No.\n\nWARNER: You\u2019re gonna ruin your shoes.\n\nELLE: ...Okay.\n\nElle gets in the car. Cut to them arriving at Delta Nu. Elle gets out of the car and walks away. She turns to say something, but Warner has already started driving away. Cut to the next morning. A sorority sister, Amy, walks through the sorority house and knocks on Elle\u2019s door.\n\nAMY:  Elle, it's Amy. I'm having trouble with this whole lip-liner thing.\n\nAnother sister approaches Amy.\n\nSISTER: Sweetie, didn't you hear?\n\nAMY: Hear what?\n\nSISTER: It's terrible. He dumped her.\n\nThe sister leads Amy away. Cut inside Elle\u2019s room. She\u2019s eating chocolate and watching an episode of General Hospital. Serena and Margot enter as she watches.\n\nWOMAN: Why me?\n\nMAN: Because you're not gonna remember anything after tonight.\n\nWOMAN: Oh, you're wrong. I will remember, no matter what. And I'm never gonna lose you again.\n\nMAN: You couldn't. You're a part of me. I love you.\n\nELLE: Liar!\n\nElle throws her chocolate at the TV.\n\nMARGOT: Honey, you have to leave this room. It's been, like, a week.\n\nELLE: So?\n\nMARGOT: Drink this.\n\nMargot hands her a drink.\n\nSERENA: What\u2019s the one thing that always makes us feel better no matter what?\n\nCUT TO: INT. SALON\nSerena and Margot are getting manicures. Serena talks to the manicurist.\n\nSERENA: She had eight grilled cheese sandwiches. She stuffed them in her mouth all at once. It was so sad. We all thought she'd be the first to walk down the aisle and now she's totally adrift.\n\nMARGOT: Totally.\n\nSERENA: She hasn't conditioned her hair in a week.\n\nElle sits on a nearby couch next to another woman. Elle picks up a magazine and begins reading.\n\nMARGOT: Maybe she's going for the grunge look. And her nails are full-on chipped. So trailer park.\n\nSERENA: (In another language) She\u2019ll never get him back with those cuticles.\n\nMANICURIST: (In another language) No shit.\n\nElle turns a page in the magazine she\u2019s reading. Her eyes go wide.\n\nELLE: Oh, my God! Do you know who this is?\n\nShe turns to the woman next to her.\n\nWOMAN: No.\n\nELLE: That's Warner's older brother!\n\nWOMAN: Who?\n\nELLE: \"Third year Yale Law student Putnam Bowes Huntington III and his fiancee Layne Walker Vanderbilt, first year Yale Law.\" This is the type of girl that Warner wants to marry! This is what I need to become to be serious!\n\nWOMAN: What, practically deformed?\n\nELLE: No. A law student.\n\nElle leaves the salon.\n\nMARGOT: Elle?\n\nCUT TO: EXT. POOL\nElle\u2019s father stands over her as she sits in their pool.\n\nELLE\u2019S FATHER: Law school?\n\nELLE: It's a perfectly respectable place, daddy.\n\nCut to a wider shot, revealing Elle\u2019s mother in a chair nearby and a worker raking leaves further away.\n\nELLE\u2019S MOTHER: Honey, you were first runner up at the Miss Hawaiian Tropics contest. Why are you gonna throw that all away?\n\nELLE: Going to Harvard is the only way I'm gonna get the love of my life back.\n\nELLE\u2019S FATHER: Oh, sweetheart, you don't need law school. Law school is for people who are boring and ugly and serious. And you, button, are none of those things.\n\nElle sighs.\nCUT TO: INT. OFFICE\nElle sits across a desk from an academic advisor. The advisor is looking at a folder of documents.\n\nADVISOR: Harvard Law School?\n\nELLE: That's right.\n\nADVISOR: But that's a top three school.\n\nELLE: Oh, I have a 4.0.\n\nADVISOR: Yes, but your major is fashion merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced History of Polka Dots.\n\nThe advisor sets the folder aside.\n\nADVISOR: What are your back-ups?\n\nELLE: I don't need back-ups. I'm going to Harvard.\n\nADVISOR: Well, then, you'll need excellent recommendations from your professors.\n\nELLE: Okay.\n\nADVISOR: And a heck of an admissions essay.\n\nELLE: Right.\n\nADVISOR: And at least a 175 on your LSATs.\n\nELLE: I once had to judge a tighty-whitey contest for Lambda Kappa Pi. Trust me, I can handle anything.\n\nElle smiles and leaves.\n\nELLE: Thanks!\n\nADVISOR: You're welcome.\n\nCUT TO: INT. DELTA NU\nSerena and Margot pass by Elle\u2019s room.\n\nMARGOT: Because I have a metrabolism... I have a really high metrab-\n\nSERENA: Metabolism. Metabo-\n\nThey stop and enter Elle\u2019s room when they see her surrounded by books and reading.\n\nMARGOT: Oh, my God. What are you doing?\n\nELLE: Reading about the LSATs.\n\nSERENA: My cousin had that. Apparently, you get a really bad rash on your-\n\nShe gestures down.\n\nMARGOT: Oh.\n\nELLE: The LSATs are an exam. Girls, I'm going to Harvard!\n\nSERENA: You mean like on vay-kay?\n\nMARGOT: Let's all go!\n\nSERENA & MARGOT: Road trip!\n\nThey begin cheering.\n\nELLE: No, I'm going to Harvard Law School!\n\nThey stop.\n\nMARGOT: Why?\n\nSerena sits down with Elle.\n\nSERENA: Elle, now, I know you're upset about all this, but can't you just take a Percocet?\n\nELLE: Okay, once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll totally want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!\n\nMARGOT: But isn't it hard to get into law school?\n\nELLE: I had the highest GPA in Delta Nu.\n\nMARGOT: Oh, well. Here, you're gonna need this.\n\nMargot hands Elle a scrunchie.\n\nELLE: Your scrunchie?\n\nMARGOT: My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.\n\nSERENA: You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a lap dance after the final.\n\nMARGOT: Yeah, luckily.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. POOL\nCut to Elle\u2019s video essay. The shot is blocked so as to imitate a VHS recording. She sits in her pool. A caption on the bottom reads, \u201cELLE WOODS HARVARD VIDEO ESSAY.\u201d\n\nELLE: Oh, hi. My name is Elle Woods, and for my admissions essay, I'm gonna tell all of you at Harvard why I'm gonna make an amazing lawyer.\n\nElle narrates over a shot of herself speaking at the head of a table of her sorority sisters.\n\nELLE: (Narrating) As president of my sorority I'm skilled at commanding the attention of a room and discussing very important issues.\n\nCut to a close up of Elle\u2019s face as she addresses her sisters.\n\nELLE: It has come to my attention that the maintenance staff is switching our toilet paper from Charmin to generic. All those opposed to chafing please say \"aye.\"\n\nSORORITY: (In unison) Aye.\n\nElle brings down a gavel. Cut away from her video essay to Amy helping Elle study in a library.\n\nAMY: A: Neither type of opera or neither type of rap is on sale. B: Neither type of jazz and neither type of opera is on sale. C: Neither type of opera and neither type of soul\u2026\n\nElle is distracted by fraternity brothers outside, shirtless and carrying a keg and snacks.\n\nBROTHER: Party! Delta Nu, we love you!\n\nAmy taps her pencil on the table, getting Elle\u2019s attention.\n\nAMY. Mm-mm.\n\nELLE: Okay.\n\nCut back to the video essay style of shot. Elle lazes on a floatie in her pool.\n\nELLE: I'm able to recall hundreds of important details at the drop of a hat.\n\nMargot enters the shot on another pool floatie.\n\nMARGOT: Hey, Elle, do you know what happened on Days of Our Lives yesterday?\n\nELLE: Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we join Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano.\n\nCut to the Delta Nu house. Amy and some other sisters are exercising while Elle sits at a table nearby with Bruiser. Amy holds up a stopwatch.\n\nAMY: Get set and go!\n\nAmy starts a timer. Elle begins writing. Cut to some time later. Margot writes 143 on Elle\u2019s practice LSAT.\n\nMARGOT: One forty-three.\n\nElle sighs. Cut back to her video essay. She walks down a busy sidewalk on campus.\n\nELLE: I feel comfortable using legal jargon in everyday life.\n\nSomeone whistles at Elle from out of shot.\n\nELLE: I object!\n\nCut to Elle taking the LSAT in a crowded room. She looks worried. Cut back to Delta Nu. Amy runs through the sorority house, followed by all of Elle\u2019s sisters, holding the results of Elle\u2019s LSAT.\n\nAMY: Elle, it's here!\n\nElle is walking down the stairs with Margot.\n\nELLE: What?\n\nAMY: It's here!\n\nAmy hands Elle the envelope with her score.\n\nMARGOT: The LSAT score! It\u2019s here!\n\nAll of her sisters gather around excitedly as she opens it.\n\nELLE: One seventy-nine!\n\nAll of Elle\u2019s sisters yell out in celebration. Margot and Serena hug her and lift her up as some other sisters use spray cans and confetti.\nCUT TO: INT. HARVARD\nCut back to Elle\u2019s video essay, which is now revealed to be playing on a TV in front of a Harvard admissions board.\n\nELLE: And that's why you should vote for me, Elle Woods, future lawyer for the class of 2004.\n\nOne of the admissions men stops the video. All six men continue staring for a few moments before one refocuses.\n\nADMISSION MAN 1: She does have a 4.0 from CULA, and she got a 179 on her LSATs.\n\nADMISSION MAN 2: A fashion major?\n\nADMISSION MAN 3: Well, sir, we've never had one before, and aren't we always looking for diversity?\n\nADMISSION MAN 4: Her list of extracurricular activities is impressive.\n\nADMISSION MAN 2: She was in a Ricky Martin video.\n\nADMISSION MAN 1: Clearly she's interested in music.\n\nADMISSION MAN 2: She also designed a line of faux fur panties for her sorority's charity project.\n\nADMISSION MAN 3: Uh huh. She's a friend to the animals as well as a philanthropist.\n\nADMISSION MAN 2: Elle Woods\u2026 Welcome to Harvard.\n\nThe camera zooms in on the paused TV with Elle\u2019s smiling face. Fade to some establishing shots of Elle driving to Harvard and of the Harvard campus itself.\nCUT TO: EXT. STREET\nElle sits in her convertible. Bruiser is in the passenger seat.\n\nELLE: Oh Bruiser, it's so exciting! Look! Harvard! Are you excited?\n\nBruiser barks. Cut to some moving men unloading some of Elle\u2019s things outside Wyeth House.\n\nELLE: This is our new house for the next three years.\n\nOther students approach apprehensively.\n\nELLE: Oh, are you thirsty? Let's get you some water. Sweetheart, you just look parched.\n\nElle sets Bruiser down. All around other students begin watching Elle.\n\nSTUDENT: Hey, Brad, check out Malibu Barbie! Where's the beach, honey?\n\nElle sets down a bowl and begins filling it with water for Bruiser.\n\nELLE: Here you go. Good boy. Warner's gonna be so excited to see you.\n\nElle turns to the movers.\n\nELLE: Guys, this way.\n\nSTUDENT: This ain't L.A.!\n\nELLE: Come on, Bruiser.\n\nElle walks inside as the movers carry some of Elle\u2019s things. Other students continue to ogle.\n\nELLE: It's gonna be so exciting. Now, don't be scared. Everyone will love you.\n\nCut to a welcome event outside. Elle approaches a table.\n\nELLE: Hi. Woods, comma, Elle.\n\nThe man at the table looks at her incredulously before handing her some things.\n\nMAN: Class schedule, map, book list.\n\nELLE: Wait a second. My social events calendar is missing.\n\nMAN: Your what?\n\nELLE: Social events? You know, mixers, formals, clambakes, trips to the Cape.\n\nHe says nothing.\n\nELLE: Okay, has Warner Huntington III checked in yet?\n\nMAN: No. Maybe you should check with the cruise director on the Lido deck.\n\nCut to Elle sitting on the grass with some other students.\n\nMAN: Okay, welcome to law school. This is the part where we go around in a circle and everyone says a little bit about themselves. Let's start with you.\n\nDAVID: Uh, my name is David Kidney. I have a masters in Russian literature, a Ph.D in biochemistry, and for the last eighteen months, I've been deworming orphans in Somalia.\n\nMAN: Awesome. What about you?\n\nENID: Hey. How you doin'? I'm Enid Wexler. I got a Ph.D. from Berkeley in women's studies, emphasis in the history of combat, (she lightly punches David), and last year, I single-handedly organized the march for Lesbians Against Drunk Driving.\n\nMAN: Killer.\n\nENID: Thanks. Good times.\n\nAARON: Aaron Mitchell. I graduated first in my class from Princeton. I have an I.Q. of 187, (David rolls his eyes and Enid scoffs), and it's been suggested that Stephen Hawking stole his Brief History of Time from my fourth grade paper.\n\nMAN: Cool.\n\nELLE: Me?\n\nMAN: Yeah.\n\nELLE: Okay. Hi. I'm Elle Woods, and this is Bruiser Woods, and we're both Gemini vegetarians. I have a bachelor's degree in fashion merchandising from CULA, and I was a Zeta Lambda Nu sweetheart, president of my sorority, Delta Nu, and last year, I was homecoming queen. Oh! Two weeks ago I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal and I talked her out of buying this truly heinous angora sweater. Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed.\n\nThe other students give her strange looks.\nCUT TO: INT. ELLE\u2019S ROOM\nElle looks at herself in her mirror in her new room. Bruiser sits on her bed nearby.\n\nELLE: Wish me luck, Bruiser. This is my first class as a serious law student. I totally look the part.\n\nCut to a hallway. Elle greets other students as she walks towards her class. Suddenly, she spots Warner. After a brief moment, she walks by him. He notices and turns to her.\n\nWARNER: Elle?\n\nELLE: Warner? I totally forgot you go here!\n\nWARNER: What are you talking about? Are you here to see me?\n\nELLE: No, silly. I go here.\n\nWARNER: You go where?\n\nELLE: Harvard. Law school.\n\nWARNER: You got into Harvard Law?\n\nELLE: What, like it's hard? Oh, my gosh, Warner, it'll be so great. I'm planning this great mixer. You totally have to help me. I'm thinking like a luau, or maybe like casino night. This is gonna be just like senior year, except funner.\n\nHe stares with his mouth open, unable to say anything.\n\nELLE: Oh, time to go. I have to go to class, but meet me after on the benches. All right, bye!\n\nElle enters her class. Cut to Professor Stromwell beginning her lecture. Elle notices all of the students around her are taking notes on computers. She takes out a heart-shaped notebook.\n\nSTROMWELL: A legal education means you will learn to speak in a new language. You will be taught to achieve insight into the world around you and to sharply question what you know. The seat you have picked will be yours for the next nine months of your life. And those of you in the front row... beware.\n\nElle is handed an attendance sheet. Stromwell gestures to a quote on the blackboard and reads it out loud.\n\nSTROMWELL: \"The law is reason free from passion.\" Does anyone know who spoke those immortal words?\n\nDavid\u2019s hand shoots up.\n\nSTROMWELL: Yes?\n\nDAVID: Aristotle.\n\nSTROMWELL: Are you sure?\n\nDAVID: Yes?\n\nSTROMWELL: Would you be willing to stake your life on it?\n\nDAVID: I think so.\n\nSTROMWELL: What about his life?\n\nShe raps another student on the head with her pencil.\n\nDAVID: I don't know.\n\nSTROMWELL: Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation but very little for self-doubt. And you were right. It was Aristotle.\n\nThe woman sitting next to David whispers to him.\n\nWOMAN: Good job.\n\nSTROMWELL: Now, I assume all of you have read pages 1-48 and are now well-versed in subject matter jurisdiction. Who can tell us about Gordon vs. Steele? Let's call on someone from the hot zone.\n\nElle avoids eye contact and takes notes. Stromwell approaches her.\n\nSTROMWELL: Elle Woods?\n\nELLE: Actually, I wasn't aware that we had an assignment.\n\nStromwell looks at the attention and calls on another student further back.\n\nSTROMWELL: Vivian Kensington. Do you think it's acceptable that Ms. Woods is not prepared?\n\nVIVIAN: No. I don't.\n\nSTROMWELL: Would you support my decision to ask her to leave class and to return only when she is prepared?\n\nVIVIAN: Absolutely.\n\nElle looks shocked. She gathers her things and leaves.\n\nSTROMWELL: Now, Ms. Kensington, did diversity jurisdiction exist in this case?\n\nVIVAN: No, it did not.\n\nSTROMWELL: Good. How about in the case of Owens vs. McCullogh?\n\nCUT TO: EXT. COURTYARD\nElle huffs past Emmett, who is sitting on a bench, and sits at another bench nearby. He notices she is upset.\n\nEMMETT: Excuse me. Are you okay?\n\nELLE: Yeah. Do they put you on the spot like that like, all the time?\n\nEMMETT: The professors? Yeah, they, they tend to do that. Socratic method.\n\nELLE: So if you don't know the answers, they\u2019re just gonna kick you out?\n\nEMMETT: So you have Stromwell, huh?\n\nELLE: Yes! Did she do that to you, too?\n\nEMMETT: No. But she did make me cry once. Not in class, I waited till I got back to my room, but she'll kick you right in the ball\u2026 Or wherever, you know. But, uh, yeah. She's tough. Really tough.\n\nELLE: Great.\n\nEMMETT: Don't worry, though, it gets better. Who else do you have?\n\nELLE: I have Callahan, Royalton, and Levinthal.\n\nEMMETT: Yeah\u2026 Let's see, speak up in Callahan's class. He really likes people that are opinionated.\n\nELLE: Okay.\n\nEMMETT: And in Royalton's class\u2026 try to get a seat in the back. He tends to spits when he talks about products liability.\n\nElle laughs.\n\nEMMETT: And, uh, for Levinthal, make sure you read the footnotes, cause that's where he gets a lot of his exam questions from.\n\nELLE: Right. Wow. I'm really glad I met you.\n\nThey both smile.\n\nWARNER: Hey.\n\nElle doesn\u2019t hear him and continues talking to Emmett.\n\nELLE: Are you a third year?\n\nEMMETT: Well-\n\nWARNER: Hey, Elle.\n\nELLE: Hi! Thanks for all your help.\n\nEMMETT: Good luck.\n\nEmmett leaves. Elle gets up and approaches Warner.\n\nELLE: Hi!\n\nWARNER: Uh\u2026 So\u2026 how was your first class?\n\nELLE: Oh, it was good, except for this horrible preppy girl who made me look bad in front of the professor. But no biggie. You're here now. So, how was your summer?\n\nWARNER: Good. It was good.\n\nELLE: Did you do anything exciting?\n\nVivian arrives and puts her arm around Warner.\n\nWARNER: Hey\u2026 Have you met Vivian?\n\nVIVIAN: Hi. Vivian Kensington.\n\nELLE: Do you know her?\n\nWARNER: She's-\n\nVIVIAN: I'm his fiancee.\n\nElle notices the ring on her finger.\n\nELLE: I'm sorry. I just hallucinated. What?\n\nWARNER: Yeah, she was my girlfriend in prep school. And, well, we got back together this summer at my grandmother's birthday party.\n\nVIVIAN: Warner told me all about you. You're famous at our club. But he didn't tell me you'd be here.\n\nWARNER: Pooh bear, I didn't know she would be here.\n\nELLE: Excuse me.\n\nElle walks away.\nCUT TO: EXT. STREET\nElle is driving and listening to loud music. She abruptly spins around when she notices a salon, causing a traffic jam.\n\nELLE: Oh, thank God!\n\nShe walks in and goes to the front desk, where Paulette is working.\n\nELLE: Are you free? It's an emergency.\n\nPAULETTE: Bad day?\n\nELLE: You can't even imagine.\n\nPAULETTE: Spill.\n\nPaulette puts down what she\u2019s doing. Elle tears up as she explains.\n\nELLE: I worked so hard to get into law school. I blew off Greek week to study for the LSATs. I even hired a Coppola to direct my admissions video. All to get my boyfriend Warner back. And now he's engaged to this awful girl Vivian, so it was all for nothing, and I\u2026 I just wish\u2026 I just wish I had never gone to Harvard.\n\nPAULETTE: After you went to all that trouble.\n\nELLE: He's engaged! She's got the six-carat Harry Winston on her bony, unpolished finger. What am I supposed to do?\n\nPAULETTE: You're asking the wrong girl. I mean, I'm with my guy eight years, and then one day, it's, \"I met someone else. Move out.\"\n\nELLE: Oh, no. That's awful.\n\nPAULETTE: Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I didn't even get to throw him a birthday party.\n\nPaulette shows Elle a framed photo of her dog, Rufus.\n\nELLE: No!\n\nPAULETTE: I mean, what's a girl to do? He's a guy who followed his pecker to greener pastures and I'm a middle-aged high-school dropout who's got stretch marks and a fat ass.\n\nELLE: That's terrible.\n\nPAULETTE: Yep. Happens every day. So what's this Vivian got that you don't have? Three tits?\n\nELLE: She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.\n\nPAULETTE: Is she as pretty as you?\n\nELLE: She could use some mascara and some serious highlights but she's not completely unfortunate looking.\n\nA UPS delivery man enters the salon with a package.\n\nUPS MAN: Hello, ladies.\n\nSALON WORKER: Hey, there.\n\nUPS MAN: How you doing? Sign here.\n\nPaulette stares at the UPS man. He turns and smiles at her. She smiles back and spills water all over Elle.\n\nPAULETTE: Oh, jeez. Look what I did.\n\nUPS MAN: See you later.\n\nHe gives Paulette one last look as he leaves.\n\nPAULETTE: Aw, shit. Could I have been any more goddamn spastic?\n\nElle helps Paulette clean up.\n\nELLE: It's OK.\n\nPAULETTE: Are you sure this Warner guy is, like, the one?\n\nELLE: Definitely. I love him.\n\nPAULETTE: Well, if a girl like you can't hold on to her man, then there sure as hell isn't any hope for the rest of us. What are you waiting for? Steal the bastard back.\n\nThey both smile at each other.\nCUT TO: INT. HARVARD CLASSROOM\nProfessor Callahan is giving a lecture.\n\nCALLAHAN: I should warn you that in addition to competing against each other for the top grade in this class you will also be competing for one of my firm's highly coveted four internship spots next year where you will get to assist on actual cases. Let the bloodbath begin. Now, let's commence with our usual torture. Ms. Woods, would you rather have a client who committed a crime malum in se or malum prohibitum?\n\nELLE: Neither.\n\nCALLAHAN: And why is that?\n\nELLE: I would rather have a client who's innocent.\n\nCALLAHAN: Dare to dream, Ms. Woods. Ms. Kensington, which would you prefer?\n\nVIVIAN: Malum prohibitum. Because then the client would have committed a regulatory infraction as opposed to a dangerous crime.\n\nCALLAHAN: Well done, Ms. Kensington. You've obviously done your homework. Now let us look at malum prohibitum a little more closely. It has been said...\n\nHe sees Elle\u2019s raised hand.\n\nCALLAHAN:  Yes, Ms. Woods?\n\nELLE: I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one 'cause I'm not afraid of a challenge.\n\nShe smirks at Vivian, whose smile drops.\nCUT TO: EXT. FIELD\nA group of students is playing football. Elle sits down with Bruiser and her notes. Warner runs with the football, but all of his teammates are distracted by Elle and stop playing.\n\nWARNER: Guys?\n\nELLE: Hi!\n\nCUT TO: INT. LIBRARY\nWarner, Vivian, and some other students are studying at a table. Elle approaches with a basket of muffins.\n\nELLE: Hi, everybody.\n\nWARNER: Elle, what are you doing here?\n\nELLE: I've come to join your study group. Look, I brought sustenance. Who's first?\n\nVivian shakes her head.\n\nVIVIAN: Our group is full.\n\nShe gives Warner a look. He avoids her gaze.\n\nELLE: Oh, is this like an RSVP thing?\n\nSTUDENT: No. It's like a smart people thing. And as Viv said, we're full.\n\nWARNER: Come on, guys, we can make room for one more.\n\nVivian kicks Warner under the table.\n\nWARNER: Ow!\n\nVIVIAN: We've already assigned the outlines. The answer is no.\n\nThe other students avoid looking at Elle.\n\nELLE: Oh, okay. I'll just leave, then.\n\nVIVIAN: Bye.\n\nElle turns and walks away. As she goes, she passes by a group of women studying, including Enid.\n\nENID: Hey, maybe there's, like, a sorority you could, like, join instead, like?\n\nELLE: You know, if you had come to a rush party, I would have at least been nice to you.\n\nENID: Oh, is that before you voted against me and then called me a dyke behind my back?\n\nELLE: I don't use that word. You must have heard it from Vivian.\n\nVivian looks up and frowns.\nCUT TO: INT. ELLE\u2019S ROOM\nElle enters her room in a bathrobe carrying Bruiser. She picks up her phone and calls Margot. Throughout the call, shots switch back and forth between Elle in her room and Margot trying out wedding dresses with Serena.\n\nMARGOT: Hello?\n\nELLE: Hey, it's me.\n\nMARGOT: It's Elle! Guess what I'm doing right this second!\n\nELLE: I don't know. What?\n\nMARGOT: I'm picking out my wedding dress!\n\nELLE: What?\n\nMARGOT: Josh proposed!\n\nMargot hands the phone to Serena.\n\nSERENA: Did you get the rock yet?\n\nELLE: Um, almost.\n\nSERENA: Well, hurry up, so you can come home! We miss you!\n\nELLE: I miss you guys, too. The people here are so vile. Hardly anybody speaks to me unless-\n\nSERENA: Oh, my God! I almost forgot to tell you!\n\nELLE: What?\n\nSERENA: I got bangs! My hair is so now.\n\nELLE: Really?\n\nMARGOT: Okay, so just listen to me. Keep June 1st open, you're one of my bridesmaids, and give Warner our love because I'm getting married! I\u2019m getting mar-\n\nMargot trips and falls over. Serena hangs up. Elle puts down her phone.\nCUT TO: INT. HARVARD\nVivian is standing in a hallway with the three other students.\n\nVIVIAN: So don't forget. Eight o'clock at 45 Dunston Street. It'll be a really nice party.\n\nSTUDENT: We'll be there.\n\nVIVIAN: Oh, and don't forget to bring your own merlot!\n\nElle hears this from in her room.\n\nELLE: No way! Is somebody at this school actually having a party?\n\nElle leaves her room. Her face falls when she realizes it\u2019s Vivian and one of her friends from the study group.\n\nFRIEND: Yes.\n\nVIVIAN: But it's a costume party. You probably wouldn't want to come.\n\nVivian\u2019s friend gives her some side-eye.\n\nELLE: I love costume parties.\n\nVIVIAN: Oh. Well, then I guess we'll see you there.\n\nELLE: Okay.\n\nVIVIAN: Oh, at 45 Dunston Street.\n\nVivian and her friend leave. Bruiser growls.\nCUT TO: EXT. STREET AT NIGHT\nElle arrives at the party dressed as a Playboy Bunny. Cut to inside the party. Enid is playing foosball. The camera pans up to reveal no one else is in costume. Enid notices Elle.\n\nENID: Oh, my God.\n\nElle assesses the situation. Everyone is staring at her. She smiles and walks to Vivian and her friend. Vivian does a spit take when she sees Elle\u2019s costume.\n\nELLE: Thanks for inviting me, girls. This party is super fun.\n\nVIVIAN: Nice outfit.\n\nELLE: Oh, I like your outfit, too. Except when I dress up as a frigid bitch, I try not to look so constipated.\n\nElle walks away.\n\nVIVIAN: Oh, she's horrible.\n\nFRIEND: You've got the ring, sweetie.\n\nElle walks through the party.\n\nSTUDENT: Nice ears.\n\nELLE: How you doin'?\n\nElle happens upon Enid and Warner talking.\n\nENID: Warner, Warner, the English language, it is all about subliminal domination. I mean, take the word semester, okay? A perfect example of this school's discriminatory preference of semen to ovaries. That's why I'm petitioning to have next term be referred to as the winter ovester.\n\nElle approaches and interrupts.\n\nELLE: Excuse me. Hey, Warner.\n\nWARNER: Wow! Well, don't you look like a walking felony?\n\nEnid scoffs and leaves.\n\nELLE: Thank you. You're so sweet. Are you having fun?\n\nWARNER: I am now. What's with the costume?\n\nELLE: Oh, I just decided to dress up.\n\nWARNER: Really.\n\nELLE: You know, I feel like we barely get to see each other since we've been here.\n\nWARNER: Oh, I know. I'm so busy with these case studies and hypos.\n\nELLE: I know what you mean. I can't imagine doing all this and Callahan's internship next year. That's gonna be so much.\n\nWARNER: Elle, come on, you'll never get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough, sweetie.\n\nELLE: Wait, am I on glue, or did we not get into the same law school?\n\nWARNER: Yeah, but-\n\nELLE: But what? We took the same LSATs, and we're taking the same classes.\n\nWARNER: I know, but come on, Elle, be serious. You can do something more valuable with your time.\n\nELLE: I'm never going to be good enough for you, am I?\n\nThey say nothing for a moment. Elle leaves.\n\nWARNER: Oh, come on.\n\nELLE: Just forget it!\n\nElle walks through the party.\n\nELLE: I'll show you how valuable Elle Woods can be!\n\nCUT TO: INT. STORE\nElle stands in a line of people at a store. She\u2019s still in her costume and is holding a computer. Emmett comes into line behind her. He clears his throat. Elle turns and sees him.\n\nELLE: Don't ask.\n\nEMMETT: Wasn't gonna.\n\nCUT TO: INT. ELLE\u2019S ROOM\nElle sits at her desk typing a paper with her new computer.\nCUT TO: EXT. CAMPUS\nElle walks past Warner and Vivians study group talking outside. She\u2019s carrying a load of books. They notice as she walks past, but she just keeps walking.\n\nSTUDENT: Was she carrying books?\n\nCUT TO: INT. LIBRARY\nElle struggles to reach a book on a tall shelf. David happens to be there and helps her get it.\n\nELLE: Thanks!\n\nCUT TO: INT. STROMWELL\u2019S CLASSROOM\n\nSTROMWELL: So, you've filed a claim. What next?\n\nDavid appears to be dozing off.\n\nSTROMWELL: Ms. Woods?\n\nDavid jerks to attention when he hears Stromwell call on Elle.\n\nELLE: Don't you need to have evidence?\n\nVivian and her friend share snide glances.\n\nSTROMWELL: Meaning?\n\nELLE: Meaning you need reasonable belief that your claim should have, like, evidentiary support?\n\nStromwell looks surprised.\n\nSTROMWELL: And what kind of evidentiary support does this case require?\n\nCUT TO: INT. ELLE\u2019S ROOM\nBruiser is watching a video of chihuahuas on Elle\u2019s TV. Elle is studying on an elliptical. She changes the channel to the news.\nCUT TO: INT. SALON\nElle studies while she\u2019s getting a perm with Paulette and Bruiser.\nCUT TO: INT. CALLAHAN\u2019S CLASSROOM\nCallahan is giving a lecture.\n\nCALLAHAN: And the purpose of diminished capacity is?\n\nElle raises her hand higher than Vivian and Warner. Callahan calls on her.\n\nELLE: To negate mens rea?\n\nCallahan nods. Vivian and Warner look annoyed.\nCUT TO: EXT. JUNKYARD\nElle drives into a junkyard with Bruiser and Paulette.\n\nELLE: Are you ready?\n\nPAULETTE: No.\n\nELLE: Yes, you are! Go. You can do this.\n\nPaulette approaches her ex\u2019s trailer while practicing what she\u2019s going to say.\n\nPAULETTE: Listen to me, Dewey. You shut your mouth. No, you shut your big mouth. I'm doing all the talking.\n\nPaulette knocks on the door. Her ex, Dewey, answers.\n\nDEWEY: What the hell do you want? We're eating lunch.\n\nPAULETTE: I just thought that...\n\nDEWEY: You just thought-\n\nPAULETTE: Maybe we could\u2026\n\nHe walks towards her.\n\nDEWEY: -you could come here and show me what I'm definitely not missing?\n\nDewey chuckles. Elle peeks her head out from a corner and watches the exchange.\n\nPAULETTE: That's not why I came by.\n\nDEWEY: Hey, Paulette, how many times are you gonna come over here begging me to take you back, huh?\n\nElle puts on her glasses.\n\nPAULETTE: I was\u2026 Um\u2026 I\u2026\n\nELLE: Dewey Newcombe?\n\nDEWEY: Who's asking?\n\nELLE: I'm Elle Woods. Miss Bonifante's attorney. And I\u2019m here to discuss the legal situation at hand.\n\nDEWEY: Come again?\n\nELLE: Do you understand what subject matter jurisdiction is?\n\nDEWEY: No.\n\nELLE: Yeah, I didn\u2019t think so. Well, due to habeas corpus, you and Miss Bonifante had a common law marriage. Which heretofore, entitles her to what is legally referred to as equitable division of the assets.\n\nDEWEY: Come again?\n\nELLE: Due to the fact that you've retained this residence Miss Bonifante is entitled to full canine property ownership and will be enforcing said ownership right now.\n\nDEWEY: Huh?\n\nELLE: Tell him, Paulette.\n\nDewey chuckles. Paulette steels herself.\n\nPAULETTE: I'm taking the dog, dumbass!\n\nCut back to the car. Paulette, Elle, and the newly emancipated Rufus all get in.\n\nELLE: That's awesome! We did it! Oh, my gosh, did you see him? He's probably still scratching his head.\n\nPAULETTE: Yeah, which must be a nice vacation for his balls.\n\nThey both laugh and pet their respective dogs.\n\nPAULETTE: Thank you.\n\nCUT TO: INT. CALLAHAN\u2019S CLASSROOM\nWarner is answering a question.\n\nWARNER: Well according to Swinney vs. Neubert, Swinney, who was also a private sperm donor was allowed visitation rights as long as he came to terms with the hours set forth by the parents. So, if we're sticking to past precedent, Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking. He was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation.\n\nCALLAHAN: But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor, and our defendant was a habitual sperm donor who also happens to be harassing the parents in his quest for visitation.\n\nWARNER: Well, yeah, but without this man's sperm, the child in question wouldn't exist.\n\nCALLAHAN: Now you're thinking like a lawyer.\n\nVivian and her friend smile and take notes. Elle raises her hand.\n\nCALLAHAN: Yes, Ms. Woods?\n\nELLE: Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of every sperm emission made throughout his life.\n\nCALLAHAN: Interesting. Why do you ask?\n\nELLE: Well, unless the defendant attempted to contact every single one-night stand to determine if a child resulted in those unions, he has no parental claim over this child whatsoever. Why now? Why this sperm?\n\nAs she talks, we see shots of Emmett and David, who both seem to take what she says into consideration.\n\nCALLAHAN: I see your point.\n\nELLE: And for that matter, all masturbatory emissions where his sperm was clearly not seeking an egg could be termed reckless abandonment.\n\nCALLAHAN: I believe you've just won your case.\n\nWarner, Vivian, and Vivian\u2019s friend all look annoyed. Cut to the end of class. As all of the students leave, Callahan stops Elle.\n\nCALLAHAN: Ms. Woods, you did well today.\n\nELLE: Really?\n\nCALLAHAN: You're applying for my internship, aren't you?\n\nELLE: I don't know.\n\nCALLAHAN: You should. Do you have a resume?\n\nELLE: Yes, I do. Here it is.\n\nShe searches through her bag and pulls it out.\n\nCALLAHAN: It's pink.\n\nELLE: And it's scented. I think it gives it a little something extra. Don\u2019t you think?\n\nHe says nothing.\n\nELLE: Okay, well, see you next class.\n\nElle leaves. Emmett approaches Callahan.\n\nCALLAHAN: Do you think she woke up one morning and said, \"I think I'll go to law school today.\"\n\nEMMETT: Well, that lapse in judgment aside, I think she's got a lot of potential. Here's the Windham file.\n\nEmmett hands Callahan a folder.\n\nCALLAHAN: Smell this.\n\nCallahan hands Emmett Elle\u2019s resume. He sniffs it.\n\nEMMETT: What's that?\n\nCALLAHAN: It's her resume.\n\nEMMETT: Smells good.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SALON\nAs it snows outside, Elle and Paulette sit inside the salon. They sit watching the snow for a few moments and then drink. Cut to later in the year with an establishing shot of the school in spring.\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY\nA number of students are gathered around something. Elle approaches David in the crowd.\n\nELLE: What's going on?\n\nDAVID: Callahan's firm is defending a murder trial. His caseload is so big, he's taking on first year interns.\n\nELLE: He picked them already?\n\nDavid nods.\n\nVIVIAN: My God, I can't believe it, Warner! We got it!\n\nVivian and Warner kiss. Elle pushes past them.\n\nSTUDENT: That only leaves one for\u2026\n\nElle makes it to the front and sees the list. In order, the internships have been awarded to Warner, Vivian, Enid, and Elle. Elle gasps when she sees her name and spins around, smiling.\n\nELLE: Me! Yes!\n\nVivian and Warner both shoot her looks. Enid approaches her from behind, surprised. Elle turns to Warner and approaches him.\n\nELLE: Oh, Warner. Do you remember when we spent those four amazing hours in the hot tub after winter formal?\n\nWARNER: Yeah- No.\n\nELLE: This is so much better than that! Excuse me. I have some shopping to do.\n\nElle walks away from them.\n\nVIVIAN: Four hours?\n\nCUT TO: INT. LAW FIRM\nCut to an establishing shot of Boston. Inside of Callahan\u2019s firm, Elle, Warner, and Vivian get out of elevators. Warner grunts and walks away.\n\nELLE: You look very nice today, Vivian.\n\nVIVIAN: Thank you.\n\nELLE: You're welcome.\n\nElle and Vivian continue on. Cut to inside a conference room. The four interns and two lawyers are sitting at a table. Callahan enters.\n\nCALLAHAN: We're defending Brooke Windham, whose very wealthy husband was found shot to death in their Beacon Hill mansion.\n\nVIVIAN: Gold digger?\n\nCALLAHAN: You'd think so, since the stiff was 60, but she was rich on her own. Some kind of fitness empire. You can buy her exercise tapes on infomercials.\n\nELLE: Wait, are you talking about Brooke Taylor?\n\nCallahan looks at his notes.\n\nCALLAHAN: Maiden name, Taylor. You know her?\n\nELLE: She's a Delta Nu! She wasn't in my pledge class. She graduated four years before me. But I used to take her class at the Los Angeles Sports Club. She's amazing!\n\nCALLAHAN: Amazing? How?\n\nELLE: She can make you lose three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted.\n\nCALLAHAN: Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.\n\nWARNER: By who?\n\nCALLAHAN: His 26-year-old daughter and the pool boy.\n\nEmmett enters the room.\n\nEMMETT: Sorry, I'm late. Excuse me.\n\nElle looks up at him, surprised. They smile at each other.\n\nCALLAHAN: This is Emmett Richmond, another associate. Top three in his class, and former editor of \"Harvard Law Review.\" You've probably seen him lurking around campus doing my research.\n\nEMMETT: Thanks for the introduction.\n\nWARNER: So, what about the murder weapon?\n\nCALLAHAN: The gun is missing. The coroner said he'd been dead 30 minutes when the cops arrived, giving Brooke plenty of time to stash it.\n\nELLE: I just don't think Brooke could have done this. Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don't shoot their husbands. They just don't.\n\nEmmett smiles.\nCUT TO: INT. JAIL\nBrooke sits in a prison jumpsuit at the end of a table with the lawyers and interns.\n\nBROOKE: I didn't do it. I walked in, I saw my husband lying on the floor. I bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off, and then Enrique and Chutney ran inside.\n\nCALLAHAN: Okay, your step-daughter and the pool boy came in where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.\n\nBROOKE: Why would I kill my husband?\n\nCALLAHAN: Insurance, a love affair, pure unadulterated hatred. Believe me, the D.A. will come up with plenty of reasons.\n\nBROOKE: I loved him.\n\nCALLAHAN: He was 34 years older than you. That doesn't look so good to a jury.\n\nBROOKE: Then show them a picture of his dick. That might clear a few things up.\n\nCALLAHAN: Brooke, I believe you, but a jury is going to want an alibi.\n\nBROOKE: Well, I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.\n\nCALLAHAN: Well then. I guess we're done for today.\n\nCallahan grabs his briefcase. Everyone gets up and leaves. Brooke stops Elle as she leaves.\n\nBROOKE: Hey\u2026\n\nELLE: Hi.\n\nBROOKE: I know you.\n\nELLE: I'm a Delta Nu, and I'm a huge fan of yours.\n\nBROOKE: You took my class in L.A.\n\nELLE: Uh huh.\n\nBROOKE: You had the best high-kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?\n\nELLE: Yeah, sort of.\n\nBROOKE: Well, thank God one of you has a brain.\n\nCOP: Let's go.\n\nThe cop pulls Brooke from the room. Elle smiles and leaves.\nCUT TO: INT. SALON\nBruiser and Rufus are laying next to each other in a doggie bed. Paulette is giving Elle a manicure.\n\nELLE: I'm the only one that believes her. Callahan totally thinks she's guilty.\n\nPAULETTE: Yeah, well that's because men are big fat retards who don't-\n\nShe stops and looks up as she hears the front door open. The UPS man enters.\n\nUPS MAN: Afternoon, ladies.\n\nPAULETTE: It's him.\n\nHe approaches the front desk.\n\nUPS MAN: Paulette Bonifante?\n\nThe woman at the front desk points to Paulette.\n\nPAULETTE: Oh, my God.\n\nELLE: He's coming over here.\n\nHe approaches Paulette\u2019s desk.\n\nUPS MAN: I've got a package.\n\nPaulette is unable to respond.\n\nELLE: He's got a package.\n\nPaulette is still too nervous to even look at him. He turns to Elle, who signs for her. Elle subtly nods towards the UPS man while smiling and looking at Paulette. Paulette turns and smiles at the UPS man.\n\nUPS MAN: How you doing today?\n\nPAULETTE: Fine.\n\nHe sets down the package and smiles at her.\n\nUPS MAN: Take it easy.\n\nHe leaves.\n\nELLE: That's great, Paulette. Is this the only interaction you two have ever had?\n\nPAULETTE: No. Sometimes I say \"OK\" instead of \"fine.\"\n\nELLE: Why don't you offer him a cold beverage or a neck massage or something?\n\nPAULETTE: Oh, come on, what's the point?\n\nELLE: Trust me, Paulette. You have all the equipment, you just need to read the manual. Do you know what I'm saying?\n\nPaulette shakes her head.\n\nELLE: Okay. I\u2019m gonna show you a little maneuver that my mother taught me in junior high. In my experience, it has a 98% success rate of getting a man's attention, and when used appropriately, it has an 83% rate of return on a dinner invitation.\n\nPAULETTE: Wow!\n\nELLE: It's called the \u201cbend and snap.\" Watch this.\n\nElle gets up and walks to the center of the Salon.\n\nELLE: \"Oh! I think I dropped something on the floor that I need to pick up.\" So you bend\u2026 and snap!\n\nShe demonstrates by bending over and snapping upright.\n\nELLE: See? Come on. You try it.\n\nPaulette gets up. Elle directs her. Another woman nearby watches them.\n\nELLE: Bend...and snap! Okay, yeah. A little less bend, a little more snap.\n\nThe woman watching gets up.\n\nWOMAN 1: Like this?\n\nThe woman demonstrates a snap.\n\nELLE: Good snap! Come on.\n\nElle pulls Paulette over to another woman.\n\nELLE: You! Come on, you can do it.\n\nAll of the women in the salon begin to pay attention.\n\nWOMAN 2: Bend... and snap!\n\nThe rest of the women applaud her.\n\nELLE: We can all do it! Come on, guys. You're gonna bend\u2026 and snap!\n\nAll of the women slowly join in.\n\nELLE: Now put your head into it. Bend... and snap! Bend... and snap! Good job! A little attitude, please. Now, everybody smile. That's very important. Bend... and snap! Good job, everybody!\n\nThe first woman begins dancing.\n\nELLE: Work it out! Work it out! That's it! Wow! Come on, Paulette! Bend and snap!\n\nPaulette comes and joins everyone for one last bend and snap. A male employee walks past.\n\nMAN: Oh, my God! The bend and snap! Works every time!\n\nBruiser and Rufus bark.\nCUT TO: INT. LAW FIRM\nEmmett paces around the conference room.\n\nEMMETT: Well, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, then who did?\n\nELLE: My money is on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.\n\nCALLAHAN: Chutney has a trust fund. She didn't need the insurance pay off or the inheritance.\n\nLAWYER: What about the mother?\n\nCALLAHAN: Covered. She was in Aspen at the time. Vivian, get me some plum sauce.\n\nVivian looks disgruntled. Warner smirks.\n\nCALLAHAN: Ten people saw her downing cosmopolitans at the Caribou Club.\n\nELLE: Well all I know is it's not Brooke.\n\nCALLAHAN: That's touching, Elle. But we need an alibi.\n\nCUT TO: INT. PRISON\nElle talks to Brooke through the phone at the prison.\n\nELLE: I brought you some necessities. Some Calvin Klein, 720 cut sheets, the entire Clinique skin care line, some aromatherapy candles, a loofah... Oh! And the Bible.\n\nShe holds up a copy of Cosmopolitan.\n\nBROOKE: You're an angel.\n\nELLE: So how are you? Are you all right? You look so... orange.\n\nBROOKE: I'm just glad that it's you and not Callahan.\n\nELLE: He means well. He's very brilliant.\n\nBROOKE: He better be for what I'm paying for him.\n\nELLE: I have to tell you the real reason I came here. Professor Callahan says we really, really need your alibi.\n\nBROOKE: Elle, I can't. You don't understand.\n\nELLE: Who could understand better than me?\n\nBROOKE: It's so shameful.\n\nELLE: Whatever it is, Brooke, it could save you.\n\nBROOKE: No! That's just it. It would ruin me.\n\nELLE: How?\n\nBROOKE: I've made my fortune on the ability to perfect women's bodies with Brooke's Butt-Buster workout.\n\nELLE: I know! You helped me go from a six to a four.\n\nBROOKE: That's great! Um... On the day of Heyworth's murder... I was getting\u2026\n\nShe whispers inaudibly.\n\nELLE: What?\n\nBROOKE: I was getting liposuction.\n\nShe says it too quietly for Elle to hear.\n\nELLE: Huh?\n\nBROOKE: Liposuction!\n\nELLE: Oh, God!\n\nOther people turn and look.\n\nBROOKE: I know! I'm a fraud! It's not like normal women can have this ass! If my fans knew that I bought it\u2026 I would lose everything! I've already lost my husband. I'd rather go to jail than lose my reputation.\n\nELLE: Brooke\u2026 your secret's safe with me.\n\nBROOKE: Thank you.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LAW FIRM\nCallahan enters the conference room. Everyone is hard at work.\n\nCALLAHAN: Vivian, grab me some coffee.\n\nVivian looks annoyed and gets up.\n\nCALLAHAN: We got two interviews tomorrow that Gerard and Bobby are gonna handle. The ex-wife in an hour. And, according to this communique from the prison, our client apparently had a visit from her sister. A Miss Delta Nu.\n\nCallahan looks pointedly at Elle and removes his glasses. Emmett smiles.\n\nCALLAHAN: Anyone you know?\n\nELLE: Yes. I went to visit her.\n\nCALLAHAN: What the hell do you mean you went to visit her?\n\nELLE: I went to get her alibi.\n\nCALLAHAN: Did you get it?\n\nELLE: Mhm. It's really good.\n\nCALLAHAN: Well, great. What is it?\n\nELLE: Oh, I can't tell you.\n\nCALLAHAN: Why the hell not?\n\nELLE: Because I promised her I'd keep it a secret, and I can't break the bonds of sisterhood.\n\nCALLAHAN: Screw sisterhood! This is a murder trial, not some scandal at the sorority house. I want the alibi!\n\nELLE: I can't give it to you, but I can tell you she is innocent.\n\nA woman enters.\n\nWOMAN: Mr. Callahan, Mrs. Windham Vandermark is on line two for you.\n\nCALLAHAN: Someone reason with her while I take this.\n\nLAWYER 1: Are you crazy? Just tell him the alibi.\n\nELLE: No!\n\nLAWYER 2: We\u2019re gonna lose this case if you don't.\n\nELLE: Well then we're not very good lawyers.\n\nWARNER: If you tell him, he'll probably hire you as a summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.\n\nVivian gives Warner a look.\n\nELLE: I gave her my word, Warner.\n\nWARNER: So what?\n\nCALLAHAN: The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with the fact that her interview is today. She's at a spa in the Berkshires.\n\nLAWYER 1: A spa? Isn't that like your mothership?\n\nELLE: I could go if you want me to.\n\nCALLAHAN: Emmett? Go with her.\n\nEMMETT: Okay.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. ROAD\nEmmett and Elle drive to the spa.\n\nEMMETT: She seems completely untrustworthy to me.\n\nELLE: Why?\n\nEMMETT: This is a person who's made her living by telling women that they're too fat.\n\nELLE: Brooke would never tell a woman she was too fat.\n\nEMMETT: And she seems like she's hiding something.\n\nELLE: Maybe it's not what you think.\n\nEMMETT: Maybe it's exactly what I think.\n\nELLE: You know, you're really being a butthead.\n\nEMMETT: A butthead? Why would you call me that?\n\nELLE: You know, Emmett, you just need to have a little more faith in people. You might be surprised.\n\nEMMETT: I can't believe you just called me a butthead. I mean, no one's called me a butthead since about the ninth grade.\n\nELLE: Maybe not to your face.\n\nThey arrive at the spa.\n\nEMMETT: So this is what a spa looks like. Wow. How do we find her?\n\nELLE: I called ahead. She's in the mud room.\n\nEMMETT: She's not, um... naked, is she?\n\nCut to inside the spa. Emmett and Elle stand next to Mrs. Windham Vandermark. She has a mask on and cucumbers over her eyes. Elle removes one of the cucumbers.\n\nELLE: Mrs. Windham Vandermark?\n\nMRS. W. V.: So you found me.\n\nELLE: Yes. We're from Austen, Platt, Jaret, and Callahan, and we're here to ask you a few questions.\n\nMRS. W. V. : So I hear that that little tart from California shot poor Heyworth.\n\nEMMETT: Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen, actually.\n\nELLE: Do you have any reason to believe that it did?\n\nMRS. W. V.: I've never actually met the woman, but my daughter tells me she can be quite the little bitch.\n\nEMMETT: Did your daughter ever mention anything about the relationship between Brooke and Heyworth?\n\nMRS. W. V.: Well, she did say that they humped like gorillas. I guess it wasn't enough, though, for Brooke.\n\nEMMETT: Why do you say that?\n\nMRS. W. V.: Well\u2026 haven't you seen the cabana boy?\n\nCut to Elle and Emmett walking outside.\n\nELLE: She's lying.\n\nEMMETT: And you know this for a fact?\n\nELLE: Did you see the icky brown color of her hair?\n\nEMMETT: So? Now you discriminate against brunettes?\n\nCut to Emmett driving Elle back to campus.\n\nELLE: Why shouldn\u2019t I? I'm discriminated against as a blonde.\n\nEMMETT: You know, being a blonde is actually a pretty powerful thing. You hold more cards than you think you do. And I personally would like to see you take that power and channel it towards the greater good, you know?\n\nELLE: Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow.\n\nEMMETT: All right.\n\nElle gets out of the car.\n\nEMMETT: Hey, how do you think I'd look as a blonde, you know?\n\nELLE: I'm not sure you could handle it.\n\nEMMETT: Bye.\n\nELLE: Bye.\n\nEmmett drives away. Cut to Elle walking on campus. She passes David and two women talking.\n\nDAVID: So, I called your room last night.\n\nWOMAN: I heard.\n\nDAVID: I was thinking maybe we could go out sometime.\n\nWOMAN: No. You're a dork.\n\nElle stops.\n\nDAVID: I'm in law school.\n\nWOMAN: Look, I'm not gonna go out with you. I can't believe you'd even ask. Girls like me don't go out with losers like you. Let's get out of here.\n\nELLE: Excuse me.\n\nElle walks over to David and slaps him.\n\nELLE: Why didn't you call me?\n\nDAVID: What?\n\nELLE: We spent a beautiful night together, and then I never hear from you again?\n\nDavid looks confusedly at the two women and then back at Elle.\n\nDAVID: I\u2026 I'm sorry?\n\nELLE: Sorry for what? For breaking my heart, or for giving me the greatest pleasure I've ever known and then just taking it away?\n\nDAVID: Uh\u2026 both?\n\nELLE: Well, forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.\n\nElle walks away and smiles.\n\nWOMAN: So...when did you want to go out?\n\nCUT TO: INT. ELLE\u2019S ROOM\nElle sits in a chair with Bruiser and looks over a deposition. There\u2019s a knock on her door.\n\nELLE: Come in.\n\nVivian enters.\n\nVIVIAN: Are you done with that deposition yet?\n\nELLE: Oh, yeah. Here, take it. I've read it like, 20 times.\n\nShe puts the deposition down. Vivian comes over to take it.\n\nVIVIAN: Okay. You know, Elle\u2026 I still can't believe you didn't tell Callahan the alibi.\n\nELLE: It's not my alibi to tell.\n\nVIVIAN: I know. And I thought that was very classy of you.\n\nELLE: Really?\n\nVIVIAN: Sure.\n\nELLE: Thanks.\n\nVivian turns to leave, but seems hesitant. She speaks again after a moment.\n\nVIVIAN: Did you ever notice how Callahan never asks Warner to bring him his coffee? I mean, he's asked me at least ten times.\n\nELLE: Men are helpless. You know that.\n\nVivian sits down.\n\nVIVIAN: I know. Warner doesn't even do his own laundry.\n\nELLE: I know, he has to have it sent out.\n\nVIVIAN: I know. Did you know when he first applied, he got wait-listed?\n\nElle looks shocked.\n\nELLE: What?\n\nVivian moves closer.\n\nVIVIAN: His father had to make a call.\n\nELLE: You're kidding. No way!\n\nVIVIAN: Oh, God, that is such a precious dog.\n\nELLE: His name is Bruiser. Do you want to hold him?\n\nVIVIAN: Oh.\n\nELLE: He's very friendly.\n\nElle hands Bruiser to Vivian.\n\nVIVIAN: Sure. Oh!\n\nBruiser licks her.\n\nELLE: Look, he likes you.\n\nVIVIAN: Ah, he's giving me kisses!\n\nElle smiles.\nCUT TO: EXT. COURTHOUSE\nA camera man exits a van as a reporter begins talking. The camera pans away to show the courthouse and dozens of people gathered around the area, including multiple news vans.\n\nREPORTER: Thanks, Jeoff. We're here today covering the trial of Brooke Windham. She's charged with the murder of her husband, Boston millionaire Heyworth Windham. First to testify are the victim's daughter and ex-wife.\n\nCut to inside the courthouse. Everyone is standing as the judge enters.\n\nBAILIFF: The Superior Court of Suffolk County is now in session. The Honorable Judge Marina R. Bickford presiding. You may be seated.\n\nEveryone sits. Cut to later in the trial. Callahan, Emmett, Brooke, and another lawyer sit at the defense table while the interns Elle, Vivian, and Warner watch from the stands. They\u2019re all watching District Attorney Joyce Rafferty question Chutney.\n\nJOYCE: And where was she exactly?\n\nCHUTNEY: Standing over my father's dead body.\n\nCut to Mrs. W. V.\u2019s testimony.\n\nJOYCE: And what was the defendant doing?\n\nMRS. W. V.: Well, she was sitting next to the pool, topless, while the Latin boy handed her a drink.\n\nCut to a shot of the courtroom sketch artist, who smirks and continues drawing Mrs. W. V. Cut to later during the pool worker\u2019s testimony.\n\nJOYCE: Mr. Salvatore, can you tell us what this is?\n\nShe holds up a blue speedo.\n\nENRIQUE: My uniform.\n\nJOYCE: This is the uniform Mrs. Windham asked you to wear while cleaning her pool?\n\nENRIQUE: Yes.\n\nJOYCE: And, are you or are you not having an affair with Brooke Windham?\n\nENRIQUE: Define \"affair.\"\n\nJOYCE: Have you and Mrs. Windham had sexual relations?\n\nENRIQUE: Yes. OK? Yes.\n\nJUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen, court will reconvene tomorrow morning at 9 A.M. We're adjourned.\n\nBrooke gets up and angrily approaches Elle.\n\nBROOKE: You know a Delta Nu would never sleep with a man who wears a thong.\n\nELLE: Never!\n\nBROOKE: I just liked watching him clean the filter.\n\nA cop takes Brooke away.\n\nELLE: I know. I believe you, Brooke.\n\nBROOKE: Take care of me, Elle.\n\nELLE: I will.\n\nElle sighs as people file out of the courtroom.\nCUT TO: INT. SALON\nThe UPS man enters as Paulette looks at herself in a mirror. He comes up from behind her with a big package and checks her out.\n\nUPS MAN: I got a big one for you.\n\nShe turns and smiles at him.\n\nUPS MAN: Can you sign?\n\nShe nervously picks up her pen and goes to sign. She looks at the pen for a moment and then drops it. She goes for the bend and snap\n\nUPS MAN: Oh, I got it.\n\nHe goes for the pen too, and she accidentally headbutts him square in the face as she snaps.\nCUT TO: INT. COURTHOUSE\nCut to Elle on the phone with Paulette.\n\nELLE: You broke his nose?\n\nPAULETTE: Oh, I blew it, Elle. My snap was all over the place.\n\nELLE: I'll be there right as soon as court is out. We have to cross-examine Enrique. But don't worry. My girlfriend Serena barfed on a guy during \"The Blair Witch Project\" and they ended up dating for three months.\n\nPAULETTE: Really?\n\nELLE: Mhm!\n\nPAULETTE: All right. Bye-bye!\n\nELLE: Okay, bye.\n\nElle goes for a water fountain, but Enrique cuts in front of her. As he drinks, she taps her foot at him.\n\nENRIQUE: Don't stomp your little last-season Prada shoes at me, honey!\n\nHe walks away.\n\nELLE: These aren't last season.\n\nElle gasps as she has a sudden realization. Cut to her running back into the courtroom.\n\nELLE: Emmett! He's gay! Enrique is gay!\n\nCallahan looks at her.\n\nEMMETT: What?\n\nElle turns to Warner.\n\nELLE: Warner, what kind of shoes are these?\n\nWARNER: Black ones.\n\nELLE: See!\n\nCALLAHAN: What are you talking about?\n\nELLE: He\u2019s gay. He isn't Brooke's lover. He's making it up.\n\nEMMETT: Wait, back up. How do you know he's gay?\n\nELLE: Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.\n\nBROOKE: Know what? He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house one time.\n\nCALLAHAN: While I appreciate your masterful legal theory, I have a murder trial to attend to. Emmett?\n\nEMMETT: Okay. I\u2019ll take care of it. Thanks.\n\nELLE: Okay.\n\nBAILIFF: The court will come to order.\n\nEveryone sits back down. Cut to the courtroom sketch artist drawing Enrique.\n\nCALLAHAN: Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?\n\nENRIQUE: Only the love in my heart.\n\nCALLAHAN: Well, if that's all the proof that he has, Your Honor, I think I'm done here.\n\nThe judge nods.\n\nJUDGE: You may step down-\n\nEMMETT: I'd like to ask a couple of questions, Your Honor.\n\nEmmett approaches Callahan.\n\nEMMETT: Just give me a couple minutes.\n\nEMMETT: Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?\n\nENRIQUE: Yes.\n\nEMMETT: Where?\n\nENRIQUE: A restaurant in Concord where no one could recognize us.\n\nEMMETT: And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?\n\nENRIQUE: Three months.\n\nEMMETT: And your boyfriend's name is\u2026?\n\nENRIQUE: Chuck.\n\nEMMETT: Right.\n\nEmmett goes to sit down. Elle smiles. Many people in the courtroom gasp and begin talking.\n\nJUDGE: Silence!\n\nThe judge bangs her gavel.\n\nENRIQUE: Pardon me! Pardon me.\n\nEmmett turns back around.\n\nEMMETT: Yes, Mr. Salvatore?\n\nENRIQUE: I was con- I was confused. I thought you said friend. Chuck is just a friend.\n\nEMMETT: Oh, okay.\n\nIn the stands, Chuck stands up.\n\nCHUCK: You bitch!\n\nChuck leaves. People gasp. Enrique gets up.\n\nENRIQUE: Chuck, wait!\n\nJUDGE: Silence in my court! Sit down, Mr. Salvatore.\n\nEnrique watches as Chuck leaves.

LAW FIRM\nElle walks down the hall.\n\nELLE: Goodnight!\n\nWOMAN: Goodnight.\n\nAs Elle keeps walking, Vivian exits a room carrying a load of papers.\n\n.VIVIAN: Oh, Elle, Callahan asked to see you before you leave.\n\nELLE: Really?\n\nVIVIAN: Yeah, you know, he already has coffee, but maybe he needs a doughnut.\n\nELLE: Do you need any help?\n\nVIVIAN: No. I'm fine.\n\nVivian leaves.\n\nELLE: Okay, bye.\n\nElle goes and knocks on Callahan\u2019s door.\n\nCALLAHAN: Come on in.\n\nElle enters his office.\n\nCALLAHAN: Hi.\n\nELLE: Hi.\n\nCALLAHAN: Sit down.\n\nElle sits down.\n\nELLE: Is everything all right?\n\nCALLAHAN: You followed your intuition today, and you were right on target. I should have listened.\n\nELLE: Thank you.\n\nCALLAHAN: About the alibi...\n\nELLE: I'm sorry-\n\nCALLAHAN: I'm impressed you took the initiative to go get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And, on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys on my payroll.\n\nELLE: Wow.\n\nCALLAHAN: I think it's time to discuss your career path.\n\nHe gets up and approaches her.\n\nCALLAHAN: Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?\n\nHe sits down next to her.\n\nELLE: Oh, um, not really. I know it's very competitive.\n\nCALLAHAN: Well, you know what competition's really about, don\u2019t you? It's about ferocity, carnage. Balancing human intelligence with animal diligence. Knowing exactly what you want\u2026 and how far you'll go to get it. How far will Elle go?\n\nVivian returns and looks through a crack in the door as Callahan places his hand on Elle\u2019s leg. She runs away.\n\nELLE: Are you hitting on me?\n\nCALLAHAN: You're a beautiful girl.\n\nElle gets up.\n\nELLE: So everything you just said...\n\nCALLAHAN: I'm a man who knows what he wants.\n\nELLE: And I'm a law student who just realized her professor is a pathetic asshole.\n\nCALLAHAN: Too bad. I thought you were a law student who wanted to be a lawyer!\n\nElle leaves and gets on an elevator. Vivian stops her.\n\nVIVIAN: You almost had me fooled.\n\nELLE: What?\n\nVIVIAN: Oh, maybe you should sleep with the jury, too. Then we can win the case.\n\nThe elevator door closes as Vivian storms off. Elle sees her reflection in the elevator door and wipes away a tear. Cut to her in the lobby. She walks past Emmett.\n\nEMMETT: Hey!\n\nELLE: I'm quitting.\n\nEmmett stops her.\n\nEMMETT: Why?\n\nELLE: Law school was a mistake. This whole internship was a mistake.\n\nEMMETT: What are you talking about? You earned it.\n\nELLE: I didn't earn anything, Emmett! Callahan only gave me that internship because he liked the way I looked. Which he made clear tonight when he tried to feel me up.\n\nEMMETT: What? Callahan did what?\n\nELLE: Just forget about it. I'm going back to L.A. No more boring suits. No more pantyhose. No more trying to be something that I'm just\u2026 I'm just not.\n\nEMMETT: What if you're trying to be somebody you are? The hell with Callahan. Stay.\n\nELLE: Call me if you're ever in California, okay?\n\nShe leaves. Emmett watches her.\nCUT TO: INT. SALON\nCut to a shot of Elle\u2019s things in her car outside the salon. Cut inside to Elle and Paulette hugging.\n\nELLE: What's the point in staying, Paulette? I mean, all people see when they look at me is blond hair and big boobs. No one's ever gonna take me seriously. The people at law school don't. Warner doesn't. I don't think my own parents take me seriously. I just felt, like, for the first time that someone expected me to\u2026 to do something more with my life than just become a Victoria's Secret model. But I was just kidding myself. Callahan never saw me as a lawyer, he just saw me as a piece of ass. Just like everybody else. Turns out I am a joke.\n\nShe begins tearing up.\n\nPAULETTE: No, you're not a joke.\n\nThey hug again. Cut to a long shot of a woman getting her hair done with Elle and Paulette in the background.\n\nELLE: The hell with law school. I just wanted to say good-bye.\n\nThe woman in the foreground turns around and is revealed to be Professor Stromwell.\n\nSTROMWELL: If you're going to let one stupid prick ruin your life\u2026\n\nStromwell approaches her.\n\nSTROMWELL: You're not the girl I thought you were.\n\nStromwell walks away.\nCUT TO: INT. PRISON\nEmmett approaches a TV and turns the volume up. A reporter is interviewing Callahan.\n\nREPORTER: Did you go in there knowing how you were going to discredit Mr. Salvatore?\n\nCALLAHAN: Absolutely. It's a little thing I'd like to call strategy.\n\nEmmett walks over to where Vivian and Brooke are sitting.\n\nBROOKE: Is he always such an ass?\n\nEMMETT: He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.\n\nBROOKE: Fine, but is he an ass that\u2019s going to win my case?\n\nEMMETT: Well, he's an ass that'll try.\n\nBROOKE: He thinks I'm guilty, doesn\u2019t he?\n\nEMMETT: That's not what's important.\n\nBROOKE: If he doesn't trust me, why should I trust him?\n\nVIVIAN: Ask Elle. She looked pretty cozy with him last night.\n\nEMMETT: No. You don't even know what the hell you're talking about.\n\nBROOKE: What's going on here?\n\nEMMETT: Elle quit.\n\nBROOKE: What?\n\nEMMETT: Yeah. Callahan hit on her, so she quit.\n\nBROOKE: Oh, my God. Scumbag.\n\nVIVIAN: Oh, God.\n\nBROOKE: What?\n\nVIVIAN: I feel terrible. I made a huge mistake.\n\nEMMETT: Well, maybe there's something we can do about it.\n\nCUT TO: INT. COURTROOM\nA bailiff lets Brooke into the room.\n\nBROOKE: Thank you.\n\nBrooke approaches the defense table where Callahan, Emmett, and another lawyer are sitting.\n\nCALLAHAN: What are you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.\n\nBROOKE: Get up.\n\nCALLAHAN: What?\n\nBROOKE: You're fired. I have new representation.\n\nCallahan throws down some files.\n\nCALLAHAN: Who?\n\nBrooke smiles and turns towards the entrance of the courtroom. Everyone in the room turns as Elle enters with David. They approach the defense table.\n\nELLE: Excuse you, you're in my way.\n\nCALLAHAN: She's a law student. She can't defend you.\n\nElle clears her throat. David reads from a legal text.\n\nDAVID: Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling 3.03.\n\nELLE: See? Thank you, David.\n\nJUDGE: Counselors, approach the bench.\n\nElle turns to go to the judge.\n\nCALLAHAN: You're not going up there.\n\nELLE: Oh, yes, I am.\n\nBROOKE: I\u2019m sorry, maybe you didn't hear me. You're fired.\n\nJUDGE: Counselors, now. All of you.\n\nElle, Callahan, Emmett, and Joyce approach the judge.\n\nELLE: Elle Woods, Your Honor. Rule 3.03 of Supreme Judicial Court states that a law student may appear on behalf of a defendant in criminal proceedings.\n\nJOYCE: Your Honor, I have no problem with this.\n\nCALLAHAN: I do. I'm not allowing it.\n\nELLE: But you agreed last night. In your office when we were discussing my career.\n\nJUDGE: The ruling also states that you need a licensed attorney to supervise you. Mr. Callahan?\n\nCALLAHAN: That I won't agree to.\n\nEMMETT: Uh, I'll supervise, Your Honor.\n\nEmmett and Callahan exchange looks.\n\nJUDGE: Well, Ms. Woods, proceed.\n\nELLE: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nThey all walk away from the judge. As Elle returns to the defense table, she sees Paulette enter with the UPS man, whose nose is bandaged. Callahan turns to Brooke.\n\nCALLAHAN: Enjoy prison.\n\nCallahan leaves.\n\nJUDGE: Mrs. Windham, you do realize what you're doing?\n\nBROOKE: Absolutely.\n\nMargot and Serena enter the courtroom.\n\nSERENA: Oh, my God! There she is! Elle!\n\nMARGOT: Elle, we came to see your trial!\n\nSERENA: Oh, look how cute! There's like a judge and everything. And jury people.\n\nMARGOT: Vote for Elle!\n\nJUDGE: Ladies, take a seat.\n\nSERENA: Go, girl.\n\nSerena and Margot sit down behind Elle. Cut to a bailiff swearing in Chutney.\n\nBAILIFF: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\n\nCHUTNEY: I do.\n\nBAILIFF: Be seated.\n\nThe bailiff leaves. Chutney sits down in the witness seat.\n\nJUDGE: Ms. Woods, you may begin your questioning.\n\nELLE: Um\u2026 First of all I would like to point out that not only is there no proof in this case, but there is a complete lack of mens rea which by definition tells us there can be no crime without a vicious will.\n\nThe prosecutors chuckle.\n\nJUDGE: I am aware of the meaning of mens rea. What I'm unaware of is why you're giving me a vocabulary lesson when you should be questioning your witness.\n\nELLE: Yes, Your Honor. Um\u2026 Miss Windham, when you arrived back at the house, was your father there?\n\nCHUTNEY: Not that I saw, but like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.\n\nELLE: And when you came downstairs, what happened?\n\nCHUTNEY: I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.\n\nELLE: But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?\n\nCHUTNEY: No. She'd stashed it by then.\n\nEMMETT: Move to strike that from the record, Your Honor. It's speculation.\n\nJUDGE: So stricken.\n\nElle looks nervously at Emmett. He nods.\n\nEMMETT: Go ahead.\n\nELLE: Miss Windham, did you hear a shot fired?\n\nCHUTNEY: No. I was in the shower.\n\nELLE: Okay, so, some time in the 20 minutes that you were in the shower, your father was shot.\n\nCHUTNEY: I guess.\n\nELLE: Your father was shot while you were in the shower, but you didn't hear the shot because\u2026 because you were in the shower?\n\nCHUTNEY: Yes. I was washing my hair.\n\nBruiser yips, startling Joyce.\n\nLAWYER: Where is she going with this?\n\nEMMETT: Have a little faith, Gerard.\n\nELLE: Um, Miss Windham, what had you done earlier that day?\n\nCHUTNEY: I got up, got a latte, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.\n\nELLE: Where you got in the shower?\n\nJUDGE: I believe the witness has made it clear that she was in the shower.\n\nThere\u2019s laughter in the courtroom.\n\nELLE: Yes, Your Honor. Um, Miss Windham, had you ever gotten a perm before?\n\nCHUTNEY: Yes?\n\nELLE: How many would you say?\n\nCHUTNEY: Two a year since I was 12. You do the math.\n\nELLE: You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko got a perm once? We all tried to talk her out of it. Curls weren't a good look for her. She didn't have your bone structure. But, thankfully, that same day, she entered the Beta Delta Pi wet t-shirt contest, where she was completely hosed down from head to toe.\n\nJOYCE: Objection! Why is this relevant?\n\nELLE: Oh, I have a point, I promise.\n\nJUDGE: Then make it.\n\nELLE: Yes, ma'am. Um, Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?\n\nCHUTNEY: Because they got wet?\n\nELLE: Exactly. Because Isn't it the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you're forbidden to wet your hair for at least 24 hours after getting a perm at the risk of deactivating the ammonium thioglycolate?\n\nJoyce looks worried.\n\nCHUTNEY: Y-yes.\n\nELLE: And wouldn't somebody who's had, say, 30 perms in their life be well aware of this rule? And if in fact you weren't washing your hair as I suspect you weren\u2019t, because your curls are still intact, wouldn't you have heard the gunshot? And if in fact you had heard the gunshot, Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs, which would mean you would have had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story plausible. Isn't that right?\n\nCHUTNEY: She's my age! Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone who was your age?\n\nELLE: You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn\u2019t you Chutney? After you shot your father.\n\nCHUTNEY: I didn't mean to shoot him. I thought it was you walking through the door!\n\nChutney points at Brooke. There are gasps in the courtroom.\n\nJUDGE: Order! Order! Order!\n\nThe noise in the courtroom continues. Joyce gasps.\n\nELLE: Oh, my God.\n\nBROOKE: Oh, my God.\n\nJUDGE: Oh, my God.\n\nEmmett looks at Elle. She approaches the defense table.\n\nJUDGE: Bailiff, take the witness into custody, where she will be charged for the murder of Heyworth Windham.\n\nEmmett shakes Elles hand.\n\nJUDGE: In the matter of The State vs. Brooke Windham, this case is dismissed. Mrs. Windham, you are free to go.\n\nEveryone cheers.\n\nBROOKE: Yes!\n\nBruiser jumps out of Elle\u2019s bag. Brooke and Elle hug. Chutney is taken away by two bailiffs. Paulette kisses the UPS man. Callahan looks disgruntled. Elle hugs David. Cut to Elle and Brooke walking down the courthouse stairs surrounded by reporters.\n\nREPORTER 1: Elle, how did you know Chutney was lying?\n\nBROOKE: Because she's brilliant, of course.\n\nELLE: The rules of hair care are simple and finite. Any Cosmo Girl would have known.\n\nCut to Elle walking through a doorway. Warner approaches her.\n\nWARNER: Elle! Elle, Elle.\n\nELLE: What?\n\nWARNER: I just wanted to say that you were so brilliant in there. And that I was wrong. And you are the girl for me.\n\nELLE: Really?\n\nWARNER: Yes. Pooh bear...I love you.\n\nHe kisses her hand.\n\nELLE: Oh, Warner. I've waited so long to hear you say that. But if I'm gonna be a partner at a law firm by the time I'm 30, I need a boyfriend who's not such a complete bonehead.\n\nShe walks away from him and out the courthouse door as two cops open it for her.\n\nELLE: Thank you, boys.\n\nShe continues walking in slow motion as the shot fades into the next one.\nCUT TO: INT. HARVARD\nText appears on screen reading \u201cTwo Years Later\u201d as the camera pans from the ceiling down to Professor Stromwell.\n\nSTROMWELL: Ladies and gentlemen, I present the graduates of Harvard Law School Class of 2004. I am personally very honored to introduce this year's class-elected speaker. After getting off to a quite interesting start here at Harvard, she graduates today with an invitation to join one of Boston's most prestigious law firms. I'm sure we are going to see great things from her. Ladies and gentlemen, Elle Woods.\n\nAs Stromwell talks, shots pan over the crowd. As she finishes, the crowd applauds. Cut to Elle smiling and getting up. Cut to Enid and David in the audience clapping happily, and then to Warner clapping slowly. Elle hugs Stromwell, who goes to sit down as Elle prepares to speak.\n\nELLE: On our very first day at Harvard, a very wise professor quoted Aristotle. \"The law is reason free from passion.\"\n\nStromwell smiles.\n\nELLE: Well, no offense to Aristotle, but in my three years at Harvard, I have come to find that passion is a key ingredient to the study and practice of law and of life. It is with passion, courage of conviction, and strong sense of self, that we take our next steps into the world, remembering that first impressions are not always correct.\n\nCut to a shot of Vivian smiling at her. Cut back to Elle.\n\nELLE: You must always have faith in people.\n\nCut to a shot of Emmett smiling at her. Cut to Warner looking glum. Cut back to Elle.\n\nELLE: And most importantly, you must always have faith in yourself. Congratulations, Class of 2004. We did it!\n\nEveryone applauds. Elle\u2019s father raises a glass to her in the audience. Everyone stands up and continues applauding. As \"Perfect Day\" by Hoku plays, we cut to shots of many of the characters while text comes up on screen describing what happens to them after the events of the movie. On a shot of Vivian text reads, \u201cVivian dumped Warner. She and Elle are now best friends.\u201d On a shot of Warner text reads, \u201cWarner graduated without honors, without a girlfriend and without any job offers.\u201d On a shot of Paulette and the UPS man text reads, \u201cPaulette married the UPS guy. They are expecting their first child, a daughter to be named Elle.\u201d On a shot of Emmett text reads, \u201cEmmett quit Callahan\u2019s firm and opened his own practice. He and Elle have been dating for the past two years.\u201d Elle smiles at him and throws her graduation cap in the air. Everyone else in the room follows suit. The camera zooms in on Elle in slow motion. On a shot of Emmett text reads, \u201cEmmett is proposing to Elle tonight.\u201d Elle smiles one last time as the screen fades to black.\nEND CREDITSEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/3406355", "artist_names": "Gerald Haywood", "full_title": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log by\u00a0Gerald\u00a0Haywood", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "id": 3406355, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 3541884, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1538871425, "path": "/Gerald-haywood-2018-haywoodindahood-listening-log-annotated", "pyongs_count": 2, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Gerald-haywood-2018-haywoodindahood-listening-log-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2018, "month": 1, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "January 1, 2018", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 1, 2018", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 26353}, "title": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log", "title_with_featured": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log", "updated_by_human_at": 1667015688, "url": "https://genius.com/Gerald-haywood-2018-haywoodindahood-listening-log-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1065349", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4184eb1c743b380255c43780ed6ef9f7.398x398x1.jpg", "id": 1065349, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4184eb1c743b380255c43780ed6ef9f7.398x398x1.jpg", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Gerald Haywood", "slug": "Gerald-haywood", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Gerald-haywood", "iq": 99371}, "artist": "Gerald Haywood", "lyrics": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log LyricsLast updated: 10/6/2018, 5:16PM MSTOctoberOctober 6Jesse Powell \u2014 Jesse Powell (1996)October 5girl in red \u2014 chapter 1 (2018)\nBlanca \u2014 Shattered (2018)\nLouGotCash (feat.
