transcript LyricsMichael Pollan: The way we eat has changed more in the last 50 years than in the previous 10,000. But the image that\u2019s used to sell the food, it is still the imagery of agrarian America. You go into the supermarket and you see pictures of farmers, the picket fence, the silo, the \u201930s farmhouse and the green grass. It\u2019s the spinning of this pastoral fantasy.\n\nThe modern American supermarket has on average 47,000 products. There are no seasons in the American supermarket. Now there are tomatoes all year round, grown halfway around the world, picked when it was green, and ripened with ethylene gas. Although it looks like a tomato, it\u2019s kind of a notional tomato. I mean, it\u2019s the idea of a tomato. In the meat aisle, there are no bones anymore. Eric Schlosser: There is this deliberate veil, this curtain, that\u2019s dropped between us and where our food is coming from. The industry doesn\u2019t want you to know the truth about what you\u2019re eating, because if you knew, you might not want to eat it.\n\nPollan: If you follow the food chain back from those shrink-wrapped packages of meat, you find a very different reality. The reality is a factory. It\u2019s not a farm. It\u2019s a factory. That meat is being processed by huge multinational corporations that have very little to do with ranches and farmers.\n\nSchlosser: Now our food is coming from enormous assembly lines where the animals and the workers are being abused. And the food has become much more dangerous in ways that are being deliberately hidden from us. Troy Roush: You\u2019ve got a small group of multinational corporations who control the entire food system. From seed to the supermarket, they\u2019re gaining control of food.\n\nSchlosser: This isn\u2019t just about what we\u2019re eating. This is about what we\u2019re allowed to say, what we\u2019re allowed to know. It\u2019s not just our health that\u2019s at risk. Carole Morison: The companies don\u2019t want farmers talking. They don\u2019t want this story told. How about a nice chicken club sandwich made with fresh cooked chicken? You know, that\u2019s a nice idea, but I think what I\u2019d really like\n\nSchlosser\u2019s voice: My favorite meal to this day remains a hamburger and french fries. I had no idea that a handful of companies had changed what we eat and how we make our food. I\u2019ve been eating this food all my life without having any idea where it comes from, any idea how powerful this industry is. And it was the idea of this world deliberately hidden from us. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why I became an investigative reporter, was to take the veil\u2013 lift the veil away from important subjects that are being hidden. (film projector clicking)\nSchlosser: The whole industrial food system really began with fast food. In the 1930s, a new form of restaurant arose and it was called the drive-in. The McDonald brothers had a very successful drive-in, but they decided to cut costs and simplify. So they fired all their carhops, they got rid of most of the things on the menu and they created a revolutionary idea to how to run a restaurant. They basically brought the factory system to the back of the restaurant kitchen. They trained each worker to just do one thing again and again and again. By having workers who only had to do one thing, they could pay them a low wage and it was very easy to find someone to replace them. It was inexpensive food, it tasted good and this McDonald\u2019s fast food restaurant was a huge huge success. That mentality of uniformity, conformity and cheapness applied widely and on a large scale has all kinds of unintended consequences. (mooing) When McDonald\u2019s is the largest purchaser of ground beef in the United States and they want their hamburgers to taste, everywhere, exactly the same, they change how ground beef is produced. The McDonald\u2019s corporation is the largest purchaser of potatoes and one of the largest purchasers of pork, chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, even apples. These big big fast food chains want big suppliers. And now there are essentially a handful of companies controlling our food system. In the 1970s, the top five beef-packers controlled only about 25% of the market. Today, the top four control more than 80% of the market. You see the same thing happening now in pork. Even if you don\u2019t eat at a fast food restaurant, you\u2019re now eating meat that\u2019s being produced by this system. You look at the labels and you see Farmer this, Farmer that\u2013 it\u2019s really just three or four companies that are controlling the meat. We\u2019ve never had food companies this big and this powerful in our history. Tyson, for example, is the biggest meat-packing company in the history of the world. The industry changed the entire way that chicken are raised. Birds are now raised and slaughtered in half the time they were 50 years ago, but now they\u2019re twice as big. People like to eat white meat, so they redesigned the chicken to have large breasts. \u2013 They not only changed the chicken, they changed the farmer. Today, chicken farmers no longer control their birds. (thudding) A company like Tyson owns the birds from the day they\u2019re dropped off until the day that they\u2019re slaughtered. (buzzes) Let me go to the top. \u2013 Man: This is the Chicken\u2013 The chicken industry has really set a model for the integration of production, processing and marketing of the products that other industries are now following because they see that we have achieved tremendous economies. In a way, we\u2019re not producing chickens; we\u2019re producing food. It\u2019s all highly mechanized. So all the birds coming off those farms have to be almost exactly the same size. What the system of intensive production accomplishes is to produce a lot of food on a small amount of land at a very affordable price. Now somebody explain to me what\u2019s wrong with that. (sniffs) Smells like money to me. (chuckles) 16 chicken houses sit here. And Chuck\u2019s son has four over the top of this hill. The chicken industry came in here and it\u2019s helped this whole community out. Here\u2019s my chicken houses here. I have about 300,000 chickens. (barks) We have a contract with Tyson. They\u2019ve been growing chickens for many many years. It\u2019s all a science. They got it figured out. If you can grow a chicken in 49 days, why would you want one you gotta grow in three months? More money in your pocket. (chickens clucking) These chickens never see sunlight. They\u2019re pretty much in the dark all the time. Man: So you think they just want to keep us out? I don\u2019t know. If I knew, I\u2019d tell you. It would be nice if y\u2019all could see what we really do, but as far as y\u2019all going in, we can\u2019t let you do that. I understand why farmers don\u2019t want to talk\u2013 because the company can do what it wants to do as far as pay goes since they control everything. But it\u2019s just gotten to the point that it\u2019s not right what\u2019s going on and I\u2019ve just made up my mind. I\u2019m gonna say what I have to say. I understand why others don\u2019t want to do it. And I\u2019m just to a point that it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Something has to be said. (loud clucking)\n\nIt is nasty in here. There\u2019s dust flying everywhere. There\u2019s feces everywhere. This isn\u2019t farming. This is just mass production, like an assembly line in a factory. (fans whirring) When they grow from a chick and in seven weeks you\u2019ve got a five-and-a-half- pound chicken, their bones and their internal organs can\u2019t keep up with the rapid growth. A lot of these chickens here, they can take a few steps and then they plop down. It\u2019s because they can\u2019t keep up all the weight that they\u2019re carrying. (wheezes) That\u2019s normal. There\u2019s antibiotics that\u2019s put into the feed and of course that passes through the chicken. The bacteria builds up a resistance, so antibiotics aren\u2019t working anymore. I have become allergic to all antibiotics and can\u2019t take \u2018em. (clucking)\n\nMorison: When it\u2019s dark inside the houses, the chickens lay down. It\u2019s less resistance when they\u2019re being caught. Traditionally, it\u2019s been African-American men. Now we\u2019re seeing more and more Latino catchers\u2013 undocumented workers. From their point of view, they don\u2019t have any rights and they\u2019re just not gonna complain. The companies like these kind of workers. It doesn\u2019t matter if the chickens get sick. All of the chickens will go to the plant for processing. The companies keep the farmers under their thumb because of the debt that the farmers have. To build one poultry house is anywhere from $280,000 to $300,000 per house. And once you make your initial investment, the companies constantly come back with demands of upgrades for new equipment, and the grower has no choice. They have to do it or you\u2019re threatened with loss of a contract. This is how they keep the farmers under control. It\u2019s how they keep them spending money, going to the bank and borrowing more money. The debt just keeps building. To have no say in your business, it\u2019s degrading. It\u2019s like being a slave to the company. Pollan: The idea that you would need to write a book telling people where their food came from is just a sign of how far removed we\u2019ve become. It seems to me that we\u2019re entitled to know about our food\u2013 \u201cWho owns it? How are they making it? Can I have a look in the kitchen?\u201d\n\nWhen I wanted to understand the industrial food system, what I set about doing was very simple. I wanted to trace the source of my food. When you go through the supermarket, what looks like this cornucopia of variety and choice is not. There is an illusion of diversity. There are only a few companies involved and there\u2019re only a few crops involved. What really surprised me most as I followed that food back to its source, I kept ending up in the same place, and that was a cornfield in Iowa. So much of our industrial food turns out to be clever rearrangements of corn. Corn has conquered the world in a lot of ways. It is a remarkable plant. 100 years ago, a farmer in America could grow maybe 20 bushels of corn on an acre. Today, 200 bushels is no problem. That\u2019s an astonishing achievement for which breeders deserve credit, for which fertilizer makers deserve credit, for which pesticide makers all deserve credit.\n\nRoush: In the United States today, 30% of our land base is being planted to corn. That\u2019s largely driven by government policy, government policy that, in effect, allows us to produce corn below the cost of production. The truth of the matter is we\u2019re paid to overproduce, and it was caused by these large multinational interests. The reason our government\u2019s promoting corn\u2013 the Cargills, the ADMs, Tyson, Smithfield\u2013 they have an interest in purchasing corn below the cost of production. They use that interest and that extensive amount of money they have to lobby Congress to give us the kind of farm bills we now have.\n\nPollan: A \u201cfarm bill,\u201d which should really be called a \u201cfood bill,\u201d codifies the rules of the entire food economy. Farm policy is always focused on these commodity crops because you can store them. We encourage farmers to grow as much corn as they can grow, to get big, to consolidate. We subsidize farmers by the bushel. Roush: We produced a lot of corn and they came up with uses for it.\n\nLarry Johnson: We are now engineering our foods. We know where to turn to for certain traits like mouth feel and flavor. And we bring all of these pieces together and engineer new foods that don\u2019t stale in the refrigerator, don\u2019t develop rancidity. Of course the biggest advance in recent years was high-fructose corn syrup. You know, I would venture to guess if you go and look on the supermarket shelf, I\u2019ll bet you 90% of them would contain either a corn or soybean ingredient, and most of the time will contain both.\n\nPollan: Corn is the great raw material. You get that big fat kernel of starch and you can break that down and reassemble it. You can make high-fructose corn syrup. You can make maltodextrin and diglycerides and xanthan gum and ascorbic acid. All those obscure ingredients on the processed food\u2013 it\u2019s remarkable how many of them can be made from corn. Plus, you can feed it to animals. Roush: Corn is the main component in feed ingredients whether it\u2019s chicken, hogs, cattle\u2013 you name it.\n\nPollan: Increasingly, we\u2019re feeding the corn to the fish whether we\u2019re eating the tilapia or the farmed salmon. We\u2019re teaching fish how to eat corn. The fact that we had so much cheap corn really allowed us to drive down the price of meat. I mean, the average American is eating over 200 lbs of meat per person per year. That wouldn\u2019t be possible had we not fed them this diet of cheap grain. Since you\u2019re selling corn at below the price of production, the feedlot operator can buy corn at a fraction of what it costs to grow, so that all the animals are sucked off of all the farms in the Midwest. There is a spiderweb of roads and train tracks all around the country moving corn from where it\u2019s being grown to these CAFOs. Cows are not designed by evolution to eat corn. They\u2019re designed by evolution to eat grass. And the only reason we feed them corn is because corn is really cheap and corn makes them fat quickly. (cow moos) Man: Where are you putting your hand? I\u2019m actually inside the rumen\u2013 that first compartment of the stomach. And it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s not\u2013 it\u2019s kind of hard to see. You can see the liquid part here.\n\nMan: Wow. There\u2019s microorganisms\u2013 bacteria in the rumen, millions of \u2018em. The animals evolved on consuming grass. There\u2019s some research that indicates that a high-corn diet results in E. coli that are acid-resistant. And these would be the more harmful E. coli.\n\nPollan: So you feed corn to cattle and E. coli, which is a very common bug, evolves, a certain mutation occurs and a strain called the \u201cE. coli 0157:h7\u2033 appears on the world stage. And it\u2019s a product of the diet we\u2019re feeding cattle on feedlots and it\u2019s a product of feedlot life. The animals stand ankle deep in their manure all day long. So if one cow has it, the other cows will get it. When they get to the slaughterhouse, their hides are caked with manure. And if the slaughterhouse is slaughtering 400 animals an hour, how do you keep that manure from getting onto those carcasses? And that\u2019s how the manure gets in the meat. And now this thing that wasn\u2019t in the world is in the food system. A fast-food nightmare may be getting worse. A two-year-old child died today in Seattle. And the killer? Tainted meat from Jack In The Box hamburgers. A nationwide recall today for more than 140 tons of ground beef. Man: A half a million pounds of ground beef\u2013 of Con Agra ground beef.\n\nSchlosser: E. coli isn\u2019t just in ground beef now\u2013 it\u2019s been found in spinach, apple juice\u2013 and this is really because of the runoff from our factory farms. 90 confirmed cases of E. coli poisoning. Central to it all\u2013 raw, bagged spinach. E. coli outbreak with leafy greens in just the last decade. Schlosser: For years during the Bush administration, the chief of staff at the USDA was the former chief lobbyist to the beef industry in Washington; the head of the F.D.A. was the former executive vice president of the National Food Processors Association. These regulatory agencies are being controlled by the very companies that they\u2019re supposed to be scrutinizing. Woman: ConAgra, which recently recalled peanut butter contaminated with salmonella, was aware of problems in its plant two years ago.\n\nSchlosser: There\u2019s always been food poisoning. As more and more technology is being applied to the production of food, you would think it would be getting safer, not more contaminated. But the processing plants have gotten bigger and bigger. it\u2019s just perfect for taking bad pathogens and spreading them far and wide. Woman: The recall of frozen hamburger now includes 22 million pounds. Enough meat to make a fast-food hamburger for every adult in America is being recalled.\nSchlosser: In the 1970s, there were literally thousands of slaughterhouses in the United States. Today we have 13 slaughterhouses that process the majority of beef that is sold in the United States. The hamburger of today, it has pieces of thousands of different cattle ground up in that one hamburger patty. The odds increase exponentially that one of those animals was carrying a dangerous pathogen. It\u2019s remarkable how toothless our regulatory agencies are when you look closely at it, and that\u2019s how the industry wants it.\n\nPatricia Buck: This is the USDA building up here. Did Josh say how much time he thought we\u2019d get? Well, maybe as much as 15. Got to be on time for that meeting. \u2013 It starts a 4:00. So if I start going like that \u2013 or start shuffling papers, it\u2019s time. \u2013 I know, it\u2019s time. Thank you! Thank you. Kowalcyk: I\u2019m a registered Republican. I\u2019ve always been fairly conservative. I never thought I would be doing this and I certainly never thought I would be working so closely with my mom. Made a mistake\u2013 I think that\u2019s the way we want to go.\n\nKowalcyk: My mom and I, our relationship has taken on a whole new dimension. 2421? 2421. Here we are. \u2013 I\u2019m Pat. to establish food standards, people just got complacent. We reduced funding for the FDA. We\u2019ve relied increasingly on self-policing for all of these industries. And now we just have, really, lost our system. You\u2019re really one of the champions on the hill for food safety and it\u2019s a very important cause. It\u2019s very personal to me and my family. Our food safety advocacy work started six years ago when my two-and- a-half-year-old son Kevin was stricken with E. coli 0157:h7 and went from being a perfectly healthy beautiful little boy\u2013 and I have a small picture with me today that was taken two weeks before he got sick. He went from that to being dead in 12 days. In July 2001, our family took a vacation. Had we known what was in store for us, we would have never gone home. We ended up eating three hamburgers before he got sick. We started to see blood in Kevin\u2019s diarrhea, so we took him to the emergency room. And they said, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten the culture back from Kevin\u2019s stool, and he has hemorrhagic E. coli.\u201d They came in and informed us that Kevin\u2019s kidneys were starting to fail. Kevin received his first dialysis treatment. He was not allowed to really drink water. We had these little sponges and we were allowed to dip that into a cup of water and then give him that. He bit the head off of one of them. You\u2019ve never seen someone beg. He begged for water. It was all he could talk about. They wouldn\u2019t let anybody bring any beverage into the room because\u2013 I mean, it was all he would talk about, was\u2026 water. (waves lapping) I don\u2019t know if he knew what was happening to him\u2026 and I hope\u2013 I don\u2019t know. To watch this beautiful child go from being perfectly healthy to dead in 12 days\u2013 it was just unbelievable that this could happen from eating food. What was kind of adding more insult to injury\u2013 it took us almost two or three years and hiring a private attorney to actually find out that we matched a meat recall. On August 1st, my son was already in the hospital. They did an E. coli test at the plant that was positive. They didn\u2019t end up recalling that meat until August 27th, 16 days after he died. If we have some more hearings\u2013 which I\u2019m sure we will\u2013 I\u2019d love to have you come and testify.\n\nKowalcyk: You never get over the death of your child. You find a new normal. \u2013 We\u2019re going this way? Kowalcyk: We put faith in our government to protect us, and we\u2019re not being protected at a most basic level. In 1998, the USDA implemented microbial testing for salmonella and E. coli 0157:h7. The idea was that if a plant repeatedly failed these tests, that the USDA would shut the plant down because they obviously had an ongoing contamination problem. The meat and poultry associations immediately took the USDA to court. The courts basically said the USDA didn\u2019t have the authority to shut down the plants. What it meant was that you could have a pound of meat or poultry products that is a petri dish of salmonella and the USDA really can\u2019t do anything about it. A new law was introduced in direct response and this law became known as Kevin\u2019s Law. It seems like such a clear-cut, common sense type thing.\n\nKowalcyk: We\u2019ve been working for six years and it still hasn\u2019t passed. I sense that there may be an opportunity\u2013 an enhanced opportunity\u2013 to get this signed into law this time. I think that from the standpoint of the consumer, a lot of people would support the idea of paying a little more if they could be guaranteed a higher standard of safety. that there are other players \u2026that tend to worry about that, because it\u2019s gonna be seen as an add-on to their costs. I think the advantage here is\u2013\n\nKowalcyk: Sometimes it does feel like industry was more protected than my son. That\u2019s what motivated me to become an advocate. In the past year alone, there have been a multitude of food-borne illness outbreaks which have resulted in significant losses. Clearly our current approach to food oversight and protection is not meeting the needs of American families. It\u2019s really hard for me to tell Kevin\u2019s story. But the only way I\u2019m going to be able to prevent it from happening to other people is to go out there and speak about it. Yeah. Six are elementary school students, one is a sibling, and there\u2019s another one in another county in Kentucky, so\u2026\n\nKowalcyk: It will be seven years since my son died. All I wanted the company to do was say \u201cWe\u2019re sorry. We produced this defective product that killed your child, and this is what we\u2019re going to do to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d That\u2019s all we wanted, and they couldn\u2019t give us that.\n\nPollan: The industrial food system is always looking for greater efficiency, but each new step in efficiency leads to problems. If you take feedlot cattle off of their corn diet, give them grass for five days, they will shed 80% of the E. coli in their gut. But of course that\u2019s not what the industry does. The industry\u2019s approach is\u2013 when it has a systematic problem like that\u2013 is not to go back and see what\u2019s wrong with the system, it\u2019s to come up some high-tech fixes that allow the system to survive. Man: The 5\u00d75 product surge tank\u2013 low level. Low level. (man speaks over radio)\n\nEldon Roth: This is our operations center. We control all of our plants from here. Where\u2019s Chicago? Here\u2019s Chicago, Georgia, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, L.A., Ohio. We control all levels of the gearboxes, the speed of motors\u2013 we can change those all from here. We built something that\u2013 from a food-safety standpoint, we think we\u2019re ahead of everybody. We think we can lessen the incidents of E. coli 0157:h7. (beeps) But I just started working with ammonia and ammonia hydroxide. Ammonia kills bacteria, so it became a processing tool. I\u2019m really a mechanic. That\u2019s really what I am. We design our own machinery. (whirring)\n\nRoth: This is our finished product. Man: Is your meat in most of the hamburgers in the country?\n\nRoth: 70%. In five years, we think we\u2019ll be in 100%. We do have some competitors. I think we\u2019re gonna beat them. -\n\nRoth: Again, it\u2019s a marriage of science and technology. (man speaking over radio) I want dollar meal\u2013 \u2026two chicken sandwich. \u2013 Man: Two small drinks, and give me a large Dr. Pepper. \u2013 $11.48. First window. Thank you. Maria Gonzalez: We didn\u2019t even think about healthy eating because we used to think everything was healthy. Maria: Now that I know that the food is really unhealthy for us, I feel guilty giving it to my kids. But we don\u2019t have time to cook because we leave at 6:00. We don\u2019t get home until 9:00, 10:00 at night. When you have only a dollar to spend and you have two kids to feed, either you go to the market and try to find something that\u2019s cheap or just go straight through a drive-thru and get two small hamburgers for them and \u201cOkay, here. Eat them.\u201d This is what\u2019s gonna fill her up, not that one single item at the market. Look at the broccoli. It\u2019s too expensive, man. First check to see how many are there for a pound. \u2013 Uh, we\u2019re not getting it. You\u2019d only get two or three. \u2013 Aww! Maria: We can find candy that\u2019s cheaper. We can find chips that are cheaper. The sodas are really cheap. Sometimes you look at a vegetable and say \u201cOkay, we can get two hamburgers over here for the same amount of price.\u201d\n\nPollan: Why is it that you can buy a double-cheeseburger at McDonald\u2019s for 99\u00a1\u00e9, and you can\u2019t even get a head of broccoli for 99\u00a1\u00e9? \u2013 We\u2019ve skewed our food system to the bad calories and it\u2019s not an accident. I mean, the reasons that those calories are cheaper is because those are the ones we\u2019re heavily subsidizing. And this is directly tied to the kind of agriculture that we\u2019re practicing and the kind of farm policies we have. All those snack-food calories are the ones that come from the commodity crops\u2013 from the wheat, from the corn and from the soybeans. By making those calories really cheap, that\u2019s one of the reasons that the biggest predictor of obesity is income level. Over the course of human history, we were struggling to make sure we had enough food and enough calories for a sizable percentage of the human race. Now the problem is too many calories. The industry blames obesity on a crisis of personal responsibility. But when you\u2019re engineering foods you are pressing our evolutionary buttons. The fact is we\u2019re hardwired to go for three tastes\u2013 salt, fat and sugar. These things are very rare in nature Now sugar is available 24/7 in tremendous quantities. We\u2019re eating hundreds of pounds of the stuff a year. This diet of high-fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates leads to these spikes of insulin and, gradually, a wearing down of the system by which our body metabolizes sugar. Maria: My husband\u2019s diabetic. One of my main concerns is he could lose his sight. He does get into\u2013 sometimes he\u2019s shaking, so I\u2019m afraid that he\u2019s gonna start not being able to drive, \u2019cause that\u2019s what he does for a profession. We have to consider his medicine. What is it, $70? 50 pills costs me about $130. Maria: But he\u2019s on two different types of pills. $100-and-something for one pill and then $100- and-something for another. That takes a lot of our income away. We\u2019re really tight from either paying for his medicine to be healthy or buying vegetables to be healthy. So which one should we do? It\u2019s hard to see my dad suffer with diabetes and stuff like that. And it\u2019s really sad to see that my sister might have it. There\u2019s something that\u2019s going on in the way that we live our lives, where we play, where we buy our food and the types of food that we\u2019re able to buy that is causing this epidemic. It\u2019s not just our community. It\u2019s not just Baldwin Park. It\u2019s everywhere. How many of us know one person in our family with diabetes? How about two? Three? Keep your hand\u2013 It used to be that type 2 diabetes only affected adults. And now it\u2019s affecting children at epidemic proportions. (kids laughing) (birds chirping) (chickens clucking)\nJoel Salatin: Everything we\u2019ve done in modern industrial agriculture is to grow it faster, fatter, bigger, cheaper. Nobody\u2019s thinking about E. coli, type 2 diabetes and the ecological health of the whole system. We\u2019re outsourcing autonomous farmer decision making\u2013 we\u2019re outsourcing that to corporate boardrooms in big cities 1,000 miles away where people make decisions and don\u2019t live with the consequences of those decisions. (cows mooing) Everything is grass based. You know, they don\u2019t eat corn, dead cows or chicken manure like they feed right here in the valley\u2013 or dead chickens. They actually eat grass, forage\u2013 you know, clover, grass, herbs. They\u2019re herbivores. If they were eating corn, you\u2019re gonna have to harvest that corn, transport that corn, then you\u2019re gonna have to haul all that manure somewhere that comes out the back end. Here\u2026 it\u2019s\u2013 there\u2013 there is the whole thing. I mean the cow is\u2013 she\u2019s fertilizing. She\u2019s mowing. We don\u2019t have to spread any manure. We don\u2019t have to harvest it\u2013 she\u2019s harvesting it. It\u2019s all real time\u2013 real solar dollars. The industrial food system gradually became so noisy, smelly, not a person-friendly place, that the people who operate those plants don\u2019t want anybody to go there, because then people would see the ugly truth. When that occurred, then we lost all the integrity and all the accountability in the food system. If we put glass walls on all the megaprocessing facilities, we would have a different food system in this country. (knife zinging)\n\nSalatin: We have allowed ourselves to become so disconnected and ignorant \u2013 \u2026as the food that we eat. What a difference this is to be out here in the fresh air, sunshine, birds singing in the trees, you know? But you see, according to the U.S.D.A, this is unsanitary because it\u2019s open to the air. They tried to close us down. One of the biggest showdowns we had was when they tried to close us down because this was unsanitary. Can you imagine? So we had them cultured at a local microbiology lab. Ours averaged 133 C.F.U. and the ones from the store averaged 3600. Of course, those have been through 40 trillion baths. Ours haven\u2019t seen any chlorine. A lot of people wonder \u201cIs this real? I mean, can you really feed the world?\u201d That whole thing is such a specious argument because, yes, we\u2019re every bit as efficient, especially if you plug in all of the inefficiencies of the industrial system. I\u2019ve had people come up at farmer\u2019s markets and say \u201cWhat? $3 a dozen for eggs?\u201d And they\u2019re drinking a 75\u00a1\u00e9 can of soda. Hey, pig. Hey, piggles. (snorting)\n\nHey, pigs. I\u2019m always struck by how successful we have been at hitting the bull\u2019s-eye of the wrong target. I mean we have learned\u2013 for example, in cattle we have learned how to\u2013 how to plant, fertilize and harvest corn using global positioning satellite technology, and nobody sits back and asks \u201cBut should we be feeding cows corn?\u201d We\u2019ve become a culture of technicians. We\u2019re all into\u2013 we\u2019re all into the how of it and nobody\u2019s stepping back and saying \u201cBut why?\u201d (laughs) I mean, a culture that just views a pig as a pile of protoplasmic inanimate structure to be manipulated by whatever creative design that humans can foist on that critter will probably view individuals within its community and other cultures in the community of nations with the same type of disdain, disrespect and controlling-type mentality. (snorting)\n\nEduardo Pe?a: The town where the plant is located is a small town called Tar Heel in the middle of a very economically-depressed area. Smithfield has mastered the art of picking and choosing a workforce that they can exploit, initially from the local workforce\u2013 the poor whites, the poor black. They went through that workforce very quickly. Now they have to bus their workers all the way from Dentsville, South Carolina, to Clinton, North Carolina. You have to draw a circle 100 miles in diameter, and that\u2019s where all of your workers are coming from. (people chatting)\n\nMan: They have the same mentality towards workers as they do towards the hogs. (squealing) Man: You know, the hog, they don\u2019t really have to worry about their comfort because they\u2019re temporary. They\u2019re gonna be killed. And they have the same viewpoint to the worker. You\u2019re not worried about the longevity of the worker because, to them, everything has an end. Man: When you\u2019ve got 2000 hogs an hour going through employees, because they\u2019re handling these guts so much, they get infections in their fingernails and all. All their fingernails separate from their fingers. with blood, feces, urine. It\u2019s easy to get hurt down there. Man: You\u2019re doing that same movement for that same piece of the hog and it\u2019s nonstop, you know. Basically you\u2019re treated as a human machine. You get people that can\u2019t afford to leave from out there, and Smithfield knows this. And that\u2019s what they hold over you.\n\nSchlosser: 100 years ago when Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle there was a beef trust that wielded enormous power. Immigrants from Eastern Europe were being abused in the absence of any kind of government regulation There were horrible disfiguring injuries and even deaths.\n\nPollan: Things got better. They slowly got better.\n\nSchlosser: Teddy Roosevelt took on the beef trust. Labor unions slowly organized meatpacking workers and turned it into one of the best industrial jobs in the United States. By the 1950s to be a meatpacking worker was like being an auto worker who has a good wage, good benefits, pension. And then what happened? Well, the meat-packing companies got bigger in order to serve the needs of the fast-food industry, which was its biggest customer. Some of the meat-packing companies like IBP borrowed the same sort of labor practices from the fast food industry\u2013 cutting wages, making sure there were no unions, speeding up production, and having the worker do the same task again and again and again. And meat-packing is now one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. The meat-packing industry also recruited a new set of immigrants\u2013 illegal immigrants and recent immigrants from Mexico. Many of the illegal immigrants coming to America were corn farmers in Mexico. NAFTA led to a flooding of the Mexican market with cheap American corn. It\u2019s put more than a million and a half Mexican farmers out of work. They couldn\u2019t compete with this cheap corn coming from America. (yelling)\n\nPollan: So what happens to those million and a half Mexican farmers?\n\nSchlosser: Meat packers like IBP, National Beef and Monfort began actively recruiting in Mexico. Companies advertised on the radio and in newspapers. IBP set up a bus service in Mexico to bring workers into the United States. For years the government turned a blind eye to the recruitment of immigrants by the meat-packing industry. But now, when there\u2019s an anti-immigrant movement, they\u2019re cracking down all of a sudden, but they\u2019re not cracking down on these companies. The government\u2019s cracking down on the workers. (clears throat) Pe?a: Immigration agents are arresting Smithfield workers Pe?a: This is an agreement between Smithfield and Immigrations authorities. They get rid of 15 workers per day, but you don\u2019t see any massive raids. That way it doesn\u2019t affect the production line. \u2013 Sir, we are trying\u2013 She is asking us questions, not you. I don\u2019t see anybody arresting no Smithfield managers. Nobody in the plant that had anything to do with the fact that those workers were hired is being arrested. What we see today is workers who were producing for this company and working hard\u2013 those are the people who get arrested. (man yelling in Spanish) Pe?a: We want to pay the cheapest price for our food. We don\u2019t understand that that comes at a price. These workers, they\u2019ve been here for 10, 15 years processing your bacon, your holiday ham and now they\u2019re getting picked up like they\u2019re criminals. (car starts) And these companies are making billions of dollars.\n\nSalatin: Is cheapness everything that there is? Who wants to buy the cheapest car? We\u2019re willing to subsidize the food system to create the \u201cmystique\u201d of cheap food, when actually it\u2019s very expensive food when you add up the environmental costs societal costs, health costs. The industrial food is not honest food. It\u2019s not priced honestly. It\u2019s not produced honestly. It\u2019s not processed honestly. There\u2019s nothing honest about that food. I can\u2019t think of a better use for a Smithfield box. Man: It was about a five-hour drive maybe 300, 400 miles. So yeah. It\u2019s worth it.\n\nSalatin: I have no desire to scale up or get bigger. My desire is to produce the best food in the world and heal. And if in doing so more people come to our corner and want stuff, then heaven help me figure out how to meet the need without compromising the integrity. That\u2013 that\u2019s where I am. I have absolutely no desire to be at Wal-Mart. As soon as you grasp for that growth, you\u2019re gonna view your customer differently, you\u2019re gonna view your product differently, you\u2019re gonna view your business differently. You\u2019re gonna view everything that is the most important\u2013 you\u2019re gonna view that differently. (snorting) (people chatting) This is our new organic line of popcorn. This is Vitasoy soy milk, the best soy milk in the entire world. This entire show when it first started was the size of this column right here.\n\nMan: Uh-huh. Several of us were sleeping in our booths. We couldn\u2019t afford hotel rooms. Organic\u2019s been growing over 20% annually. It\u2019s one of the fastest-growing segments in the food industry. My God! Ah! We\u2019re not gonna get rid of capitalism. Certainly we\u2019re not gonna get rid of it in the time that we need to arrest global warming and reverse the toxification of our air, our food and our water. We need to be much more urgent. If we attempt to make perfect the enemy of the good and say we\u2019re only going to buy food from the most-perfect system within 100 miles of us, we\u2019re never gonna get there. As an environmentalist, it was pretty clear to me that business was the source of all the pollution, business was the source of basically all the things that were destroying this world. In college I came across this little institute called New Alchemy Institute, which was a group of renegade biologists. My hope is to give you\u2013\n\nHirshberg: We were preaching a kind of a new religion, trying to develop food and waste-treatment alternatives, but we were preaching to the convinced. We were depending on sources of support that were dried up and we weren\u2019t reaching the audience that really needed these messages. I realized we need to not be David up against Goliath. We need to be Goliath. (clacking)\n\nHirshberg: When we started out, we were a seven-cow farm. We wanted to prove that business could be part of the solution to the globe\u2019s environmental problems. At the same time we had to prove that we could be highly profitable. Today in 2008, not only are in America, but we\u2019re among the most profitable. See, this is the interesting thing. A little company like this is now Kraft, but you don\u2019t have any idea that it\u2019s Kraft. This is now Pepsi. That\u2019s now Kellogg\u2019s. \u2013 Man: Kashi is Kellogg\u2019s? Yeah, this is one of those companies that started like us. \u2013 Well, it\u2019s\u2013 Make them successful, basically. The jury is out. I have to put it that way.\n\nHirshberg: These large companies don\u2019t grow organically. They grow by acquisition. Coke, Pepsi, Kellogg\u2019s, General Mills\u2013 all of them are running, not walking, into the organic food business.\n\nHirshberg: For me, when a Wal-Mart enters the organic space, I\u2019m thrilled. It\u2019s absolutely one of the most exciting things. I have dreamed of the day when I could sit with corporate titans and have conversations about organics and sustainability. \u2013 Hi Amanda. I\u2019m Rand. Okay, help me figure out where\u2013 \u2013 You\u2019re with Wal-Mart. Yup. Do you know that we don\u2019t go to Wal-Mart? \u2013 We\u2019ve never been. \u2013 Isn\u2019t that amazing? Yeah, we\u2019ve never been. We just started boycotting a long time ago and we just kept riding on that.\n\nHirshberg: Wal-Mart is terribly sensitive to their reputation. They\u2019ve obviously been vilified, probably more than any retailer in our current economy. Actually, it\u2019s a pretty easy decision to try to support things like organic, or whatever it might be, based on what the customer wants. We see that and react to it. So if it\u2019s clear the customer wants it, it\u2019s really easy to get behind it, to push forward and try to make that happen.\n\nHirshberg: When I run into my old environmental friends, many are initially horrified by the kinds of company that I\u2019m keeping these days. But when I then go on to explain what the impact of one purchase order from Wal-Mart is, in terms of not pounds but tons of pesticide, tons of herbicide, tons of chemical fertilizer, the discussion\u2013 we get away from the emotion and we get down to the facts. This is really key, though, what you guys are doing here. I have no illusions about this. I don\u2019t believe that Wal-Mart has come here because they\u2019ve suddenly had a moral enlightenment. It\u2019s because of economics. I can debate with my radical friends all day long, but nobody can challenge the fact that a sale of another million dollars to Wal-Mart helps to save the world.\n\nPollan: Back around the turn of the last century, the average farmer could feed six or eight people. Now the average American farmer can feed 126 people, okay? These are the most productive humans that have ever lived. The changes down on the farm have been momentous and radical but invisible to most of us, \u2019cause who knows a farmer anymore? But their way of life has been revolutionized. Roush: 10,000 years ago, farmers started saving their best seeds and planted again in the following year. That\u2019s how seeds have been developed. That\u2019s how corn was developed from a useless grass for the most part to the extremely productive plant it is today.\n\nPollan: The idea that any corporation could own a food crop is a very new idea. It wasn\u2019t until the 1980s that the Supreme Court said you could patent life. And that opened the floodgates\u2013 efforts to patent the most valuable parts of life, which is to say the crops on which we depend.\n\nRoush: Monsanto is a chemical company. They produced DDT, Agent Orange in Vietnam, and then they developed a product called \u201cRoundup.\u201d We started hearing rumblings about genetically-engineered soybeans that could resist the application of Roundup. When the Roundup was sprayed over top of it, it killed every weed out there except for this Roundup Ready soybean.\n\nRoush: I can remember when the first prohibition against seed saving came into being. Most farmers were just absolutely disgusted with the whole concept. It\u2019s been interesting over the course of 11 years to watch us go from utter contempt for the notion that we can\u2019t save our own seed to acceptance. Man: What happens if a farmer saves the seeds? (chuckles) Well, you know, really there\u2019s only one company involved in this now and that\u2019s Monsanto. Monsanto is\u2026 They\u2019ve got a team of private investigators that kind of roam the country and they\u2019ve got a little 1-800 hotline they take calls on. If they get a call and somebody alleges that somebody saved seed, they\u2019ll send an investigator out to look into the matter. If you save your own seed, you\u2019re gonna get a call from somebody from Monsanto. David Runyon: Two men drove in my driveway at 7:00, 7:30 at night, presented a black card to me and they never told me that they were from Monsanto. Man: They said that they had had a surveillance team, caught me cleaning beans. Moe Parr: I found it necessary to get up at 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning before the investigators are on the road following me.\n\nRunyon: They were\u2013 I\u2019m gonna say maybe ex-military or ex-police. They were large and they were intimidating. Man: I don\u2019t know whether they had their surveillance team or whether it was my neighbor that turned me in. I don\u2019t know. Now as I turned to walk in the house, one of them said\u2013 I could hear in the back\u2013 He\u2019s guilty.\n\nRunyon: It\u2019s a real ingenious device designed back in the 1800s, and Monsanto\u2019s gonna close all of them out. So how many seed cleaners are out there in the country do you think? In the state of Indiana, there may be six. Maybe. I\u2019m not aware of\u2013 Have they all been put out of business? There\u2019s nobody left.\n\nRunyon: When Monsanto soybeans first came on the market, I just never really switched over. I was getting pretty good yield with the conventional soybeans I\u2019d been using, so I thought \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just stay where I\u2019m at.\u201d My neighbors all around me are all GMOs. If the pollen goes in, if the seed moves in, I am still held accountable. Pollan: When you genetically modify a crop, you own it. We\u2019ve never had this in agriculture.\n\nRoush: Used to be that your land-grant universities, they developed what was called public seed. The vast majority of the plant breeding was actually done in these public institutions Pollan: Monsanto is very much like Microsoft. The same way Microsoft owns the intellectual property behind most computers in America, they set out to own the intellectual property behind most of the food in America.\n\nRoush: Public plant breeding is a thing of the past. There virtually are no public seeds anymore. Runyon: There\u2019s only like four or five varieties that I can actually plant. Now I have some of the last soybeans coming out of the state of Illinois\u2013 When it comes to the point that I can\u2019t buy any more certified seed, what do I do? What are my options? I acquired this list that was mailed to me. The black list here is Monsanto\u2019s unauthorized growers list. Wow. Either farmers that have judgments against them, or businesses, or else it\u2019s\u2013 or it\u2019s farmers that have not submitted their paperwork, will not turn over their records. For my case, that\u2019s why I\u2019m on there\u2013 \u2019cause I would not turn over my records. Wow. I see two of the farmers that I work for on here. This list\u2013 now it comes down to the point where I cannot buy Monsanto products, okay? Right. So it\u2019s coming down to What can I plant? Parr: Monsanto is suing me on the basis that I\u2019m encouraging the farmer to break the patent law by cleaning their own seed. I haven\u2019t been in a courtroom yet and my bill is already $25,000. People that were friends of mine now are reticent to even talk with me. We\u2019ve been friends for 50 years, and now we can hardly be seen together. Right. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m really guilty, but it was cheaper to pay the fine than it was to try to fight it. \u2026because if you think you\u2019re right at something, but yet you admit you\u2019re wrong.\n\nRoush: Monsanto falsely accused us of violating their patent and breach of contract. None of it was true. You go into a market, you find a dominant farmer and if you can ruin them, you scare the rest of them to following the line. My family spent $400,000 fighting the battle, pretrial. And we were told it would take another million to take the thing to trial. We settled out of court. The way the system appeared to work to me was Lady Justice had the scales and you piled cash on the scales and the one that piled the most cash on the scales, hired the most experts and was most willing to tell the biggest lies, that was the winner. That seems to be how our justice system functions now. It\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s terrible. How can a farmer defend himself against a multinational corporation like Monsanto? I talked to a young man just three days ago. They\u2019d been to his farm, you know? And this poor kid, he\u2019s just starting out. His fianc\u00a8\u00a6e was there. I talked to her and tried to give them the best advice I could. Unfortunately the best advice I could give them was \u201cTry to get out of this thing with your skin intact. Don\u2019t fight \u2018em. You\u2019ve got to roll over and give them what they want, \u2019cause you can\u2019t defend yourself.\u201d In the case of Monsanto, their control is so dominant. If you want to be in production agriculture, you\u2019re gonna be in bed with Monsanto. They own the soybean. They are going to control that product from seed to the supermarket. They are, in effect, gaining control of food.\n\nPollan: There has been this revolving door between Monsanto\u2019s corporate offices and the various regulatory and judicial bodies that have made the key decisions.\n\nRoush: Justice Clarence Thomas was a Monsanto attorney. That wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal if it weren\u2019t for one court case that really decided this whole seed-saving issue. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion in a case that allowed these companies to prevent farmers from saving their own seed. Pollan: Monsanto had very close ties to the Bush administration\u2026 and the Clinton administration. This goes to why we haven\u2019t had much political debate over this radical change to our food system.\n\nPollan: For the last 25 years, our government has been dominated by the industries that it was meant to be regulating.\n\nSchlosser: The challenge is as soon as you have people with expertise in industry, they may turn out to be very good regulators. It\u2019s really about what interests they decide to represent. You\u2019re talking about power\u2013 centralized power and that power is being used against the people who are really producing the food like the farmers. It\u2019s being used against the workers who work for these companies and it\u2019s being used against consumers who are deliberately being kept in the dark about what they\u2019re eating, where it comes from and what it\u2019s doing to their bodies. (kids laughing)\n\nWoman: Good afternoon, Madame Chair and members. SB-63 is a consumer right-to-know measure. It simply requires that all foods that are cloned must be labeled as cloned foods. These cloned animals are a fundamentally new thing. But I find it incredible that the FDA not only wants to allow the sale of meat from cloned animals without further research, but also wants to allow the sale of this meat without any labeling. How many witnesses in opposition, please? Noelle Cremers with California Farm Bureau. And if I can point out\u2013 the reason that we are concerned with labeling is it creates unnecessary fear in a consumer\u2019s mind. Until the industry has an opportunity to educate why we want to use this technology and the value of the technology, we don\u2019t feel that consumers just having a warning label will help them. (chatting)\n\nPollan: These companies fight tooth and nail against labeling. The fast food industry fought against giving you the calorie information. They fought against telling you if there\u2019s trans fat in their food. The meat packing industry for years prevented country-of-origin labeling. They fought not to label genetically modified foods, and now 78% of the processed food in the supermarket has some genetically- modified ingredient. I think it\u2019s one of the most important battles for consumers to fight\u2013 is the right to know what\u2019s in their food and how it was grown. Not only do they not want you to know what\u2019s in it, they have managed to make it against the law to criticize their products. Man: Can you tell me how you\u2019ve changed how you eat? Yeah, we\u2013 you\u2019ll probably have to talk to an attorney before you would put this in there. What? You can say this is\u2013 we\u2019ve stopped\u2013 I know, but\u2013 I could have the meat and poultry industry coming after me and I really\u2013 Seriously? For saying\u2013 that it\u2019s so\u2013 It depends on the context. You\u2019re not saying Someone else don\u2019t eat it. Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, Robbie, but I get asked this all the time. Initially, my reaction was \u201cI don\u2019t care. Let them sue me. Let them try and sue the mother of a dead child and see.\u201d It\u2019s pretty amazing that you can\u2019t say \u2013 how you and your family have changed\u2013 (stammers) are different. The food industry has different protections than other industries do. We have a lot of questions about this mad cow disease.\n\nKowalcyk: If you recall the case where Oprah was sued by the meat industry for something she said on her show. It has just stopped me cold from eating another burger. \u2013 Good morning, y\u2019all. it\u2019s finally winding down? Well, I think I can say that, right? I can say that, yeah. I can see the end in sight.\n\nSchlosser: In Colorado it\u2019s a felony if you\u2019re convicted under a veggie libel law. So you could go to prison for criticizing the ground beef that\u2019s being produced in the state of Colorado. There is an effort in several farm states to make it illegal to publish a photo of any industrial food operation, any feedlot operation.\n\nSchlosser: At the same time, they\u2019ve also gotten bills passed that are called cheeseburger bills that make it very very difficult for you to sue them. These companies have legions of attorneys and they may sue even though they know they can\u2019t win just to send a message. Man: We are on record for the deposition of Maurice Parr in the matter of Monsanto Company and Monsanto Technology versus Maurice Parr. your bank records in this case. Do you know that? Parr: I\u2019ll tell you, what really scared me the most today was the fact that they have every check that I have written from every bank account that I\u2019ve used in the last 10 years. Mr. Parr? Three. this Dell computer? Which ones are soybean seed cleaning customers? Parr: These people are not just customers, they\u2019re personal friends. It\u2019s extremely heart-wrenching for me to know that this list is in the possession of Monsanto. Harold Sinn? Beans only. Stephen Pennell: This is the first case in which a seed company is suing the person who does the cleaning of the seed. So if Monsanto\u2019s claims are upheld in this case, that would not only put Moe out of business, but it would prohibit every grower in the country from doing what Moe does as a precedent in future cases. Have any of these customers specifically told you that they are not going to use Parr\u2019s voice: This essentially puts me out of business. \u2013 Parr\u2019s voice: I\u2019m finished. Jerry Kaufman. Bill Zeering. Robert Duvall.\n\nPollan: We\u2019ve had a food system that\u2019s been dedicated to the single virtue of efficiency, so we grow a very small number of crops, a very small number of varieties, a very small number of companies. And even though you achieve efficiencies, the system gets more and more precarious. You will have a breakdown eventually. And where the breakdown comes in the system we don\u2019t always know.\n\nRoush: Modern production agriculture is highly dependent on large amounts of petroleum. Our farm, we\u2019re going to use about 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel a year.\n\nPollan: We eat a lot of oil without knowing it. To bring a steer to slaughter, it\u2019s 75 gallons of oil. So what we\u2019re seeing is that this highly-efficient machine does not have the resilience to deal with shocks such as the spike in oil prices. Food prices last month were 3.9% higher than they were a year ago. Take corn, another basic source of food, up to a 12-year high.\n\nPollan: For a while, we could sell grains so cheaply anywhere in the world, farmers in other countries who aren\u2019t being subsidized could not compete with us. So their capacity to grow food for themselves was compromised.\n\nRoush: The world\u2019s running out of food and nobody\u2019s talking about it. We have no reserves. Man: There have been protests around the world. The food crisis has already brought down one government.\n\nPollan: A month doesn\u2019t go by where there isn\u2019t a story in the news that peels back the curtain on how that industrial food is made. (mooing pitifully) Man: Downer cows\u2013 too ill or lame to walk\u2013 being brutalized to get them to their feet for slaughter. Woman: Millions of gallons of concentrated hog manure flushing their contents downriver. Government\u2019s food czar reported that there are no tools in place to track the origin of the latest salmonella outbreak.\n\nPollan: Every time one of these stories comes out, America learns a little bit more\u2013 what\u2019s going on in the kitchen where their food is being prepared. And every time they turn away in revulsion and start looking for alternatives.\n\nHirshberg: The irony is that the average consumer does not feel very powerful. They think they are the recipients of whatever industry has put out there for them to consume. Trust me, it\u2019s the exact opposite. When we run an item past the supermarket scanner, we\u2019re voting for local or not, organic or not. At Wal-Mart, we made a decision about a year ago to go through a process of becoming rBST-free in our milk supply. We made that decision based on customer preference.\n\nHirshberg: Individual consumers changed the biggest company on earth and in so doing, probably put the last nail in the coffin for synthetic growth hormone.\n\nPollan: To eat well in this country costs more than to eat badly. It will take more money and some people simply don\u2019t have it. And that\u2019s one of the reasons that we need changes at the policy level, so that the carrots are a better deal than the chips.\n\nSchlosser: People think \u201cThese companies are so big and so powerful, how are we ever going to change things?\u201d But look at the tobacco industry. It had huge control over public policy and that control was broken. The battle against tobacco is a perfect model of how an industry\u2019s irresponsible behavior can be changed. (people talking)\n\nSalatin: Imagine what it would be if, as a national policy, we said we would be only successful if we had fewer people going to the hospital next year than last year. How about that for success? The idea then would be to have such nutritionally dense unadulterated food that people who ate it actually felt better, had more energy, and weren\u2019t sick as much. Now see, that\u2019s a noble goal.\n\nKowalcyk: I can\u2019t change the fact that Kevin\u2019s dead. When you tell somebody you\u2019ve lost a child, I really don\u2019t like that look of pity that comes into their eyes, that they feel sorry for me. I can have a pity party all by myself very well, thank you. I don\u2019t need it from other people. What I need them to do is listen and help me effect a change. Roush: You have to understand that we farmers, we\u2019re gonna deliver to the marketplace what the marketplace demands. If you want to buy $2 milk, you\u2019re gonna get a feedlot in the backyard. It\u2019s that simple. People have got to start demanding good, wholesome food of us. And we\u2019ll deliver. I promise you. We\u2019re very ingenious people. We\u2019ll deliver. That\u2019s all I had to say. (\u201cThis Land is Your Land\u201d playing) (audience cheering)\n\nWhen I rode that ribbon highway\n\nI saw above me\n\nThe endless skyway\n\nI saw below me\n\nThe golden valley\n\nWell, this land

can't lose the weight, then you're just fat\nBut if you lose too much, then you're on crack\nYou're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't\nSo, you might as well just do whatever you

you're a self-righteous son of a...\nCan't win for losin', you'll just disappoint 'em\nJust 'cause you can't beat 'em, don't mean you should join 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, make lots of noise (Hey), kiss

Who Was Gonna Die Young Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI like fast cars and sharp dreams\nChased a lot of crazy things\nLeft behind my share of broken pieces\nThis morning I turned 36\nWhen you just remember half of it\nYou wonder how you outlived Hank and Jesus\n\n[Chorus]\nI put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder\nBut you kept me from goin' under\nWhen that current got too heavy\nI always thought I'd be a heap of metal\nIn a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal\nSold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy\nFear, I've had none\nWhat the hell made you wanna love\nA man who was gonna die young\n[Verse 2]\nIn the mirror I saw my surprise\nWho knew gray hairs liked to hide on a head\nThat didn't think he'd live past thirty\nIf I make it thirty more\nIt's the brown that you'll be looking for\nAs you run your fingers through it and say\n\"Slow down, honey.\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder\nBut you kept me from goin' under\nWhen that current got too heavy\nI always thought I'd be a heap of metal\nIn a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal\nSold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy\nFear, I've had none\nWhat the hell made you wanna love\nA man who was gonna die young\n\n[Verse 3]\nCall it intuition, or call it crazy\nJust thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies\nBut I'll gladly stick around if we're together\nSo baby, when you bow your head tonight\nCould you tell the Lord I've changed my mind?\nAnd with you I'd like to live foreverSee Eric Church LiveGet tickets as low as $440You might also like2Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

of fear and the peace came quickly\nFreedom\nI was in the dark and then it hit me\nI chose suffering and pain and I live for the rain\nI know, I gotta get out into the world again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut

He had never known her, but she was his mother's own sister, the daughter of a Moscow merchant, one Paparchin, who had died a bankrupt. But the elder brother of this same Paparchin, had been an eminent and very rich merchant. A year since it had so happened that his only two sons had both died within the same month. This sad event had so affected the old man that he, too, had died very shortly after. He was a widower, and had no relations left, excepting the prince's aunt, a poor woman living on charity, who was herself at the point of death from dropsy; but who had time, before she died, to set Salaskin to work to find her nephew, and to make her will bequeathing her newly-acquired fortune to him.\n\nIt appeared that neither the prince, nor the doctor with whom he lived in Switzerland, had thought of waiting for further communications; but the prince had started straight away with Salaskin's letter in his pocket.\n\n\"One thing I may tell you, for certain,\" concluded Ptitsin, addressing the prince, \"that there is no question about the authenticity of this matter. Anything that Salaskin writes you as regards your unquestionable right to this inheritance, you may look upon as so much money in your pocket. I congratulate you, prince; you may receive a million and a half of roubles, perhaps more; I don't know. All I do know is that Paparchin was a very rich merchant indeed.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Lebedeff, in a drunken voice. \"Hurrah for the last of the Muishkins!\"\n\"My goodness me! and I gave him twenty-five roubles this morning as though he were a beggar,\" blurted out the general, half senseless with amazement. \"Well, I congratulate you, I congratulate you!\" And the general rose from his seat and solemnly embraced the prince. All came forward with congratulations; even those of Rogojin's party who had retreated into the next room, now crept softly back to look on. For the moment even Nastasia Philipovna was forgotten.\n\nBut gradually the consciousness crept back into the minds of each one present that the prince had just made her an offer of marriage. The situation had, therefore, become three times as fantastic as before.\n\nTotski sat and shrugged his shoulders, bewildered. He was the only guest left sitting at this time; the others had thronged round the table in disorder, and were all talking at once.\n\nIt was generally agreed, afterwards, in recalling that evening, that from this moment Nastasia Philipovna seemed entirely to lose her senses. She continued to sit still in her place, looking around at her guests with a strange, bewildered expression, as though she were trying to collect her thoughts, and could not. Then she suddenly turned to the prince, and glared at him with frowning brows; but this only lasted one moment. Perhaps it suddenly struck her that all this was a jest, but his face seemed to reassure her. She reflected, and smiled again, vaguely.\n\n\"So I am really a princess,\" she whispered to herself, ironically, and glancing accidentally at Daria Alexeyevna's face, she burst out laughing.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" she cried, \"this is an unexpected climax, after all. I didn't expect this. What are you all standing up for, gentlemen? Sit down; congratulate me and the prince! Ferdishenko, just step out and order some more champagne, will you? Katia, Pasha,\" she added suddenly, seeing the servants at the door, \"come here! I'm going to be married, did you hear? To the prince. He has a million and a half of roubles; he is Prince Muishkin, and has asked me to marry him. Here, prince, come and sit by me; and here comes the wine. Now then, ladies and gentlemen, where are your congratulations?\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried a number of voices. A rush was made for the wine by Rogojin's followers, though, even among them, there seemed some sort of realization that the situation had changed. Rogojin stood and looked on, with an incredulous smile, screwing up one side of his mouth.\n\n\"Prince, my dear fellow, do remember what you are about,\" said the general, approaching Muishkin, and pulling him by the coat sleeve.\n\nNastasia Philipovna overheard the remark, and burst out laughing.\n\n\"No, no, general!\" she cried. \"You had better look out! I am the princess now, you know. The prince won't let you insult me. Afanasy Ivanovitch, why don't you congratulate me? I shall be able to sit at table with your new wife, now. Aha! you see what I gain by marrying a prince! A million and a half, and a prince, and an idiot into the bargain, they say. What better could I wish for? Life is only just about to commence for me in earnest. Rogojin, you are a little too late. Away with your paper parcel! I'm going to marry the prince; I'm richer than you are now.\"\n\nBut Rogojin understood how things were tending, at last. An inexpressibly painful expression came over his face. He wrung his hands; a groan made its way up from the depths of his soul.\n\n\"Surrender her, for God's sake!\" he said to the prince.\n\nAll around burst out laughing.\n\"What? Surrender her to you?\" cried Daria Alexeyevna. \"To a fellow who comes and bargains for a wife like a moujik! The prince wishes to marry her, and you\u2014\"\n\n\"So do I, so do I! This moment, if I could! I'd give every farthing I have to do it.\"\n\n\"You drunken moujik,\" said Daria Alexeyevna, once more. \"You ought to be kicked out of the place.\"\n\nThe laughter became louder than ever.\n\n\"Do you hear, prince?\" said Nastasia Philipovna. \"Do you hear how this moujik of a fellow goes on bargaining for your bride?\"\n\n\"He is drunk,\" said the prince, quietly, \"and he loves you very much.\"\n\n\"Won't you be ashamed, afterwards, to reflect that your wife very nearly ran away with Rogojin?\"\n\n\"Oh, you were raving, you were in a fever; you are still half delirious.\"\n\n\"And won't you be ashamed when they tell you, afterwards, that your wife lived at Totski's expense so many years?\"\n\n\"No; I shall not be ashamed of that. You did not so live by your own will.\"\n\n\"And you'll never reproach me with it?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Take care, don't commit yourself for a whole lifetime.\"\n\"Nastasia Philipovna.\" said the prince, quietly, and with deep emotion, \"I said before that I shall esteem your consent to be my wife as a great honour to myself, and shall consider that it is you who will honour me, not I you, by our marriage. You laughed at these words, and others around us laughed as well; I heard them. Very likely I expressed myself funnily, and I may have looked funny, but, for all that, I believe I understand where honour lies, and what I said was but the literal truth. You were about to ruin yourself just now, irrevocably; you would never have forgiven yourself for so doing afterwards; and yet, you are absolutely blameless. It is impossible that your life should be altogether ruined at your age. What matter that Rogojin came bargaining here, and that Gavrila Ardalionovitch would have deceived you if he could? Why do you continually remind us of these facts? I assure you once more that very few could find it in them to act as you have acted this day. As for your wish to go with Rogojin, that was simply the idea of a delirious and suffering brain. You are still quite feverish; you ought to be in bed, not here. You know quite well that if you had gone with Rogojin, you would have become a washer-woman next day, rather than stay with him. You are proud, Nastasia Philipovna, and perhaps you have really suffered so much that you imagine yourself to be a desperately guilty woman. You require a great deal of petting and looking after, Nastasia Philipovna, and I will do this. I saw your portrait this morning, and it seemed quite a familiar face to me; it seemed to me that the portrait-face was calling to me for help. I\u2014I shall respect you all my life, Nastasia Philipovna,\" concluded the prince, as though suddenly recollecting himself, and blushing to think of the sort of company before whom he had said all this.\n\nPtitsin bowed his head and looked at the ground, overcome by a mixture of feelings. Totski muttered to himself: \"He may be an idiot, but he knows that flattery is the best road to success here.\"\n\nThe prince observed Gania's eyes flashing at him, as though they would gladly annihilate him then and there.\n\n\"That's a kind-hearted man, if you like,\" said Daria Alexeyevna, whose wrath was quickly evaporating.\n\n\"A refined man, but\u2014lost,\" murmured the general.\n\nTotski took his hat and rose to go. He and the general exchanged glances, making a private arrangement, thereby, to leave the house together.\n\n\"Thank you, prince; no one has ever spoken to me like that before,\" began Nastasia Philipovna. \"Men have always bargained for me, before this; and not a single respectable man has ever proposed to marry me. Do you hear, Afanasy Ivanovitch? What do you think of what the prince has just been saying? It was almost immodest, wasn't it? You, Rogojin, wait a moment, don't go yet! I see you don't intend to move however. Perhaps I may go with you yet. Where did you mean to take me to?\"\n\n\"To Ekaterinhof,\" replied Lebedeff. Rogojin simply stood staring, with trembling lips, not daring to believe his ears. He was stunned, as though from a blow on the head.\n\n\"What are you thinking of, my dear Nastasia?\" said Daria Alexeyevna in alarm. \"What are you saying?\" \"You are not going mad, are you?\"\n\nNastasia Philipovna burst out laughing and jumped up from the sofa.\n\n\"You thought I should accept this good child's invitation to ruin him, did you?\" she cried. \"That's Totski's way, not mine. He's fond of children. Come along, Rogojin, get your money ready! We won't talk about marrying just at this moment, but let's see the money at all events. Come! I may not marry you, either. I don't know. I suppose you thought you'd keep the money, if I did! Ha, ha, ha! nonsense! I have no sense of shame left. I tell you I have been Totski's concubine. Prince, you must marry Aglaya Ivanovna, not Nastasia Philipovna, or this fellow Ferdishenko will always be pointing the finger of scorn at you. You aren't afraid, I know; but I should always be afraid that I had ruined you, and that you would reproach me for it. As for what you say about my doing you honour by marrying you-well, Totski can tell you all about that. You had your eye on Aglaya, Gania, you know you had; and you might have married her if you had not come bargaining. You are all like this. You should choose, once for all, between disreputable women, and respectable ones, or you are sure to get mixed. Look at the general, how he's staring at me!\"\n\n\"This is too horrible,\" said the general, starting to his feet. All were standing up now. Nastasia was absolutely beside herself.\n\n\"I am very proud, in spite of what I am,\" she continued. \"You called me 'perfection' just now, prince. A nice sort of perfection to throw up a prince and a million and a half of roubles in order to be able to boast of the fact afterwards! What sort of a wife should I make for you, after all I have said? Afanasy Ivanovitch, do you observe I have really and truly thrown away a million of roubles? And you thought that I should consider your wretched seventy-five thousand, with Gania thrown in for a husband, a paradise of bliss! Take your seventy-five thousand back, sir; you did not reach the hundred thousand. Rogojin cut a better dash than you did. I'll console Gania myself; I have an idea about that. But now I must be off! I've been in prison for ten years. I'm free at last! Well, Rogojin, what are you waiting for? Let's get ready and go.\"\n\n\"Come along!\" shouted Rogojin, beside himself with joy. \"Hey! all of you fellows! Wine! Round with it! Fill the glasses!\"\n\n\"Get away!\" he shouted frantically, observing that Daria Alexeyevna was approaching to protest against Nastasia's conduct. \"Get away, she's mine, everything's mine! She's a queen, get away!\"\n\nHe was panting with ecstasy. He walked round and round Nastasia Philipovna and told everybody to \"keep their distance.\"\n\nAll the Rogojin company were now collected in the drawing-room; some were drinking, some laughed and talked: all were in the highest and wildest spirits. Ferdishenko was doing his best to unite himself to them; the general and Totski again made an attempt to go. Gania, too stood hat in hand ready to go; but seemed to be unable to tear his eyes away from the scene before him.\n\n\"Get out, keep your distance!\" shouted Rogojin.\n\n\"What are you shouting about there!\" cried Nastasia \"I'm not yours yet. I may kick you out for all you know I haven't taken your money yet; there it all is on the table. Here, give me over that packet! Is there a hundred thousand roubles in that one packet? Pfu! what abominable stuff it looks! Oh! nonsense, Daria Alexeyevna; you surely did not expect me to ruin him?\" (indicating the prince). \"Fancy him nursing me! Why, he needs a nurse himself! The general, there, will be his nurse now, you'll see. Here, prince, look here! Your bride is accepting money. What a disreputable woman she must be! And you wished to marry her! What are you crying about? Is it a bitter dose? Never mind, you shall laugh yet. Trust to time.\" (In spite of these words there were two large tears rolling down Nastasia's own cheeks.) \"It's far better to think twice of it now than afterwards. Oh! you mustn't cry like that! There's Katia crying, too. What is it, Katia, dear? I shall leave you and Pasha a lot of things, I've laid them out for you already; but good-bye, now. I made an honest girl like you serve a low woman like myself. It's better so, prince, it is indeed. You'd begin to despise me afterwards\u2014we should never be happy. Oh! you needn't swear, prince, I shan't believe you, you know. How foolish it would be, too! No, no; we'd better say good-bye and part friends. I am a bit of a dreamer myself, and I used to dream of you once. Very often during those five years down at his estate I used to dream and think, and I always imagined just such a good, honest, foolish fellow as you, one who should come and say to me: 'You are an innocent woman, Nastasia Philipovna, and I adore you.' I dreamt of you often. I used to think so much down there that I nearly went mad; and then this fellow here would come down. He would stay a couple of months out of the twelve, and disgrace and insult and deprave me, and then go; so that I longed to drown myself in the pond a thousand times over; but I did not dare do it. I hadn't the heart, and now\u2014well, are you ready, Rogojin?\"\n\n\"Ready\u2014keep your distance, all of you!\"\n\n\"We're all ready,\" said several of his friends. \"The troikas [Sledges drawn by three horses abreast.] are at the door, bells and all.\"\n\nNastasia Philipovna seized the packet of bank-notes.\n\n\"Gania, I have an idea. I wish to recompense you\u2014why should you lose all? Rogojin, would he crawl for three roubles as far as the Vassiliostrof?\n\n\"Oh, wouldn't he just!\"\n\n\"Well, look here, Gania. I wish to look into your heart once more, for the last time. You've worried me for the last three months\u2014now it's my turn. Do you see this packet? It contains a hundred thousand roubles. Now, I'm going to throw it into the fire, here\u2014before all these witnesses. As soon as the fire catches hold of it, you put your hands into the fire and pick it out\u2014without gloves, you know. You must have bare hands, and you must turn your sleeves up. Pull it out, I say, and it's all yours. You may burn your fingers a little, of course; but then it's a hundred thousand roubles, remember\u2014it won't take you long to lay hold of it and snatch it out. I shall so much admire you if you put your hands into the fire for my money. All here present may be witnesses that the whole packet of money is yours if you get it out. If you don't get it out, it shall burn. I will let no one else come; away\u2014get away, all of you\u2014it's my money! Rogojin has bought me with it. Is it my money, Rogojin?\"\n\n\"Yes, my queen; it's your own money, my joy.\"\n\n\"Get away then, all of you. I shall do as I like with my own\u2014don't meddle! Ferdishenko, make up the fire, quick!\"\n\n\"Nastasia Philipovna, I can't; my hands won't obey me,\" said Ferdishenko, astounded and helpless with bewilderment.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" cried Nastasia Philipovna, seizing the poker and raking a couple of logs together. No sooner did a tongue of flame burst out than she threw the packet of notes upon it.\n\nEveryone gasped; some even crossed themselves.\n\n\"She's mad\u2014she's mad!\" was the cry.\n\n\"Oughtn't-oughtn't we to secure her?\" asked the general of Ptitsin, in a whisper; \"or shall we send for the authorities? Why, she's mad, isn't she\u2014isn't she, eh?\"\n\n\"N-no, I hardly think she is actually mad,\" whispered Ptitsin, who was as white as his handkerchief, and trembling like a leaf. He could not take his eyes off the smouldering packet.\n\n\"She's mad surely, isn't she?\" the general appealed to Totski.\n\n\"I told you she wasn't an ordinary woman,\" replied the latter, who was as pale as anyone.\n\n\"Oh, but, positively, you know\u2014a hundred thousand roubles!\"\n\n\"Goodness gracious! good heavens!\" came from all quarters of the room.\n\nAll now crowded round the fire and thronged to see what was going on; everyone lamented and gave vent to exclamations of horror and woe. Some jumped up on chairs in order to get a better view. Daria Alexeyevna ran into the next room and whispered excitedly to Katia and Pasha. The beautiful German disappeared altogether.\n\n\"My lady! my sovereign!\" lamented Lebedeff, falling on his knees before Nastasia Philipovna, and stretching out his hands towards the fire; \"it's a hundred thousand roubles, it is indeed, I packed it up myself, I saw the money! My queen, let me get into the fire after it\u2014say the word-I'll put my whole grey head into the fire for it! I have a poor lame wife and thirteen children. My father died of starvation last week. Nastasia Philipovna, Nastasia Philipovna!\" The wretched little man wept, and groaned, and crawled towards the fire.\n\n\"Away, out of the way!\" cried Nastasia. \"Make room, all of you! Gania, what are you standing there for? Don't stand on ceremony. Put in your hand! There's your whole happiness smouldering away, look! Quick!\"\n\nBut Gania had borne too much that day, and especially this evening, and he was not prepared for this last, quite unexpected trial.\n\nThe crowd parted on each side of him and he was left face to face with Nastasia Philipovna, three paces from her. She stood by the fire and waited, with her intent gaze fixed upon him.\n\nGania stood before her, in his evening clothes, holding his white gloves and hat in his hand, speechless and motionless, with arms folded and eyes fixed on the fire.\n\nA silly, meaningless smile played on his white, death-like lips. He could not take his eyes off the smouldering packet; but it appeared that something new had come to birth in his soul\u2014as though he were vowing to himself that he would bear this trial. He did not move from his place. In a few seconds it became evident to all that he did not intend to rescue the money.\n\n\"Hey! look at it, it'll burn in another minute or two!\" cried Nastasia Philipovna. \"You'll hang yourself afterwards, you know, if it does! I'm not joking.\"\n\nThe fire, choked between a couple of smouldering pieces of wood, had died down for the first few moments after the packet was thrown upon it. But a little tongue of fire now began to lick the paper from below, and soon, gathering courage, mounted the sides of the parcel, and crept around it. In another moment, the whole of it burst into flames, and the exclamations of woe and horror were redoubled.\n\n\"Nastasia Philipovna!\" lamented Lebedeff again, straining towards the fireplace; but Rogojin dragged him away, and pushed him to the rear once more.\n\nThe whole of Rogojin's being was concentrated in one rapturous gaze of ecstasy. He could not take his eyes off Nastasia. He stood drinking her in, as it were. He was in the seventh heaven of delight.\n\n\"Oh, what a queen she is!\" he ejaculated, every other minute, throwing out the remark for anyone who liked to catch it. \"That's the sort of woman for me! Which of you would think of doing a thing like that, you blackguards, eh?\" he yelled. He was hopelessly and wildly beside himself with ecstasy.\n\nThe prince watched the whole scene, silent and dejected.\n\n\"I'll pull it out with my teeth for one thousand,\" said Ferdishenko.\n\n\"So would I,\" said another, from behind, \"with pleasure. Devil take the thing!\" he added, in a tempest of despair, \"it will all be burnt up in a minute\u2014It's burning, it's burning!\"\n\n\"It's burning, it's burning!\" cried all, thronging nearer and nearer to the fire in their excitement.\n\n\"Gania, don't be a fool! I tell you for the last time.\"\n\n\"Get on, quick!\" shrieked Ferdishenko, rushing wildly up to Gania, and trying to drag him to the fire by the sleeve of his coat. \"Get it, you dummy, it's burning away fast! Oh\u2014damn the thing!\"\n\nGania hurled Ferdishenko from him; then he turned sharp round and made for the door. But he had not gone a couple of steps when he tottered and fell to the ground.\n\n\"He's fainted!\" the cry went round.\n\n\"And the money's burning still,\" Lebedeff lamented.\n\n\"Burning for nothing,\" shouted others.\n\n\"Katia-Pasha! Bring him some water!\" cried Nastasia Philipovna. Then she took the tongs and fished out the packet.\n\nNearly the whole of the outer covering was burned away, but it was soon evident that the contents were hardly touched. The packet had been wrapped in a threefold covering of newspaper, and the notes were safe. All breathed more freely.\n\n\"Some dirty little thousand or so may be touched,\" said Lebedeff, immensely relieved, \"but there's very little harm done, after all.\"\n\n\"It's all his\u2014the whole packet is for him, do you hear\u2014all of you?\" cried Nastasia Philipovna, placing the packet by the side of Gania. \"He restrained himself, and didn't go after it; so his self-respect is greater than his thirst for money. All right\u2014he'll come to directly\u2014he must have the packet or he'll cut his throat afterwards. There! He's coming to himself. General, Totski, all of you, did you hear me? The money is all Gania's. I give it to him, fully conscious of my action, as recompense for\u2014well, for anything he thinks best. Tell him so. Let it lie here beside him. Off we go, Rogojin! Goodbye, prince. I have seen a man for the first time in my life. Goodbye, Afanasy Ivanovitch\u2014and thanks!\"\n\nThe Rogojin gang followed their leader and Nastasia Philipovna to the entrance-hall, laughing and shouting and whistling.\n\nIn the hall the servants were waiting, and handed her her fur cloak. Martha, the cook, ran in from the kitchen. Nastasia kissed them all round.\n\n\"Are you really throwing us all over, little mother? Where, where are you going to? And on your birthday, too!\" cried the four girls, crying over her and kissing her hands.\n\n\"I am going out into the world, Katia; perhaps I shall be a laundress. I don't know. No more of Afanasy Ivanovitch, anyhow. Give him my respects. Don't think badly of me, girls.\"\n\nThe prince hurried down to the front gate where the party were settling into the troikas, all the bells tinkling a merry accompaniment the while. The general caught him up on the stairs:\n\n\"Prince, prince!\" he cried, seizing hold of his arm, \"recollect yourself! Drop her, prince! You see what sort of a woman she is. I am speaking to you like a father.\"\n\nThe prince glanced at him, but said nothing. He shook himself free, and rushed on downstairs.\n\nThe general was just in time to see the prince take the first sledge he could get, and, giving the order to Ekaterinhof, start off in pursuit of the troikas. Then the general's fine grey horse dragged that worthy home, with some new thoughts, and some new hopes and calculations developing in his brain, and with the pearls in his pocket, for he had not forgotten to bring them along with him, being a man of business. Amid his new thoughts and ideas there came, once or twice, the image of Nastasia Philipovna. The general sighed.\n\n\"I'm sorry, really sorry,\" he muttered. \"She's a ruined woman. Mad! mad! However, the prince is not for Nastasia Philipovna now,\u2014perhaps it's as well.\"\n\nTwo more of Nastasia's guests, who walked a short distance together, indulged in high moral sentiments of a similar nature.\n\"Do you know, Totski, this is all very like what they say goes on among the Japanese?\" said Ptitsin. \"The offended party there, they say, marches off to his insulter and says to him, 'You insulted me, so I have come to rip myself open before your eyes;' and with these words he does actually rip his stomach open before his enemy, and considers, doubtless, that he is having all possible and necessary satisfaction and revenge. There are strange characters in the world, sir!\"\n\n\"H'm! and you think there was something of this sort here, do you? Dear me\u2014a very remarkable comparison, you know! But you must have observed, my dear Ptitsin, that I did all I possibly could. I could do no more than I did. And you must admit that there are some rare qualities in this woman. I felt I could not speak in that Bedlam, or I should have been tempted to cry out, when she reproached me, that she herself was my best justification. Such a woman could make anyone forget all reason\u2014everything! Even that moujik, Rogojin, you saw, brought her a hundred thousand roubles! Of course, all that happened tonight was ephemeral, fantastic, unseemly\u2014yet it lacked neither colour nor originality. My God! What might not have been made of such a character combined with such beauty! Yet in spite of all efforts\u2014in spite of all education, even\u2014all those gifts are wasted! She is an uncut diamond.... I have often said so.\"\nAnd Afanasy Ivanovitch heaved a deep sigh.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/225024", "artist_names": "One Direction", "full_title": "Diana by\u00a0One\u00a0Direction", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/aee7c080c94f4d46135c2b80c7102f93.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aee7c080c94f4d46135c2b80c7102f93.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 225024, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 246999, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1663541509, "path": "/One-direction-diana-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 38, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/One-direction-diana-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 18}, "release_date_for_display": "November 18, 2013", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Nov. 18, 2013", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/f6ff378fab5e667838e5c62e33b92f51.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/f6ff378fab5e667838e5c62e33b92f51.500x500x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 179437}, "title": "Diana", "title_with_featured": "Diana", "updated_by_human_at": 1663541533, "url": "https://genius.com/One-direction-diana-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/19657", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d556360ef2b1a2f6a80d526a9a957a80.1000x709x1.jpg", "id": 19657, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d4e08e9c7edd1833b410b078a8b33483.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "o", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "One Direction", "slug": "One-direction", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/One-direction"}, "artist": "One Direction", "lyrics": "TranslationsPortugu\u00easDiana Lyrics[Intro: Zayn]\nDiana\n\n[Verse 1: Liam, All, Harry]\nThe front pages are your pictures, they make you look so small\nHow could someone not miss you at all?

Sia]\nI can feel the heat risin'\nEverything is on fire\nToday's a painful re-\nMinder of why\nIt can only get brighter\nThe further you put it behind ya\nBut right now I'm on the\nInside lookin' out, \u2018cause\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Sia]\nI'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nYesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after\nYour world is torn in half, you wake in its wake\nTo start the mourning process and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress\nToday's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous asthma\nThunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it and poked its\nEye out with the thornbush that ya used to smell the roses\nStopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is stuffed\nSo focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal\nAnd hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back\nMay hit the curb, but every day's a new learning curve as ya\nSteer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to\nTo avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage\n\u2018Cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass\nAnd threw dirt on your casket, but you've returned from the ashes\nAnd that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline\nAnd while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chantin'\n\n[Chorus: Sia]\nI'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Eminem]\nYou're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like\nIt happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life\nAnd it's as though you feel you've died, 'cause you've been killed inside\nBut yet you're still alive, which means you will survive\nAlthough today you may weep \u2018cause you're weak and\nEverything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'\nIt begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'\nYou from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end\nAnd I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling\nAnd with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow\nYou may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em\nEven after all the shit you've been put through, this feeling of resilience is building\nAnd the flames are burnin' quick as fire would (firewood) through this building\nYou're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it\nAnd as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down, \u2018cause you're so over 'em\nYou could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nAs time passes, things change every day\nBut wounds, wounds heal but scars still remaining the same\nBut tomorrow, today's going down in flames\nThrow the match, set the past ablaze\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nSo feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even\nPerspire from the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief\nAnd as you say goodbye to the grief, it's like watching the walls melt\nIn your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin' hell\nStill, a little piece of you dies as you scream\u2014\n[Chorus: Sia]\nI'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\n[Bridge: Sia]\nI feel the burn\nWatch the smoke as I turn, rising\nA phoenix from the flames\nI have learned\nFrom fighting fights that weren't mine\nIt's not with fists\nBut with wings that I will fly\n\n[Chorus: Sia]\nAnd I'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light238Embed"}, {"_type":

this someday will be over\nI pull you close, so much to lose\nKnowing that nothing lasts forever\nI didn\u2019t care, before you were here\nI danced in laughter, with the ever after\nBut all things change, let this remain\n[Verse 2]\nHear the sirens covering distance in the night\nThe sound echoing closer, will they come for me next time?\nFor every choice, mistake I made it's not my plan\nTo send you in the arms of another man\nAnd if you choose to stay, I\u2019ll wait, I\u2019ll understand\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOh, it\u2019s a fragile thing, this life we lead\nIf I think too much, I can get over-\nWhelmed by the grace, by which we live our lives\nWith death over our shoulders\nWant you to know, that should I go\nI always loved you, held you high above too\nI studied your face, the fear

if I go in there\nBack rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out\nTalkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now\nTalkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get

all these things on his bucket list\nAnd now he's actin' like, \"Oh, well, this is life, I guess\"\nNah, fuck that shit\nListen, man, you can still do what you wanna do\nYou gotta trust that shit\nHeard once that in dire times when you need a sign\nThat's when they appear\nGuess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here\nI hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment\nTelling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit\nLike that's true shit\nAnd all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round\nStarted treating me like I'm \"him\" now\nLike we don't know each other, we ain't grow together\nWe just friends now\nShit got me feeling pinned down\nPick the pen up or put the pen down?\nI'm writing to you from a distance like a

On tour, gettin' money\nY'all don't even really check for me\nYou ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl\nYou don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl\n'Cause you

record\nI'm gettin' twenty million off the record\nJust to off these records, nigga, that's a record\nI'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure\nPast the present when you have to mention\nThis is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though\n'Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go\nHeavy airplay all day with no chorus\nWe keep it thorough, nigga\nRap like this for all of my borough niggas\nI reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga\nI reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga\nPrince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga\nI could go a hour on this beat, nigga\nYeah, I'm just as famous as my mentor\nBut that's still the boss, don't get sent for\nGet hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for\n'Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more\nHot temper, scary outcome\nHere's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one\nThat always let they mouth run\nBench players talkin' like starters, I hate it\nStarted from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it\nYeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick\nDegenerates, but even Ellen love our shit\nRich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich\nSelf-explanatory, you just here to spread the story\nWassup?\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nSittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV\nYoung rebel, Young Money, nothin' you could tell me\nPaperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me\nI'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family\nNot even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'\nI dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it\nI'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it\nThink that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'\nOn a mission, tryna shift the culture\nTell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit\nThem strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'\nAll of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments\nFuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message\nBorn a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive\nThat shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure\nLike ayy, B, I got your CD, you get an E for effort\nI piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless\nOwl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace\nMy life's a completed checklist\nI'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now\nJust give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now\nThat's real\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nHow much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?\nLately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento\nI just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo\nThe family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk\nOff everything my pen wrote, we went from Bundy to Winslow\nThis for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo\nI sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)\nThe fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie\nAll these nineties fantasies on my mind\nThe difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time\nI might come through without security to check if you're fine\nThat's just me on my solo like \"Fuck it\", like \"YOLO\"\nWanted to tell you, \"Accept yourself\"\nYou don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself\nAnd if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help\nYou know, back on your feet and shit\nTryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit\nHow much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?\nHow this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?\nLife is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese\nAnd I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me\nNow real nigga, wassup?\nAyy, yeah, ayy\nHow much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might also like[Spoken Outro: Curtis Mayfield]\nIf there's hell below, I'll see you when you get there\nAre you enjoyin' yourselves?\nIf we may, we would just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational\nHopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years\nIt don't mean that we can't have a good life\nSo we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us\n[Produced by Noah \"40\"

last night I brought DOA to the studio\nThey already had a stage and a booty pole\nIt's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on\nBut who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?\nSomeone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)\nTold my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)\nYeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up\nBaby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?\nRap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?\nLast album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?\nAnd ya know I need ya back in my life\nGirl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like\nGirl, you got that thing for real\nWhen I was on a mission to make it\nWho used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?\nWho else

our wedding day\nA clock that don't work and the bible that your daddy gave\nIt's on the window side, where the moon creeps in at night\nStaring at the ceiling, lying here all alone\nI said a prayer for you then I said one of my own\nBut you don't reach for me, when you lie down quietly\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me how, how'd you get so far away?\nAll we have left are the memories of the love we made\nAre you sleeping with your own regret?\nOn your side of the bed\n[Verse 2: Jimi]\nOn your side of the bed there's a burned out candle flame\nA letter I started but I didn't know what to say\nNo

I mean Surf got caught with a hammer\nBut this nigga was absent, what happened bro?\nArsonal's supposed to have weapons but he don't clap 'em though\nCause the only thing that got him out alive was a Calicoe\nYou's a fucking fraud Ars, you so much of a fraud\nHe act like having a CDL is so bad and it feel wrong\nNigga any parent would be happy that they child starting to feel grown\nBut he'd rather be a nigga he not, fronting like he peel domes\nHe need to stop being the fake Arsonal and start being Darell Jones\nGo ahead and sleep they'll be bringing a stone for your mattress Cross Colors?\nI'm getting him patched that's old fashioned Revolver\nYou bugging my nigga, these old matics\nOnly reason niggas think that you raw cause you war\nBackwards\nI get all static, stretch like antennas when I spray off\nIt feeling like I'm handing him Hitler, I'm giving 8 off / Adolf\nOnly thing I'm declaring is war, dissing K arms\nJust means that I'm getting the W with this AR\nYou a bird that's why you get hit with the Dessie when the tool blam\nEagle with the hawk on the front in case the tool jam\nFront, I'm plucking ya feathers using two hands\nIn other words, I'm letting 'em fly, you getting two cans (Tucans)\nBut he lost all 3 rounds, who think he won one?\nExactly, this nigga suck\nSo I ain't gotta go no more so what's my slogan nigga?\n(ZIP EM UP!!!)Embed"}, {"_type":

was gone. The house was shut up for the evening. No more deep blue skies or crimson and amber tints. Margaret went up to dress for the early tea, finding Dixon in a pretty temper from the interruption which a visitor had naturally occasioned on a busy day. She showed it by brushing away viciously at Margaret's hair, under pretence of being in a great hurry to go to Mrs. Hale. Yet, after all, Margaret had to wait a long time in the drawing-room before her mother came down. She sat by herself at the fire, with unlighted candles on the table behind her, thinking over the day, the happy walk, happy sketching, cheerful pleasant dinner, and the uncomfortable, miserable walk in the garden.\nHow different men were to women! Here was she disturbed and unhappy, because her instinct had made anything but a refusal impossible; while he, not many minutes after he had met with a rejection of what ought to have been the deepest, holiest proposal of his life, could speak as if briefs, success, and all its superficial consequences of a good house, clever and agreeable society, were the sole avowed objects of his desires. Oh dear! how she could have loved him if he had but been different, with a difference which she felt, on reflection, to be one that went low\u2014deep down. Then she took it into her head that, after all, his lightness might be but assumed, to cover a bitterness of disappointment which would have been stamped on her own heart if she had loved and been rejected.\n\nHer mother came into the room before this whirl of thoughts was adjusted into anything like order. Margaret had to shake off the recollections of what had been done and said through the day, and turn a sympathising listener to the account of how Dixon had complained that the ironing-blanket had been burnt again; and how Susan Lightfoot had been seen with artificial flowers in her bonnet, thereby giving evidence of a vain and giddy character. Mr. Hale sipped his tea in abstracted silence; Margaret had the responses all to herself. She wondered how her father and mother could be so forgetful, so regardless of their companion through the day, as never to mention his name. She forgot that he had not made them an offer.\n\nAfter tea Mr. Hale got up, and stood with his elbow on the chimney-piece, leaning his head on his hand, musing over something, and from time to time sighing deeply. Mrs. Hale went out to consult with Dixon about some winter clothing for the poor. Margaret was preparing her mother's worsted work, and rather shrinking from the thought of the long evening, and wishing bed-time were come that she might go over the events of the day again.\n\n'Margaret!' said Mr. Hale, at last, in a sort of sudden desperate way, that made her start. 'Is that tapestry thing of immediate consequence? I mean, can you leave it and come into my study? I want to speak to you about something very serious to us all.'\n\n'Very serious to us all.' Mr. Lennox had never had the opportunity of having any private conversation with her father after her refusal, or else that would indeed be a very serious affair. In the first place, Margaret felt guilty and ashamed of having grown so much into a woman as to be thought of in marriage; and secondly, she did not know if her father might not be displeased that she had taken upon herself to decline Mr. Lennox's proposal. But she soon felt it was not about anything, which having only lately and suddenly occurred, could have given rise to any complicated thoughts, that her father wished to speak to her. He made her take a chair by him; he stirred the fire, snuffed the candles, and sighed once or twice before he could make up his mind to say\u2014and it came out with a jerk after all\u2014'Margaret! I am going to leave Helstone.'\n\n'Leave Helstone, papa! But why?'\n\nMr. Hale did not answer for a minute or two. He played with some papers on the table in a nervous and confused manner, opening his lips to speak several times, but closing them again without having the courage to utter a word. Margaret could not bear the sight of the suspense, which was even more distressing to her father than to herself.\n\n'But why, dear papa? Do tell me!'\n\nHe looked up at her suddenly, and then said with a slow and enforced calmness:\n\n'Because I must no longer be a minister in the Church of England.'\n\nMargaret had imagined nothing less than that some of the preferments which her mother so much desired had befallen her father at last\u2014something that would force him to leave beautiful, beloved Helstone, and perhaps compel him to go and live in some of the stately and silent Closes which Margaret had seen from time to time in cathedral towns. They were grand and imposing places, but if, to go there, it was necessary to leave Helstone as a home for ever, that would have been a sad, long, lingering pain. But nothing to the shock she received from Mr. Hale's last speech. What could he mean? It was all the worse for being so mysterious. The aspect of piteous distress on his face, almost as imploring a merciful and kind judgment from his child, gave her a sudden sickening. Could he have become implicated in anything Frederick had done? Frederick was an outlaw. Had her father, out of a natural love for his son, connived at any\u2014\n\n'Oh! what is it? do speak, papa! tell me all! Why can you no longer be a clergyman? Surely, if the bishop were told all we know about Frederick, and the hard, unjust\u2014'\n\n'It is nothing about Frederick; the bishop would have nothing to do with that. It is all myself. Margaret, I will tell you about it. I will answer any questions this once, but after to-night let us never speak of it again. I can meet the consequences of my painful, miserable doubts; but it is an effort beyond me to speak of what has caused me so much suffering.'\n'Doubts, papa! Doubts as to religion?' asked Margaret, more shocked than ever.\n\n'No! not doubts as to religion; not the slightest injury to that.' He paused. Margaret sighed, as if standing on the verge of some new horror. He began again, speaking rapidly, as if to get over a set task:\n\n'You could not understand it all, if I told you\u2014my anxiety, for years past, to know whether I had any right to hold my living\u2014my efforts to quench my smouldering doubts by the authority of the Church. Oh! Margaret, how I love the holy Church from which I am to be shut out!' He could not go on for a moment or two. Margaret could not tell what to say; it seemed to her as terribly mysterious as if her father were about to turn Mahometan.\n\n'I have been reading to-day of the two thousand who were ejected from their churches,'\u2014continued Mr. Hale, smiling faintly,\u2014'trying to steal some of their bravery; but it is of no use\u2014no use\u2014I cannot help feeling it acutely.'\n\n'But, papa, have you well considered? Oh! it seems so terrible, so shocking,' said Margaret, suddenly bursting into tears. The one staid foundation of her home, of her idea of her beloved father, seemed reeling and rocking. What could she say? What was to be done? The sight of her distress made Mr. Hale nerve himself, in order to try and comfort her. He swallowed down the dry choking sobs which had been heaving up from his heart hitherto, and going to his bookcase he took down a volume, which he had often been reading lately, and from which he thought he had derived strength to enter upon the course in which he was now embarked.\n\n'Listen, dear Margaret,' said he, putting one arm round her waist. She took his hand in hers and grasped it tight, but she could not lift up her head; nor indeed could she attend to what he read, so great was her internal agitation.\n\n'This is the soliloquy of one who was once a clergyman in a country parish, like me; it was written by a Mr. Oldfield, minister of Carsington, in Derbyshire, a hundred and sixty years ago, or more. His trials are over. He fought the good fight.' These last two sentences he spoke low, as if to himself. Then he read aloud,\u2014\n\n'When thou canst no longer continue in thy work without dishonour to God, discredit to religion, foregoing thy integrity, wounding conscience, spoiling thy peace, and hazarding the loss of thy salvation; in a word, when the conditions upon which thou must continue (if thou wilt continue) in thy employments are sinful, and unwarranted by the word of God, thou mayest, yea, thou must believe that God will turn thy very silence, suspension, deprivation, and laying aside, to His glory, and the advancement of the Gospel's interest. When God will not use thee in one kind, yet He will in another. A soul that desires to serve and honour Him shall never want opportunity to do it; nor must thou so limit the Holy One of Israel as to think He hath but one way in which He can glorify Himself by thee. He can do it by thy silence as well as by thy preaching; thy laying aside as well as thy continuance in thy work. It is not pretence of doing God the greatest service, or performing the weightiest duty, that will excuse the least sin, though that sin capacitated or gave us the opportunity for doing that duty. Thou wilt have little thanks, O my soul! if, when thou art charged with corrupting God's worship, falsifying thy vows, thou pretendest a necessity for it in order to a continuance in the ministry. As he read this, and glanced at much more which he did not read, he gained resolution for himself, and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right; but as he ceased he heard Margaret's low convulsive sob; and his courage sank down under the keen sense of suffering.\n\n'Margaret, dear!' said he, drawing her closer, 'think of the early martyrs; think of the thousands who have suffered.'\n\n'But, father,' said she, suddenly lifting up her flushed, tear-wet face, 'the early martyrs suffered for the truth, while you\u2014oh! dear, dear papa!'\n\n'I suffer for conscience' sake, my child,' said he, with a dignity that was only tremulous from the acute sensitiveness of his character; 'I must do what my conscience bids. I have borne long with self-reproach that would have roused any mind less torpid and cowardly than mine.' He shook his head as he went on. 'Your poor mother's fond wish, gratified at last in the mocking way in which over-fond wishes are too often fulfilled\u2014Sodom apples as they are\u2014has brought on this crisis, for which I ought to be, and I hope I am thankful. It is not a month since the bishop offered me another living; if I had accepted it, I should have had to make a fresh declaration of conformity to the Liturgy at my institution. Margaret, I tried to do it; I tried to content myself with simply refusing the additional preferment, and stopping quietly here,\u2014strangling my conscience now, as I had strained it before. God forgive me!'\n\nHe rose and walked up and down the room, speaking low words of self-reproach and humiliation, of which Margaret was thankful to hear but few. At last he said,\n\n'Margaret, I return to the old sad burden we must leave Helstone.'\n'Yes! I see. But when?'\n\n'I have written to the bishop\u2014I dare say I have told you so, but I forget things just now,' said Mr. Hale, collapsing into his depressed manner as soon as he came to talk of hard matter-of-fact details, 'informing him of my intention to resign this vicarage. He has been most kind; he has used arguments and expostulations, all in vain\u2014in vain. They are but what I have tried upon myself, without avail. I shall have to take my deed of resignation, and wait upon the bishop myself, to bid him farewell. That will be a trial, but worse, far worse, will be the parting from my dear people. There is a curate appointed to read prayers\u2014a Mr. Brown. He will come to stay with us to-morrow. Next Sunday I preach my farewell sermon.'\n\nWas it to be so sudden then? thought Margaret; and yet perhaps it was as well. Lingering would only add stings to the pain; it was better to be stunned into numbness by hearing of all these arrangements, which seemed to be nearly completed before she had been told. 'What does mamma say?' asked she, with a deep sigh.\n\nTo her surprise, her father began to walk about again before he answered. At length he stopped and replied:\n\n'Margaret, I am a poor coward after all. I cannot bear to give pain. I know so well your mother's married life has not been all she hoped\u2014all she had a right to expect\u2014and this will be such a blow to her, that I have never had the heart, the power to tell her. She must be told though, now,' said he, looking wistfully at his daughter. Margaret was almost overpowered with the idea that her mother knew nothing of it all, and yet the affair was so far advanced!\n\n'Yes, indeed she must,' said Margaret. 'Perhaps, after all, she may not\u2014Oh yes! she will, she must be shocked'\u2014as the force of the blow returned upon herself in trying to realise how another would take it. 'Where are we to go to?' said she at last, struck with a fresh wonder as to their future plans, if plans indeed her father had.\n\n'To Milton-Northern,' he answered, with a dull indifference, for he had perceived that, although his daughter's love had made her cling to him, and for a moment strive to soothe him with her love, yet the keenness of the pain was as fresh as ever in her mind.\n\n'Milton-Northern! The manufacturing town in Darkshire?'\n\n'Yes,' said he, in the same despondent, indifferent way.\n\n'Why there, papa?' asked she.\n'Because there I can earn bread for my family. Because I know no one there, and no one knows Helstone, or can ever talk to me about it.'\n\n'Bread for your family! I thought you and mamma had'\u2014and then she stopped, checking her natural interest regarding their future life, as she saw the gathering gloom on her father's brow. But he, with his quick intuitive sympathy, read in her face, as in a mirror, the reflections of his own moody depression, and turned it off with an effort.\n\n'You shall be told all, Margaret. Only help me to tell your mother. I think I could do anything but that: the idea of her distress turns me sick with dread. If I tell you all, perhaps you could break it to her to-morrow. I am going out for the day, to bid Farmer Dobson and the poor people on Bracy Common good-bye. Would you dislike breaking it to her very much, Margaret?'\n\nMargaret did dislike it, did shrink from it more than from anything she had ever had to do in her life before. She could not speak, all at once. Her father said, 'You dislike it very much, don't you, Margaret?' Then she conquered herself, and said, with a bright strong look on her face:\n\n'It is a painful thing, but it must be done, and I will do it as well as ever I can. You must have many painful things to do.'\n\nMr. Hale shook his head despondingly: he pressed her hand in token of gratitude. Margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of crying. To turn her thoughts, she said: 'Now tell me, papa, what our plans are. You and mamma have some money, independent of the income from the living, have not you? Aunt Shaw has, I know.'\n\n'Yes. I suppose we have about a hundred and seventy pounds a year of our own. Seventy of that has always gone to Frederick, since he has been abroad. I don't know if he wants it all,' he continued in a hesitating manner. 'He must have some pay for serving with the Spanish army.'\n\n'Frederick must not suffer,' said Margaret, decidedly; 'in a foreign country; so unjustly treated by his own. A hundred is left. Could not you, and I, and mamma live on a hundred a year in some very cheap\u2014very quiet part of England? Oh! I think we could.'\n\n'No!' said Mr. Hale. 'That would not answer. I must do something. I must make myself busy, to keep off morbid thoughts. Besides, in a country parish I should be so painfully reminded of Helstone, and my duties here. I could not bear it, Margaret. And a hundred a year would go a very little way, after the necessary wants of housekeeping are met, towards providing your mother with all the comforts she has been accustomed to, and ought to have. No: we must go to Milton. That is settled. I can always decide better by myself, and not influenced by those whom I love,' said he, as a half apology for having arranged so much before he had told any one of his family of his intentions. 'I cannot stand objections. They make me so undecided.'\n\nMargaret resolved to keep silence. After all, what did it signify where they went, compared to the one terrible change?\n\nMr. Hale continued: 'A few months ago, when my misery of doubt became more than I could bear without speaking, I wrote to Mr. Bell\u2014you remember Mr. Bell, Margaret?'\n\n'No; I never saw him, I think. But I know who he is. Frederick's godfather\u2014your old tutor at Oxford, don't you mean?'\n\n'Yes. He is a Fellow of Plymouth College there. He is a native of Milton-Northern, I believe. At any rate, he has property there, which has very much increased in value since Milton has become such a large manufacturing town. Well, I had reason to suspect\u2014to imagine\u2014I had better say nothing about it, however. But I felt sure of sympathy from Mr. Bell. I don't know that he gave me much strength. He has lived an easy life in his college all his days. But he has been as kind as can be. And it is owing to him we are going to Milton.'\n\n'How?' said Margaret.\n\n'Why he has tenants, and houses, and mills there; so, though he dislikes the place\u2014too bustling for one of his habits\u2014he is obliged to keep up some sort of connection; and he tells me that he hears there is a good opening for a private tutor there.'\n\n'A private tutor!' said Margaret, looking scornful: 'What in the world do manufacturers want with the classics, or literature, or the accomplishments of a gentleman?'\n\n'Oh,' said her father, 'some of them really seem to be fine fellows, conscious of their own deficiencies, which is more than many a man at Oxford is. Some want resolutely to learn, though they have come to man's estate. Some want their children to be better instructed than they themselves have been. At any rate, there is an opening, as I have said, for a private tutor. Mr. Bell has recommended me to a Mr. Thornton, a tenant of his, and a very intelligent man, as far as I can judge from his letters. And in Milton, Margaret, I shall find a busy life, if not a happy one, and people and scenes so different that I shall never be reminded of Helstone.'\n\nThere was the secret motive, as Margaret knew from her own feelings. It would be different. Discordant as it was\u2014with almost a detestation for all she had ever heard of the North of England, the manufacturers, the people, the wild and bleak country\u2014there was this one recommendation\u2014it would be different from Helstone, and could never remind them of that beloved place.\n\n'When do we go?' asked Margaret, after a short silence.\n\n'I do not know exactly. I wanted to talk it over with you. You see, your mother knows nothing about it yet: but I think, in a fortnight;\u2014after my deed of resignation is sent in, I shall have no right to remain.\n\nMargaret was almost stunned.\n\n'In a fortnight!'\n\n'No\u2014no, not exactly to a day. Nothing is fixed,' said her father, with anxious hesitation, as he noticed the filmy sorrow that came over her eyes, and the sudden change in her complexion. But she recovered herself immediately.\n\n'Yes, papa, it had better be fixed soon and decidedly, as you say. Only mamma to know nothing about it! It is that that is the great perplexity.'\n\n'Poor Maria!' replied Mr. Hale, tenderly. 'Poor, poor Maria! Oh, if I were not married\u2014if I were but myself in the world, how easy it would be! As it is\u2014Margaret, I dare not tell her!'\n\n'No,' said Margaret, sadly, 'I will do it. Give me till to-morrow evening to choose my time Oh, papa,' cried she, with sudden passionate entreaty, 'say\u2014tell me it is a night-mare\u2014a horrid dream\u2014not the real waking truth! You cannot mean that you are really going to leave the Church\u2014to give up Helstone\u2014to be for ever separate from me, from mamma\u2014led away by some delusion\u2014some temptation! You do not really mean it!'\n\nMr. Hale sat in rigid stillness while she spoke.\n\nThen he looked her in the face, and said in a slow, hoarse, measured way\u2014'I do mean it, Margaret. You must not deceive yourself into doubting the reality of my words\u2014my fixed intention and resolve.' He looked at her in the same steady, stony manner, for some moments after he had done speaking. She, too, gazed back with pleading eyes before she would believe that it was irrevocable. Then she arose and went, without another word or look, towards the door. As her fingers were on the handle he called her back. He was standing by the fireplace, shrunk and stooping; but as she came near he drew himself up to his full height, and, placing his hands on her head, he said, solemnly:\n\n'The blessing of God be upon thee, my child!'\n\n'And may He restore you to His Church,' responded she, out of the fulness of her heart. The next moment she feared lest this answer to his blessing might be irreverent, wrong\u2014might hurt him as coming from his daughter, and she threw her arms round his neck. He held her to him for a minute or two. She heard him murmur to himself, 'The martyrs and confessors had even more pain to bear\u2014I will not shrink.'\n\nThey were startled by hearing Mrs. Hale inquiring for her daughter. They started asunder in the full consciousness of all that was before them. Mr. Hale hurriedly said\u2014'Go, Margaret, go. I shall be out all to-morrow. Before night you will have told your mother.'\n\n'Yes,' she replied, and she returned to the drawing-room in a stunned and dizzy state.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

warmer\nUp in the mountains, down by the ocean\nWhere, it don't matter as long as we're going\nSomewhere together, I've got a quarter\nHeads Carolina, tails California\n[Verse 2]\nW\u0435 can load what we own in the back of a U-Haul van\nCouple of mod\u0435rn day Moses' searching for the promised land\nWe can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas\nWe can drive for a day and then we'll take a look at the map\n\n[Chorus]\nHeads Carolina, tails California\nSomewhere greener, somewhere warmer\nUp in the mountains, down by the ocean\nWhere, it don't matter as long as we're going\nSomewhere together, I've got a quarter\nHeads Carolina, tails California\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe're gonna get outta here\nIf we gotta ride a Greyhound bus\nBoy, we're bound to outrun\nThe bad luck that's tailing us\n\n[Chorus]\nHeads Carolina, tails California\nSomewhere greener, somewhere warmer\nUp in the mountains, down by the ocean\nWhere, it don't matter as long as we're going\nSomewhere

Racist Lyrics[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]\nTo the man that waited on me at the Starbucks down on Main\nI hope you understand\nWhen I put on that T-shirt, the only thing I meant to say\nIs I'm a Skynyrd fan\nThe red flag on my chest somehow is\nLike the elephant in the corner of the south\nAnd I just walked him right in the room\nJust a proud rebel son with an ol' can of worms\nLookin' like I got a lot to learn, but from my point of view\n[Chorus: Brad Paisley]\nI'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland\nTryin' to understand what it's like not to be\nI'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done\nAnd it ain't like you and me can re-write history\nOur generation didn't start this nation\nWe're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday\nAnd caught between Southern pride and Southern blame\n\n[Verse 2: Brad Paisley]\nThey called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears\nWe're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years\nI try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin\nBut it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin\n\n[Chorus: Brad Paisley]\n'Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland\nJust like you I'm more than what you see\nI'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done\nAnd it ain't like you and me can re-write history\nOur generation didn't start this nation\nAnd we're still paying for our mistakes\nThat a bunch of folks made long before we came\nAnd caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nDear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood\nWhat the world is really like when you're living in the hood\nJust because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good\nYou should try to get to know me, I really wish you would\nNow my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood\nI wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood\nI want you to get paid but be a slave I never could\nFeel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods\nSo when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good\nI guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book\nI'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air\nBut I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here\nSee Brad Paisley LiveGet tickets as low as $305You might also like[Chorus: Brad Paisley (w/ LL Cool J ad libs)]\nI'm just a white man\n(If you don't judge my durag)\nComin' to you from the southland\n(I won't judge your red flag)\nTryin' to understand what it's like not to be\n(Yeah)\nI'm proud of where I'm from\n(If you don't judge my gold chains)\nBut not everything we've done\n(I'll forget the iron chains)\nIt ain't like you and me can re-write history\n(Can't re-write history baby)\n\n[Outro: Brad Paisley (LL Cool J)]\nOh, Dixieland\n(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')\nI hope you understand what this is all about\n(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee\nBut I've been thinkin' about this lately)\nI'm a son of the new south\n(The past is the past, you feel me)\nAnd I just want to make things right\n(Let bygones be bygones)\nWhere all that's left is southern pride\n(RIP Robert E. Lee\nBut I've gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me\nKnow what I mean?) It's real, it's real\nIt's truth18Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/889528", "artist_names": "We the Kings", "full_title": "Just Keep Breathing by\u00a0We\u00a0the

risk\nYeah\n\n[Chorus 1: Adam Levine]\nYou know that we are still young\nSo don't be dumb\nDon't trust anyone\n'Cause you only live once\n[Verse 1: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy]\nUh, you only live once, that's the motto\nSo take a chill pill, ease off the throttle\nNever go to loud clubs 'cause it's bad for your ears\nYour friends will all be sorry when they can't hear\nAnd stay the hell away from drugs 'cause they not legal\nThen bury all your money in the backyard like a beagle\n'Cause you should never trust a bank, they've been known to fail\nAnd never travel by car or bus, boat or by rail\nAnd don't travel by plane, and don't travel at all\nBuild a bomb shelter basement with titanium walls\nAnd wear titanium suits in case pianos fall on you\nAnd never go to saunas 'cause they're crawlin' with piranhas\nAnd never take the stairs 'cause they're often unsafe\nYou only live once, don't let it go to waste\n\n[Chorus 2: Adam Levine]\nYou know that we are still young\nSo hold off on the fun\nCook your meat till it's done\n'Cause you only live once\n\n[Verse 2: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy]\nYeah, and here's another piece of advice\nStay away from kids, 'cause their hair is filled with mad lice\nThere's no such thing as too much Purell\nThis a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell\nSo don't 1980-force any plugs into sockets\nAlways wear a chastity belt and triple lock it\nThen hire a taster, make him check your food for poison\nAnd if you think your mailman is a spy, then destroy him\nNo blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep\nTwo words about furniture: killing machines\nNow, board your windows up the sun is bad for your health\nAnd always wear a straitjacket so you're safe from yourself\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nUh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'\nInvest in your future, don't dilute your finances\n401K, make sure it's low risk\nThen get some real estate (how much?), 4.2%\nThirty year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal\nAnd if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill\nRenting is for suckers right now\nA dependable savings\nAnd you'll retire with money in your account\nBeast!\n\n[Bridge: All]\nYOLO, say no-no\nIsolate yourself and just roll solo, be careful-o\nYou Oughta Look Out also stands for YOLO\n\n[Chorus 3: Adam Levine]\nYou know that we are still young\nBurn the prints off your thumbs\nThen pull out all your teeth\nSo you can't bite your tongue\n\n[Bridge: All]\nOnly on this earth for a short time, time\nSo don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die\nJust take our advice and hide\nAnd scream YOLO to the sky\n[Outro: Andy]\nYou oughta look out15Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1141616", "artist_names": "Glee Cast",
