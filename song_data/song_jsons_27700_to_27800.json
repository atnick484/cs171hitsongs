yeah)\nBlood and cologne on the fragrance (Mmm, yeah, yeah)\n'Cause if ya deal with me, I know you know what pain is (Oh no)\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo if you're gonna love me\nYou gotta love all of me\nYou gotta love, deeper than that\nNow, if you're gonna leave me\nYou better run far away\nI\u2019d hate for you to leave me attached\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm in love with bad luck\nI\u2019m in love with bad luck\nMove too close, get caught up\nMove too close, get caught up\nI'm in love with bad luck\nI'm in love with bad luck\nMove too close, get caught up\nMove too close, get caught up\nI'm in love with bad luck (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I don't even like to think about it\nOn my own, but still so crowded\nWalls come down and the guards come up\nBut there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded\nHurt feels better when I'm by myself\nNo one really means it when they're wishing you well\nI got no one to call, no one\nAnd people only love you when they're needing your wealth\nDamn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan\nEverybody acting like they give a damn\nWhere is everybody when you need a hand?\nI've been burning rubber on the Michelin\nFlying in the rain like I'm Superman\nI could say I love it, but that just depends\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm in love with bad luck\nI\u2019m in love with bad luck\nMove too close, get caught up\nMove too close,

love all of me\nYou gotta love, deeper than that\nNow, if you're gonna leave me\nYou better run far away\nI\u2019d hate for you to leave me attached\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm in love with bad

buildin'\nSitting on the steps, feeling no feelings\nLast night, it was a cold killin'\nYou gotta keep the devil in his hole, nigga\nBut you know how it go, nigga\nI'm front line every time it's on, nigga\nHunnid proof flow, run and shoot pro\n458 drop, playin' \"Bullet Proof Soul\"\nEvery few shows, I just buy some new gold\nCircle got smaller, everybody can't go\nDowntown, Diamond District, jewelers like, \"Yo\nHussle, holla at me, I got Cubans on the low\"\nFlew to Cancun, smokin' Cubans on the boat\nThen docked at Tulum just to smoke, look\nListening to music at the Mayan Ruins\nTrue devotion on the bluest ocean, cruisin'\nMy cultural influence even rival Lucien\nI'm integrated vertically, y'all niggas blew it\nThey tell me, \"Hussle, dumb it down, you might confuse 'em\"\nThis ain't that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to\nLike the beginning of Mean Streets\nI'm an urban legend, South Central in a certain section\nCan't express how I curved detectives\nGuess it's evidence of a divine presence, blessings\nHeld me down, at times, I seem reckless, F it\nYou got an L, but got an E for effort, stretched him\nDropped him off in the Mojave desert, then left him\nAin't no answer to these trick questions\nMoney Makin' Nip, straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser\nWell known, flick up and jail pose\nSnatch a champagne bottle from Rico's 'til T show\nWhatever, nigga, playin' chess, not checkers, nigga\nThirty-eight special for you clever niggas\nSee, bro, if you ain't live and die by the street code\nBeen through all these motions, up and down like a see-saw\nI can never view you as my equal\nFuck I wanna hear your CD for?\n[Chorus: Stacy Barthe & Arctic Monkeys]\nLike the beginning of Mean Streets\nLike the beginning of Mean Streets\nLike the beginning of Mean Streets\nLike the beginning of Mean Streets\nLike the beginning of Mean Streets\nLike the beginning of Mean Streets\n(We gotta make it)\nLike the beginning of Mean Streets\n\n[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]\nYeah, look\nI'm finna take it there\nThis time around, I'ma make it clear\nSpoke some things into the universe and they appeared\nI say it's worth it, I won't say it's fair\nFind your purpose or you wastin' air\nFuck it, though, y'all niggas scared\nEyes opened, I can see it clear\nThey don't make 'em bar none, they don't make 'em real\nThey don't make it where I'm from, they don't take it here\nThey ain't see in due time, I be makin' mils\nBossed up in this game, I been makin' deals\nGet your lawyer on the phone, we can make it real\nI got checks and balance, I flex dramatic\nOther fifty on my neck, just my reckless habit\nAin't no pussy on my rep, disrespect the savage\nI make one phone call and the rest get handled\nIt's just another front step with candles\nLil' message from the set, \"We accept your challenge\"\nYou might also like[Outro: Stacy Barthe]\nWoah-oh\nWoah-oh\nWoah-oh\nWoah, woah\nWe gotta make it, yeah, we gotta\nWe gotta make it,

get no more cheddar\nI feel like a king and my queen is Coretta\nI been made a livin', I'm never gon\u2019 give in\nI'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'\nI'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that I\u2019m fallin\u2019\nThe world think I'm ballin\u2019 and maybe I am\nBut don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'\nDid not have a plan, don't know who I am\nOr who I\u2019m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright\nBustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night\nTake over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might\nGot 'em all in my sight\nI know that I'm strong, I know that I am\nI know I'm the man\nAnd whether you poor or you filled with financial security\nEveryone deal with they own insecurity\nEven the preacher was born with impurity\nScared to go out even with my security\nScared of the world and all of its obscurity\nPray for maturity, hope that I grow\nHope my anxiety stay on the low\nI swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow\nWhere do I go? What would you do\nIf suddenly all of your dreams came true?\nWhat would you do if you did it all?\nIf you ain't never have to lift a finger\nWould you linger like, \"Fuck 'em all\"?\nGuess that's your call, but I can't\nThis a marathon, not a sprint\nSwitch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint\nCan you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?\n[Chorus]\nWhat's your name? What's your game?\nCome now, boy, just spit your flow\nFeel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?\nNovocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'\nIn my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know\nWhat's your name? What's your game?\nCome now, boy, just spit your flow\nFeel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?\nNovocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'\nIn my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know\n\n[Interlude]\nHow I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)\nBreak it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)\nHow I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)\nDown, roll it up, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nSearchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits\nOnly led me to battle depression\nI done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain\nWhat if your life was under a glass?\nAnd people tried to dig up shit from your past\nAnd tell you what's good and what's not\nAnd every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot\nAnd don't give a damn that it came from the heart\nThey tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers\nThis here for the people that know what I'm sayin'\nAll of the people that know what I'm sayin'\nFuck social media\nTellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap\nThey always compare, they always compare me to others\nAnd try to hit me up against all my brothers\nNow, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?\n(Overdosin' at the crib)\n'Cause people just won't let 'em live\nAnd the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em\nBut nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside\nAnd they wonder why we all hide, shit\nMaybe I'm just overthinkin'\nOr maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'\nAnd when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate\nSit in the corner and think of a better day\nMaybe this bullet can help me to get away\nI just cannot seem to think of a better way\nEven though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'\nThat's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'\nEven when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag\nI'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least\nI ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)\n'Cause \"you'll never be Kenny\"\n\"You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole\"\n\"You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old,\" yeah\nThese are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now\nThat make me depressed and they pullin' me down\nI'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown\nSo I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound\nAnd play it when nobody else is around\nWhenever I feel like I'm far from the ground\nGod, give me the power to battle depression\nYeah, round after round\nI wish I was famous, I wish I was rich\nI wish I could just get up out of this bitch\nBut be careful what you wish for\n'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be\nMy life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be\n'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division\nAin't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am\nDo what you love and do not give a damn\nFuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram\nJust mind your own business and be a good man\nBe a good boss and be a good friend\nSpread your imagination to the millions\nDon't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions\nJust spread that positivity for the children\nAnd all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em\n'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em\nKnow somebody feel 'em\nLast but not least, put your ego on the shelf\nAnd remember, love yourself\nNah, nah, nah\nPut your ego on the shelf and love yourself\nNah, nah, nah\nPut your ego on the shelf\nAnd remember, love your\u2014'member, love yourself\nYou might also like[Outro]\nNah, nah, nah\nPut your ego on the shelf

rent (Survive)\nI was so broke that I could cry, I was sick (Broke)\nBorn in the wild, so many trials, I ain't quit\nAll the people I robbed, I brought 'em down, I repent (Down)\nDirtied the money, I let it drown, watch it cleanse (Cleanse)\nSellin' these pounds, a hundred times I jumped the fence (12)\nBreakin' it down, I made a pound turn to ten (Ten)\nThem hunnids ain't found, they in the ground, don't get spent\nThey in the ground\nWay back in the time, black and brown, you get lynched\nBlack and brown\nWe was talkin' him down, he make a frown if he flinch\nGun him down\nSee the pain in my eyes, I hold it down 'cause I'm rich\nHold it down\n[Verse 1]\nLivin' in the street, concrete, get rough (Street)\nNiggas tryna creep, we eat, gun bust (Creep)\nThink about my history, back of the bus (Who)\nFought for the rights, but we still killed us (Who)\nTryin' not to be political, it was ridiculed (Real)\n'Member I was in the middle school, with a fit or two ('Member)\nMama had the boy by herself, it was critical (Mama)\nStarted with the weed, then codeine, then a pill or two (Codeine)\nHit one lick, then I hit two (Lick)\nKickin' down the door, then I ran through (Woo)\nSticks in the van, this ain't bamboo (Sticks)\nI got rich bought some land for my kids too (Whew)\nTake the risks for my fam, for some damn food (Risks)\nTake my bitch out to France, out to Canc\u00fan (France)\nMy wrist like a dam, you can splash, pool (Splash)\nMoney root of all evil, but the cash rule\n\n[Chorus]\n(Hey) I took a couple of my dawgs on a lick\nDo or die, gotta survive, pay the rent

so cold, need a whole sweater (Cold)\nI was kickin' in the back of doors but I know better (Hey)\nYou expose what you know, then you go get it (Hey)\nSow what you reap (Sow) , sleepin' on my feet\nTrust fund for my daughter, son, daddy plant a seed\nNo bond when you do a crime, slavery repeat (Slave)\nSlick minded, they think we runnin' a treasury (Who)\nLost my homie, it keep on hauntin' me in my sleep\nLost my grandmama, whole family incomplete\nStabbed in my back a million times, this shit deep\nI was hittin' licks doin' crime for my seed\nBroke now I got 25 cars, it's a fleet\nTake notes, make a bando turn Ferrari, I can teach\nStruggled with the pain, but I still turned out a beast\nI got out the chains, now the world belong to me (Hey)\n\n[Chorus]\n(Hey) I took a couple of my

Lyrics[Intro]\nI will never stop, never stop\nKeep goin', keep goin'\nOh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah\n\n[Verse]\nI make Yeezy Boost moves in my Reeboks\nIt ain't gon' never stop\nTryna run a billion up until my ankle pop, yeah\nYou'll get rich and have problems that you never thought\nIt bring tears knowin' we came up out the sandbox\n(Bringin' tears to my eyes)\nMade it out the trenches, it got harder for my niggas\nI just wanna see my dawgs ball, seven figures\nI done got rich and it cursed me\nEver since I got successful, they envy\nTryna shake the devil, on promethazine\nTryna show you love but you don't feel me\nGave up on me so you turned your back\nI can see the demons 'cause a nigga been blessed\nI can tell you worried, but a nigga been in debt\nI can't get caught up inside the matter\nI should've did better, but it's chatter\nI ran up my money off the gravel\nLove is just a word, it don't matter to me\nI got so rich, nothing matters to me\nI'm livin' my second life, it's so amazin'\nI done been hit with a bullet, and one grazed me\nI done been considered a failure, it don't faze me\nI done came up out the ghetto, my crib gated\nSame niggas played with the devil, these niggas hatin'\nAll these bitches fuck with no rubbers, this shit brazy\nIcy-ed out the Hublot, these niggas lookin' fugazi (Yeah)\nMoney stack tall past the ceilin', I can't be jaded\nI done came from sleepin' on floors, you can't persuade me (Yeah)\nI been takin' other niggas' hoes, it's gettin' outrageous (True story)\nRich nigga gettin' caught with a bitch worth minimum wages (Pluto)\nFuckin' with my ego, but I never lost a lady (Facts)\nFucked a pop star after I got my dreads braided\nNever dropped her name but her head game contagious (No cap)\nTwenty percent of my dames, I shipped 'em right out to Vegas (Gone)\nYou can feel the pain when I'm rappin' 'cause I'm ragin' (Wizard)\nYou can see my past and where I was on they faces (Weak)\nI done flipped the truck over and crashed, ducked the agents (Facts)\nI been with these blue hundreds like a nigga racist (Freebandz)\nI been gettin' richer each year, feel like I'm racin' (Gone)\nTried to tell you the formula but you wouldn't take it\nHard work and perseverance, they ain't related (Ain't related)\nPoppin' up on Forbes is fuckin' up my relations (Fuckin' up my family)\nTen milli' plus on a crib and it's vacant (Woo)\nI can see it vividly at the crib, Rico basement  (Woo)\nWatch him get the mula, I was sittin' back bein' patient (I was bein' patient)\nI was sittin' back, programmin' my brain, I was in trainin' (Yeah)\nI be in my coupe, Maybach, and I ain't have to trade it (Skrrt-skrrt)\nThinkin' 'bout when I was posted up when they raided (Swear I was)\nNow I Double R and Ghost it up, I feel spacious (Woo)\nI don't feel the safest, but I feel gracious (Yeah)\nI thank God every day, I don't feel basic\nProbably lose my sanity if I ain't have my babies (Sheesh)\nProbably be gamblin' with my life if I ain't made it\nHome invasions, and you ain't have to persuade me (Nah)\nCut it with a razor and serve it 'til your day\nCame from whippin' out the bowl, Tom Ford suit and tie (Yeah)\nGet my grandma to serve my dope, that ain't a lie (On God)\nYou can tell I've been broke when you look into my eyes (Future)\nNobody done noticed 'til the jet was in the sky\n[Outro]\n(Soaring, soaring)\nBringin' tears to my eyes (Oh yeah)\nNobody done noticed 'til the jet was in the sky\nBringin' tears to my eyes (Keep goin')\nGotta tell The WIZRD, it's a story like a book\nTears in my eyes\nI can't forget where I came from\nI lost a lover, it's alright\nIt can't be worse when I lost my main homie to the streets\nYou should've never give up on me without hearin' my side of the story\n(The WIZRD)\nI can't forget where I came from\nFreebandz\nBringin' tears to my eyesYou might also like18Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/4230713", "artist_names": "Future", "full_title":

much rocks and shit\nEven though I be out here schemin' like a demon semen\nI know I'm God-sent\nThis gotta be God\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm God-sent, like He sent me up so I can relay these messages\nLike He use me as his vessel, like He use me as an instrument\nTryna locked me in a box, they hate how God just keep on blessin' me\nThey locked me in a box, I pray to God this ain't my destiny\nI don't drink no lean, I\u2019m sippin\u2019 on holy water like this my medicine\nI'm a livin\u2019 testimony, every album like a testament\nEverything I went through made me who I am 'cause he be testin' me\nSo I'm breakin\u2019 bread with all my fam 'cause I don't take no ecstasy\nI done sacrificed my niggas 'cause none of my niggas see the best in me\nThey want me slingin' metal like the Devil, but I'm Heaven-sent\nMy brother, my mother them addicts fuck my daddy 'cause he neglected me\nI'm 20 years old, but I act like I been here before, like I'm a veteran\nHe speak this shit through me like I'm a prophet, but I'm a reverend\nPut my blood, sweat and tears in all these lyrics 'cause this my Exodus\nI'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it\nI'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it\n[Chorus]\nAyy, blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh\nStuck in these streets, feel like my life froze\nI've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated\nI've been livin' so crazy,

world tryna be me\nMiss my niggas, hope they see me on the TV\nI'm on Instagram showin' off my VV's\nYou won't understand that this wasn't easy\nI been walkin' 'round with my head peezy\nShot a nigga, took a shower with the bleach, Yahweh\nMama, I fell victim to the streets, I'm sorry\nI'm in middle school; sellin' weed in the hallway\nI was skippin' school, got in beef, started robbin'\nJackboy,

Kanye West & Travis Barker (Traducci\u00f3n al Espa\u00f1ol)\"]\n\n[Verso: Kanye West]\nTanto odio en la cima\nEs un lugar solitario\nCuando te das cuenta de que los polic\u00edas no son las \u00fanicas serpientes\nY la persona que est\u00e1 contigo s\u00f3lo sabe lo que no borras\nEl mundo s\u00f3lo te conoce por tus grandes errores\nAs\u00ed que \u00a1spas! en sus culos, no hay otra manera\nDale fuerte, humo, ey\nCh\u00f3cate y regresa con la cara destrozada\nY cuando termine mi camino, X aguanta la puerta\nModifican las mierdas, no negociamos\nSi est\u00e1 hecho por tu puta, no negociamos\nApar\u00e9cete en tu cumplea\u00f1os si me debes tarta\nCon una m\u00e1scara negra, as\u00ed es c\u00f3mo lo contamos\nAs\u00ed que perd\u00f3n por mis acciones, mi coraz\u00f3n est\u00e1 de por medio\nSigo mis pensamientos, no hay sentido en \"Ye\"\nDijo \"Eso es todo lo que tengo que decir\", si lo encuentran en el caso\nEntonces lo env\u00edan a la c\u00e1rcel, como un perro a la jaula\nNi siquiera me siento de esta edad, no me pudro\nTus lameculos est\u00e1n cagados, t\u00fa los llamas de lejos\nPorque los ata\u00fades se ponen debajo de una l\u00e1pida\nPorque incluso cuando mueras, ellos seguir\u00e1n tir\u00e1ndole piedras a tu tumba\nAs\u00ed que sigue la ola, no puedes tragarte el odio\nMi mente est\u00e1 por encima de cualquier cosa que un erudito pueda decir\nNo sabemos c\u00f3mo comportarnos, salimos de las raves\nSi te disclocas un brazo, simplemente c\u00f3localo en su lugar\nPorque los condenados no pueden\nTodo el dolor y la angustia\nMe volvieron un hombre\nAs\u00ed que no me quejo\nAhora esto est\u00e1 cambiando\nNo m\u00e1s est\u00fapidos por ah\u00ed\nNo m\u00e1s fama en famosos\nNo hay que avergonzarse de avergonzar\nTe quiere dar su galletita Famous Amos, bobo\nElla te dio su vagina, pero t\u00fa ni pagaste por el ano\nAhora tu nombre est\u00e1 corrompido por las afirmaciones que le causan dolor\nEl acusado es culpable, nadie culpa al demandante\nTengo que decirlo en los t\u00e9rminos de Layman, mientras espera en las comparecencias\nPorque si el jurado dice que lo hiciste, las consecuencias ser\u00e1n caras\nDame un minuto, mi se\u00f1ora se acaba de desmayar\nMis beb\u00e9s est\u00e1n llorando, \u00bfentiendes lo que quiero decir?\n[Estribillo: XXXTENTACION]\nUn minuto, un minuto que se va\nUn minuto, y el siguiente es m\u00edo\nUn minuto, un minuto que se va\nUn minuto, y el siguiente es m\u00edo\nUn minuto, un minuto que se va\nUn minuto, y el siguiente es m\u00edo\nUn minuto, un minuto que se

kissing me, I\u2014\nI was lost\n\n[Verse 1]\nSo I took a different path\nIn the distance he awaited me\nHad no weapon, I'm guessin' his hands were just enough for me\nWas no question, I'm guessin' he laughed just at the sight of me\nI was lost\n[Chorus]\nI remember I had walked home that day\nContent with all my misery\nTold myself it'd get better, no clue what there was next for me\nRemember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance\nI was dressed for winter weather\nBut the summer rays were kissing me, I\u2014\nI was lost\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd there he was, his presence was alarming\nAs he approached, was casual, we talked 'bout self-harming\nHe told me, \"Kid, you shouldn't be walkin' on your own\"\nHe smiled and laughed, and pat my back\nHe asked, \"How far are you from home?\"\nI said, \"Maybe 30 minutes\"\nHis frequency distorted quick, I seen it in his image\nI should've run right fucking there, a\u2014\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou ever woke up on a train track, with no motherfuckin' clothes on?\nDeath before your eyes, you prayin' to God, but ain't no response\nTryna scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on\nBut ain't nobody comin', so you scream on and scream on and scream on\nWhile this evil fuck laugh at you\nTrain getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you\nTears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule\nCould've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?\nYou finna die here on this train track\n'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back\nThinking 'bout your previous memories, going way back\nAll them fucking dreams 'bout a diamond chain and a Maybach\nNow your time finally up\nAsk yourself this final question, is you going down or up?\nRecollectin' all the moments that you never gave a fuck\nNow it's here, death has now arrived, time's finally upYou might also like136Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/4135257",

Lyrics[Sample]\nUsed to be a dreamer\nDreamin' of a fire\n\n[Verse 1]\nUh, my mama used to pray that she'd see me in Yale\nIt's fucked up she gotta see me in jail\nOn the visit with Lil Papi, it hurt even though I seemed to be well\nThey got a smoker with a key to my cell, damn\nAnd even worst, my judge black don't wanna see me do well\nIt's either that or black people for sale\nGave me two to four years like, \"Fuck your life, meet me in hell\"\nAnd let it burn like Lucifer, you look even stupider\nTryna impress them people in power when power abusin' us\nFor 44 dollars a hour, you coward they using ya\nIs it self-hate that made you send me upstate?\nThis where the so-called \"real niggas\" sweeping up for cupcakes\nAnd that's your phone time, if you ain't got no money, you ain't online\nHey call your son, call your daughter just to wish them more prime\nOh God, don't let them streets get a hold of 'em\nYour daughter fuckin' now, it's gon be a cold summer\nYour son trapping, and your homie giving O's to him\nAnd if he fuck that paper up, he puttin' holes through him\nAnd you just wanna make it home, so you can show it to him\nAnd them people ain't finna give no parole to ya\nThey want blood, we all hangin' with a noose on our neck\nMy celly mom just died, he wanna use my collect\nAnd he won't make it to the wake unless he give 'em a check\nWe still niggas though, what you expect?\n[Chorus]\nI just won\nI was on the corner with the reefa\nAnd they got us warring for our freedom\nSee my brother blood on the pavement\nHow you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?\nUhh, trauma\nWhen them drugs got a hold of your mama\nAnd the judge got a hold on your father\nGo to school, bullet holes in the locker\n\n[Verse 2]\nAin't no PTSDs, them drugs keep it at ease\nThey shot that boy 20 times when they could've told him just freeze\nCould've put him in a cop car, but they let him just bleed\nThe ambulance, they coming baby, just breathe\nThat's what the old lady said when she screamed\nThis nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th\nAnd in the 13th amendment, it don't say that we kings\nThey say that we legally slaves if we go to the bing\nThey told Kaep' stand up if you wanna play for a team\nAnd all his teammates ain't saying a thing (Stay woke)\nIf you don't stand for nothing, you gon' fall for something\nAnd in the 60's, if you kneeled, you'd prolly be killed\nBut they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal\nKill your account, look where money get spilled\nCheck it, and they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal\nKill your account, look where money get spilled\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI just won\nI was on the corner with the reefa\nAnd they got us warring for our freedom\nSee my brother blood on the

locker\n\n[Verse 3]\nHow many times you send me to jail to know that I won't fail\nInvisible shackles on the king, 'cause shit, I'm on bail\nI went from selling out arenas, now shit, I'm on sale\nThem cold nights starting to feel like hell, uhh\nWatching a black woman take my freedom\nAlmost made me hate my people\nWhen they label you felon, it's like they telling you they not equal\n11 years going to court knowing they might keep you or drive you crazy\n23 hours in a cell, somebody save me\nI'm on a jail call, trying to explain it to my baby\nI gotta do the calendar twice, and that's a maybe\nTrauma\n\n[Chorus]\nI just won\nI was on the corner with the reefa\nAnd they got us warring for our freedom\nSee my brother blood on the pavement\nHow you wake up in the mornin' feelin'

doin' no coke\nI used to wish that my daddy was livin'\nI had a dream that I seen him as ghost\nI used to act up when I went to school\nThought it was cool, but I really was hurt\nWanted my family to come to my games\nMy mama couldn't make it 'cause she was at work\nLived with my grandma, she took me to church\nReally no I ain't wanna go\nRemember I kissed my aunt in the casket\nAnd her forehead was cold\nI was like 4 years old\nWe couldn\u2019t afford no clothes\nIt was hand me down\nWho would think a nigga get a Grammy now?\nGot a black judge tryna tear me down\nAll this jail time probably wear me down\nTurn the lights off in the bathroom\nScreaming, \"Bloody, Bloody, Bloody Mary\" now\nHavin\u2019 nightmares about Candyman\nWith the tool on me like a handyman\nKilled my lil' cousin, I\u2019m like, \"Damn it, man\"\nHad to see the footage on a camera, man\nOn the pavement, with his brains out\nWith the white sheet, he was laid out\nWanna ask 'Ye, \"Is this a choice?\"\nIt was like this when I came out\nWhat the fuck is you really complaining 'bout?\nI know niggas that's never gon\u2019 make it out\nThis that shit you won't see in the media\nPoor get poorer and the rich gettin' greedier\nLot of daddies goin' back and forth out of jail\nLot of sons growin' up and repeating them\nThis the belly of the beast, you won't make it out\nMan, this shit was designed just to eat us up\nAnd my momma told, \"Nigga, keep it up\nYou gon' end up in prison, just sweepin' up\"\nRemember, nobody never believed in us\nWhen they see us now, they can't believe it's us, no\n[Interlude]\nI think it's funny how\nWe used to go to school, play SEGA's\nAnd then, next thing you know, you runnin' 'round with Glock .40s\nWe ain't never believed in the police, they was shootin' us\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, they called it the projects, they put us in projects\nWhat they gon' do with us? Can't call the cops yet\nYou might just get popped at\n'Cause they the ones shootin' us\nI'm on my mom's steps, it's like a bomb threat\nThe violence pursuing us, I ain't meet God yet\n'Cause I'm on the block where\nIt's just me and Lucifer, look what they do to us\nThey know we in poverty\nWhen I went to court, the judge said, \"Meek, you a menace to society\"\nHuh, you said, you would give me a chance, your honor, why would you lie to me?\n16 more years of probation, you know you gon' get some more time on me, huh\nWhole hood goin' crazy, babies havin' babies\nShe was fourteen, actin' like she eighty\nGot pregnant by a nigga that was locked up in them cages\nAnd the story goes on, if you make it, you amazing (Word up)\n\n[Outro]\nSee, I got homie that's a billionaire\nAnd I be tryin' to explain it to him like\nIf your mom ain't on crack or if she got a job and she doing eight hours a day\nAnd your daddy in the graveyard or in the jail cell, who the fuck gon' babysit?You might also

Bentleys, we mob through the A\nBenjis on Benjis, we stack every day\nBusiness is business, so you gotta pay\nNew Lamborghinis make me wanna race\nStill eat fettuccine I'm stuck in my ways\nMy bed Tempur-Pedic, I fuckin' get paid\nMy flow a disease, kill these rappers like AIDS\nYves St. Laurent on the lens of my shades\nGunna back up, I was goin' through a phase\nI doubled up and got my bitches straight\nYou learned how to drip from you watchin' my page\nNiggas be tossin', somebody decay\nOff-White'd the coupe and the inside is beige\nI pop this shit like I've been doin' for ages\nSo many dead faces I got me a grave\nYSL, nigga say \"Slatt\" every day\nI pop me a pill, one got stuck in my throat\nThis Rollie a Presi', I don't need to vote\nYour ho super ready, she at my condo\nI stay with that 9, they should call me Marlo\nI'm the greatest of all, my emoji is goat\nBouncin' my life, got my back off the rope\nToo real I can't turn my back on the bros\n\n[Chorus: Gunna]\nI tote

to spend it\nYou dropped the ball I got it, we winnin'\nSpaceship for a car that ain't rented\nThey know who I am, I ain't walkin' through Lenox\nIt didn't take long, I ran up them racks\nBought it, ain't like it, ain't takin it back\nI shoulda playin' linebacker, I want a sack\nI got this cheetah print all on my jacket\nI got the belt and the shoes to match it\nI'm from the hood, I'm keepin' my ratchet\nMy bitch the baddest, she ain't bougie, she ratchet\nI get him flipped, then I buy him a casket\nI'm servin' real, I ain't just singin', rappin'\nI got on Soldier Re's, they're classics\nI got a 31 doin' gymnastics\nI sold a brick, it was still in the package\nSixty five hundred was spent on this coat\n(Got a bitch in the condo, she snortin' the coke)\nI don't wanna fuck her just want the throat\nI'm savin' my money, I ain't goin' broke\nDon't want no handouts, that shit ain't no joke\nThey listen up when I speak, I'm the pope\nI'm bringin' cash, ain't payin' no notes\nI got the stick just in case they want smoke\n[Chorus: Gunna]\nI tote a TEC 'cause niggas be shady\nAnd a surfboard 'cause we're really wavy (Surfboard)\nI need some love to go with this hate\nGive mama a hug,
