king\nAnd my bitch a queen\nLife a Livin' dream\nBouta' catch a body on a record if you disagree\nDisbelief, that's the look they give me when I rip the beat\n\nI don't take a shot\nI make it hit then hit em' with defeat\nStripes though\nStripes\n\n[Chorus; Bingx]\nMake it hit, it's somethin' light though\nLight\nY'all couldn't see me with my eyes closed\nRight?\nYou say some shit you ain't the type though\nRight?\n\n[Verse 2; Bingx]\nYou lie low\nAll these pussies being passive\nI don't play that shit\nIf you got somethin' to say\nThen you should say that shit\nTryna say i'm in my feelings when I state how I'm feelin'\nThat's just communication\nBut they can't take that shit\nYou might also likeI don't think it's dope to fuck 100 bitches and cheat\nI don't idolize drugs, pussy gimmicks

be\nI'm who they can't be\nIf Drake rapped one of my records, that shit would get a Grammy\nIt makes some men outta boys who think about lookin' fancy\nThey on the Gram\nFlexin' money in they

the ??? and chillin\nWhile they still up in the club, tryna floss for women\nAin't no wonder that you barely meet your cost for livin'\nBut you stay middle class from your poor decisions\n\nLook\nGotta watch and take notes on how to best maneuver\nSurround yourself with more bosses homie, less consumer\nSpreadin' love along with knowledge, y'all are spreadin' rumors\nBut still i'm laughin to the bank, I got a sense of humor\n\nAs for the people who been tryna call me white trash\nGet off of Twitter, maybe brush up on your fine ass\nIf i'm bein honest, I don't really need advice fam\nYoung god, bout to make a milly from my mic stand\n\nI'm on a roll to 7 digits at least\nTill then I spread wealth, I got limitless reach\nI get when money when I preach\nCall them figures of speech\nKnow my income passed if I get rich when I sleep\n\nDamn\nYou had it all, it's a shame that you lost it\nPeaked back in high school, no wonder you're nostalgic\nLife's still trash and complainin' won't solve it\nTellin' me I've changed\nYeah bitch, I'm evolvin'\n\nTell em' I want all of it and then I need it multiplied\nMoney kinda soundin' like I spittin rhymes in double

throw em across the room, he a paper plane\nI figured it out, you just do them \"Showtime's\" to get better love\nTrying to be battle rap's Magic Johnson, hope you got better blood\nBut if you did get that Showtime from Magic it would be better cause\nThe fans say he ain't sick no more, but some theories say he never was\nI know Johnson, but he the one going to hell Aye\nLike Kareem I post off his block and you got mail Aye\nAnd it's a 42 but you ain't worthy of these shells Aye\nSo you ain't gotta be a former Laker to retire with an L, A (Aye)\nAnd well Aye, you getting old Verb\nLook around, the kids that used to look up to you are now looking down\nI see your wheelchair coming soon, don't choke up now\nYou been bullied all your life, you should be used to getting pushed around\nSo get them patent leather waves out my sight\nOr get followed and shot like it's the day in the life\nSo please don't say the John if you ain't saying it twice\nAnd if you don't add Da Don, you ain't saying it right\n\n[Round 3: Aye Verb]\nOkay Johnny, this the part of the night where you get grounded\nYou was looking for that top tier smoke... and you found it\nRight now your head's about to get mounted\nLeave your corpse with them cause it's the 'end of the road\nThis the 3rd round and you can never compare Boyz II Men\nI came in this game, made noise, woke niggas up early, I am a rooster\nYou steal shit and then try to flip it nigga, you are a booster That's a cheap way to get around, your style is Uber\nI'm a nightmare, I see red and black\nMy right hand sharp, nigga my style is Kruger\nI murdered Daylyt last weekend I'm back stabbing my friend\nCaesar, Brutus, backstabbing my friend\nSee you can't do that, see it's a reason why the crowd don't get you\nCause this stage is

me coach you\nYou wanna keep going down this road?\nYou need change and lil nigga I'm the toll booth\nI told you get out of this game, this ain't for you\nCause what's the point in being Alumni if you Alumni Aluminum Foil?\nYeah your aura cool but I knew you would die, I'm the Oracle Be humble, cause 3 years ago I was the nigga you brought water too\nIt's 1 or 2, do you rap for the money?\nNah it can't be for the money\nCause what you get paid like is straight light\nJohn I get bread out this shit\nNigga my kids don't even know what Ramen Noodles taste like\nThis a underwater cage fight, you the guppy, I'm the great white\nWith that switchblade I'm Blade like\nThat Butterfly you had in yo stomach, that wasn't stage fright\nYo lines go in a circle, they going nowhere, first thing I think a maze, mice\nAnd the shit so simple, nigga that shit don't even amaze mice\nI had dreams of going to college, flirting with girls in each class\nInstead I got this nightmare of this dope fiend named Veronica She was a TLC fan\nI used to watch her get served\nShe'll hit that cheap glass and start singing Waterfalls\nNodding off doing that \"so I Creep\" dance\nI terrorize these timid guys\nCollege

if you will the picture\nOf you and I engaged in a kiss\nYou don't have to be beautiful to turn me on\nIf we can not make babies\nMaybe we can make some time\n(Baby, you're so creamy)\n\nShe said how'd you like to waste some time\nAnd I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind\nNikki, oh\nDon't worry, I won't hurt you\nI only want you to have some fun\nBaby, baby, baby I'm a star (Star, ooh)\nMight not know it now\nBaby, but I are, I'm a star, eh (Star, ooh)\nI don't wanna stop 'til I reach the top, oh\nOw!\n\nIf I gave you diamonds and pearls\nWould you be a happy boy or a girl?\nAll I can do is just offer you my love\nAll I can offer you is my love\n\nI never meant to cause you any sorrow\nI never meant to cause you any pain\nI only wanted one time to see you laughing\nOnly want to see you laughing in the purple rain\n\nDearly beloved\nWe are gathered here today to get through this thing called life\n\nSexy dancer, I want your body, want your body\nSexy

let me drive you to work?\n\nI was working part time in a five and dime\nMy boss was Mr. McGee\nHe told me several times that he didn't like my kind\n'Cause I's a bit too leisurely\nIt seems that I was busy doin' something close to nothin'\nBut different than the day before\nThat's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her\nShe walked in through the out door, out door\n\nShe wore a raspberry beret\nThe kind you find in a second hand store\nRaspberry beret\nAnd if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more\nRaspberry beret\nI think I love her\n\nGuess I shoulda known by the way you parked your car sideways\nThat it wouldn't last\nSee, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once\nLove 'em and leave 'em fast\nGuess I must be dumb, she had a pocket full of horses\nTrojan and some of them used\nBut it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right\nAnd you say - \"What have I got to lose?\"\nAnd honey, I said little red Corvette\n\nThis is it\nTime for you to go to the wire\nYou will hit\n'Cause you got the burnin' desire\nThe kinda girl you wanna teach\nShe's a peach\n\n(Go!)\n(Oops, upside yo ass)\n(Oops, upside yo ass)\n(Oops, upside yo ass)\n(Oops, upside yo

don't stop\n(C'mon, throw ya hands in the air, in the air)\nBrand Nubian'll rock the sure shot\n(In the air, in the air)\n\n[Verse 1: Lord Jamar]\nWell, let me get a piece of the track, peace to the black\nPeeps on the streets with the beats in the Jeeps, comin' back\nIn '94 with the raw that's against the law\nIt's the G-O-D, my delivery is C-O-D\nWord is bond and bond is life, we got it goin' on tonight\nDon't nobody wanna fight, they wanna see a tight show\nWhere some brothers might go for broke\nUtilizin' the effects of the smoke\n[Verse 2: Sadat X]\nI pull cash to smash, make the blunt last\nFill it with hash, too and pass, don't even ask\nIn a flash, put that ass in the grass\nFlag is half-mast, somebody must've passed\nWe're makin' your ass drip into the stands\nFold my cash at last, my task to teach the class\nAnd receive somethin' more than brass and some glass\nMake a brother work hard, long and fast\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]\nDreadlock, I said I rock for my block\nClock wax like crack, samplin' from old stacks\nThat's where the soul's at in this whole rap universe\nWe kick the funky tunes with a verse\nSun, moon and star, some boom for Jamar\nTo get me in the flow, now I'm read' to go\nSet to show everybody in the party that we nice\nWithout sippin' on Bacardi and ice\n\n[Verse 4: Sadat X]\nThis style flash, Jamar'll be the shinin' star\nNo matter who you are, no matter who you are\nI'll rape the tape, travel on the interstate\nWith weight, wipe the slate and mob the gate\nAnd by fate, I'll avoid the court date, no legal aid\nEverythin' is paid, why cause a tirade?\nIf the money ain't made, talkin' millions\nBut spendin' pennies and gettin' cheap shoes from Kenny's\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Lord Jamar]\nNow, let's take time out to say peace to the Gods (Peace!)\nBust how I release 'cause this beat is hard\nWe be the squad Farad taught to rule\nTake a thought to the top, now I drop the jewel\n\n[Verse 5: Sadat X]\nI push the Cadillac Seville and still be real\nI drive a garbage truck and not give a ...\nI need to earn a buck fo' the year\nI'm through with buyin' wild gear\nJust somethin' I can wear, somethin' fly when I appear\n\n[Verse 6: Lord Jamar]\nWell, now we're here to take the gold and the cash for the bill fold\nI told their ass to chill and they still cold\nFrozen 'cause they not amongst the chosen one\nSun shines like a beacon, similar to how I'm speakin'\n\n[Verse 7: Sadat X]\nAs I receive the mic for the last time, I clear up your past crime\nAll felonies can go, as long as you know\nBrand Nubian will stand without the use of a band\nWe always work with a plan\n[Hook x2]3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1699703", "artist_names": "The Jesus and Mary Chain (Ft.

gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe\n\n[Verse 1]\nBust it, check it, watch how I wreck it\nNiggas watch your back, shit is gettin hectic\nI catch vibes like Count Basie, sucker won't face me\nI'm so much flavor you can taste me\nI'm underground like a gutter\nYou never catch me stutter, everybody knows that I'm butter\nI'm not the man with sensitivity\nThe name is Fat Joe, the label's Relativity, huh\nI chop a rapper like a meat cleaver\nI'm burnin' hot, people think I have a fever, check it\nIf niggas wanna front, then come with it\nIf you're havin second thoughts, well then forget it, see\nI dig in my crates, I don't perpatrates\nI got shit sewn, like Billy Bathgate\nBeware like Koco, yo I'm not a slow boat\nGot so much dough I vacate in Acapulco\nCrazy as they come I'm not the one\nWe can do this with the hands, or take it to the guns\nYou know I can flow, the name is Fat Joe\nI can flow, I can flow, I can flow\n[Hook]\nYou gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe\nYou gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe\nYou gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe\nYou gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe\n\n[Verse 2]\nEverybody knows Fat Joe's in town\nNuff respect for the Boogie Down\nI'm livin in the Bronx on an ave called Trinity\nMy name rings bells within the vicinity\nPeace to the money makers always plottin' mono\nTogether we gettin' dough, just like Lucky Luciano\nPeople always tell me, yo, you're dope Joe\nBut I'm not a car, so I don't get gassed like Amoco\nNever ate the paint, no I'm not a sucker\nNever liked ball, so to Hell with the Rucker\nAlways on my own, never sweatin' nobody\nWarm up a crowd like a bottle of Bacardi\nI can kick it this way, I can kick it that away\nI kick a funky style, from New York to Piscataway\nSuckers best scram\nNow in ninety-three, it's all about the Fat Man\nPeace to Finesse, Showbiz and A.G\nGizmo, Little Hec', and Kool Mike-ski (say what?)\nMy crew from Uptown\nAnd if you mess around, then you'll catch a beat down\nSee, I got this in a smash\nIf a rapper steps up, he'll get smoked like a blunt full of hash\nMy style of rap is legendary\nFuck with the man, then you'll end up in the cemetery\nAnd that's word to Ma Duke\nI never fake moves, I'll go out like a troop\nSo act like you know, the name is Fat Joe\nI can flow, I can flow, I can flow\nYou might also like[Hook]\nYou gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow,

test\nTroop it gets so bad, I make you wanna wear a vest\nCause I'm too hot to handle\nKnockin' niggas out like Livingstone Bramble\nRappers come heavy, but yo I weigh a ton\nI won't lose weight 'cause I'm not on the run\nI'm on point like a sniper, hyper than the hyper\nOn the DL, overlooked by C-Cipher\nNever get caught, I'm on top with my game\nFlip a fat ride, there's no need for a train\nRappers come close, but they just can't make it\nWhen it comes to the funk, you know I won't fake it\nPeace to Serge, and my right hand Flex\nAnd when I grab the mic nobody wants to rock next\nThe name is Fat Joe, cause Joe is livin' Fat\nNiggas gettin' jealous cause I got a contract\nBut I don't sweat it, I know the style is raw\nYou can't compare me to a cornball\nAnd you know I kick game like a hottie\nNow in ninety-three, they should free John Gotti\nIf you step, battle and I'm gonna mash your toes\nYou know I got the flow\n[Hook]\nYou gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe\nYou gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe\nYou gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe\nYou gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe\nYou gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe\nYou gotta,

arms\n\nCount the bad, count the good\nAnd all I wouldn't change even if I could\nI used to stumble back when I was young\nAnd I'm still stumbling but now it's a lot more fun\nAnd I'm falling, I'm falling, I flew too close to the sun\nTo get your...\nLoving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms\nYour sweet, sweet loving arms\nTo get to your loving arms, your loving arms\nYour loving arms\nYour sweet, sweet loving arms\nEmpty pockets, motel beds\nAirline tickets, words better left unsaid\nStrange kisses get the ghost\nWhat I miss is what she'll never know\nEvery day another mountain, another mountain to climb\nTo get to your...\nLoving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms\nYour sweet, sweet loving arms\nTo get to your loving arms, your loving arms\nYour loving arms\nYour sweet, sweet loving arms\n\nAnd the world could be perfect\nEven if we are not\nIf everything is forgiven\nEven if not forgot\nAnd when the morning comes a-breaking\nAnd I call out your name\nMy heart will be running, oh running to get to your\nLoving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms\nYour sweet, sweet loving arms\nTo get to your loving arms, your loving arms\nYour loving

Why, what the Devil ails the Colonel, in a time when all the World is gay, to look like mere Lent thus? Hadst thou been long enough in Naples to have been in love, I should have sworn some such Judgment had befall\u2019n thee.\n\nBELV. No, I have made no new Amours since I came to Naples.\n\nFRED. You have left none behind you in Paris.\n\nBELV. Neither.\nFRED. I can\u2019t divine the Cause then; unless the old Cause, the want of Mony.\n\nBLUNT. And another old Cause, the want of a wench, would not that revive you?\n\nBELV. You\u2019re mistaken, NED.\n\nBLUNT Nay, \u2019Sheartlikins, then thou art past Cure.\n\nFRED. I have found it out; thou hast renew\u2019d thy Acquaintance with the Lady that cost thee so many Sighs at the Siege of PAMPELONA pox on\u2019t, what d\u2019ye call her. Her Brother\u2019s a noble SPANIARD Nephew to the dead General FLORINDA ay, FLORINDA And will nothing serve thy turn but that damn\u2019d virtuous Woman, whom on my Conscience thou loves in spite too, because thou serest little or no possibility of gaining her?\n\nBELV. Thou art mistaken, I have Interest enough in that lovely Virgin\u2019s Heart, to make me proud and vain, were it not abated by the Severity of a Brother, who perceiving my Happiness\n\nFRED. Has civilly forbid thee the House?\n\nBELV. \u2019Tis so, to make way for a powerful Rival, the Vice-Roy\u2019s Son, who has the advantage of me, in being a Man of Fortune, a SPANIARD, and her Brother\u2019s Friend; which gives him liberty to make his Court, whilst I have recourse only to Letters, and distant Looks from her Window, which are as soft and kind as those which Heaven sends down on Penitents.\n\nBLUNT. Hey day! \u2019Sheartlikins, Simile! by this Light the Man is quite spoil\u2019d FREDERICK, what the Devil are we made of, that we cannot be thus concern\u2019d for a Wench? \u2019Sheartlikins, our Cupids are like the Cooks of the Camp, they can roast or boil a Woman, but they have none of the fine Tricks to set \u2019em off, no Hogoes to make the Sauce pleasant, and the Stomach sharp.\n\nFRED. I dare swear I have had a hundred as young, kind and handsome as thisFLORINDA; and Dogs eat me, if they were not as troublesome to me i\u2019th\u2019 Morning as they were welcome o\u2019er night.\nBLUNT. And yet, I warrant, he would not touch another Woman, if he might have her for nothing.\nBELV. That\u2019s thy Joy, a cheap Whore.\n\nBLUNT. Why, \u2019dsheartlikins, I love a frank soul when did you ever hear of an honest Woman that took a Man\u2019s Mony? I warrant \u2019em good ones But, Gentlemen, you may be free, you have been kept so poor with Parliaments and Protectors, that the little Stock you have is not worth preserving but I thank my Stars, I have more Grace than to forfeit my Estate by Cavaliering.\nBELV. Methinks only following the Court should be sufficient to entitle \u2019em to that.\nBLUNT. \u2019Sheartlikins, they know I follow it to do it no good, unless they pick a hole in my Coat for lending you Mony now and then; which is a greater Crime to my Conscience, Gentlemen, than to the Common-wealth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enter WILLMORE.\n\nWILL.

What think you of those grave People? Is a Wake in Essex half so mad or extravagant?\n\nWILL. I like their sober grave way, \u2019tis a kind of legal authorized Fornication, where the Men are not chid for\u2019t, nor the Women despised, as amongst our dull English; even the Monsieurs want that part of good Manners.\n\nBELV.

Have a care how you venture with me, Sir, lest I pick your Pocket, which will more vex your English Humour, than an Italian Fortune will please you.\n\nWILL. How the Devil cam\u2019st thou to know my Country and Humour?\n\nHELL. The first I guess by a certain forward Impudence, which does not displease me at this time; and the Loss of your Money will vex you, because I hope you have but very little to lose.\n\nWILL.

explain\nSome other fool across the ocean years ago\nMust have crashed his little airplane\n\n[Chorus]\nHow long 'til my soul gets it right?\nCan any human being ever reach that kind of light?\nI call on the resting soul of Galileo\nKing of night vision, king of insight\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm not making a joke, you know me\nI take everything so seriously\nIf we wait for the time 'til all souls get it right\nThen at least I know there'll be no nuclear annihilation\nIn my lifetime, I'm still not right\n\n[Verse 4]\nI offer thanks to those before me\nThat's all I've got to say\n'Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime\nNow I have to pay\nSee Indigo Girls LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like[Verse 5]\nBut then again it feels like some sort of inspiration\nTo let the next life off the hook\nBut she'll say, \"Look what I had to overcome from my last life\nI think I'll write a book\"\n\n[Chorus]\nHow long 'til my soul gets it right?\nCan any human being ever reach the highest light?\nExcept for Galileo\u2014God rest his soul\n(Except for the resting soul of Galileo)\nKing of night vision, king of insight\n\n[Outro]\nHow long\nUntil my soul gets it right?\n'Til

focused\nLooking straight forward at the world and beyond\nI feel people pulling me down\nI feel some pulling me up\nI can't get stuck\nI just keep moving forward\nI got places to go man\nLet's go\n\n[Chorus: Damian Marley]\nWhen the armageddon's dark and dread\nA lot of weak hearted weep and moan\nOnly the strong will continue\nDo you have it in you?\nCome, we've got a journey to go\nAnd when the battle get sour and dread\nA lot of weak hearted wither and  moan\nOnly the strong will continue\nI know you have it in you\nI know you have it in you\n[Verse 1: Damian Marley]\nHey, the victory's found in truth\nLike innocence found in youth\nSelf defeat is your own dispute\nAnd man, you put yourself in your own shoes\nEither you're winning or losing\nDon't you get it confused\nPlay a star and you know your own movie\nPlaying of the role you choose, so\nStand up and fight if you know that you're right\nAnd know you will never fail\nTipping the scale and the wind shall prevail\nAnd the boat shall forever sail\nHey, there ain't no stopping or cruising\nEven when you're battered and bruised\nOutrun all the sprinters on Mount Olympus\nMy God's tougher than Zeus\n\n[Chorus: Damian Marley (Nas)]\nWhen the Armageddon's dark and dread\n(I get up and make it happen)\nA lot of weak hearted wither and moan\n(I get up and we get it cracking)\nOnly the strong will continue\nDo you have it in you?\nCome, we've got a journey to go\nAnd when the battle get sour and dread\n(I get up and I get it going)\nA lot of weak hearted wither and moan\n(We get up and we keep it flowing)\nOnly the strong will continue (yeah)\nI know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)\nI know you have it in you\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Nas]\nAs I walk through the valley of the shadow of death\nNew York to Cali, for the money, power, respect\nIt's a journey, some'll get left behind\nCause in life, you cannot press rewind\nGet it right, you only have one first chance\nTo make one first impression that lasts a lifetime\nReputation supersedes itself\nDo you believe in Hell? Babylon greed for wealth\nDo you deceive yourself and let your ego swell?\nAnd disregard those who most need your help\nThick skin, the dark won't take my soul\nSurvive spiritual wars, see my welts\nAnd the evil's felt, but the faith is stronger\nI saw grown men fall when I was a youngster\nBut I clench my fists, ready to go against whoever\nTie my Timbs and rise in the end\n[Chorus: Damian Marley (Nas)]\nWhen the armageddon's dark and dread\n(I get up and make it happen)\nA lot of weak hearted weep and moan\n(I get up and we get it cracking)\nOnly the strong will continue\nDo you have it in you?\nCome, we've got a journey to go\nAnd when the battle get sour and tread\n(I get up and I get it going)\nA lot of weak hearted wither and moan\n(We get up and we keep it flowing)\nOnly the strong will continue (yeah)\nI know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)\nI know you have it in you\n[Verse 3: Damian Marley]\nNo man live forever, but never say never\nEvery good he want better, must be a go getter\nAnd always be clever in every endeavor\nCause drastic time call for drastic measure\nYuh birthright to pleasure From yuh navel string sever\nThe land and the treasure, work for whatever\nJah said don't be a beggar, the Alpha Omega\nWill bless every soul no matter which name you prefer\nThe immortal stepper, believe in every skin no matter which color they are\nWe never let we don't know here which kind of weather\nYou're destined to rise like the Son of Rebecca\nDon't stop for a second\nEveryone reckon, it sure would be good to be there\nWhether Zion or Mecca\nWhen the gates are finally closed\nAnd the saints go marching in\n\n[Chorus: Damian Marley & (Nas)]\nWhen the armageddon's dark and dread\nA lot of weak hearted weep and moan\nOnly the strong will continue\nDo you have it in you?\nCome, we've got a journey to go\nAnd when the battle get sour and dread\nA lot of weak hearted wither and  moan\nOnly the strong will continue\nI know you have it in you\nI know you have it in you\n\n\n[Verse 4: Nas]\nI'm a street lifer\nAlways harrassed by the cee cyphers\nChief like Geronimo with his peace pipe\nI emerged from the street life\nThis for the homies who relate\nKnow what it be like\nMy QB life takin' a turn to the Louis XIII life\nTwisted and mangled sort of like Bruce Lee life\nCursed with his son Brandon\nIf that's you and me, Knight, I pray our fates greater\nI speak life I still matter as a rapper, not doubtin'\nEven Toni Braxton signed a deal with Craig Kallman\nHow in, the hell am I supposed stay comfy\nWhen I pay child support, alimony monthly?\nGot Maseratis and Ferraris\nOnly like a woman who's a rider, But only ho's want me\nSingle life crazy, niggas wives on me\nI say stay faithful, they say their man corny\nSo I'm, stuck with a married woman\nSo fine, cheatin while they husband\nRushing on the 40-yard line, wonder if\nThis is what my ex did the whole time\nGood niggas seem to always end up\nWith some hard times, hope not\nIf a pimp slippin and a ho plot\nAin't nothin to a G in a two-tone drop, kid\nAnd it don't stop, See a nigga dissapearin\nWith the baddest honeys in the whole spot, yeah13Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

Forget em\nCause \u201cone day it\u2019ll all make sense\u201d like 9/30/97\nTo become highly recommended\nOne reason some may not comprehend it\nIs to be in the know humans beings don\u2019t usually show one reason to grow\nCheck your self before you wreck it to survive\nIn other words reflect for the lessons\nOne time for anyone who\u2019s ever manifested a dream\nTwo time for all the beautiful things in my life\nBecause to be wealthy is to be gracious\nThe energy in your space is what makes it truly spacious\nOne time for the ones who wonder if they won\nThe ones who never run and never need anyone\nWhat?\nPeace to the ones who live to please\nExtra peace to the ones who live by the gun\nHoping they never have to squeeze\nPeace to the artist\u00e9s living they masterpiece\nLookin like Maxi Priest\nClose to you even when they unapproachable\nEven when they anti social\nYou know it\u2019s no trouble\nTo show love and be the most humble\nWho would have known we\u2019d grow up to push through the cold like snow shovels\nBefore returning to my own bubble\nPeace, Tribe\nR.I.P.

For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature's boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution's menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?\nIt is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured. Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O'Shiels, the O'Hickeys, the O'Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux. Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that all hardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.\n\nTo her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile. O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!\nBefore born bliss babe had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever in that one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.\n\nSome man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night's oncoming. Of Israel's folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.\n\nOf that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are won't that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God's angel to Mary quoth. Watchers tway there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless. Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.\n\nIn ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland's westward welkin. Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins. Christ's rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne's house.\n\nLoth to irk in Horne's hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.\n\nAs her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O'Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O'Hare Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God's rightwiseness to withsay. She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men's oil to his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.\nTherefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.\n\nThe man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman's birth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.\nAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon. And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.\n\nAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.\nAnd the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.\nThis meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast. Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long. And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next. Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both's health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars' hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. Woman's woe with wonder pondering.\n\nNow let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable's with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.\nFor they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne's house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi's praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God's greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman's seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his won't was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.\n\nBut sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb's wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now Sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.\n\nAbout that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul's bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore. His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time's ruins build eternity's mansions. What means this? Desire's wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark me now. In woman's womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. This is the postcreation. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin. But here is the matter now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M. L\u00e9o Taxil nous a dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette fichue position c'\u00e9tait le sacre pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality ODER consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality. And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness. Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With will will we withstand, withsay.\n\nHereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time's occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred. In Horne's house rest should reign.\nTo be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar's vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid's Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it. Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. _Orate, fratres, pro memetipso_. And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high Which brake hell's gates visited a darkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully saith of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion. The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt's plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper _ubi_ and _quomodo_. And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage. And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.\n\nThereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.\n\n_Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack See the malt stored in many a refluent sack, In the proud cirque of Jackjohn's bivouac._\n\nA black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne's hall. He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart's side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.\nBut was young Boasthard's fear vanquished by Calmer's words? No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.\n\nThis was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.\nSo Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won't sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too. Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke's lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon's door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the college lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman's gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore's the writer's (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M's brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne's being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne's. There Leop. Bloom of Crawford's journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy's, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will. Madden, T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D. Leop. Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, be having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can't deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue. 'Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick's nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king's bible. Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear. In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi's almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer's gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.\nWith this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul's men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), 'tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. There's as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. _Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids' linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce believe 'tis so bad, says he. And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street. I question with you there, says he. More like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. He'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that's Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language and they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry's orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I'll meddle in his matters, says he. I'll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:\n\n_--Pope Peter's but a pissabed. A man's a man for a' that._\nOur worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and Incubator. Lambay Island_. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. 'Tis as cheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.\n\nValuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne's house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman's woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though 'tis pity she's a trollop): There's a belly that never bore a bastard. This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.\nHere the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. _Mais bien s\u00fbr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_. That you may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le Fecondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle AVEC LUI in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.\nAmid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad's bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I'm all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you're as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she ain't in the family way. I knows a lady what's got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.\nTo revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while from the sister's words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.\nAccordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. 'Slife, I'll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.\n\nBut with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.\nThe news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.\nBut Malachias' tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up the scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me. This is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland's, is in this life. It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out. In vain! His spectre stalks me. Dope is my only hope... Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His real name was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. The spider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer's ground.\nWhat is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is young Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother's thought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob's pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat_!) light shall flood the world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath 'twas done but--hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No, Leopold. Name and memory solace thee not. That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee--and in vain. No son of thy loins is by thee. There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.\nThe voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more. And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_. Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.\n\nOnward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.\nFrancis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee's time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He could not leave his mother an orphan. The young man's face grew dark. All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider's name: Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with 0. Madden up. She was leading the field. All hearts were beating. Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three today. What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient won't. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then. Her posies tool Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had poor luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.\nHowever, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before's observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.\n\nThe debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne's house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.\nIt had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_ of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.\nMeanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer's office, Dublin Castle. And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!\nThere are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine. Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.\nThe stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. A scene disengages itself in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the PIAZZETTA giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergangliche_) in her glad look.\nMark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago. But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.\nBurke's! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a milligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out, tumultuously, off for a minute's race, all bravely legging it, Burke's of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up there. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward of watching in Horne's house has told its tale in that washedout pallor. Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?\n\nThe air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._ God's air, the Allfather's air, scintillant circumambient cessile air. Breathe it deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done a doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most farraginous chronicle. Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven preformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of man's work. Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog and let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their daddies, Theodore. Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher's bills at home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up! For every newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See, thy fleece is drenched. Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A canting jay and a rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer. Copulation without population! No, say I! Herod's slaughter of the innocents were the truer name. Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw, bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps, quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins. A truce to threnes and trentals and jeremies and all such congenital defunctive music! Twenty years of it, regret them not. With thee it was not as with many that will and would and wait and never--do. Thou sawest thy America, thy lifetask, and didst charge to cover like the transpontine bison. How saith Zarathustra? _Deine Kuh Tr\u00fcbsal melkest Du. Nun Trinkst Du die s\u00fcsse Milch des Euters_. See! it displodes for thee in abundance. Drink, man, an udderful! Mother's milk, Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk too of those burgeoning stars overhead rutilant in thin rainvapour, punch milk, such as those rioters will quaff in their guzzling den, milk of madness, the honeymilk of Canaan's land.

meant to be\nWhen you are here you're all that I see\nBut we can't ignore what life has in store\nFor those less fortunate than we\n\nThere will be a day\nWhen we can play in a sea of blue\nBut now we are here\nAnd all that we fear\nIs coming true\n\nIt's too much for me and you\nU know what we have to do\nIt's too late to hesitate\nWe've got to turn this world hate\nInto loveYou might also

baby\nI'm holdin' back, I'm not lettin' go\n'Cause a fool don't have a shoulder to cry on, so\nGive me a kiss and you can sing this\nWhether you like a mister or a miss\n[Chorus]\nAyo, baby, I know you don't love me (I know why you're here)\nI know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I ain't sayin' nothin')\nAyo, baby, I know you don't love me\nI know why you're here, but I ain't sayin'

you think that I'm crazy\nNo, I'm not drinking, I know what you want\nI made ya want it, take my hand\nListen to the man, you have a plan, don't even risk it\nWhat do you want, a biscuit?\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo, baby, I know you don't love me (I know why you're here)\nI know why you're here, but I ain't sayin' nothin' (I ain't sayin' nothin')\nAyo, baby, I know you don't love me\nI

discuss why you're here\nBut of course I ain't sayin' nothin'\n\n[Verse 4]\nOkay, now that you know\nI know you know that I know you know\nAnd that's the move, so sit right here\nWhisper in my ear, caress my chest\nAnd say somethin' smooth, but don't forget\nI know what you'll say\nJust what I thought, I know the routine\nI know the routine, just what I thought\nI know you tell the truth, I know

slower\nBut actions speak louder than words\nSo I'll hush for now and let myself be heard\nYou're bound to make the same sound\nWhen the lights go out\n(Oh, when the lights go out)\nWhen the lights go out\n(Oh, when the lights go out)\n(Ooh ooh ooh)\n\nOh Bobbie, give me one night so I can hold you tight\nWet my apetite, make you feel just right\nRoll from side to side, rub around your thighs\nCheck the merchandise, then try it on for size\nTake a shot to find the spot that drives you nuts\nI don't intend to stop till you drop\nAnd when you do hit the lights so I can see those baby blues\nYou've got nothing to lose\n\n(Oh, when the lights go out)\nWhen the lights go out\n(Oh, when the lights go out)\nWhen the lights go out\n(Oh, when the lights go out)\nWhen the lights go out\n(Ooh ooh ooh)\n\nRight now, he&121\n\nSo Bobbie, what's it gonna be?\nWhy settle for less when you can be with me?\nI intend to do my best, forget the rest\nSo please, say yes, can't you see that I'm obssesed?\nNo girl can match ya\nI dream about you and when I gotcha I ain't touching no one but you\nBut until that day, the kid will play, so 'ciao' for now\nGot nothing more to say till the lights go out\nYou might also like(Oh, when the lights go out)\nWhen the lights go out\n(Oh, when the lights go out)\nWhen the lights go out\n(Ooh ooh ooh)\n\n(Oh, when the lights go out)\nWhen the

green\nThe green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top\nBut Robocop last year was a shock\nThe tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt\nKids are screaming; the media says, \"What...\nKind of music is this for you to dance to?\"\nThe man with the plan and the man demands you\nLeave the smack and the crack for the wack\nThrow the vial in the Nile; keep a smile like that\nLeave the knife and the gun in the store\nAnd ignore temptation, sent by the nation\nRacial gain causes pain; need a new rep\nIn your hearts and minds never forget Yusef\nHawkins, and when you're walking, you don't just run\nBlack on black; remember that; it's important\nAnyway the struggle is won, brings forth the fun\nNo hatred; the summer's almost done\nNo time for sleep, jump in your Jeep\nAnd pump up the funky beat a whole week\nBeeper goes off, yo, smash it and trash it\nYou're too young to be plumped in a casket\nJust get your boys and bring the noise\nAnd just swing it, and party people, sing it\n[Chorus]\nTreat me right, I'll treat you good\n\n[Verse Two]\nKids in the crib want dibs on the big man\n\"Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam?\nI'm his number one fan, yes I am\"\nAll these kids realize that I'm the man\nSix foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger\nThan last year, but still a unique figure\nRob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky, and Hot Dog know\nThat I'm a man who was born to have a mic on\nNext to me at all times, ready to kick a rhyme\nThat will keep me out of financial bind\nThat's why when it comes to fans, I'm never mean\nKids on St. James between Gates and Greene\nAlways says hello, cause I'm a modest fellow\nNever try to play a superstar, that's hollow\nCause if these kids don't go buy our records\nWe'll be has-beens, and plus naked\nSo we owe them, so pull out your pen\nSign an autograph, you might make a new friend\nSo just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it\nAnd party people in the house, sing it\n\n[Chorus]\nYou might also like[Verse Three]\nParty people in the house, listen up\nI'm the man with the plan and the band rips it up\nPeace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee\nSwinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ed Lover, Dinky\nFish and chips with the hippy hippy hips\nBefore the tune ends, give me some lips (ah!)\nSanity Crystal, my niece\nAnd Lady Kazam, my homegirl, peace\nAnd leave the guns and have fun; out!\nAnd oh yeah, sing it\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse Four]\nWell, coming back\nTo nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene\nWith a lean and a hardcore dream\nThe dream wasn't crafted to be pornographic\nDecency started from the crib, plus kids\nDon't need to hear all of that on the rap\nThe strength of my vibe placed Chubbs on the map\nCause authority, seniority goes far\nMy staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs\nRead my mic, heed my sight, I'll definitely lead you right\nJust treat me right, peace!\n[Outro]\nTreat me right\nTreat me right\nTreat me right4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/6946145", "artist_names": "The Vaccines", "full_title": "Bandit

poplar trees in the\ndriveway of my father\u2019s house and annoy our neighbors by reflecting sunlight\ninto their homes with a shard of mirror. We would sit across from each other on\na pair of high branches, our naked feet dangling, our trouser pockets filled\nwith dried mulberries and walnuts. We took turns with the mirror as we ate\nmulberries, pelted each other with them, giggling, laughing; I can still see\nHassan up on that tree, sunlight flickering through the leaves on his almost\nperfectly round face, a face like a Chinese doll chiseled from hardwood: his\nflat, broad nose and slanting, narrow eyes like bamboo leaves, eyes that looked,\ndepending on the light, gold, green, even sapphire I can still see his tiny lowset\nears and that pointed stub of a chin, a meaty appendage that looked like it\nwas added as a mere afterthought. And the cleft lip, just left of midline, where\nthe Chinese doll maker\u2019s instrument may have slipped; or perhaps he had simply\ngrown tired and careless.\nSometimes, up in those trees, I talked Hassan into firing walnuts with his\nslingshot at the neighbor\u2019s one-eyed German shepherd. Hassan never wanted to,\nbut if I asked, _really_ asked, he wouldn\u2019t deny me. Hassan never denied me\nanything. And he was deadly with his slingshot. Hassan\u2019s father, Ali, used to\ncatch us and get mad, or as mad as someone as gentle as Ali could ever get. He\nwould wag his finger and wave us down from the tree. He would take the mirror\nand tell us what his mother had told him, that the devil shone mirrors too,\nshone them to distract Muslims during prayer. \u201cAnd he laughs while he does it,\u201d\nhe always added, scowling at his son. \u201cYes, Father,\u201d Hassan would mumble, looking down at his feet. But he never told\non me. Never told that the mirror, like shooting walnuts at the neighbor\u2019s dog,\nwas always my idea.\nThe poplar trees lined the redbrick driveway, which led to a pair of wroughtiron\ngates. They in turn opened into an extension of the driveway into my\nfather\u2019s estate. The house sat on the left side of the brick path, the backyard\nat the end of it.\nEveryone agreed that my father, my Baba, had built the most beautiful house in\nthe Wazir Akbar Khan district, a new and affluent neighborhood in the northern\npart of Kabul. Some thought it was the prettiest house in all of Kabul. A broad\nentryway flanked by rosebushes led to the sprawling house of marble floors and\nwide windows. Intricate mosaic tiles, handpicked by Baba in Isfahan, covered the\nfloors of the four bathrooms. Gold-stitched tapestries, which Baba had bought in\nCalcutta, lined the walls; a crystal chandelier hung from the vaulted ceiling.\nUpstairs was my bedroom, Baba\u2019s room, and his study, also known as \u201cthe smoking\nroom,\u201d which perpetually smelled of tobacco and cinnamon. Baba and his friends\nreclined on black leather chairs there after Ali had served dinner. They stuffed\ntheir pipes--except Baba always called it \u201cfattening the pipe\u201d--and discussed\ntheir favorite three topics: politics, business, soccer. Sometimes I asked Baba\nif I could sit with them, but Baba would stand in the doorway. \u201cGo on, now,\u201d\nhe\u2019d say. \u201cThis is grown-ups\u2019 time. Why don\u2019t you go read one of those books of\nyours?\u201d He\u2019d close the door, leave me to wonder why it was always grown-ups\u2019\ntime with him. I\u2019d sit by the door, knees drawn to my chest. Sometimes I sat\nthere for an hour, sometimes two, listening to their laughter, their chatter.\nThe living room downstairs had a curved wall with custombuilt cabinets. Inside\nsat framed family pictures: an old, grainy photo of my grandfather and King\nNadir Shah taken in 1931, two years before the king\u2019s assassination; they are\nstanding over a dead deer, dressed in knee-high boots, rifles slung over their\nshoulders. There was a picture of my parents\u2019 wedding night, Baba dashing in his\nblack suit and my mother a smiling young princess in white. Here was Baba and\nhis best friend and business partner, Rahim Khan, standing outside our house,\nneither one smiling--I am a baby in that photograph and Baba is holding me,\nlooking tired and grim. I\u2019m in his arms, but it\u2019s Rahim Khan\u2019s pinky my fingers\nare curled around.\nThe curved wall led into the dining room, at the center of which was a mahogany\ntable that could easily sit thirty guests-- and, given my father\u2019s taste for\nextravagant parties, it did just that almost every week. On the other end of the\ndining room was a tall marble fireplace, always lit by the orange glow of a fire\nin the wintertime.\nA large sliding glass door opened into a semicircular terrace that overlooked\ntwo acres of backyard and rows of cherry trees. Baba and Ali had planted a small\nvegetable garden along the eastern wall: tomatoes, mint, peppers, and a row of\ncorn that never really took. Hassan and I used to call it \u201cthe Wall of Ailing\nCorn.\u201d\nOn the south end of the garden, in the shadows of a loquat tree, was the\nservants\u2019 home, a modest little mud hut where Hassan lived with his father.\nIt was there, in that little shack, that Hassan was born in the winter of 1964,\njust one year after my mother died giving birth to me. In the eighteen years that I lived in that house, I stepped into Hassan and\nAli\u2019s quarters only a handful of times. When the sun dropped low behind the\nhills and we were done playing for the day, Hassan and I parted ways. I went\npast the rosebushes to Baba\u2019s mansion, Hassan to the mud shack where he had been\nborn, where he\u2019d lived his entire life. I remember it was spare, clean, dimly\nlit by a pair of kerosene lamps. There were two mattresses on opposite sides of\nthe room, a worn Herati rug with frayed edges in between, a three-legged stool,\nand a wooden table in the corner where Hassan did his drawings. The walls stood\nbare, save for a single tapestry with sewn-in beads forming the words _Allah-uakbar_.\nBaba had bought it for Ali on one of his trips to Mashad.\nIt was in that small shack that Hassan\u2019s mother, Sanaubar, gave birth to him one\ncold winter day in 1964. While my mother hemorrhaged to death during childbirth,\nHassan lost his less than a week after he was born. Lost her to a fate most\nAfghans considered far worse than death: She ran off with a clan of traveling\nsingers and dancers.\nHassan never talked about his mother, as if she\u2019d never existed. I always\nwondered if he dreamed about her, about what she looked like, where she was. I\nwondered if he longed to meet her. Did he ache for her, the way I ached for the\nmother I had never met? One day, we were walking from my father\u2019s house to\nCinema Zainab for a new Iranian movie, taking the shortcut through the military\nbarracks near Istiqlal Middle School--Baba had forbidden us to take that\nshortcut, but he was in Pakistan with Rahim Khan at the time. We hopped the\nfence that surrounded the barracks, skipped over a little creek, and broke into\nthe open dirt field where old, abandoned tanks collected dust. A group of\nsoldiers huddled in the shade of one of those tanks, smoking cigarettes and\nplaying cards. One of them saw us, elbowed the guy next to him, and called\nHassan.\n\u201cHey, you!\u201d he said. \u201cI know you.\u201d\nWe had never seen him before. He was a squatly man with a shaved head and black\nstubble on his face. The way he grinned at us, leered, scared me. \u201cJust keep\nwalking,\u201d I muttered to Hassan.\n\u201cYou! The Hazara! Look at me when I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d the soldier barked. He\nhanded his cigarette to the guy next to him, made a circle with the thumb and\nindex finger of one hand. Poked the middle finger of his other hand through the\ncircle. Poked it in and out. In and out. \u201cI knew your mother, did you know that?\nI knew her real good. I took her from behind by that creek over there.\u201d\nThe soldiers laughed. One of them made a squealing sound. I told Hassan to keep\nwalking, keep walking.\n\u201cWhat a tight little sugary cunt she had!\u201d the soldier was saying, shaking hands\nwith the others, grinning. Later, in the dark, after the movie had started, I\nheard Hassan next to me, croaking. Tears were sliding down his cheeks. I reached\nacross my seat, slung my arm around him, pulled him close. He rested his head on\nmy shoulder. \u201cHe took you for someone else,\u201d I whispered. \u201cHe took you for\nsomeone else.\u201d\nI\u2019m told no one was really surprised when Sanaubar eloped. People _had_ raised\ntheir eyebrows when Ali, a man who had memorized the Koran, married Sanaubar, a\nwoman nineteen years younger, a beautiful but notoriously unscrupulous woman who\nlived up to her dishonorable reputation. Like Ali, she was a Shi\u2019a Muslim and an\nethnic Hazara. She was also his first cousin and therefore a natural choice for a spouse. But beyond those similarities, Ali and Sanaubar had little in common,\nleast of all their respective appearances. While Sanaubar\u2019s brilliant green eyes\nand impish face had, rumor has it, tempted countless men into sin, Ali had a\ncongenital paralysis of his lower facial muscles, a condition that rendered him\nunable to smile and left him perpetually grimfaced. It was an odd thing to see\nthe stone-faced Ali happy, or sad, because only his slanted brown eyes glinted\nwith a smile or welled with sorrow. People say that eyes are windows to the\nsoul. Never was that more true than with Ali, who could only reveal himself\nthrough his eyes.\nI have heard that Sanaubar\u2019s suggestive stride and oscillating hips sent men to\nreveries of infidelity. But polio had left Ali with a twisted, atrophied right\nleg that was sallow skin over bone with little in between except a paper-thin\nlayer of muscle. I remember one day, when I was eight, Ali was taking me to the\nbazaar to buy some _naan_. I was walking behind him, humming, trying to imitate\nhis walk. I watched him swing his scraggy leg in a sweeping arc, watched his\nwhole body tilt impossibly to the right every time he planted that foot. It\nseemed a minor miracle he didn\u2019t tip over with each step. When I tried it, I\nalmost fell into the gutter. That got me giggling. Ali turned around, caught me\naping him. He didn\u2019t say anything. Not then, not ever. He just kept walking.\nAli\u2019s face and his walk frightened some of the younger children in the\nneighborhood. But the real trouble was with the older kids. They chased him on\nthe street, and mocked him when he hobbled by. Some had taken to calling him\n_Babalu_, or Boogeyman.\n\u201cHey, Babalu, who did you eat today?\u201d they barked to a chorus of laughter. \u201cWho\ndid you eat, you flat-nosed Babalu?\u201d\nThey called him \u201cflat-nosed\u201d because of Ali and Hassan\u2019s characteristic Hazara\nMongoloid features. For years, that was all I knew about the Hazaras, that they\nwere Mogul descendants, and that they looked a little like Chinese people.\nSchool text books barely mentioned them and referred to their ancestry only in\npassing. Then one day, I was in Baba\u2019s study, looking through his stuff, when I\nfound one of my mother\u2019s old history books. It was written by an Iranian named\nKhorami. I blew the dust off it, sneaked it into bed with me that night, and was\nstunned to find an entire chapter on Hazara history. An entire chapter dedicated\nto Hassan\u2019s people! In it, I read that my people, the Pashtuns, had persecuted\nand oppressed the Hazaras. It said the Hazaras had tried to rise against the\nPashtuns in the nineteenth century, but the Pashtuns had \u201cquelled them with\nunspeakable violence.\u201d The book said that my people had killed the Hazaras,\ndriven them from their lands, burned their homes, and sold their women. The book\nsaid part of the reason Pashtuns had oppressed the Hazaras was that Pashtuns\nwere Sunni Muslims, while Hazaras were Shi\u2019a. The book said a lot of things I\ndidn\u2019t know, things my teachers hadn\u2019t mentioned. Things Baba hadn\u2019t mentioned\neither. It also said some things I did know, like that people called Hazaras\n_mice-eating, flat-nosed, load-carrying donkeys_. I had heard some of the kids\nin the neighborhood yell those names to Hassan.\nThe following week, after class, I showed the book to my teacher and pointed to\nthe chapter on the Hazaras. He skimmed through a couple of pages, snickered,\nhanded the book back. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing Shi\u2019a people do well,\u201d he said,\npicking up his papers, \u201cpassing themselves as martyrs.\u201d He wrinkled his nose\nwhen he said the word Shi\u2019a, like it was some kind of disease. But despite sharing ethnic heritage and family blood, Sanaubar joined the\nneighborhood kids in taunting Ali. I have heard that she made no secret of her\ndisdain for his appearance.\n\u201cThis is a husband?\u201d she would sneer. \u201cI have seen old donkeys better suited to\nbe a husband.\u201d\nIn the end, most people suspected the marriage had been an arrangement of sorts\nbetween Ali and his uncle, Sanaubar\u2019s father. They said Ali had married his\ncousin to help restore some honor to his uncle\u2019s blemished name, even though\nAli, who had been orphaned at the age of five, had no worldly possessions or\ninheritance to speak of.\nAli never retaliated against any of his tormentors, I suppose partly because he\ncould never catch them with that twisted leg dragging behind him. But mostly\nbecause Ali was immune to the insults of his assailants; he had found his joy,\nhis antidote, the moment Sanaubar had given birth to Hassan. It had been a\nsimple enough affair. No obstetricians, no anesthesiologists, no fancy\nmonitoring devices. Just Sanaubar lying on a stained, naked mattress with Ali\nand a midwife helping her. She hadn\u2019t needed much help at all, because, even in\nbirth, Hassan was true to his nature:\nHe was incapable of hurting anyone. A few grunts, a couple of pushes, and out\ncame Hassan. Out he came smiling.\nAs confided to a neighbor\u2019s servant by the garrulous midwife, who had then in\nturn told anyone who would listen, Sanaubar had taken one glance at the baby in\nAli\u2019s arms, seen the cleft lip, and barked a bitter laughter.\n\u201cThere,\u201d she had said. \u201cNow you have your own idiot child to do all your smiling\nfor you!\u201d She had refused to even hold Hassan, and just five days later, she was\ngone.\nBaba hired the same nursing woman who had fed me to nurse Hassan. Ali told us\nshe was a blue-eyed Hazara woman from Bamiyan, the city of the giant Buddha\nstatues. \u201cWhat a sweet singing voice she had,\u201d he used to say to us.\nWhat did she sing, Hassan and I always asked, though we already knew--Ali had\ntold us countless times. We just wanted to hear Ali sing.\nHe\u2019d clear his throat and begin:\n_On a high mountain I stood,\nAnd cried the name of Ali, Lion of God.\nO Ali, Lion of God, King of Men,\nBring joy to our sorrowful hearts._\nThen he would remind us that there was a brotherhood between people who had fed\nfrom the same breast, a kinship that not even time could break.\nHassan and I fed from the same breasts. We took our first steps on the same lawn\nin the same yard. And, under the same roof, we spoke our first words.\nMine was _Baba_.\nHis was _Amir_. My name. Looking back on it now, I think the foundation for what happened in the winter\nof 1975--and all that followed--was already laid in those first words.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,
