that tolls the hour has turned sweet lips to sour\nYes, I cheat the hangman and even when life has flown away\nI leave a kiss behind\n[Verse 2]\nThe rain that fell upon my stone\nLike tears you cry I shared alone\nI walk the night, I cannot sleep\nThe love you spend you cannot reap\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I cheat the hangman, cheated him many times before\nThe bell that tolls the hour has turned sweet

brewed a song of love and hatred\nOblique suggestions and he waited\nHe polarised the pumpkin-eaters\nStatic-humming panel-beaters\nFreshly day-glow'd factory cheaters\nSalaried and collar-scrubbing\nHe titillated men of action\nBelly warming, hands still rubbing\n\nOn the parts they never mention\nHe pacified the nappy-suffering, infant-bleating\nOne-line jokers, T.V.

and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.\n\n\u2014Come on, Simon.\n\n\u2014After you, Mr Bloom said.\n\nMr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:\n\nYes, yes.\n\n\u2014Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.\nMr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them. Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean job.\n\nAll waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.\n\nAll waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At walking pace.\n\nThey waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.\n\n\u2014What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.\n\n\u2014Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.\n\nMr Dedalus nodded, looking out.\n\n\u2014That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.\nAll watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.\n\n\u2014There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.\n\n\u2014Who is that?\n\n\u2014Your son and heir.\n\n\u2014Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.\n\nThe carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:\n\u2014Was that Mulligan cad with him? His fidus Achates!\n\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.\n\n\u2014Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.\n\nMr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.\n\nRichie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady's two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night. Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing his back. Thinks he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are. About six hundred per cent profit.\n\n\u2014He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. I'll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.\n\nHe cried above the clatter of the wheels:\n\n\u2014I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.\n\nHe ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house. Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins.\n\nGot big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her. I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn German too.\n\n\u2014Are we late? Mr Power asked.\n\n\u2014Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.\n\nMolly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too. Life, life.\nThe carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.\n\n\u2014Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. Do you follow me?\n\nHe closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.\n\n\u2014What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?\n\n\u2014Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.\n\nAll raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said:\n\n\u2014Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?\n\n\u2014It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nMr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.\n\nMr Dedalus sighed resignedly.\n\n\u2014After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.\n\n\u2014Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.\n\n\u2014And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.\n\n\u2014At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.\n\n\u2014I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.\n\nThe carriage halted short.\n\n\u2014What's wrong?\n\n\u2014We're stopped.\n\n\u2014Where are we?\n\nMr Bloom put his head out of the window.\n\n\u2014The grand canal, he said.\n\nGasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't miss this chance. Dogs' home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave. A dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's dogs usually are.\n\nA raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.\n\n\u2014The weather is changing, he said quietly.\n\n\u2014A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.\n\n\u2014Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming out.\n\nMr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.\n\n\u2014It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.\n\n\u2014We're off again.\n\nThe carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.\n\n\u2014Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.\n\n\u2014O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of The Croppy Boy.\n\n\u2014Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience.\n\n\u2014Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the retrospective arrangement.\n\n\u2014Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.\n\n\u2014I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?\n\n\u2014In the paper this morning.\n\nMr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change for her.\n\n\u2014No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.\n\nMr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton, Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind: Quinlan. On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.\nIt is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.\n\nI tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled. Before my patience are exhausted.\n\nNational school. Meade's yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding. Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their hats.\n\nA pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?\n\nAntient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law perhaps.\n\nThey went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway bridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder. I said I. Or the Lily of Killarney? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. Fun on the Bristol. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two. As broad as it's long.\n\nHe's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.\n\nPlasto's. Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?\n\n\u2014How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.\n\n\u2014He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?\n\n\u2014Who? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\n\u2014Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.\n\nJust that moment I was thinking.\n\nMr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.\n\nMr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes that? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.\n\nHe clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.\n\nMr Power asked:\n\n\u2014How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?\n\n\u2014O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good idea, you see...\n\n\u2014Are you going yourself?\n\n\u2014Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.\n\n\u2014Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.\n\nHave you good artists?\n\n\u2014Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in fact.\n\n\u2014And Madame, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.\n\nMr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them. Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.\n\nOot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.\n\n\u2014Four bootlaces for a penny.\n\nWonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street. Same house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford. Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too. Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake. O'Callaghan on his last legs.\n\nAnd Madame. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing her hair, humming. voglio e non vorrei. No. vorrei e non. Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. Mi trema un poco il. Beautiful on that tre her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.\n\nHis eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over the ears. Madame: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way. Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the Moira, was it?\n\nThey passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.\n\nMartin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.\n\n\u2014Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.\n\nA tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.\n\n\u2014In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.\n\nMr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:\n\n\u2014The devil break the hasp of your back!\n\nMr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray's statue.\n\n\u2014We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.\n\nHis eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:\n\n\u2014Well, nearly all of us.\n\nMr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.\n\n\u2014That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.\n\n\u2014About the boatman? Mr Power asked.\n\n\u2014Yes. Isn't it awfully good?\n\n\u2014What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.\n\n\u2014There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were both ...\n\n\u2014What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown...\n\n\u2014Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!\n\nMr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.\n\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself...\n\nMartin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:\n\n\u2014Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.\n\n\u2014For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?\n\n\u2014Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is...\n\n\u2014And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son's life.\n\nA stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.\n\n\u2014O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.\n\n\u2014Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.\n\n\u2014One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.\n\nMr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.\n\nNelson's pillar.\n\n\u2014Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!\n\n\u2014We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nMr Dedalus sighed.\n\n\u2014Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh. Many a good one he told himself.\n\n\u2014The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this. He's gone from us.\n\n\u2014As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went very suddenly.\n\n\u2014Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.\n\nHe tapped his chest sadly.\n\nBlazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose. Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent colouring it.\n\nMr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.\n\n\u2014He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.\n\n\u2014The best death, Mr Bloom said.\n\nTheir wide open eyes looked at him.\n\n\u2014No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.\n\nNo-one spoke.\n\nDead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college, Gill's, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.\n\nWhite horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for a nun.\n\n\u2014Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.\n\nA dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society pays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant nothing. Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If not from the man. Better luck next time.\n\n\u2014Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.\n\nThe carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.\n\n\u2014In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.\n\n\u2014But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.\n\nMartin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.\n\n\u2014The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.\n\n\u2014Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We must take a charitable view of it.\n\n\u2014They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.\n\n\u2014It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nMr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent. Like Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't broken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and capering with Martin's umbrella.\n\nAnd they call me the jewel of Asia,\nOf Asia,\nThe Geisha.\n\nHe looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.\n\nThat afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner's sunlit ears, big and hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.\n\nNo more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.\n\nThe carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.\n\n\u2014We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.\n\n\u2014God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.\n\n\u2014Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.\n\nAs they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from Saul. He's as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The Mater Misericordiae. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the dying. Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other. The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.\n\n\u2014What's wrong now?\n\nA divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.\n\n\u2014Emigrants, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.\n\nHuuuh! out of that!\n\nThursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for old England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a year. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.\n\nThe carriage moved on through the drove.\n\n\u2014I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.\n\n\u2014Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite right. They ought to.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all. Don't you see what I mean?\n\n\u2014O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon diningroom.\n\n\u2014A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.\n\n\u2014Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more decent than galloping two abreast?\n\n\u2014Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.\n\n\u2014And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road.\n\n\u2014That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road. Terrible!\n\n\u2014First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.\n\n\u2014Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.\n\nBom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up now. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.\n\n\u2014Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.\n\nDunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up here on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation. Elixir of life.\n\nBut suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about? He would and he wouldn't, I suppose. Depends on where. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.\n\nIn silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.\nCrossguns bridge: the royal canal.\n\nWater rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse. Aboard of the Bugabu.\n\nTheir eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady's. Developing waterways. James M'Cann's hobby to row me o'er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats. Camping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.\n\nThey drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.\n\n\u2014I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.\n\n\u2014How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?\n\n\u2014Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.\n\nThe carriage steered left for Finglas road.\n\nThe stonecutter's yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence: appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.\n\nPassed.\n\nOn the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot. After life's journey.\n\nGloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.\n\nMr Power pointed.\n\n\u2014That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.\n\n\u2014So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off. Murdered his brother. Or so they said.\n\n\u2014The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That's the maxim of the law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.\n\nThey looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder. The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.\n\nCramped in this carriage. She mightn't like me to come that way without letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.\n\nThe high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars, rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.\n\nThe felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.\n\nChange that soap now. Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.\n\nPaltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It's all the same. Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death. Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead. Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.\n\nHe followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.\n\nWhere is that child's funeral disappeared to?\n\nA team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.\n\nCoffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands every hour. Too many in the world.\n\nMourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry. Fish's face, bloodless and livid.\n\nThe mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So much dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.\n\nAll walked after.\n\nMartin Cunningham whispered:\n\n\u2014I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.\n\n\u2014What? Mr Power whispered. How so?\n\n\u2014His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the Queen's hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare. Anniversary.\n\n\u2014O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?\n\nHe glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal's mausoleum. Speaking.\n\n\u2014Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.\n\n\u2014I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.\n\n\u2014How many children did he leave?\n\n\u2014Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's.\n\n\u2014A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.\n\n\u2014A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.\n\n\u2014Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.\n\nHas the laugh at him now.\n\nHe looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow him. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who knows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.\n\n\u2014How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven't seen you for a month of Sundays.\n\n\u2014Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?\n\n\u2014I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.\n\n\u2014And how is Dick, the solid man?\n\n\u2014Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.\n\n\u2014By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?\n\n\u2014Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.\n\n\u2014Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?\n\n\u2014Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton is behind. He put down his name for a quid.\n\n\u2014I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.\n\n\u2014How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?\n\n\u2014Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.\n\nThey halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three shillings to O'Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?\n\nAfter a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.\n\nA server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's belly. Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.\n\nThey halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.\n\nFather Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. Domine-namine. Bully about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on him like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burst sideways.\n\n\u2014Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine.\n\nMakes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem mass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist. Chilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too. What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of the place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh's lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you're a goner.\n\nMy kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.\n\nThe priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.\n\n\u2014Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.\n\nThe server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course ...\n\nHoly water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows' breasts. All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.\n\n\u2014In paradisum.\n\nSaid he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.\n\nThe priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.\n\nThe ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn't lilt here.\n\n\u2014The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.\n\nMr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.\n\n\u2014He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. But his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!\n\n\u2014Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I'll soon be stretched beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.\n\nBreaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.\n\n\u2014She's better where she is, he said kindly.\n\n\u2014I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.\n\nCorny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.\n\n\u2014Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.\n\nMr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.\n\n\u2014The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.\n\nThey covered their heads.\n\n\u2014The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think? Mr Kernan said with reproof.\n\nMr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret eyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We are the last. In the same boat. Hope he'll say something else.\n\nMr Kernan added:\n\n\u2014The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.\n\nMr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.\n\nMr Kernan said with solemnity:\n\n\u2014I am the resurrection and the life. That touches a man's inmost heart.\n\n\u2014It does, Mr Bloom said.\n\nYour heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections. Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.\n\nCorny Kelleher fell into step at their side.\n\n\u2014Everything went off A1, he said. What?\n\nHe looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman's shoulders. With your tooraloom tooraloom.\n\n\u2014As it should be, Mr Kernan said.\n\n\u2014What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.\n\nMr Kernan assured him.\n\n\u2014Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I know his face.\n\nNed Lambert glanced back.\n\n\u2014Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano. She's his wife.\n\n\u2014O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven't seen her for some time. He was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. And a good armful she was.\n\nHe looked behind through the others.\n\n\u2014What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.\n\nNed Lambert smiled.\n\n\u2014Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for blottingpaper.\n\n\u2014In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for? She had plenty of game in her then.\n\n\u2014Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.\n\nJohn Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead.\n\nThe barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.\n\n\u2014John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.\n\nMr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:\n\n\u2014I am come to pay you another visit.\n\n\u2014My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don't want your custom at all.\n\nSaluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back.\n\n\u2014Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?\n\n\u2014I did not, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nThey bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.\n\n\u2014They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.\n\nThe caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He resumed:\n\n\u2014And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, Not a bloody bit like the man, says he. That's not Mulcahy, says he, whoever done it.\n\nRewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.\n\n\u2014That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.\n\n\u2014I know, Hynes said. I know that.\n\n\u2014To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It's pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.\n\nMr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. All want to be on good terms with him. Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort. Keys: like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks. Habeas corpus. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it's not chucked in the dead letter office. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That's the first sign when the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her. It might thrill her first. Courting death... Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O'Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. Will o' the wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a pitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they'd kiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards. Learn anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting to do it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.\n\nHe has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing. Sitting or kneeling you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic Gardens are just over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives new life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. With thanks.\n\nI daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.\n\nBut they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life. Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11 p.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in fashion. A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way. Gravediggers in Hamlet. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. De mortuis nil nisi prius. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.\n\n\u2014How many have-you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.\n\n\u2014Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.\n\nThe caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.\n\nBurying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June. He doesn't know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.\nO, poor Robinson Crusoe!\nHow could you possibly do so?\n\nPoor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow's. They're so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible even in the earth. The Irishman's house is his coffin. Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.\n\nMr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads. Twelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death's number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the chapel, that I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.\n\nNice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It's dyed. His wife I forgot he's not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.\n\nThe coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.\n\nPause.\n\nIf we were all suddenly somebody else.\n\nFar away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.\n\nGentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment you feel. Must be damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven't yet. Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he's doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner's death showing him a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold thee? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget you. Don't forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.\n\nWe are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well and not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.\n\nDoes he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning. Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.\n\nThe gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there's no.\n\nThe clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nThe caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.\n\nHynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he knows them all. No: coming to me.\n\n\u2014I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your christian name? I'm not sure.\n\n\u2014L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too. He asked me to.\n\n\u2014Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the Freeman once.\n\nSo he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads. Charley, you're my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does no harm. I saw to that, M'Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.\n\n\u2014And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...\n\nHe looked around.\n\n\u2014Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?\n\n\u2014M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don't know who he is. Is that his name?\n\nHe moved away, looking about him.\n\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!\n\nDidn't hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good Lord, what became of him?\n\nA seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.\n\n\u2014O, excuse me!\n\nHe stepped aside nimbly.\n\nClay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over. A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing. Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord. The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand. Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For yourselves just.\n\nThe mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.\n\n\u2014Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. We have time.\n\n\u2014Let us, Mr Power said.\n\nThey turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr Power's blank voice spoke:\n\n\u2014Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled with stones. That one day he will come again.\n\nHynes shook his head.\n\n\u2014Parnell will never come again, he said. He's there, all that was mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.\n\nMr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then lump them together to save time. All souls' day. Twentyseventh I'll be at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death's door. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it. Old Dr Murren's. The great physician called him home. Well it's God's acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the Church Times. Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.\n\nA bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him. Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder. Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.\n\nThe Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy. Apollo that was.\n\nHow many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed. As you are now so once were we.\n\nBesides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather. Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after fifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely's.\n\nRtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!\n\nHe looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he goes.\n\nAn obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it. Good hidingplace for treasure.\n\nWho lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn't he? Making his rounds.\n\nTail gone now.\n\nOne of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat gone bad. Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that Voyages in China that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the plague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to ashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can't bury in the air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication. We learned that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular square feed for them. Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn't care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.\n\nThe gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again. Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I was here was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after death. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.\n\nMartin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.\n\nSolicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office. Mat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.\n\nGot a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.\n\n\u2014Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.\n\nThey stopped.\n\n\u2014Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.\n\nJohn Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.\n\n\u2014There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.\n\n\u2014It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nJohn Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.\n\n\u2014Thank you, he said shortly.\n\nThey walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.\n\nOyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him. Get the pull over him that way.\n\nThank you. How grand we are this morning!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4373179", "artist_names": "Rusty Wier", "full_title": "Don't It Make You Wanna Dance? by\u00a0Rusty\u00a0Wier", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3745aba481c2ca72909b54eae296caad.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3745aba481c2ca72909b54eae296caad.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 4373179, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 5361247, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1551927013, "path": "/Rusty-wier-dont-it-make-you-wanna-dance-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Rusty-wier-dont-it-make-you-wanna-dance-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1975, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1975", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1975", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3745aba481c2ca72909b54eae296caad.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3745aba481c2ca72909b54eae296caad.600x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Don\u2019t It Make You Wanna Dance?", "title_with_featured": "Don't It Make You Wanna Dance?", "updated_by_human_at": 1669932907, "url": "https://genius.com/Rusty-wier-dont-it-make-you-wanna-dance-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/361458", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d4a003f8132c81ba1ac584690a0f34dc.720x720x1.jpg", "id": 361458, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d4a003f8132c81ba1ac584690a0f34dc.720x720x1.jpg", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Rusty Wier", "slug": "Rusty-wier", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Rusty-wier"}, "artist": "Rusty Wier", "lyrics": "Don\u2019t It Make You Wanna Dance?

"Monica-lewinsky", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Monica-lewinsky"}, "artist": "Monica Lewinsky", "lyrics": "Speech at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity LyricsIf you were a brand, what brand would you be?\n\nThat's a question I was asked in an interview\u2014a job interview just several years ago.\n\nLet me tell you, when you're Monica Lewinsky, that's a loaded fucking question.\n\nAll of you here today touch marketing and advertising with successful, established and respected companies. You're familiar with what it means to nurture, grow and shape a brand. And while unfortunate, it's likely that at one point or another, you've experienced a brand crisis, when your brand's narrative ran away from you.\n\nBut can you imagine what it is like when the brand is you? You personally. Your likeness, your name, your history, your values, your soul?\n\nThat's what happened to me in 1998.\nYou're looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade due in part to a brand crisis and branding, or rather how I was branded, by whom and for what purpose. Obviously the publicly silent bit has changed, but only recently.\n\nIt was eight months ago that I gave my first public talk at the Forbes 30 Under 30 Summit. Fifteen hundred brilliant people, all under the age of 30. That meant that in 1998, the oldest among the group were just 14 years old, and the youngest were 4.\n\nI joked that some of them might know me only from rap songs. Yes, I'm in rap songs. By my original count, it was almost 40 rap songs, but it actually turned out to be over 120, with a new one added just last week. In fact, there's probably a Spotify playlist of all these songs.\n\nThe night of my speech a surprising thing happened. At the age of 41 I was hit on by a 27-year-old guy. Crazy, right? He was charming, and I was flattered. And between us, I thought about it for a second, but I did decline.\n\nWhat was his unsuccessful pickup line? That he could make me feel 22 again. I realized later that night I'm probably the only person over 40 who does not want to be 22 again.\n\nAt the age of 22, I fell in love with my boss, and at the age of 24, I learned the devastating consequences.\n\nNow, I'd like to see a show of hands, please. Who here has ever made a mistake that you regretted? Now leave your hand up if everyone in the auditorium knows about that mistake. Not a one of you? You advertising folks are supposed to be naughty!\n\nLike me, a few of you may have made your mistake at 22. You may also, like me, have taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person, maybe even your boss. Unlike me, though, your boss probably wasn't the president of the United States of America.\n\nNot a day goes by that I'm not reminded of my mistake, and I regret that mistake deeply.\n\nIn 1998, after having been swept up into an improbable romance, I was then swept up into the eye of a political, legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before.\n\nIf the investigation had unfolded only a few years earlier, it would have been against the backdrop of a much slower and quieter media landscape. Up until then, news was consumed from just three places: reading a newspaper, listening to the radio or watching it on television. That was it.\n\nBut that wasn't my fate. Instead, this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution.\n\nThis meant we could access all the information we wanted, when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere. When the story broke in January 1998, it broke online. It was the first time traditional news was usurped by the Internet. A click that reverberated around the world.\nWhat that meant for me personally was that overnight, I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one, worldwide.\n\nI was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously. around the world, this story went. A viral phenomenon. News sources plastered photos of me all over to sell papers, banner ads online and to keep people tuned to the TV.\nDid a particular image of me just come to mind? Say, me wearing a beret?\n\nNow, I admit I made mistakes, and I think we can probably all agree that wearing the beret was one of them. But the attention and judgment I received\u2014not the story, but that I personally received\u2014was unprecedented.\n\nI was branded as a tart, slut, whore, bimbo, floozy and, of course, \"that woman.\" I was seen by many but truly known by few.\nAnd I get it. It was easy to forget that woman was dimensional, had a soul and was once unbroken.\n\nDuring this period, I came to realize that there were two Monica Lewinskys. There was me, and there was the public Monica Lewinsky. She was branded and constructed by various political factions in the media. Branded and constructed with a little fact and a lot of fiction.\n\nMy friends didn't know that Monica. My family didn't know that Monica. And this Monica, the real Monica, standing here today, didn't know her either.\n\nThis rush to judgment, enabled by technology, led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers. There was no Facebook, Twitter or Instagram back then, but there were gossip, news and entertainment websites, replete with comment sections, and of course there was email. The cruel jokes certainly made the rounds.\n\nWhen this happened to me 17 years ago, there was no name for this. Today we call it cyber-bullying and online harassment.\nI want to share some of my experience with you, talk about how my experience has helped shape my cultural observations and how I hope my past experience can lead us all to more compassionate behavior, specifically branding with compassion.\n\nIn 1998, I lost my reputation and my dignity. I lost almost everything, and I almost lost my life.\n\nLet me paint a picture for you. It's Labor Day weekend in 1998. I've traveled up to my stepdad's cabin up in the beautiful and calming Adirondacks in upstate New York. We're right on Lake Saranac, cosseted by the reassuring permanence of the majestic, soaring pine trees.\n\nIt's the first real moment of peace I've had since the investigation started over half a year ago. I'm just beginning to replenish my soul in nature, and dare I say relax, and the phone rings. I'm told I have a phone call. It's one of my lawyers.\n\nI've been summoned back to Washington, D.C., immediately. Within 48 hours, I'm sitting in a windowless room inside the office of the Independent Counsel underneath humming fluorescent lights. I'm listening to the sound of my voice\u2014my voice in surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before. I am here because I have been legally required to authenticate all 20 hours. Yes, you heard me correctly, all 20 hours of taped phone calls.\nAnd by legally required, I mean if I refuse to do this, the immunity to prosecution I had received would be taken away. I'd be sent to trial with the threat of jail.\n\nFor eight long months since I'd first learned of their existence, the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the Sword of Damocles over my head. Who can remember what they said a year ago?\n\nScared and mortified, I listened. Listened as I prattled on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day. Listened as I confessed my love of the president, and of course my heart broke. Listened to my sometimes catty, sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self, being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth. Listened as I expressed views I didn't know I held. Listened deeply, deeply ashamed to the worst version of myself\u2014a self I don't even recognize.\n\nA few days later, The Starr Report is released to Congress, and all those tapes and transcripts, those stolen words, form a part of it.\nThat people can read the transcripts is horrific enough. But a few weeks after that, the audio tapes are aired on TV and significant portions made available online. The public humiliation was excruciating, and life was almost unbearable.\n\nThis was not something that happened with regularity in 1998, and by this I mean the stealing of people's private words, conversations, actions or even pictures and then making them public\u2014public without consent, public without context and public without compassion.\n\nFast forward 12 years to 2010, and social media has now been born. The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine, whether or not someone had actually made a mistake, and now for both public and private people, the consequences for some were dire. Very dire.\n\nI was on the phone with my mom in September 2010, and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from Rutgers University named Tyler Clementi. Sweet, sensitive and creative Tyler, who played the violin and rode a unicycle\u2014sometimes simultaneously\u2014had been secretly webcammed by his roommate when he was intimate with another man.\n\nWhen the online world learned of the incident, the ridicule and cyber-bullying ignited. A few days later, submerged in the shame and humiliation, Tyler jumped from the George Washington Bridge to his death. He was 18.\n\nMy mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family. While we were both upset, she was gutted with pain in a way I couldn't quite understand.\n\nEventually, I realized she was reliving 1998, reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night, reliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open, and reliving a time that both my parents feared I would be humiliated to death, literally.\n\nThere were moments for me when it seemed like suicide was the only way to end the ridicule. And in this tiny respect, the blaring headlines were actually a blessing. My parents knew what I was going through because there was no mistaking it and no escaping it.\n\nBut today, too many parents haven't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones. Too many have learned of their child's suffering after it was too late.\n\nIn 1998, we had no way of knowing where this brave new technology called the Internet would take us. Since then, it has connected people in unimaginable ways\u2014joining lost siblings, saving lives, launching revolutions. But the darkness, cyber-bullying and slut shaming I experienced had mushroomed.\n\nEvery day online, people, especially young people who aren't developmentally equipped to handle this yet, are so humiliated that they can't imagine living to the next day. Some, tragically, don't, and there's nothing virtual about that.\n\nOnly a few months ago, new research was published of a longitudinal study conducted in both the U.S. and the U.K. The findings? Bullying was more damaging than child abuse. A victim of bullying was nearly four times more likely to suffer from mental health problems than a victim of child abuse.\n\nChildLine, a U.K. nonprofit that helps young people dealing with various issues, released this staggering statistic late last year: From 2012 to 2013, there was an 87 percent increase in calls related to cyber-bullying.\n\nWhat shocked me, though it shouldn't have, was research published last year that humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion than either happiness or even anger. Cruelty to others is nothing new, but the shift in the power of humiliation, given the breadth of the Internet, the reach is something altogether different.\nOnline, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified, uncontained and permanently accessible. It is loud, and there are no borders, no perimeters around how many people can observe it once and put you in a public stockade.\n\nThe echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as our family, school or community. But now it's the online community too.\n\nMillions of people, often anonymously, can stab you with their words. Can you imagine for a second what that pain feels like? Name calling, hate speech and online threats are weaponized words. Even as I'm talking to you now, this is happening to someone online. And I guess, depending on what you're all tweeting, that someone might be me.\n\nAuthors like Jon Ronson are writing about the online public stockade and bringing awareness to the scale and depth of online humiliation, particularly for people who made mistakes or choices that led to their online suffering.\n\nJust ask Justine Sacco, whose life has been derailed. She took off from the United States as a private person, and because of one unfortunate tweet she posted before she left, when she landed in South Africa, she was the object of public scorn and ridicule\u2014instantaneously, globally.\n\nNo matter how you viewed her regrettable tweet, do we want to live in a world with that large of a scale of scorn? I'm certainly not saying people need to be silent or silenced, but I do believe we need to think before we think out loud and online.\n\nThere is a very personal price to public humiliation, and the growth of the Internet has jacked up that price.\n\nFor nearly two decades now, we've slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil, both on- and offline. Gossip websites, paparazzi, reality programming, politics, news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame. It's led to desensitization and a permissive attitude online to cyber-bullying, harassing and threatening.\n\nThis shift has created what Professor Nicolaus  Mills calls \"a culture of humiliation.\" And in this culture of humiliation, there's another kind of price tag attached to public shaming. The price does not measure the cost to the victim that Tyler and too many others have paid. Rather, the price measures the profit of those who prey on them.\n\nThis violation of others is raw material, efficiently and ruthlessly mined and packaged and sold at a profit. Whether tallied in clicks, likes or just the perverse thrill of exposure, a marketplace has emerged where shame is a commodity and public humiliation an industry.\n\nHow is the money made? Clicks. The more shame, the more clicks. The more clicks, the more advertising dollars. And the more advertising dollars\u2014well, we can all see where this is going\u2014the more of what sells: shame.\n\nBut this is not an indictment of advertising dollars. I'm sure we can all agree that there's nothing wrong with advertising dollars here. But I believe we can also agree there are boundaries where profit halts and social responsibility steps in.\n\nNow we're in a dangerous cycle. The more we click on this kind of gossip, the more numb we get to the human lives behind it, and the more numb we get, the more we click. All the while, someone is making money off the back of another's suffering.\n\nPolitical commentator Sally Kohn pointed out in her TED talk on click-bait that because of online algorithms, we are now co-creating our content by our clicking behavior. As she said, \"We are the editors of the new media. Clicking is a public act.\" I would argue a moral one too.\n\nWe don't stop to think that with a click on click-bait, we are entering the online Coliseum. With every click, we make a choice, myself included. The more we saturate our culture with this kind of shaming, the more accepted it is, the more we will see behaviors like cyber-bullying, trolling and online harassment, and some kinds of hacking.\n\nWhy? Because they all have humiliation at their cores. This behavior is a symptom of the culture we've created.\n\nConsider a few prominent examples from the past year alone:\n\nSnapchat. Every second, there are 8,796 photos posted to Snapchat. The service claims its messages only have a lifespan of a few seconds. But a third-party app which Snapchatters used to extend the lifespan was hacked. One hundred thousand personal conversations, videos and videos were leaked online to have a lifespan of forever.\n\nA hundred thousands personal conversations, photos and videos leaked online to be publicly humiliated and be clicked.\nJennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked and private, personal nude photos were splattered across the Internet without their permission. One gossip website had over 5 million hits for just one article on this story.\nWhat about the Sony Pictures cyber-hacking? Of course the documents that received the most attention were the private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value, which meant maximum clicks and dollar signs.\n\nAaron Sorkin described it best: \"If you close your eyes, you can imagine the hackers sitting in a room, combing through the documents to find the ones that would draw the most blood. And in a room next door are American journalists doing the same thing. As demented and criminal as it is, at least the hackers are doing it for a cause. The press is doing it for a nickel.\"\n\nAnd most recently, Caitlyn Jenner. She spoke to Vanity Fair about a time this past year when she considered taking her own life. The impetus? She learned a gossip outlet planned to release information, private information about her transgender journey, information that at the time would have been shocking news to her family.\n\nHaving your narrative stolen can be that devastating. Fortunately, she garnered strength in the moment and made it through. The gossip outlet, on the other hand, they garnered clicks and dollars.\nChanging this behavior in our culture begins with evolving our beliefs. We've seen that to be true with racism, homophobia and plenty of other biases now and in the past. As we've changed beliefs about same-sex marriage, we've seen more people being offered equal freedom. Valuing sustainability led to more recycling.\n\nSo as far as our culture of humiliation goes, what we need is a cultural revolution. Public shaming as a blood sport must stop. It's time for an intervention on the Internet and in the culture.\nThe shift begins with something simple, but it's not easy. We need to return to a long-held value of compassion, compassion and empathy.\n\nOnline, we've got a compassion deficit, an empathy crisis.\nResearcher Brene Brown said, \"Shame cannot survive empathy.\"\nI've seen some very dark days in my life, and it was empathy and compassion from my family, friends, professionals and strangers that helped me get through. Even empathy from one person can make a difference.\n\nThe theory of minority influence proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici showed that there is power in small numbers when there's consistency over time. In the online world, we can foster minority influence by becoming up-standers.\n\nTo be an up-stander instead of bystander apathy means to stand up for someone else online or maybe report a bullying situation. Use a positive comment. Online media can tear us down, but it can also build us up.\n\nTrust me, compassionate comments help abate the negativity. I am, after all, on Twitter.\n\nWe can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations addressing some of these issues, like Bystander Revolution and the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which are both in the U.S. In the U.K., there's Anti-Bullying Pro and Project Rockit in Australia.\n\nWe talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression...\n\n(At this point in the speech, a stage tech's voice could be heard coming through the auditorium's loudspeakers, causing Lewinsky to pause.)\n\nAt least he wasn't saying something nasty about me. Although, I don't speak French.\n\n(Crowd laughs and applauds.)\n\nWe talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression, but we need to talk more about our responsibility to freedom of expression. We all want to be heard, but let's acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention and speaking up for attention.\n\nThe Internet is the superhighway for the id, but showing empathy to others online benefits us all with a better and safer world. We need to communicate online with compassion, consume news with compassion and click with compassion.\n\nJust imagine walking a mile in someone else's headline.\n\nIn the past year, the question I've been asked the most is, \"Why?\" Why now, why was I sticking my head above the parapet? The top-note answer was, and is, because it's time. Time to stop tiptoeing around my past, time to stop living a life of opprobrium and time to take back my narrative.\n\nIt's also not just about saving myself. Anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing: You can survive it.\n\nI know it's hard, and it may not be painless, quick or easy, but you can insist on a different ending to your story. Have compassion for yourself. We all deserve compassion and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world.\n\nThere's also a more personal and deeper answer that I wanted to share with all of you today, particularly because of your field and the way your influence permeates the culture.\n\nI'm sure you can imagine how much work on myself I've had to do in the past 17 years and how very kind, wise and patient the professionals with whom I've worked have been.\n\nSeveral years ago, during one such session, where I was desperately trying to make sense of how to move forward in my life, a familiar, iconic image came to mind: a traditionally destructive image, one that normally conjures death and inhumanity. One that represents a terrible time in history. I was shocked.\n\nNow, I want to apologize in advance if anybody finds this culturally insensitive. That's certainly not my intention. It was actually a very sacred moment for me.\n\nWhat I saw was that iconic image of the atomic bomb test from Bikini Atoll. The vast, looming mushroom cloud, spread out across the sky over the ocean, forefronted (sic) by the beach with swaying palm trees. Can you see it?\n\nBut this image wasn't exactly the same. It was being re-purposed. There was a twist. In my mind's eye, the image was tinted in green, the color associated with the heart chakra. And handwritten across the wide mushroom cloud was the word \"compassion.\"\nLet me explain to you what this meant to me personally, how I interpreted it.\n\nMy public history was an archetypal story, a story that had been around since the dawn of time. And in this story, I was cast as an incarnation of a modern-day archetype. And because of that, I became seared in the collective consciousness. Are you all still with me?\n\nSo I surmised, that as part of the collective consciousness, if people could find a modicum of compassion for what happened to me, rather like the mushroom cloud, compassion would radiate positively for others, other victims of shame and humiliation, other women and other people in society who'd been marginalized.\nCompassion can reduce the half life of shame and public humiliation.\n\nAnd if you're sitting there thinking I sound like a solipsistic, egomaniacal little miss crazy pants, I get it. I questioned my thinking when this happened too. But I realized that it actually didn't have to do with me personally but rather had to do with the role I found myself on in the public stage. It resonated as a truth for me and has been a guiding principle ever since.\n\nBuilding a more compassionate society is going to be a bilateral exercise between individuals and the brands that represent their aspirations, their values and their truths. People make brands. If people are compassionate, brands will be compassionate in return.\n\nWe can lead each other to a more compassionate, more empathic place. We can help change behavior. We can all learn from our mistakes and be more resilient. And we can, together, make a society where the sometimes distancing effect of technology doesn't remove our fundamental humanity.\n\nAll of the most vibrant, creative minds in the world are here and here this week. You are the creative engines that will drive forward our culture. Will you help me?\n\nAnd so, I end where I began. If you were a brand, what brand would you be?\n\nThank you.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/6817291", "artist_names": "Joe Simon", "full_title": "Music In My Bones by\u00a0Joe\u00a0Simon", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/17ce4c9df19c053b4822731bad2e9e2b.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/17ce4c9df19c053b4822731bad2e9e2b.720x720x1.jpg", "id": 6817291, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 6924593, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1621193958, "path": "/Joe-simon-music-in-my-bones-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Joe-simon-music-in-my-bones-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1975, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1975", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1975", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/17ce4c9df19c053b4822731bad2e9e2b.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/17ce4c9df19c053b4822731bad2e9e2b.720x720x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Music In My Bones", "title_with_featured": "Music In My Bones", "updated_by_human_at": 1658943079, "url": "https://genius.com/Joe-simon-music-in-my-bones-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/355224", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/df12a95fb0885312b4eef2dfb7cb826b.426x205x1.jpg", "id": 355224, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/41cb2e79c637078d21179128720f72b6.266x266x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Joe Simon", "slug": "Joe-simon", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Joe-simon"}, "artist": "Joe Simon", "lyrics": "Music In My Bones LyricsI want everybody to put your dancin' shoes on\nI want you to clap your hands right here\nI just want you to join in, and help me to sing a little bit\nThe music in my bones, and I can't sit down\nCome on y'all, come on and\n(Music in my bones, and I can't sit down)\nYeah, sing it one more time, if you don't mind\n(Music in my bones, and I can't sit down)\n\nOh, I'm trying so hard to make it to my seat\n(Music in my bones, and I can't sit down) ooh yeah\nBut my body's shaking all over, and I'm groovin' with the beat now\n(Music in my bones, and I can't sit down) yes I am\nI feel good, I really feel good, baby\nI like the groove, and I like the blues\nI like music, that puts me in a mood\nOh, excuse me while I do my thing, y'all\nCome on and... ooh yeah\n(Music in my bones, and I can't sit down)\nIf you think you can outdo me, just step into the ring now\n(Music in my bones, and I can't sit down) ooh yeah\n\nCome on, come on and do it, oh yeah\nThe baddest thing, come on and get on the line\nGet set, and let's go; come on and, come on and do it\nCome on and, ohh...

December 19: Ms. Lewinsky Is Subpoenaed\n\nOn Friday, December 19, 1997, sometime between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., Ms. Lewinsky was served with a subpoena at her Pentagon office.(796) The subpoena commanded her to appear for a deposition in Washington, D.C., at 9:30 a.m. on January 23, 1998.(797) The subpoena also required the production of certain documents and gifts. Among the items that Ms. Lewinsky was required to produce were \"each and every gift including, but not limited to, any and all dresses, accessories, and jewelry, and/or hat pins given to you by, or on behalf of, Defendant Clinton,\" as well as \"[e]very document constituting or containing communications between you and Defendant Clinton, including letters, cards, notes, memoranda, and all telephone records.\"(798)\n\n\t \t\n\t \t\n\nMs. Lewinsky testified that, after being served with the subpoena, she \"burst into tears,\" and then telephoned Mr. Jordan from a pay phone at the Pentagon.(799) Mr. Jordan confirmed Ms. Lewinsky's account; he said he tried to reassure Ms. Lewinsky: \"[C]ome and talk to me and I will see what I can do about finding you counsel.\"(800)\nAccording to records maintained by Mr. Jordan's law firm, Ms. Lewinsky arrived at his office at 4:47 p.m.(801) White House phone records show that, at 4:57 p.m., the President telephoned Mr. Jordan; the two men spoke from 5:01 p.m. to 5:05 p.m.(802) At 5:06 p.m., Mr. Jordan placed a two-minute call to a Washington, D.C., attorney named Francis Carter.(803)\n\nMs. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan gave somewhat different accounts of their meeting that day. According to Ms. Lewinsky, shortly after her arrival, Mr. Jordan received a phone call, and she stepped out of his office. A few minutes later, Ms. Lewinsky was invited back in, and Mr. Jordan called Mr. Carter.(804)\n\nMr. Jordan testified that he spoke to the President before Ms. Lewinsky ever entered his office.(805) He told the President: \"Monica Lewinsky called me up. She's upset. She's gotten a subpoena. She is coming to see me about this subpoena. I'm confident that she needs a lawyer, and I will try to get her a lawyer.\"(806) Mr. Jordan told the President that the lawyer he had in mind was Francis Carter.(807) According to Mr. Jordan, the President asked him: \"You think he's a good lawyer?\" Mr. Jordan responded that he was.(808) Mr. Jordan testified that informing the President of Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena \"was the purpose of [his] call.\"(809)\n\nAccording to Mr. Jordan, when Ms. Lewinsky entered his office, \"[H]er emotional state was obviously one of dishevelment and she was quite upset. She was crying. She was -- she was highly emotional, to say the least.\"(810) She showed him the subpoena as soon as she entered.(811)\n\nMs. Lewinsky also testified that she discussed the subpoena with Mr. Jordan.(812) She told him that she found the specific reference to a hat pin alarming -- how could the Jones's attorneys have known about it?(813) Mr. Jordan told her it was \"a standard subpoena.\"(814) When he indicated to Ms. Lewinsky that he would be seeing the President that night, Ms. Lewinsky told him \"to please make sure that he told the President\" about her subpoena.(815)\n\nAt some point, according to Mr. Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky asked him about the future of the Clintons' marriage.(816) Because Ms. Lewinsky seemed \"mesmerized\" by President Clinton,(817) he \"asked her directly had there been any sexual relationship between [her] and the President.\"(818) Mr. Jordan explained, \"You didn't have to be Einstein to know that that was a question that had to be asked by me at that particular time, because heretofore this discussion was about a job. The subpoena changed the circumstances.\"(819) Ms. Lewinsky said she had not had a sexual relationship with the President.(820)\n\nMs. Lewinsky testified, however, that at this time she assumed that Mr. Jordan knew \"with a wink and a nod that [she] was having a relationship with the President.\"(821) She therefore interpreted Mr. Jordan's questions as \"What are you going to say?\" rather than \"What are the [actual] answers . . .?\"(822) When the meeting ended, she \"asked [Mr. Jordan] if he would give the President a hug.\"(823)\n\nThat evening, Mr. Jordan visited the President at the White House. According to Mr. Jordan, the two met alone in the Residence and talked for about ten minutes.(824) He testified:\n\nI told him that Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed, came to me with a subpoena. I told him that I was concerned by her fascination, her being taken with him. I told him how emotional she was about having gotten the subpoena. I told him what she said to me about whether or not he was going to leave the First Lady at the end of the term.(825)\n\nMr. Jordan asked the President \"[t]he one question that I wanted answered.\"(826) That question was, \"Mr. President, have you had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky?\" The President told Mr. Jordan, \"No, never.\"(827)\n\nMr. Jordan told the President: \"I'm trying to help her get a job and I'm going to continue to do that. I'm going to get her counsel and I'm going to try to be helpful to her as much as I possibly can, both with the lawyer, and I've already done what I could about the job, and I think you ought to know that.\"(828) Mr. Jordan testified: \"He thanked me for telling him. Thanked me for my efforts to get her a job and thanked me for getting her a lawyer.\"(829)\n\nIn his grand jury testimony, the President recalled that he met with Mr. Jordan on December 19; however, he testified that his memory of that meeting was somewhat vague:\n\nI do not remember exactly what the nature of the conversation was. I do remember that I told him that there was no sexual relationship between me and Monica Lewinsky, which was true. And that -- then all I remember for the rest is that he said he had referred her to a lawyer, and I believe it was Mr. Carter.(830)\nAsked whether he recalled that Mr. Jordan told him that Ms. Lewinsky appeared fixated on him and hoped that he would leave Mrs. Clinton, the President testified: \"I recall him saying he thought that she was upset with -- somewhat fixated on me, that she acknowledged that she was not having a sexual relationship with me, and that she did not want to be [brought] into that Jones lawsuit.\"(831)\n\nB. December 22: Meeting with Vernon Jordan\n\n\t \t\n\t \t\n\nMr. Jordan arranged for Ms. Lewinsky to meet with attorney Francis Carter at 11:00 a.m. on Monday, December 22.(832) On that morning, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she called Mr. Jordan and asked to meet before they went to Mr. Carter's office.(833) She testified: \"I was a little concerned. I thought maybe [Mr. Jordan] didn't really understand . . . what it was that was happening here with me being subpoenaed and what this really meant.\"(834) She also wanted to find out whether he had in fact told the President of her subpoena. Mr. Jordan said that he had.(835) Ms. Lewinsky also told Mr. Jordan that she was worried that someone might have been eavesdropping on her telephone conversations with the President.(836) When Mr. Jordan asked why she thought that would be of concern, Ms. Lewinsky said, \"Well, we've had phone sex.\"(837)\n\nMs. Lewinsky testified that she brought some of her gifts from the President, showed them to Mr. Jordan, and implied that these items were not all of the gifts that the President had given her.(838) Mr. Jordan, in contrast, testified that Ms. Lewinsky never showed him any gifts from the President.(839)\n\nC. December 22: First Meeting with Francis Carter\n\nMr. Jordan drove Ms. Lewinsky to Mr. Carter's office.(840) There, he introduced Ms. Lewinsky to Mr. Carter, explaining that she needed not only a lawyer but a \"counselor.\"(841) Mr. Carter testified that, after the initial referral, he expected to have no further contact with Mr. Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky or her case.(842)\n\nMr. Carter and Ms. Lewinsky then met for approximately an hour.(843) She explained that she did not want to be drawn into the Jones case and would strongly prefer not to be deposed.(844) He said that he would try to persuade Paula Jones's attorneys not to depose her.(845) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she suggested filing an affidavit to avert a deposition.(846)\n\nAccording to Ms. Lewinsky, she asked Mr. Carter to get in touch with the President's personal attorney, Robert Bennett, just \"to let him know that I had been subpoenaed in this case.\"(847) She wanted to make clear that she was \"align[ing] [her]self with the President's side.\"(848) Mr. Carter testified that, while Ms. Lewinsky was in his office, he placed a call to Mr. Bennett to arrange a meeting.(849)\n\nOn the morning of Tuesday, December 23, Mr. Carter met for an hour with two of the President's personal attorneys, Mr. Bennett and Katherine Sexton.(850) The President's attorneys told Mr. Carter that other witnesses had filed motions to quash their subpoenas, and they offered legal research to support such a motion.(851)\n\nD. December 23: Clinton Denials to Paula Jones\n\nThroughout the sexual harassment case, Ms. Jones's attorneys attempted to obtain information about President Clinton's sexual relationships with any woman other than his wife. On December 11, 1997, the judge overseeing the Jones case, Susan Webber Wright, ruled that the President had to answer a written interrogatory naming every state and federal employee since 1986 with whom he had sexual relations or with whom he had proposed to have sexual relations. On December 23, 1997, the President answered the interrogatory: \"None.\"(852)\n\nE. December 28: Final Meeting with the President\nA day or two after Christmas, Ms. Lewinsky called Ms. Currie and told her that the President had mentioned that he had presents for her.(853) Ms. Currie called back and told her to come to the White House at 8:30 a.m. on Sunday, December 28.(854)\n\nThat morning, Ms. Lewinsky met with the President in the Oval Office. WAVES records reflect that the visit was requested by Ms. Currie and that Ms. Lewinsky entered the White House at 8:16 a.m.(855)\n\nAfter she arrived at the Oval Office, she, the President, and Ms. Currie played with Buddy, the President's dog, and chatted. Then, the President took her to the study and gave her several Christmas presents: a marble bear's head, a Rockettes blanket, a Black Dog stuffed animal, a small box of chocolates, a pair of joke sunglasses, and a pin with a New York skyline on it.(856)\n\nMs. Lewinsky testified that, during this visit, she and the President had a \"passionate\" and \"physically intimate\" kiss.(857)\n\nMs. Lewinsky and the President also talked about the Jones case.(858) In Ms. Lewinsky's account, she asked the President \"how he thought [she] got put on the witness list.\"(859) He speculated that Linda Tripp or one of the uniformed Secret Service officers had told the Jones attorneys about her.(860) When Ms. Lewinsky mentioned her anxiety about the subpoena's reference to a hat pin, he said \"that sort of bothered [him], too.\"(861) He asked whether she had told anyone about the hat pin, and she assured him that she had not.(862)\n\nAt some point in the conversation, Ms. Lewinsky told the President, \"[M]aybe I should put the gifts away outside my house somewhere or give them to someone, maybe Betty.\"(863) Ms. Lewinsky recalled that the President responded either \"I don't know\" or \"Let me think about that.\"(864)\n\nWhen Ms. Lewinsky was asked whether she thought it odd for the President to give her gifts under the circumstances (with a subpoena requiring the production of all his gifts), she testified that she did not think of it at the time, but she did note some hesitancy on the President's part:\n\n[H]e had hesitated very briefly right before I left that day in kind of packaging . . . all my stuff back up . . . I don't think he said anything that indicated this to me, but I thought to myself, \"I wonder if he's thinking he shouldn't give these to me to take out.\" But he did.(865)\n\nWhen asked in the Jones deposition about his last meeting with Ms. Lewinsky, the President remembered only that she stopped by \"[p]robably sometime before Christmas\" and he \"stuck [his] head out [of the office], said hello to her.\"(866) The deposition occurred three weeks after this December 28 meeting with Ms. Lewinsky.\n\nIn the grand jury, the President acknowledged \"talking with Ms. Lewinsky about her testimony, or about the prospect that she might have to give testimony. And she, she talked to me about that.\"(867) He maintained, however, that they did not discuss Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena: \"[S]he was upset. She -- well, she -- we -- she didn't -- we didn't talk about a subpoena. But she was upset.\"(868) In the President's recollection, Ms. Lewinsky said she knew nothing about sexual harassment; why did she have to testify? According to the President, \"I explained to her that it was a political lawsuit. They wanted to get whatever they could under oath that was damaging to me.\"(869)\n\nMs. Lewinsky's friend, Catherine Allday Davis, testified about a conversation with Ms. Lewinsky on January 3, 1998. Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Davis that she had met with the President and discussed the Jones case a few days earlier. Ms. Davis testified that Ms. Lewinsky and the President had \"noted [that] there was no evidence\" of their relationship.(870)\n\nE. December 28: Concealment of Gifts\n\nIn the afternoon of December 28, a few hours after Ms. Lewinsky's White House visit, Ms. Currie drove to Ms. Lewinsky's Watergate apartment and collected a box containing the President's gifts. Ms. Currie then took the box home and hid it under her bed. Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie, and the President were all questioned as to why Ms. Currie retrieved the box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky.\n\nAccording to Ms. Lewinsky, the transfer originated in a phone call from Ms. Currie that afternoon. Ms. Lewinsky testified that Ms. Currie said, \"I understand you have something to give me,\" or, \"The President said you have something to give me.\"(871) Ms. Lewinsky understood that Ms. Currie was alluding to the gifts.(872) Ms. Currie said that she would stop by Ms. Lewinsky's apartment and pick up the items.(873) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she put many, but not all, of her gifts from the President into a box. Ms. Currie drove by her apartment and picked it up.(874)\n\nMs. Lewinsky was concerned because the gifts were under subpoena; she did not throw them away, however, because \"they meant a lot to [her].\"(875) The reason she gave the gifts to Ms. Currie, and not to one of her friends or her mother, was \"a little bit of an assurance to the President . . . that everything was okay.\"(876) She felt that, because the gifts were with Ms. Currie, they were within the President's control: \"Not that [the gifts] were going to be in his possession, but that he would understand whatever it was I gave to Betty and that that might make him feel a little bit better.\"(877)\n\nMs. Lewinsky's account of the events of December 28 in her sworn statement of February 1, 1998, corroborates her later grand jury testimony:\n\n\"Ms. L . . . asked if she should put away (outside her home) the gifts he had given her or, maybe, give them to someone else. Ms. Currie called Ms. L later that afternoon as said that the Pres. had told her Ms. L. wanted her to hold onto something for her. Ms. L boxed up most of the gifts she had received and gave them to Ms. Currie. It is unknown if Ms. Currie knew the contents of the box.\"(878)\n\nMs. Currie's testimony was somewhat at odds with Ms. Lewinsky's. Though her overall recollection was hazy, Ms. Currie believed that Ms. Lewinsky had called her and raised the idea of the gifts transfer.(879) Ms. Currie was asked about the President's involvement in the transfer:\n\nQ:\tAnd did the President know you were holding these things for Monica?\n\nBC:\tI don't know. I don't know.\n\nQ:\tDidn't he say to you that Monica had something for you to hold?\n\nBC:\tI don't remember that. I don't.\n\nQ:\tDid you ever talk to the President and tell him you had this box from Monica?\n\nBC:\tI don't remember that either.\n\nQ:\tDo you think it happened, though?\n\nBC:\tI don't know. I don't know.(880)\n\nWhen asked whether a statement by Ms. Lewinsky indicating that Ms. Currie had in fact spoken to the President about the gift transfer would be false, Ms. Currie replied: \"Then she may remember better than I. I don't remember.\"(881)\n\nAccording to Ms. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky said that she was uncomfortable retaining the gifts herself because \"people were asking questions\" about them.(882) Ms. Currie said she drove to Ms. Lewinsky's residence after work, collected the box, brought it home, and put it under her bed.(883) Written on the top of the box were the words \"Please do not throw away!!!\"(884) Ms. Currie testified that she knew that the box contained gifts from the President.(885)\n\nFor his part, the President testified that he never asked Ms. Currie to collect a box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky.(886) He said that he had no knowledge that Ms. Currie had held those items \"until that was made public.\"(887)\n\nThe President testified that he has no distinct recollection of discussing the gifts with Ms. Lewinsky on December 28: \"[M]y memory is that on some day in December, and I'm sorry I don't remember when it was, she said, well, what if they ask me about the gifts you have given me. And I said, well, if you get a request to produce those, you have to give them whatever you have.\"(888)\n\nD. December 31: Breakfast with Vernon Jordan\n\nMs. Lewinsky testified that in late December 1997 she realized that she needed to \"come up with some sort of strategy as to [what to do] if Linda Tripp\" divulged what she knew.(889) On December 30, Ms. Lewinsky telephoned Mr. Jordan's office and conveyed either directly to him or through one of his secretaries that she was concernedabout the Jones case.(890)\n\nThe following day, Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan had breakfast together at the Park Hyatt Hotel.(891) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she told Mr. Jordan that a friend of hers, Linda Tripp, was involved in the Jones case. She told Mr. Jordan: \"I used to trust [Ms. Tripp], but I didn't trust her any more.\"(892) Ms. Lewinsky said that Ms. Tripp might have seen some notes in her apartment. Mr. Jordan asked: \"Notes from the President to you?\" Ms. Lewinsky responded: \"No, notes from me to the President.\" According to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan said: \"Go home and make sure they're not there.\" Ms. Lewinsky testified that she understood that Mr. Jordan was advising her to \"throw . . . away\" any copies or drafts of notes that she had sent to the President.(893)\n\nAfter breakfast, Mr. Jordan gave Ms. Lewinsky a ride back to his office.(894) When Ms. Lewinsky returned home to her apartment that day, she discarded approximately 50 draft notes to the President.(895)\n\nE. January 4: The Final Gift\n\n\nOn Sunday, January 4, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky called Ms. Currie at home and told her that she wanted to drop off a gift for the President.(896) Ms. Currie invited Ms. Lewinsky to her home, and Ms. Lewinsky gave her the package.(897) The package contained a book entitled The Presidents of the United States and a love note inspired by the movie Titanic.(898)Embed"},

For a little extra on the side, we can arrange for a slightly more intimate encounter, wink wink...\nFor a tuppence, just a tuppence, a handful of pills to feed the inmates!\nWe've got pills for depression, obsession, aggression, possession, indiscretion\u2013there's a bloody pill for everything nowadays!\n\n[GENTLEMAN 3]\nHow big is a lady's brain?\n\n[HOST]\nIt's really very, very small\nA simple thought is quite a strain\n\n[WOMAN]\nThis seems just a bit inhumane\n\n[HOST]\nThat's just a simple little shock\nIt doesn't cause her any pain\nYou see, they're really more like animals than people\nWhich has been proven haven't any souls at all\nThe only bits that aren't inferior are bosom and posterior\nAnd these are only useful in a seedy music hall\n\nThey won't bite\nWell, they might\nI say, this one does look hungry tonight\nSo get your picture with an inmate\nBut be sure she's locked up tight\nThey're practically wild, sir\nProtect your child, sir\n\nThey don't recall the taste of freedom\nThey're just happy if we feed them\nSo point and laugh, it isn't bad\nThey oughtn't mind because they're mad\nIf you haven't got a dime, toss us your pearls\n\n[HOST & INMATES]\nYou're welcome to enjoy our girls, crazy girls\nIf you're willing to be thrilled, this is a hell of a ride\nThose girls, crazy girls\nWe're hot!

They will constitute the panel today\nOn October 19 of last year the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion reversing an earlier judgment f the district court in Los Angeles in the case of Universal City Studios v. Sony Corporation of America\n\nThe issue in the case was whether recording off the of copyrighted television programing by private individuals without the permission of the copyright owner constituted an infringement under the Federal copyright law. The district court had held that there was no such copyright infringement in such a case\n\nThe court of appeals found otherwise and remanded the matter to the lower court for purposes of developing appropriate remedies for the copyright owners.

Audio recording was not an issue in the Sony case, with both the district court and the court of appeals having concluded that control of off-air taping was not included among those rights granted copyright owners under the 1971 law, which first granted copyright protection to the sound recording industry\n\nThis afternoon the subcommittee will begin 3 days of hearings on the issues raised in the case of Universal v. Sony and related legislation\n\nWe have chosen Los Angeles as the site of the hearings because it is both the center of many of the industries involved and also because it is the site of the litigation which gave rise to the issue itself. We will announce at a later date further hearings in Washington for the purpose of receiving testimony from governmental witnesses\n\nThis particular set of hearings will be divided into three segments of roughly 2 hours each. During each segment we will hear from witnesses representing a coalition of interests with roughly similar views on the issues\n\nThis afternoon we will hear from those generally who approve of the ninth circuit decision, representatives of video program producers and allied groups. Tomorrow morning we will hear from those generally opposed to the decision. On Wednesday morning we will hear from witnesses who support legislation extending copyright protection in situations involving the taping of audio works\n\n[The statement follows:]\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT W. KASTENMEIER\nCHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON COURTS, CIVIL LIBERTIES\nAND THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE\n\nOn October 19 of last year the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion reversing an earlier judgment of the District Court here in Los Angeles in the case of Universal City Studios v. Sony Corporation of America\n\nThe issue in the case was whether recording off the air of copyrighted television programming by private individuals without permission of the copyright owner constituted an infringement under the Federal Copyright Law. The District Court had held that there was no copyright infringement in such a case. The Court of Appeals found otherwise and remanded the matter to the lower court for the purpose of developing appropriate remedies for copyright owners. Meanwhile, the defendents have requested the Supreme Court to review the case and further judicial proceedings at the trial court level have been suspended pending the high court's decision\n\nWithin 24 hours of the Appeals Court's action bills were introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate which would reverse the decision\n\nThe immediate and widespread interest in the Sony case is unprecedented in the history of copyright litigation. Perhaps one reason this issue has generated so much interest lies in the fact that video cassette recorders constitute the most significant new development in the entertainment industry since the introduction of television itself, with over 3.2 million of the machines having been sold since 1975. And the Ninth Circuit decision has raised the spectre of making each and every use of these machines to date a copyright infringement. Theoretically, at least, the Court of Appeals decision, if upheld, could subject millions of private citizens to damages for copyright infringement and subject the manufacturers and retailers of the recorders to a financial liability exceeding their entire net worth\n\nRecognizing the serious implications of the case for business and the public, the bills which have been introduced are of two types -- legislation offered by Congressmen Foley, Duncan and Parris, would specifically except all private, noncommercial video taping from liability for copyright infringement, while legislation introduced by Congressman Don Edwards and others would grant users of video cassette recorders a compulsory license with royalties to be paid to copyright owners from the sale of machines and blank tapes\n\nIn addition, Congressman Edwards would provide similar treatment for audio recording equipment. Audio recording was not an issue in the Sony case with the District Court and Court of Appeals having concluded that control over off air taping was not included among those rights granted copyright owners under the 1971 law which first granted copyright protection to the sound recording industry\n\nThis morning the subcommittee will begin three days of hearings on the issues raised in the case of Universal v.

Tomorrow morning we will hear from those generally opposed to the decision. On Wednesday morning we will hear from witnesses who support legislation extending copyright protection in situations involving the taping of audio works\n\nBefore calling on our first witness I would like to express, on behalf of the subcommittee, our gratitude to U.C.L.A. Law School and in particular Professor Charles Firestone and Mr. Ted Holbert, Ms. Doris Davis and Ms. Margaret Kiever of the Law School staff for their assistance in the arrangements for the hearing\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Before calling on our first witness, I would like to express on behalf of the subcommittee our gratitude to UCLA, to the UCLA Law School, and particularly Prof. Charles Firestone, Ted Hobert, Ms. Doris Davis, and Ms. Margaret Kiever of the law school staff for their assistance in the arran ements for this hearing\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. I don't have a statement, Mr. Chairman\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. I don't have a statement, Mr. Chairman\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. If not, then the Chair will be very pleased to call our first witness and he may handle his time or yield to other witnesses as he sees fit, Mr. Jack Valenti\n\nMr. Valenti, do I understand that Mr. Eastwood will be the first witness?\n\nMr. VALENTI. No, I will speak first\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Valenti\nTESTIMONY OF JACK VALENTI, PRESIDENT, MOTION PICTURE\nASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, INC\n\nMr. VALENTI. Mr. Chairman and ladies and gentlemen of the committee, I shall testify first and then following me will be Mr Clint Eastwood, actor/producer/ director; Mr. Jay Eliasberg, former vice president and director of research at the Columbia Broadcasting System; Richard Orear, president of the National Association of Theatre Owners; Mr. Gene Allen, vice president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Operators of the United States and Canada, commonly known in this town as the \"IA\"; Judy Taylor, president of the Directors Guild of America; Wayne Oliver, executive secretary of AFTRA, which is the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and, finally, Mr. Jack Copeland, who is the chairman, Copyright Committee, Training Media Distributors Association\n\nI am going to stand, if you don't mind, Mr. Chairman, cause I have what is known as \"visual aids.\" I know they are visual; whether they are aids or not is something you will have to determine later on\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. And whether they are copyrighted or not\n\nMr. VALENTI. I am merely coming to start off by talking about the American film and television industry, not as an economic enterprise, but as a great national asset to this country, to the U.S. Treasury and the strength of the American dollar. And I am not just talking on behalf of people whose names are household words, like Clint Eastwood and some of his small band of peers. I am speaking on behalf, as he is, as he will no doubt tell you on behalf of hundreds of thousands of men and women who without public knowledge or recognition, who are not besieged by fans, but who are artisans, craftsmen, carpenters, bricklayers, all kinds of people, who work in this industry, not only in this State but in the 50 States where American films are shot on location. And they deserve no less, Mr. Chairman, than the concern of the Congress for the preservation of their industry\n\nBut more than that, which I think is paramount to the national interest, the preservation of a huge trade asset. American films and television dominate the screens of the world and that just didn't happen. It happened because of the quality and caliber and the imagination and the way people construct fragile imaginings that we call the American film\n\nBut now we are facing a very new and a very troubling assault on our fiscal security, on our very economic life and we are facing it from a thing called the video cassette recorder and its necessary companion called the blank tape. And it is like a great tidal wave just off the shore. This video cassette recorder and the blank tape threaten profoundly the life-sustaining protection, I guess you would call it, on which copyright owners depend, on which film people depend, on which television people depend and it is called copyright\n\nNow, my first card, Mr. Chairman, deals with what I consider to be one of the essential elements that you cannot ignore and, indeed, you must nourish. The U.S. film -- and I will read this -- \"The U.S. film and television production industry is a huge and valuable American asset.\" In 1981, it returned to this country almost $1 billion in surplus balance of trade. And I might add, Mr. Chairman, it is the single one American-made product that the Japanese, skilled beyond all comparison in their conquest of world trade, are unable to duplicate or to displace or to compete with or to clone. And I might add that this important asset today is in jeopardy. Why?\n\nBecause unless the Congress recognizes the rights of creative property owners as owners of private property, that this property that we exhibit in theaters, once it leaves the post-theatrical markets, it is going to be so eroded in value by the use of these unlicensed machines, that the whole valuable asset is going to be blighted. In the opinion of many of the people in this room and outside of this room, blighted, beyond all recognition. It is a piece of sardonic irony that this asset, which unlike steel or silicon chips or motor cars or electronics of all kinds -- a piece of sardonic irony that while the Japanese are unable to duplicate the American films by a flank assault, they can destroy it by this video cassette recorder\n\nAnd that brings me, if I had to summarize what this is all about -- one lady from a network said would you want to summarize -- well, I will summarize it for you. The single centralizing principle on which this whole rostrum rests is this: If you cannot own, if what you own cannot be protected, you don't own anything and that goes for Clint Eastwood or the most obscure person in this industry or anybody in any industry. If what you own cannot be protected, you own nothing\n\nNow, that is the dominating theme of this debate an you are going to hear a lot of other stuff and we will have to bring it in, but it is like tracings on dry leaves in the wind. It is irrelevant to this essential dominating theme, which pervades this entire debate\n\nNow, I don't have to tell anybody in politics -- I have spent most of my adult life in politics and you learn one thing. Nothing of value is free. It is very easy, Mr. Chairman, to convince people that it is in their best interest to give away somebody else's property for nothing, but even the most guileless among us know that this is a cave of illusion where commonsense is lured and then quietly strangled. That is what it is all about\n\nNow, these machines are advertised for one purpose in life. Their only single mission, their primary mission is to copy coyrighted material that belongs to other people. I don't have to go into it. The ads are here. Here is Sony that tells you that you can record one channel while watching another. You can program to record a variety of shows on four different channels for up to 14 days in advance if you like\n\nNow, Mr. Chairman, how many people would want to buy these machines if you said you couldn't use any copyrighted material on it. The machine would be useless and this is what the Ninth Circuit said. They advertise their machine blatantly and deliberately saying the way to enjoy this machine is to copy somebody else's copyrighted programs\n\nNow, in my judgment the Ninth Circuit Court decision -- I am not a lawyer; I beg to ask the forgiveness of all of you in the UCLA Law School. If I was smart enough maybe I would have been a lawyer and then I would feel more comfortable about presenting this case. But, at least to my untutored eye, the Ninth Circuit Court decision was lucid, unambiguous, and consistent. The logic was clear and it said when you use copyrighted material on a video cassette recorder, it is an infringement of copyright\n\nNow, again, in politics when confronting difficult issues, we are often constrained to observe how few are the alternatives available to us and how meager the opportunities to enlarge them. However, we think that we have an answer that is founded in good sense: and more than that, coincides with the Constitution's command. This rational answer I will call it, H.R. 5705, the Edwards bill. It exempts home taping from copyright infringement. That is first off, so people in the privacy of their home can tape anything that they choose, but it links to that the indispensable buckling that must take place and that is, it establishes a copyright royalty fee, which would be paid by the manufacturers of the video cassette recorder and by the manufacturers of blank tapes\n\nNow, again, citing the fact that 100 percent of these machines are made in Japan and 85 percent of all of the blank tapes are made in Japan, and I say that, Mr. Chairman, because I. have to keep coming back to this trade asset because if the Congress doesn't act, then what we are going to be doing is exporting our jobs out of this country to another country, beyond the real of our own shore\n\nNow, I believe that -- I believe, I do believe it and I think I do have some confirmatory peer in this room -- they believe that the Home Recording Act, the Edwards bill is congenial to the spirit of fair play. It is a compromise, Mr. Chairman, as all of us in politics understand is the litmus paper from which everything must come, compromise, an intelligent compromise. But more than that, it is thoroughly hospitable to the Constitution itself and I simply cannot -- I cannot -- emphasize that fact too firmly. And I say that because the Edwards bill obeys the Constitution. Why? Because the fifth amendment forbids the taking of private property without just compensation\n\nNow, I have before me a memorandum of law prepared by Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at the Harvard Law School, known as the UCLA Law School of the East, and this 49-page memorandum I must say, I think, is a devastatingly apt memorandum in which Professor Tribe summarizes -- and I am making this available to the committee as part of the record -- in which he says that if the Congress passed the Foley, Parris, or Duncan bills, which merely exempt home taping from copyright infringement without linking to it this copyright royalty fee, you would be insulting the Constitution. It would be unconstitutional\n\nThe last sentence of the fifth amendment, and I urge all ofyou law students to read it again, because the fifth amendment is not merely that you can't testify to incriminate yourself. The last sentence says you cannot take anybody's private property, not even the Government, without giving them just compensation for it. It is that \"takings\" clause that is the heart and muscle of this memorandum by Professor Tribe\n\nNow, let me tell you something about how this business works. My God, Clint Eastwood and Terry Semple, who is the head of Warner Bros., who is in this room, can speak to this with for more accuracy and understanding than I, but I think it is important to a brief summary\n\nThe permission of the copyright owner is required for the use of their programs in all markets. Now, I those markets include theaters, cable, pay cable, pay television, prerecorded cassettes, network television, syndicated television, video discs. Every one of those markets is going to be competing for Mr. Eastwood's new film \"Firefox.\" They are going to license that film at a negotiated price\n\nNow, we cannot live in a marketplace, Mr. Chairman -- you simply cannot live in a marketplace, where there is one unleashed animal in that marketplace, unlicensed. It would no longer be a marketplace; it would be a kind of a jungle, where this one unlicensed instrument is capable of devouring all that people had invested in and labored over and brought forth as a film or a television program, and, in short, laying waste to the orderly distribution of this product\n\nNow, I don't have to tell you, Mr. Chairman -- God, we have sweated blood together on the Cable Copyright Act -- but this subcommittee back in 1976 recognized the inequity of a new technology being unlicensed, cable television. You didn't want cable television fouling the airwaves and like Pac Man, gulping do everything in sight, and denying the copyright owner -- I say that as a throwaway line to Warner Bros. and Atari -- not only de copyright owner his rights, but stripping his other markets of their profit potential\n\nNow what did you do, Mr. Chairman? You and your colleagues saw the need for licensing and unlicensed medium. So, you came firmly down on the side of the principle that what belonged to others could not be used by somebody else to make a profit without even negotiating with the Eastwoods of the world or the copyright owners or under a compulsory license, paying a copyright fee\n\nAnd I might add, to go back to those 1976 debates, you also paid tribute to the constitutional principle that it was the use, underscore use, of copyrighted material that was deeply relevant to what you were doing. Now, how did you express that? You said that even cable systems which did not carry distant signals, Mr. Chairman, would have to pay a copyright royalty fee, point 645, 1 believe, if I am correct\n\nA VOICE. It is point 675\n\nMr. VALENTI. I have my man prompting me, point 675 of the gross revenues of a cable system for the use, for the privilege of using copyrighted material. So, what we are asking has nothing to do with shattering precedent. It doesn't collide with fair play at all. All we ask is this principle that you used in cable copyright be linked to the video cassette recorder and its control, the blank tape. I hope I am not moving too fast for this audience\n\nNow, let me tell you something about the high-risk business that we are in. This may be one of the most precarious business enterprises which a man or a woman can enter. Movie making is a high-risk business. Let me cite you some examples. The average film costs $20 million. That includes negative costs, advertising, promotion, prints, distribution costs -- $20 million\n\nMr. Eastwood might want to talk about the cost of his current film. Eight out of ten films -- now, listen. These two statistics I am going to give you are really the nerve center of the statistical summary that you will have. Eight out of ten films do not retrieve their investment from theatrical exhibition\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Is there any water over there?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Six out of ten films -- Mr. Railsback, I am going to tell you, when people think about that, they don't ask for water, they ask for brandy\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. That is what we really have in there\n\nMr. VALENTI. And 6 out of 10 films do not retrieve their total investment period. Now, what are you going to do right on top of that? There is going to be a VCR avalanche. Exports of VCR's from Japan totaled 2.57 million units in 1981. No. 2, the United States is the biggest market. No. 3, February 1982, which is the latest data, shows the imports to the United States are up 57 percent over 1981. This is more than a tidal wave. It is more than an avalanche. It is here\n\nNow, that is where the problem is. You take the high risk, which means we must go by the aftermarkets to recoup our investments. If those aftermarkets are decimated, shrunken, collapsed because of what I am going to be explaining to you in a minute, because of the fact that the VCR is stripping those things clean, those markets clean of our profit potential, you are going to have devastation in this marketplace\n\nNow, is this all? Is it going to get any bigger? Well, I assure you it is. Here is the weekly Variety, Wednesday, March 10. Head1ine, \"Sony Sees $400 Billion Global Electronics Business by the Decade's End,\" $400 billion by the decade's end. In 1981, Mr. Chairman, this United States had a $5.3 billion trade deficit with Japan on electronic equipment alone. We are going to bleed and bleed and hemorrhage, unless this Congress at least protects one industry that is able to retrieve a surplus balance of trade and whose total future depends on its protection from the savagery and the ravages of this machine\n\nNow, the question comes, well, all right, what is wrong with the VCR. One of the Japanese lobbyists, Mr. Ferris, has said that the VCR -- well, if I am saying something wrong, forgive me. I don't know. He certainly is not MGM's lobbyist. That is for sure. He has said that the VCR is the greatest friend that the American film producer ever had\n\nI say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone\n\nThe VCR avalanche, I told you about that. Now, what about the VCR owners. Now, from here on out, Mr. Chairman, I am going to be speaking about a survey done by the Media Statistics Inc., which is a prestigious firm out of Silver Spring, Md. We, meaning the MPAA, did not commission this survey. We bought it after it was done when we heard about it. So, this was not a case -- we have commissioned a lot of things, but this is not one of them\n\nNow, I want to tell you about it because I think it is absolutely fascinating. This survey was taken in October 1981. It is the newest and freshest data available. Here is what it says. Median income of a VCR owner is between $35,000 and $50,000 a year. Not a lot of what we call today the truly needy are buying these machines. One-third of all the owners have incomes of more than $50,000. Now, here is the next one: 87 percent, 86.8 percent of all these owners erase or skip commercials. I have here, Mr. Chairman, if you are not aware of how this works -- this is Panasonic. This is a little remote control device that you use on machines. It has on here channel, rewind, stop, fast forward, pause, fast advance, slow, up, down, and visual search, either going left or right\n\nNow, let me tell you what Sony says about this thing. These are not my words. They are right straight from McCann Erickson, whom you will hear from tomorrow, who is the advertising agency for Sony and here is what they say. They advertise a variable beta scan feature that lets you adjust the speed at which you can view the tape from 5 times up to 20 times the normal speed\n\nNow, what does that mean, Mr. Chairman? It means that when you are playing back a recording, which you made 2 days or whenever -- you are playing it back. You are sitting in your home in your easy chair and here comes the commercial and it is right in the middle of a Clint Eastwood film and you don't want to be interrupted. So, what do you do? You pop this beta scan and a 1-minute commercial disappears in 2 seconds\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Is that all bad?\n\nMr. VALENTI. If you are watching a Clint Eastwood film it is the most cheerful thing you can do. However, if you are an advertiser who has paid $280,000 a minute to advertise, he feels a very large pain in his stomach as well as in his checkbook because it destroys the reason for free television, the erasure, the blotting out, the fast forwarding, the visual searching, the variable beta scans. the technology is there and I am one who has a belief that before the next few years the Japanese will have built into their machines an automatic situation that kills the commercial\n\nBeing advertised today in all the video magazines, and if any of you take video magazines, here is a marvelous little device called the Killer. It eliminates those black and white commercials. You put the Killer onto your Sony and it automatically takes out the commercial. You don't like the Killer, try the editor. The editor will do the same thing. It will wipe out commercials\n\nThe technology is there in my judgment, in the next several years, where an integral part of the machine will be automatic Killer. But you don't need that now as long as you have this. Indeed, when my son is taping for his permanent collection, he sits there and pauses his machine and when he is finished with it, he has a marvelous Clint Eastwood movie and there is no sign of a commercial. It is a brand new movie and he can put three of those on one 6-hour tape\n\nNow, the average --\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. May I interrupt, Jack, on that point?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Yes\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. And it is a point that just occurs to me. Actually, the advertiser doesn't pay for a taped replay of any program of that sort. He pays only for a live telecast, where his commercial appears and no matter how it is deferred, he doesn't pay for the deferral because that person wasn't there watching it the first time, presumably it is missed for commercial --\n\nMr. VALENTI. Mr. Chairman, I am going to defer that question because I have at this table Mr. Eliasberg, for 34 years a practitioner and a student of research in what Nielson and Arbitron present to networks and advisers, what they pay for and what they don't pay for. And rather than me, race over, take time, may I defer the question to Mr. Eliasberg\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. We will defer that question\n\nMr. VALENTI. And he will be able to handle that for you even much better than I will\n\nBut at any rate, that is a very relevant point that you make and it will bring it out, what the problem is and you will see that as you get into the future, this becomes a devastating problem for both advertisers and producers, who will get less for their programs on the air and that is what I am talking about. When less revenues are available to the networks and less revenues are available then to the producer -- Mr. Ferris and his people will tell you, oh, the marketplace will adjust, as if some tooth fairy hovers over the place and says whenever you lose here, we will be glad to pay for it. Nobody pays for value they don't receive and that is an axiom of the business marketplace\n\nThe average number of cassettes per household -- this is fascinating -- Mrs. Schroeder, was 27.7, 28 cassettes. Now, if you are just time shifting, all you are doing is you are away from home and you are taping something and you come back and you watch the commercial, then you time shift, you don't need 28 cassettes. You need one cassette or at the most two. Why do you have 28? Why? Because of the next line. Seventy-five percent have a permanent collection. My own home, we do it in our on home. I know about that. Anybody that has a VCR, talk to them, and I ask you to use your own commonsense, Mr. Chairman, Mrs. Schroeder, Mr. Railsback, just think of you as human beings. If you had the power to sit on a playback of a recording and you could wipe out the commercials or not wipe out the commercials, what would you do? You would do exactly what you said, sir. That is terrific. Of course. We all do it\n\nBut when you do it, you strip away the reason for free television. Now, let me --\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Jack, let me ask you. Do you consider yourself and your family infringers when you engage in that practice?\n\nMr. VALENTI. I consider myself and my family believing what the plaintiffs in this lawsuit said and they said publicly, they have said it to the press, they have said it to the lawyers, they have said it to the courts. They do not intend to file any actions against homeowners now or in the future. I mean, that is obvious and they have said that publicly, Mr. Chairman, so I believe them. As far as I am concerned, I am going to continue taping because the plaintiffs have said they aren't going to do anything to me. I am not committing any crime. They know that\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. That wasn't my question\n\nMr. VALENTI. Do I consider myself an infringer?\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. When you engage in such practice\n\nMr. VALENTI. Yes, sir, I do. I am taking somebody else's copyrighted material without their consent and I know damn well I am infringing. But as far as court action or anything else, I am safe. First, it is not a criminal act. Again, the opposition would tell you video, police, and criminals. They show an astonishing lack of the copyright law. They know good and well that that is not a criminal infringement unless you do it for profit. But on the other hand the plaintiffs have said they are moving against anybody in the homes. There is no problem, but 1 know and everybody else knows they are infringing\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Could I ask a couple of questions? Your figures are very different from the district court in the Betamax case. I am wondering if the 27.7 is that acquired over a period of time. That is not a yearly acquisition?\n\nMr. VALENTI. What was the date of the court case? 1978. That is 4 years ago. They were using data that was gleaned in 1977\n\nIn those days, first, there was only about an hour's recording time on a cassette. Nobody could really collect cassettes because you couldn't record long enough. Soon, they got up to 2 hours, 3 hours. Now, they are up to 6 hours. They are going to be up to 24 hours. Pretty soon, they will have a cassette that will record all year long, I suppose. But it is because of the time gap etween the court case and today\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. I know, but I was really asking about the average cassettes for a household. Is that acquired over a period of time?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Yes, sir, it is. It is acquired over a period of time because you are making collections. You are making recordings that you are keeping. Otherwise, you wouldn't need but one or two cassettes. It is because of permanent collections or you are holding them\n\nNow, I do want to go over an interesting study -- and Mr. Eliasberg is going to talk a little about this -- because, example, Mediastat also found out the following: They did additional work in diaries and found out that of the total number of recordings in minutes 49.7 percent of all the minutes recorded wer not played back within 6 days. And all the movies recorded, 100 ercent, 59.3 percent of all the movies were not played back within days. That is a very vital point, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Eliasberg is going to touch on this because there is one thing you cannot measure. You cannot measure playback. This will also be part of the record that we will present\n\nBut I want to tell you what Mediastat is saying here because, I think, it is relevant to what we are talking about. The Mediastat's analyst says that 67 percent of the VCR owners own no prerecorded cassettes and 72 percent plan to buy one in the coming year and 48 percent have never rented a prerecorded cassette. The major source of programing material is home recording, which thus preempts prerecorded tapes and their revenue. Consider that for a moment, which this survey is bringing out\n\nAs one VCR owner wrote in his diary, why buy prerecorded movies? You can record the same thing from a premium pay channel, home box office movie channel show time, much cheaper. There is also less need for VCR pay TV people, Mr. Orear of the Theater Owners Association, to go out to the movies. Hence, in economic terms, people are deriving value, benefit, utility from the ownership of a home taped copy of a video film production while there is currently no equivalent benefit payment for the producers in the economic exchange\n\nMovies are the single most recorded program type accounting for approximately 30 percent of all the recorded minutes\n\nNow, what I am about to read you now boggles my mind and it is going to boggle the mind of everybody in the movie and television business in this city. If 56 of the 93 movies recordings made by the 250 households during the first 3 days of a diary week -- just 56 of those movies are saved for the shelf and for additional playback -- then the number of movies collected in a year by the Nation's 2.4 million VCR households, only 2.4 million, the number of movies collected would be 6,537,216. At a prerecorded purchase of $50, they would have a retail value of $3.2 billion\n\nMr. Chairman, things like that could make a grown men cry\n\nNow, let me say a word about the portion of the Edwards amendment that does away with the first-sale doctrine. Just devote a little time to that\n\nWhat happens today, Mr. Chairman, is a very unstabilized marketplace because under the first-sale doctrine, if a producer sells a cassette for $30 to a video retail store, that store can either sell it or rent it. He can rent it 100, 200, 300 times and never pay the producer a dime. And the producer says, \"Hey, we would like some of that money, too. That is our product.\" \"No,\" he said, \"under the first-sale doctrine I can do whatever I want to with it.\"\n\nSo, now, what do producers do? They have to be one of two things. They either withhold that prerecorded cassette from the sale market and say, OK all we are doing is renting alone. That means the customer is denied a choice of whether he wants to buy or rent. He has no choice. Or the producer can add a surcharge to the cassette. If you are going to sell it for $30, you add another $25 surcharge and you say that takes care of the rental income. So, now, you are charging the consumer more money for his product\n\nAlso, if you don't do that and you are renting only, the inventory is lessened. The advantage is wholly with the public here. The public has two great advantages. One, it is able now to buy video cassettes at a much lower price and, two, he has an option. The customer now has an option of whether he wants to buy or rent, but it is his option\n\nNow, because of the distorted, unstabilized marketplace, that option doesn't exist. The fair marketing amendment will stabilize the marketplace, Mr. Chairman\n\nNow, that is what the public interest is all about. I know when I was in Government the first question that the President would ask any of his aides when we came up with some bright idea, he would say, well, what is the public interest? How does the public benefit from what it is you guys, want to do? And I think that the Edwards bill serves the public interest\n\nNow, look at these numbers because they are totally relevant. By 1990, the Japanese estimate that 30 to 35 million U.S. homes will be equipped with VCR's. VCR owners will buy about 225 million or 300 million blank tapes. But, and here is an explosive political fact, Mr. Chairman, two-thirds of U.S. households will not own VCR's, Mr. Chairman. One-third of VCR households will not be on cable or won't have access to cable. Now, if there is a scarcity of film and television entertainment, it won't be the well-groomed and the well-heeled that will suffer. It is going to be, as always it is, Mr. Chairman, the less-affluent, the disadvantaged people pressed against the wall, out of work, who can't afford these expensive machines, and free television to the sick and the old and the poor will remain the primary source of home entertainment\n\nNow, when a producer takes in less from these other markets, he is going to invest less. When your profit potential shrinks, you pull back. You produce less and you stay as long as you can in markets where you think you can make some money without having a VCR lay waste to your profit\n\nThe loser will be your public because they don't have these expensive machines. And that is what I am saying, sir. The public is the loser when creative property is taken and here is the reason why. The investment of hundreds of millions of dollars each year to produce quality programs to theaters and television will surely decline\n\nNow, you are going to hear tomorrow from a number of eloquent, intelligent, well-paid gentlemen a lot of arguments. This congressional debate has ripened the imagination of this opposition and I must say as I -- in another forum I said that my dear friend Mr. Ferris is a fellow who plasters together the true and the false and therefrom manufactures the plausible. I want to deal with some of those plausible plasters right now\n\nNow, the first thing that you are going to hear is this is a tax. It isn't a fee. Well, Mr. Chairman, if this were a tax, I think we would be performing before Chairman Rostenkowski and not Chairman Kastenmeier. We would be before the Ways and Means Committee\n\nBut they also say that it is going to be passed on -- this is a tax that is going to be passed on in its entirety to the consumer. What about this pass on? We contracted with the distinguished, consulting, economic firm of Robert Nathan. Robert Nathan Associates. I know you are familiar with them and all of the people in Congress are -- to do a study to tell us what will be the impact of a fee, say a $50 -- we picked this fee out mainly because I have been saying it \"in public when trying to pick a number when people want to talk about numbers as being fairly reasonable, a $50 on the machine and a $1 fee on the blank tape. And we said what about this pass on?\n\nNow, let me tell you what the Nathan -- I am going to read this because I think you ought to see it. Will royalty fees on VCR's and blank tapes be passed on to consumers? This is what Mr. Nathan said. \"Conditions prevailing in the markets for VCR equipment and blank video cassettes will be such that very substantial portions of any fees will be borne by manufacturers and retailers rather than passed on to the consumer.\"\n\nI have this entire report right here, Mr. Chairman. I will make it part of the record and I commend it to you because I think it will make for very interesting reading\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Without objection, several reports, including that of Professor Tribe and your own statement will be received\n\nMr. VALENTI. Yes, sir, the Mediastat survey, the Laurence Tribe memorandum and the Robert Nathan report will all be made part of your record\n\nThe effect on the consumer price, says Mr. Nathan, will be negligible, between 1 and 2 percent. As the market matures progressive smaller portions of any fee will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. The effect on consumer prices from passing on the royalty fees is to increase them negligibly from 1 to 2 percent\n\nI want to just tell you that he did a study in New York and found out that the high and low prices of a Sony SL 5600. The suggested retail price was $1,350 in New York. In New York the high price was $999. The low price was $666 or a price differential, Mrs. Schroeder, of $333\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the same 5600 Sony has a price differential of $571 and so forth and so on. That is in the report. It shows that the price is very competitive in the marketplace today\n\nNow, let me put it another way. If you had a 1 and 2 percent pass on, Mr. Nathan says it would be about $5.80 on an $800 to $900 machine and about 12 cents on a blank tape. If your machine has a 10-year life and it surely has more than that, then the consumer would be paying 50 cents per year for his copyright fee to use taping -- 50 cents a year. And if you had a tape, as I had, where you can tape as much as 200 times on a tape, each taping would cost you one-sixteenth of 1 cent per taping. I won't go into more detail on that. I think that you ought to read it\n\nNow, I have come to, another important fallacy that I want to nail to the wall right now. Mr. Ferris has said that the opposition is saying that the American producers are greedy and it is terrible that they want to extract more money and they are triple and double and quadruple dipping in all these markets and they are saying why in the devil should we go and make all this money. Why don't we stop? Haven't we got enough? Aren't we rich enough off of television and everybody?\n\nWell, this charge is so riddled with absurdities that I hardly know where to begin, but, by jingoes, I will begin. Now, I think it is quite intemperate -- I hope they don't make this argument tomorrow because of the answer I am about to give you -- to charge the Americans with greed when the Japanese companies are swollen with profits. Now, let me just -- somewhere here I have an interesting little piece of paper. Here we are. Wall Street Journal, February 24, 1982. 1 am bringing this for the record, Mr. Chairman, because a charge has been made that the American producers are greedy\n\nMatsushita Electric Industrial Co., which by the way is the largest maker of VCR's in the entire world, aided by strong demand, said the Wall Street Journal, for its video tape recorders reported record results for its fiscal quarter ending November 20. In the fourth quarter, net income rose to the equivalent of almost $200 million. That is a quarter, net income at the rate of $800 million or more a year, net profit. Sales climbed to $4.12 billion. The strong results of fiscal 1981 were linked to healthy markets overseas -- for \"overseas\" read United States -- as sales within Japan were hurt by sluggish economy. Foreign volume rose 36 percent and VCR's posted the healthiest sales gain of all of Matsushita's consumer products, surging 80 percent. Overseas went up almost 90 percent\n\nNow, I have here the profits of Japanese companies, if you want to talk about greed. Here, Hitachi, Matsushita, Sanyo, Sony, TDK, Toshiba, Victor, all of whom make these VCR's. Do you know what their net profits were last year? $2.8 billion net profit. Indeed, Matsushita, one company alone, makes more net profits than the entire American film and television industry combined. He wants to talk about greed\n\nNow, let me just show you something else. Mr. Nathan has what the Japanese companies had on return on stockholder equity. Listen to this, and if you are a reader of Fortune, Forbes, or Business Week or you hear the economists on the air, you will know what I mean. Matsushita's return on stockholder equity, 32.7 percent; Victor's return on equity, 37.6; Sony, 25.1. In 1980, the Fortune 500 companies of America, their average return was 14.4 percent, enough of profits, I suppose\n\nAnd the second part of the charge is that the American companies are retrieving their investment, and I have already cited you the other markets, and why do they want something out of the VCR. I have already cited you the fact that 6 out of 10 movies don't make a profit. By that same tortured logic, should Sony, once it has recovered its investment from its VCR's, should they give away their machines'? Of course not\n\nNow, they also talk about how Nielsen rewards home taping and this is a bonus for advertisers. Mr. Eliasberg is going to handle that\n\nOne final point, Mr. Chairman, and then I am through and I have taken more time than I should have, but I am so fascinated by what I am saying --\n\nNow, the final charge, the electronics industry is saying that the VCR sales are going to be hurt and the prices are going to rise if you have this copyright fee and sales are going to go down and I will tell you it is going to be a black and bleak world. It is amusing and instructive for this subcommittee to read from the record, though, of 1962. Then the electronics industry wrung its collective hands in dismay over the All-Channel Receivers Act that Congress, you remember, was passing. It said you had to have UHF and VHF tuners. Some of the arguments made today by the opponents are lamentably and comically similar to those made in 1962\n\nI am going to quote L. M. Sandwick, staff director for the Consumer Products Division of the Electronic Industries Association and then I am done. I know this is in your file, Charlie, so you can correct me. This is what this gentleman representing electronics said. \"The committee should consider what all-channel legislation will do to the consumer's pocketbook. The average selling price for TV sets will be increased by $30 and the public is going to be paying all this much more money, a 14-percent price could bring a 14-percent loss in business * * *\" and on and on and on. The drop in sales could cost the Federal Government millions of dollars in excise tax\n\nWhat really happened? Three years later the Federal Communications Commission did a study and they found the price of TV receivers didn't go up. They went down. The sales of TV receivers didn't go down. They went up. They went on to say that while some consumers may have paid for UHF tuners that they never used, the general public benefited because the all-channels law has been credited as a major stimulus to the creation of hundreds of UHF stations that have, been available to TV viewers\n\nMr. Chairman, I am done. The public interest is at stake here. It is the public interest that you have by solemn oath sworn to serve because what I am talking about and what the rest of these witnesses are talking about is making it possible for a steady stream of quality entertainment to reach people through their television sets and to keep the incentive and reward mechanism in line so that people can risk great sums of money in this very dicey forum. That is what is at stake, and, finally, the preservation of a huge and valuable trade asset that can't be duplicated by any country in the world\n\nI thank you for indulging me. I went about 18 minutes longer than I wanted to. I apologize to you, but I am grateful for your attention\n\n[The statement follows:]\n\n[85-page statement amplifies Valenti's testimony.]\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. I compliment you on your presentation, Jack. Actually, even though you are not a lawyer, you didn't seem the least bit uncomfortable\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. He really sounds like a lawyer\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Now, I would like to call on the distinguished actor/producer/director Clint Eastwood\n\nEastwood, you are in production, so you may proceed as you wish. I do have a question at the outset. Is Mr. Valenti right? You are producing Foxfire or Firefox, which is it?\n\nMr. EASTWOOD. Firefox, yes\n\nTESTIMONY OF CLINT EASTWOOD, ACTOR/PRODUCER/ DIRECTOR\n\nMr. EASTWOOD. You know, I got so wrapped up in Jack's speech that, I don't know, I was just kind of dazzled. I am used to speaking rather lengthy myself, but I decided I would cut it a little short today\n\nI think that when Mr. Valenti asked me to come and be a representative or a spokesman for the men and women who work in the motion picture industries, I was a little apprehensive at first, but I think that the one comment that he made, the thing that makes sense to me, is that the motion picture industry has never been subsidized by the Government like they are in some countries and they are not asking for that. They are not asking to be anything but in the free enterprise system\n\nBut Mr. Valenti did bring up that there is a high risk factor in the fact that 8 out of 10 films might not make their money back and get out of the red in the first period of release, which is the theatrical division. And I think later on he brought up the point that if this continued at this rate and investors were turned off to not come into the film thing, there would be less films to produce, less films to be shown, less films to be taped on VCR systems ahd I think that is the main thing I would like to add here today\n\nI think it is going to be better for the home recording industry in the long run to have this copyright, potential copyright law, that Mr. Edwards is talking about. And I think that if a film is marginal, it needs those extra categories to get in. It needs that home box office. It needs that cassette sale to get out of the red or maybe even right up to network television sale. Maybe that is the thing that pushes it into the black. It is very simple. The more films that are in the black, the more films are made, the more men and women are employed by the film industry\n\nThat is about the extent of -- I can read Jack's speech again\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. We appreciate your comments. They are, indeed, what it is all about. They are relevant. I think we might ask either Mr. Valenti or Mr. Eastwood some questions at this juncture so we get a little give and take between committee and the panel before yielding to Mr. Eliasberg and others among you who will comment on different questions\n\nOne question I have of Mr. Valenti who brilliantly represents his industry and has in the past before this committee many times, is about the compulsory license. My question to you is this. You and I both having been through some very rocky times with respect to the compulsory license in the cable industry, and do you see that coming into your industry and, indeed, an interrelationship of a number of industries. It has been a rather painful experience, as you well know. Why, for heaven sakes, would you recommend now a new Compulsory license of all devices, I would ask you, Mr Valenti?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Mr. Chairman, as again, well we both know, when you and I and others on your committee were debating this issue, I wanted the free marketplace and that is no compulsory license and open negotiation between cable systems and program suppliers. Now, you are dealing, of course, with what? 20, 30, 40, 60 million homes, so, obviously, you can't deal with the homeowners, so you must deal with the manufacturer\n\nNow, it seems to me that the sensible thing to do with the manufacturers and program suppliers is to find some congenial way that satisfies both, that satisfies the copyright infringement, satisfies the need for these machines in the marketplace. We would like to have them out there. We like people to tape, but in a sense, Mr. Chairman, the compulsory license, while it is not everything that I want it to be, and you are the best judge of the accuracy of that statement, it is working\n\nThe courts just came down yesterday with a decision that said the Copyright Royalty Tribunal are doing a good job. They are getting the job done and they made very few comments about the way the Copyright Royalty Tribunal was going. I know that Mr. Ferris has dubious comments about the CRT, but the appeals court -- I mean, the Federal court -- found it is working OK\n\nI am saying to you that that is the very minimum that should be done. I think that that is the attitude that the committee took. The committee said, well, we don't think we can go to compulsory license because that might upset the marketplace. I don't hink it would have, but the very least you did, Mr. Chairman, was you recognized the principle of ownership. You recognized that program producers can't have their programs off the air by cable systems. And, so, you, wisely, in a spirit of compromise, moved on the compulsory license\n\nThis is an imperfect world, Mr. Chairman. Nothing is absolutely perfect and the cable copyright bill is not, but it is serving a useful purpose and it is the very least that should have been done\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. I have many questions. I will ask just one more and then yield to my colleagues\n\nWhat about past practices, past sales, past uses? Are they to be forgiven by the enactment of 5705 or how do you cope with all that?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Well, I cope with it Mr. Chairman, I cope with it with commonsense and that is if you have a machine, you don't have to pay anything. The manufacturer doesn't have to pay anything. The machine is there. We are talking about the future, just as the All-Channels Act said that in the future all TV sets must have two tuners. And blank tapes the same way, blank tapes and video cassette recorders have already been purchased. Obviously, they do not come within the ken of the canopy of this bill\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Also, the bill itself indicates then that home users are not infringers. Is that correct?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Absolutely. Absolutely. The bill clearly states unambiguously that all home taping is exempt from copyright infringement. I am talking about 5705\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you. I am now going to yield to my friend from Illinois, Mr. Tom Railsback\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman\n\nHas there been any estimate of damages, actual damages, or predicted damages from an economic standpoint?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Mr. Railsback, there are less than 3 million of those machines -- we have 3 million plus machines out there. There are 80 million television homes. So, if you try to quantify damage, it is very difficult to do at this time, but you will be hearing from the audio people on Wednesday, Mr. Chairman, and there is a business that is collapsing before our very eyes; $2 billion a year in stolen property\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. I recognize that audio may, by reason of the very large number of sets, have less of a problem as far as proving prospective damage. But I am aware, again, that the district court really made a point that your industry had not been able to show any damage at all at that time. I think there were something like 3 million at that time\n\nMr. VALENTI.Oh, no, sir. There were less than 1 million\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Less than a million at that time\n\nLet me ask you this. Do you agree that the question of damages should be presumed in the event liability is shown and then that the burden would shift to the -- in the case that we are talking about -- manufacturers of the sets or the other defendants and that they then would have to show that damage has not occurred? What is your feeling about that?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Well, two things. First, the court of appeals suggested the copyright royalty fee as a suitable alternative as a solution of this problem. No. 2, the small number of VCR's in the marketplace now is a cloud no bigger than a man's fist on the horizon. To me, it is like the picture of Dorian Gray. You look at the picture and it is a very handsome fellow, but when you look behind the picture, behind the curtain, you see a face ravaged with ruin\n\nThe audio business today is where the video business is going to be 4, 5, 6 years from now. By that time, Mr. Railsback, it is going to be too late. You can't salvage the business then. I am saying to you first there is use. There ought to be a fee for use. There ought to be a fee for the harm we know is coming. It has to come. All you have to do is use commonsense on this to know a little bit about this business\n\nI don't know of any issue in the 16 years that I have been in the movie business which has won the total unanimous support of everybody connected with this business because they live in this hazardous business every day and they know what the blight is all about and they see it right there\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. What you are really saying is that it is there. It is very difficult to show. It is very difficult to prove, but you know it is there and I guess what I am asking is at this stage, which is later -- you know, now, we are in 1982 -- I wonder if it would be wise to have a study that would come up with a more predictable appraisal of what damage has actually occurred and what is likely to occur\n\nMr. VALENTI. Mr. Railsback, I would be the last person in the world to try to deal with you on this. You and I both know that Congress rules exceedingly slow. If we don't do something this year, it may be years before we attend to this problem. You know, studies -- we don t need that, Mr. Railsback. It is here. We have 3 million cassette recorders out there. You are going to have 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10 shortly. We are growing at the rate of 2 million a year. Mr. Eliasberg is going to tell you about some of the qualms that advertisers are having now\n\nI had one advertiser -- unfortunately, I don't have his written statement before me, but I do hope to have it for the hearings next week in the Senate -- in which he was saying that a lot of advertisers are looking at this. They are not going to pay for home taping recordings for just the reason I talked about, because you can't tell if they are ever played back and when they are played back, this little machine blocks out the commercial, which means that you are going to have a precipituous dropoff. If you are saying until the harm is there, shall we wait until the 355 magnum is in our belly or shall we do something about it now -- that is all I am saying. It is going to be there. It cannot escape it, Mr. Railsback\n\nMr. RAIIZBACK. OK. That is all I have\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Next, I would like to yield to my colleague from Colorado, who replaced George Danielson on this subcommittee. Mr. Danielson had been on the subcommittee many years and became a judge of the Court of Appeals of California. So, we are very pleased to greet our colleague on the full committee, Mrs. Pat Schroeder from Colorado and this is the first time she as appeared on the subcommittee and we welcome her\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Thank you very much. All I want to now is does that little machine take off political commercials, too. mean, this could be serious\n\nI want to thank you and I want to say that I think the presentation was much more interesting than any moot court presentations I ever saw when I was in law school. You did an excellent job\n\nMr. Eastwood, if 6 out of 10 movies never pay off, why do you invest in them? Why not go into money markets?\n\nMr. EASTWOOD. It has always been a high risk business, at least in the days since the advent of television. In the old days almost all movies made money. I don't know why people invest in them, but they do. You are asking me why do I. I have had a little bit better luck than 6 out of 10, but that happens to be the average and I think that average includes 8 out of 10 in the theatrical market and then this is on down through the other markets, because movies are a feast or famine kind of roll with the dice. There are movies out there making money and doing tremendously well. There are a lot of them out there that don't do zero\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Do you have a lot of trouble raising money now? Do other producers have trouble raising money? Is there any difference in the market?\n\nMr. EASTWOOD. I think the movie industry as a whole is having -- I think the business is down about 50 percent compared to last year and I think it is down like the rest of the economy is. But at the same time, you need that extra amount of money out there to take those kinds of risks because it is a feast or famine -- it is more -- more than most industries, it has the feeling of red or black on roulette\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. The problem is that the public sees ihe feast\n\nMr. EASTWOOD. Exactly. They all flock to the feast and they forget the famine jobs\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. But you personally don't have trouble getting investors, I am sure\n\nMr. EASTWOOD. I personally don't, but I have had a little better average than that average there, but I am here at Mr. Valenti's request to represent the industry as a whole and the men and women this affects, the people that are unemployed now in the business and will continue to be unemployed if movies and television aren't turned out\n\nAs I said before, I think this benefits the home recording devices in the long run\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Do you have any worry about how these receipts are going to be divvied up?\n\nMr. EASTWOOD. Yes, I do. I don't know the exact way it is going to be done. I have read some information that Mr. Valenti sent me from Washington, but I think that there are experts enough here on this panel that can answer that question. I can't, but, yes, I would be concerned about that\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Because the real question is whether or not -- and I guess is that camel under the tent notion -- are you going to come in and have to increase the amount of the royalty as you go forward and costs are rising and everything\n\nMr. EASTWOOD. If I may, the bill says that the Copyright Royalty Tribunal after a year of evidentiary hearings would determine a fee and then they would hold hearings the following year to determine the allocation of that fee the previous year. Third, every 5 years they would revisit the fee that they had initially set\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. They are going to be real popular folks\n\nMr. VALENTI. Well, they are getting a lot of practice now in cable copyright fees and mechanical royalties and juke boxes. But I might tell you, Mrs. Schroeder, that ASCAP has been doing this for 50 years. They have more than 40,000 artists and they have people who poll and spot check the logs of radio stations and they make allocations of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of musical recordings and they have done it with almost no dissention from the ranks because they have gotten expertise in it and everybody trusts their judgment and I am completely convinced that in the years ahead that the same sort of thing will come to the CRT gains more experience on how to do this\n\nWill it be easy? Of course not. It won't easy. Is it doable? Immensely doable. And I think fairly so. Mr. Eastwood and all other people will have the right to redress their grievances in the courtroom if they feel they have been harmed\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Maybe that is why we are here. Maybe we are creating jobs for lawyers\n\nMr. VALENTI. I think the UCLA Law School ought to be very much in favor of this. It is a life safety net for employment\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. But I think it is important to point out the industry record in other areas because I think the thing that bounces into the average voter's mind is something similar to their electric bill or what have you, you know, so you start here, but every year they are going to be wanting more and more and more and more and then you start seeing the consumer pushing and that is what I think is important to get very straight\n\nMr. VALENTI. Well, two things, Mrs Schroeder. The Nathan study, I think, and if you read this, it is very easy reading, if you read this, you will find that this is not going to be passed through for one thing. No. 2, every 5 years, the Copyright Royalty Trinunal must go in and revisit this fee. It can't raise it or lower it in the 5 years. If it is too high, they lower it. If it is too low, they raise it\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. But as a politician when you are running for reelection no one is ever going to believe they are going to lower it and that if it gets high enough, they aren't going to pass it through\n\nMr. VALENTI. Well, I might add that the Copyright Royalty Tribunal first doesn't cost the Government a dime. All the costs of actually maintaining this come out of the copyright royalty fees. You are talking about -- if you ask somebody and I have done this ith a lot of people, not scientific, of course, if you wanted to be able to tape all you could tape and you wanted to have a copyright royalty fee paid creative people so that you can get these programs, people don t mind paying 2 cents more a passthrough on a tape or $2 more on a machine that is going to last them 10 or 15 years. We don't mind when you go buy a record. You have a copyright fee on that. When you go buy a book, there is a copyright fee in that. People understand it and I don't think there is any problem to it at all\n\nNow, if you had the fee half again as high as the cost of the set, that is one thing, but, obviously, that is not going to happen\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Thank you very, very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. I think is one point clearly on behalf of the bill is that the copyright owner here is merged in a single producing company. Unlike the possibilities in some cases, you do not have a situation where a script writer or a music composer shares in the copyright proceeds as such. The copyright in film production being unitary in terms of whatever the producing company is, the owner, does not have to proliferate it among so many sources. So, I think to that extent it would not be that complex\n\nI would like to yield to Mr. Railsback\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Could I ask, Jack, one last -- really, one last question. There was an article that appeared in the New York Times and I believe it was in November and it was by an Ernest Holzendoff and it said this:\n\nProposal being promoted in the motion picture industry would have the public paying an extra dollar or two for each recording tape, now selling at retail for about $20 each, and about $50 extra for each new tape machine, selling now for about $1,000 each, give or take $200\nI just wondered, do you know anything about that or who is circulating those figures?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Well, Mr. Railsback, I have used those figures in interviews and that sort of thing when people ask me, well, what kind of a fee are you talking about. I say, first, I don't know what kind of a fee. Now, if you ask me what I think would be a reasonable fee, I would say $50 and that is Jack Valenti. That has nothing to do with the Copyright Royalty Tribunal, which unhappily has oftentimes not taken my point of view\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. So, it really would still be, of course, left to the Copyright Royalty Tribunal and actually their determination would be based on the evidence that they took\n\nMr. VALENTI. But keep in mind, Mr. Railsback, that is not the pass through. I am saying to you that right now you can buy the same model machine in Washington for a price differential of $571 and in New York City $333. So, you are talking about what the Nathan people are talking about. What actually would the customer at the very worst have to pay? They are suggesting between 1 and 2 percent\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. You are saying that because of the competition and the discount houses and everything else that that really would not necessarily be a pass off\n\nMr. VALENTI. Absolutely not. You and I both know that you can walk in the Globe Book Store on G and Pennsylvania and buy a novel for $14.95. You walk right across the street to the Crown Book Store and buy the same book for $11.95. 1 mean, that sort of price competition is rampant in the electronics business and they are all indulging in it right now\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Thank you\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Just to follow up very simply, the Copyright Royalty Tribunal, unlike all previous compulsory licenses, in this case makes the initial determination\n\nMr. VALENTI. Yes, sir\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. In all other cases the initial determination was a statutory one\n\nMr. VALENTI. Yes, sir. That is correct\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Do you think that is fair?\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Yes, well, that is what they --\n\nMr. VALENTI. You asked me if I think it is fair, Mrs. Schroeder?\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Yes\n\nMr. VALENTI. Yes, I think it is fair. Risky, but fair\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. I want to thank Mr. Valenti and Mr. Eastwood for their presentations thus far. Now, would you -- and I know Mr. Eastwood is in production --\n\nMr. VALENTI. Yes, would you excuse Mr. Eastwood? He is holding up a very expensive production\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. OK. Thank you very much for your appearance today\n\nNow, Mr. Eliasberg, who is former vice president of research of CBS Broadcast Group, we would be pleased to have your comments\n\nTESTIMONY OF JAY ELIASBERG, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF\nRESEARCH, CBS BROADCAST GROUP\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the committee, my name is Jay Eliasberg. Until 2 weeks ago, I was the vice president for research of th CBS Broadcast Group, a position that I held for more than 7 years. Prior to that I held various research jobs with CBS over a period of 20 years. I have been involved with broadcast ratings, that is to say, the measurement of audience behavior, for more than 34 years\n\nI have been asked by the Motion Picture Association of America to come before this committee to comment on statements that the use of VCR's will not negatively affect the reported audiences to television programs. The opponents of H.R. 5705 have alleged that the producers of those programs will be adequately and properly compensated for the audiences their programs have created\n\nFor reasons that I shall discuss, this not the case. On the contrary, VCR use, coupled with the television audience measurement techniques now being used or that will be used in the foreseeable future, will inevitably result in a decline in the amounts paid by television networks and stations to program suppliers\n\nIn the simplest terms, the producers of television programs will in the long run be paid for their product in proportion to the effective size of the audiences that their programs reach. This is clearly true in the case of advertiser-supported television where the demand for television audiences at any particular time establishes a going cost-per-thousand-homes that an advertiser is willing to pay to a network or to a local station. This, in its turn, establishes the amount the network or station is willing to pay producers or syndicators for their programs\n\nThe question before us then is simple enough. Will the use of tape machines increase or will such use decrease the size of the reported audience to the programs shown on television? The opponents of H.R. 5705 have suggested that the use of VCR's will have no negative effect on the audience size of movies shown on television. Indeed, it has been claimed and I quote the Home Recording Rights Coalition, that \"The VCR is the best friend Hollywood ever had.\" With friends like that, who needs enemies\n\nI venture to differ and to differ strongly. The extensive use of VCR's will have major negative effects on the reported size of those audiences and on what I shall refer to as the effective size of those audiences, that is to say, the size of the audience tha advertisers are willing to pay for\n\nCareful examination of the claims of those who feel that the use of VCR's will increase the size of audiences to television programs shows that these claims all rely on the usually unmentioned assumption that the availability of VCR's will increase the overall use of television. While this may be true to a negligible degree, a simple examination of television use in the average home indicates that neither VCR's nor anything else in the foreseeable future will have any substantial positive effect on the use of television by the average television family\n\nWe think of the day as having 24 hours and, indeed, it has. However, from the point of view of television set usage, the effective number of hours in a day is much less. Some time, after all, must be allowed for activities such as sleep, work, and so on. If we take as a reasonable figure that there are 8 hours a day when people are sleeping or engaged in sleep-related activities, such as showering or bathing in the morning or whatever, another 8 hours a day when there is no one at home to use the set, either because they are out at work or doing necessary shopping for food or on vacation or what have you. Now, that 8-hour figure is probably too large in a large family, where one person could be out and another person at home, but on the other hand it is probably much too small in a small family\n\nSo, that, effectively, we are left with 8 hours a day during which the television set can be used during the average day. Now, in fact, according to A. C. Nielsen Co. figures for 1981, and these are year-around figures, the television set usage in the average television household is already in use for 6 hours and 43 minutes per day\n\nThat uses up just about all of those available 8 hours and the hours, as I said, I think is an overstatement. I have left out a lot of other reasons why the set can't be used, such as family regulations and so on\n\nNow, giving all possible credit to the convenience, afforded by VCR's, it is clear that the use of such recorders is not, going to increase television set usage to any appreciable degree, Now, if we are faced with an essentially fixed amount of television use, the only effect that VCR's, or anything else for that matter, can possibly have is to redistribute the viewing and so it will. The problem is that in redistributing the viewing it will also reduce the reported amount of viewing and it will reduce the effective audience. I say this because of the measurement tools which are used to measure audience size. Let me explain\n\nOn the network level, audience sizes are measured use of meters. These devices accurately report when VCR's are being used to record and what is being recorded. They, do not, however, indicate when VCR's are being used to play back programs, nor can they identify the programs that are being played back. In other words, there are two types of recordings. There are attended recordings when somebody records a program as he watches it. Now, in the case of attended recording, the audience is correctly reported at the time of recording because Nielsen reports a home view and, indeed, a home did view. Subsequent playbacks, however, are not reported as viewing\n\nAt best then, a recorded program, which is recorded with someone in attendance, is correctly treated if the program is only viewed at the time of the original recording. As soon as the program is played back, however, its audience becomes understated because the future playbacks are simply not reported\n\nNow, unattended recording is also reported as viewing at the time of recording and this, in effect, is an overstatement. At the first playback, however this overstatement is, in effect, corrected since this playback is not reported as viewing. So, we have had one case where the program was not viewed, but was reported as being viewed and we have another case where the program viewed, but was not reported as being viewed and that is a wash\n\nHowever, on subsequent playbacks -- and you have all seen how many tapes these families have and how long they keep them. They have 27 tapes and they keep them for ages. This also results then in understatement. There is also some proportion of programs which were recorded but unviewed when the recording was made and that are never played back. And this is an overstatement. This overstatement, however, is much more than made up for by programs which are played back more than once and whose audiences are understated\n\nThus, while audience measurement meters are marvelous mechanisms, they do not and they cannot accurately reflect VCR recording and playback activity without, on balance, understating the size of the audience on which broadcast advertising rate are based. With increased penetration of VCR-equipped households, the inaccuracies of the metered rating system, particularly where coupled with statistical proof of commercial deletion, which you ladies and gentlemen have seen and which the advertisers are coming to know about, must inevitably result in a serious erosion of advertiser confidence in network television as an advertiser medium\n\nFurthermore, because it is clear that playbacks of video recordings will not increase television use, each playback must replace original viewing to a program which would have been watched if there had not been a recording made and played back. And it is because of this fact that the apparent audiences to television programs will decline in VCR-equipped households. Programs which would have been viewed and would have had their audiences correctly reported will be replaced by playbacks of recorded programs\n\nAnd, as I have just explained, the vast majority of these recorded programs will have their audiences understated. And I shall not belabor, but it is worth repeating, that the effective audience will decline because advertisers will be unwilling to pay for audiences which may well have eliminated the commercial from playbacks by the use of a pause mechanism or skipping the commercials by use of the fast forward features, which are an integral part of all VCR's sold today\n\nIt may be maintained that this situation could be corrected if the techniques used to measure audiences were improved. However, despite the optimism of the opponents of H.R. 5705, there is little prospect that this will be done or even can be done in the near future. And even if it is done, this is rather technical and I apologize for it, but there would still be a major decline in the size of reported audiences. This happens for the following reasons:\n\nNielsen -- and they are the people who measure network audiences -- Nielsen is in the business of reporting audiences. Those audiences have to be reported within a reasonable time after the program has appeared on the air if anybody is going to use those data-advertisers, networks, or anybody else. As a result, if the playback did not -- even if they could identify the playback to specific programs, if that playback did not occur before the Sunday following the original reporting, it just gets lost. There is no program to attach it to. Nielsen would know there was viewing and they might even know it was to -- Mr. Eastwood's movies seem to get all the examples -- they might even know it should be attached to Mr. Eastwood's, but there is no way to do it. Mr. Eastwood's program audience has already been reported and paid for and nobody is going to do anything about it after that\n\nNow, the third Mediastat study of VCR-homes, which Mr. Valenti referred to, which was conducted during September and October 1981, shows that less than half of the recordings made would meet these Nielsen requirements of being played back by the Sunday following the day they are recorded. In series programs, this could be partially corrected by attaching the playback viewing to the original program of the series that happened to be appearing in the week of the playback. However, this is not always possible, even for series programs, and it is completely impossible for onetime-only programs. And remember that, as I said earlier, there is no prospect of identifying or even measuring the volume of this. At least there is no possibility of that on the horizon this time. There has been reference to a Nielsen device called AMOL, which stands for automatic measurement of lineups. I think that this reference can only arise out of a complete misunderstanding of what this device is and what it does\n\nThe reference seems to feel that these devices are in Nielsen homes and that they could be used to identify programs being watched, recorded, played back, or whatever in those homes. The devices are not in Nielsen homes. There is no prospect that they will be in Nielsen homes in the near future and, as I said, even if they were, there are reasons why it wouldn't work anyhow\n\nNow, if the situation is bad on the network level, and it is, it is even worse on the local level. Local measurements, except in a few markets where meters are used, are made with diaries. People are asked to keep detailed records of their television viewing. Now, in spite of the impression which may be left with you at some other time -- in spite of that impression -- neither the Nielsen nor the Arbitron diaries now in use have been designed in any way to encourage the entry of recordings made for timeshift or any other purpose. There are no special instructions given VCR owners in their keeping of diaries\n\nAny entries made by VCR owners regarding recording or playback are strictly voluntary and cannot be relied on. Neither the Arbitron nor Nielsen diaries are designed for VCR owners to note their recording or viewing, that is to say, playback activities. In other words, no rating service based on diaries now provides any measurements of the viewing of recordings in their audience raiings data\n\nThe optimism of the opponents of the bill before you will probably lead them to suggest that Neilsen and Arbitron should change their instructions to diary-keeping families and request them to record VCR recording or playback or both. Their optimism would play them false. In my judgment and the judgment of most knowledgeable people in the industry, what is now already required of diary-keepers already strains their abilities. A set of additional requirements would, I am afraid, push many of them past the point of willingness to cooperate in the diary-keeping process\n\nIn short, then, VCR use will not increase audience size, at least not reported audience size. Moreover, the limitations of the audience measurement techniques available to us or ever likely to be available to us will result in an apparent decline of reported television audiences. This decline in reported audience, coupled with a demonstrable inclination on the part of VCR owners to delete or fast forward commercials would lead to a decline in advertiser demand or to the price advertisers are willing to pay. Clearly, if the networks and stations take in less money from advertisers for their programs, there will be less available to pay program suppliers for their costly product\n\nThank you\n\n[The information follows:]\n\n[A two-page statement is almost identical to Eliasberg's testimony.]\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Eliasberg\n\nIncidentally, there has been other reference to Mediastat. Mr. Valenti said that the Motion Picture Association had not commissioned it originally. Who did, do you know?\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. The Mediastat survey -- incidentally I didn't either -- but the Mediastat survey is a syndicated service done for the entire industry. Anybody could buy it that wanted it. Well, Mr. Valenti said they didn't commission it. They did not. They subscribed to it as hundreds of other people did\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. In other words, no one commissioned it. They did the survey themselves and. then sold the results to whoever --\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. It may have had its impetus from one or more companies in the industry that led them to feel that this could be wise\n\nMr. KASTENMEJER. Your early analysis about the lengthy watching, the incurred time shift replay, is that all contingent on a single television set at home?\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. I am sorry. I don't understand your question\n\nMr. KAsTENMEIER. Well, is that all contingent. on a single television set? That is to say, let me say, I would assume that any home that has a Sony or one of these thousand dollar VCR's is likely to have more than one television set. So, one person could be watching a certain program or sporting event while others of the family could be watching something else on another set\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. Yes; they could be. They could be, but if you remember, my analys is related just to times when the television set could not be in use. The fact that two television sets might be in use at some particular time wouldn't change that very much. In fact, if it changed it at all, it might increase the number of homes watching the totality of two programs, but it wouldn't increase what we call the audience composition because it would just split the people watching between the two sets\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Any questions?\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Why don't you go to Pat first?\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Well, I just want to -- double dipping is such a loaded word and we have heard it a lot\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. Did I use it?\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. No, no. No, no, but I am hoping you are the one that responds to the issue and I just want to make it clear. Are you saying that the double-dipping argument, which is that the networks and the advertisers get that counted into the ratings whether you are recording or not and then you are saying, well, it doesn't matter because later on, they may replay it. Are you saying that the reason that that is different for the advertisers is because when they replay it, they may have taken the advertising out, so it is looking like they have a market for the advertising, but when people really see it, it is all taken out? It has been cleansed; it has been purged; it has been whatever?\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. I say it is different for two reasons and that is one of them and I won't repeat that because you just expressed it better than I could\n\nThe other reason is that because of the technicalities of the measurement service -- because of the inelastic clock hat we live with, when a program is recorded and is later played back, it is going to replace another program. While the program which was recorded may appear to have a larger audience than it would have had if there were no such thing as video recorders. The program that would have been watched will have a smaller audience. And the problem is that those two things do not balance because the reported program will not get the full benefit of the larger audience because of the inadequacies of the research techniques that we have available to us. So that on balance between the two programs, the audience would appear to go down\n\nThen there is the point that you made that even if it looked as if it was the same size, the advertisers are not going to be willing to pay for it\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Because as you see more and more video recorders come on, they will think that their message got lost. No one ever saw it\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. You will hear testimony from people who say that they will and, of course, they are welcome to do that, as they want to, but the damage will be done if there is anybody who will not\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Yes, because then it looks like a chocolate chip ice cream that had all of the chocolate chips strip mined out ot it, so why bother. Yes. OK\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. Advertisers look at it as the chocolate chips being taken out, yes\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Yes, and the technology is really there. Having black and white televisions I am amazed by all of this, but the first time you see it you can take it out\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. Yes; there is a device called a pause and when you come to the commercial and you see it is a commercial, you just press this down and your machine stops and when the commercial is over, you just let the pause button back up and you have a continuous movie\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. But you have to be watching that\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. The first time only. That is the use of the pause button. If you have recorded it with the commercials in it, but now don't want to watch it with the commercials, then as you watch the movie, when you come to the commercial, you just fast forward it and you are burdened for 3 seconds instead of 1 minut and then you are back to the movie\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. OK. Thank you very much\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. May I ask one question?\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Yes\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. May I ask is it possible to speculate as to where the greatest impact in the future would be; that is to theaters, to network sales or network programs, the sale of video cassettes by the motion picture business, to syndicated sales? I know you elieve it is going to impact on all of those, but I am curious. Is there any one or more areas where it is likely to impact if there is no copyright royalty?\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. Excuse me, Mr. Railsback. Whether I believe that it will have impact on all of those or not is immaterial, because I am not talking about all of those. I am really only here to speak about the effect on the network audiences and the syndicated audiences and I believe that effect will be substantial\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. So, you believe that at least in those two areas that there certainly is going to be an impact\n\nMr. ELIASBERG. Yes, sir, I do\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Maybe Mr. Valenti has somebody else who could talk about future impact on, say, theater owners\n\nMr. VALENTI. We do, Mr. Railsback\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. OK, good. Well, then, I will withhold those questions until we hear from them\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. I think the next witness is, in fact --\n\nMr. VALENTI. Mr. Chairman, may I -- because of some time constraints, I think Mr. Orear is going next and then Mr. Jud Taylor will follow him, instead of Mr. Allen, if that is all right with you\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Yes, I would say to the witnesses I regret the time has passed so quickly. The Chair would appreciate your synopsizing your statements to the extent possible to get to the meat of it without refracting it, so that we are going to run well past the hour we planned to -- well, having said that, let me no all on Mr. Orear, who, as I recall, represents --\n\nMr. VALENTI. He is president of the --\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. President of the National Association of Theatre Owners, speaking on behalf of H.R. 5705\n\nTESTIMONY OF RICHARD H. OREAR, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL\nASSOCIATION OF THEATRE OWNERS\n\nMr. OREAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Richard Orear and I would like to read my testimony here --\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Your testimony is short. It is only 4 1/2 pages\n\nMr. OREAR. Yes. I am president of the National Association of Theatre Owners. Our association represents the owners and the operators of motion picture theaters in every State in this Nation. Many of these theaters are owned by small businessmen. There are over 18,000 motion picture screens in the United States. The 1981 attendance at these theaters reached over 1 billion moviegoers\n\nThe motion picture industry had box office receipts for the year 1981 of almost $3 billion. The exhibition industry employed over 130,000 workers\n\nIt is a great pleasure for me to be here this afternoon because I believe that the passage of the Home Recording Act of 1982, H.R. 5705, is very important for the continued viability of the motion picture industry on which our members depend\n\nMotion picture theaters have survived in this age of rapid technology by offering to the American public an entertainment experience that is unique, the ability to view great creative works in the setting of comfort, conviviality and has become a way of life ever since Edison first made a flickering image on the screen\n\nAmericans have always had many alternatives from which to choose their entertainment. These alternatives are now even more varied and growing, as engineers produce equipment for home use. The expanded use of pay cable and pay TV, especially when coupled with the relatively new video tape recorders, will make it easier for the public to view full length motion pictures in their homes\n\nIt is obvious that the new home delivery systems will become even keener competitors. We cannot say to what extent these competitors will fragment the audience and, thus, reduce the income of the theater. But movie theaters are willing to compete in this entertainment market, providing all those who compete use the same ground rules\n\nTo date, the VCR gets its material free. Theater owners must pay a license fee to the owners of the creative property. It is only fair that the rights of the copyright owner be protected and that they receive fair compensation for the use of their creative efforts, whether it be in the theater or on video tape\n\nThe theater and home viewing options available to the American public to date are dependent upon a unique product, movies. This product, in turn, is totally dependent upon a healthy and an active industry. No one could deny that motion picture theaters offer the opportunity to experience something that is bigger than life, a big screen, new sound reproduction technologies, improved production technologies, which are all focused on providing the viewer with a very special experience\n\nBut the ability of our theaters to continue to do this depends upon the motion picture industry's creative ability and, frankly, financial capabilities, as well. Investments required to produce the thrilling scenes of \"Star Wars\" or the suspense of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" are immense. The public wants to see the grea works of the American movie industry, but to keep this process continually moving, the creators must be rewarded for their labors\n\nLet me explain a little bit about the business of movie theaters and the movie industry. First, everyone has heard about the pictures that become box office smashes; that rare film which is both a popular and a commercial success. Let me point out that no one knows at the time a film is being conceived, whether it will have the right combination of stars, story, and creative genius to become a hit\n\nAll of the creative people involved hope that it will. We in the theater business are acutely aware that very few films find total acceptance by the public. In fact, investments in films are so risky that a recent film investment prospectus registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission stated in regard to public taste that it is both \"unpredictable and susceptible to change without warning or explanation.\" And that is an understatement, as I am sure you in Congress know\n\nMotion picture theaters bid for motion pictures as they become available. The successful bidder hopes he has selected a picture which the public in his respective area will like in ever-increasing numbers. Our theaters must be open year round and our members need new releases and re-releases in order to offer a variety of entertainment to the public\n\nWhat the American public wants is to be able to continue to view creative and imaginative works. This continued flow of creative works can only be assured by casting the investment net wide. I believe that it is the creativity and the imagination that is at issue here and we insure that it continues to be supported\n\nVideo cassette recorders now provide the technical means of taking the works of creative people from them without compensation. If we allow a new technology, the VCR, to take property without paying for it, I believe the Nation will be jeopardizing one of its greatest assets, our film industry\n\nI know that you will be told that no harm will come to the industry if video cassette recording in the home is exempted from copyright protection, but I cannot see how that assertion can be believed when confronted with the experience of the audio recording industry and simple commonsense. Other works of art ar protected from unauthorized reproduction because their value erodes as their numbers multiply. How can a film be any different?\n\nAnd I expect that you will hear the argument, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" in reference to the film industry today. To that, I would only say that in this case, an ounce of prevention is certainly worth a pound of cure\n\nThe Constitution provides for the copyright and Congress is responsible for keeping it viable in the face of emerging technologies. The members of the National Association of Theatre Owners urge you to take action to protect the American film industry and the creative genius that it fosters. We as a nation will be poorer if you don't\n\nThank you, sir\n\n[The statement follows:]\n\n[One-page statment same as the Orear testimony.]\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Orear, for that fine statement on behalf of the film industry, in support of -- but let me ask you from a self-interest standpoint as a representative of theater owners. H.R. 5705 does not produce copyright fees for theater owners. In fact, we have heard also Mr. Valenti say that the fees prospectively that might be charged will not, in fact, affect the purchase of either tapes or sets because the market range for the sale of these is so disparate as to make -- not make it inevitable that the cost be passed on accordingly therefore. Presumably, there would be no curtailment of the sale or use of these devices. How, then, does the bill benefit theater owners, per se?\n\nMr. OREAR. Well. in my opinion it dilutes the ancillary market that will come from the sale of the films and, as you have already heard, the majority of the pictures do not break even unless they have, first, a good theatrical run and, second, a sale to one of the video systems for delivery to the home\n\nThe producer deprived of that market, or at least lessened, will obviously not be interested in making more pictures. From my point of view, I am terribly concerned over continual flow of products. I know the money must be made available to the producers if that is to continue\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. The producers must be healthy for you as theater owners to survive\n\nMr. OREAR. That is correct\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Railsback?\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Mr. Chairman, I don't have any questions\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Valenti, did you suggest that Mr. Allen proceed next?\n\nMr. VALENTI. No, sir. I am suggesting that Mr. Jud Taylor, president of the Directors Guild of America\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Taylor, we are very pleased to greet you today and hear what you have to say. Jud Taylor, president, Directors Guild of America, Inc\n\nTESTIMONY OF JUD TAYLOR, PRESIDENT, DIRECTORS GUILD OF\nAMERICA, INC\n\nMr. TAYLOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a pleasure to be here. I certainly appreciate the opportunity the committee is providing the motion picture and television community to express its views on a critical issue which has substantial creative and financial ramifications for us\n\nI am president of the Directors Guild of America. Our guild has 6,270 members. The men and women who work in the field of directing theatrical films and television programs are instrumental in the shaping and artistic evolution of each product which is seen in a motion picture theater or on a home television screen\n\nThe Directors Guild is a large and diverse group of men and women having different talents, creative abilities and skills. As we work on films which emerge from studios or on locations in this city or elsewhere, our responsibilities vary according to our backgrounds, talent and seniority\n\nFilms require more than merely a director. In addition, there are production managers, first and second assistant directors and in live television there are stage managers, technical directors and associate directors. Each has a different role in the creation of a film, ranging from overall artistic supervision of the actors and actresses, in the case of directors, to such roles as organizing, budgeting, recordkeeping, staging of background actors, cueing of cameras and talent, et cetera\n\nBecause of our diversity, the salary scales of our guild members vary widely. And though we all read about directors receiving enormous salaries, at present, less than 1 percent of our membership earns in excess of $100,000 per year and the average income for the total Directors Guild membership is presently $17,000 and since that is an average figure, obviously, there are many that earn far less\n\nFrom those we consider to be in the work force, the current unemployment rate is 40 percent in all categories. Despite different economic circumstances based on experience and talent, all of the members of the Directors Guild must depend on the overall economic vitality of the motion picture and television film industries for our economic security. When this industry is suffering financially, our ability to help create movies and television shows is seriously limited and our livelihoods are in jeopardy\n\nNow, despite our skills and hard work, the products which we help create are by no means guaranteed to attract widespread public acceptance. In fact, very few of us are fortunate enough to direct many box office hits or top-rated television films. The tremendous financial risks of motion picture and television film production are such that our guild members could never survive in the industry if success at the box office or in the ratings alone determined whether a program could recoup its investment\n\nOur guild is most concerned at present that widespread use of video cassette recorders will seriously harm the American film and television industry and erode its financial viability because of the impact of this new technology on after-theater markets. Others will present testimony on this subject who are better informed than I to discuss the precise economic impact of the video cassette recorder on our industry. However, one does not have to be a renowned economist or a statistician to understand that when millions of copies of one of our programs are made for free use on home video cassette recorders, the incentive to pay to view our creation again has totally disappeared. This fact cannot be disputed\n\nWe believe that the legislation introduced by Congressman Don Edwards and cosponsored by 60 of his colleagues offers the best legislation to permit the public to view and tape our films and at the same time to establish a mechanism to compensate the film industry production companies, including all of the members of the Directors Guild of America\n\nAs president of the Directors Guild, I want to emphasize that our organization is only one segment of the creative and organizational structure which creates entertainment programs enjoyed by millions of Americans and by others in foreign nations. Our members generally are not seen on the screen. Few of us are household names. Fewer yet have swimming pools. Yet, we all take great pride in our work and we all depend on the vitality of the motion picture industry for our livelihood and our future\n\nI ask that the members of this committee consider this as you deliberate on the fate of this legislation and weigh the equities involved with this important issue. American consumers want access to quality entertainment programs\n\nDirectors Guild members want to work in an industry which will continue to provide innovative, quality films and employment for its members. I see no conflict between consumer needs and our industry's goals. However, I do believe that Congress must protect intellectual property and provide sound leadership in charting a course that will permit our members to have the economic security they must have to meet the public's expectations and, in a word, I guess what I am talking about is jobs, employment, and the health and progress and future of our industry\n\nThank you very much\n\n[Prepared statement of Mr. Taylor follows:]\n\n[One-page statement is essentially the same as the Taylor testimony.]\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. And I take it that your guild is made up of -- when you say directors, actually the 6,270 members are first assistants, second assistant directors, unit production managers, stage managers, technical director , all these other people, not merely what would be captioned as \"The Director\" of a film\n\nMr. TAYLOR, That is true. The directors make up approximately 58 percent of that number. The balance are that support team without which films obviously cannot be made\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. More than half of your membership does bear the title \"Director\"?\n\nMr. TAYLOR. That is right. Fifty-eight percent at present and the balance are in these other categories, which you have just mentioned\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you. Are there questions?\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. I have no questions. Thank you very much\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you very much\n\nThe Chair would next like to call Mr. Gene Allen, who is vice president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees & Moving Picture Operators of the United States and Canada\n\nTESTIMONY OF GENE ALLEN, VICE PRESIDENT. INTERNATIONAL\nALLIANCE OF THEATRICAL STAGE EMPLOYEES & MOVING PICTURE\nOPERATORS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA\n\nMr. ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and other than my name is Gene Allen, I won't read that again. We are known affectionately, and I hope it is affectionately, as the IA. I am also executive director of local 876, the Society of Motion Picture & Television Art Directors. And like others, it is a pleasure for me to b here on behalf of some 63,000 members of the IA to testify in strong support of H.R. 5705, the Home Recording Act of 1982. And I might mention that those 63,000 members are spread out across this country. We are not speaking of Hollywood. We are not representing just Hollywood or California, but the 63,000 are spread out across the United States\n\nThe IA feels that this legislation provides a mechanism to allow Americans to enjoy the fruits of modern technology, while providing those of use whose jobs depend on the health of the American motion picture industry a fair opportunity to be paid for our labors\n\nIn addition to stagehands and projectionists, the IA is made up of many crafts, property men and women, drapers, greensmen, decorators, photographers, lab workers, sound and cinetechnicians, costumers, makeup artists and hair stylists, production office coordinators, crafts service personnel, electricians, painters, professionals in first aid, editors, illustrators, and matte artists, scenic and title artists, publicists. cartoonists, set designers and modelmakers, story analysts, script supervisors, teachers. Now, you know why the end titles of movies go on and on as you go up the aisle\n\nThese IA members represent a pool of talent unequaled in the world and they depend for their livelihood on investors; independent producers, and major studios who are willing to take the considerable risk that the concept created by a writer and molded into a screenplay will be something millions of the world's citizens will be willing to pay to see\n\nThe IA supports the Home Recording Act because it is a means of making sure that those who fuel the industry by making investments can be assured that their copyrighted works are used by others only after receiving their permission\n\nWe support the act because across this country our members are out of work. The unemployment figures range from 40 to 60 percent and with that it is important for you to understand that when our members are out of work, our various health and welfare and pension plans suffer because employer and employee contributions are based on hours worked\n\nContrast that with the TDK automated tape plant in Japan that has no production workers. Profits in Japan by the manufacturers of VCR's and blank tapes are soaring. You heard testimony to that effect. We don't think it makes sense to export profits overseas at the expense of jobs at home. It is not fair and it is not right\n\nI know this is a complex subject and I am not a copyright expert, but H.R. 5705 seems to me, the IA, to strike the appropriate balance between protecting the economic incentive created by the copyright and the desire of Americans to use new technologies. It is fair legislation and we need it\n\nAnd I might just add that I don't think we were asked to come here to testify. I think we went to Mr. Valenti when we began to understand what we face in the future and we asked if we could be part of this panel because we have a great fear for these thousands of people that we represent. If the facts as presented here, and they certainly must be believed, are to come to fruition, then our people would be in trouble unless we have appropriate legislation\n\nSo, speaking for the international president, Walter Diehl, the general executive board, and the 63,000 members, I hope you will act to pass this vital, this very needed legislation\n\nThank you very much\n\n[The statement follows:]\n\n[Statement same as testimony.]\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Allen, and I might add that whether the committee invited you, whether you asked to come yourself or whether Mr. Valenti or anyone else suggested it is irrelevant. You are here and you do speak for 63,000 members and you have a statement and I really don't care how you happened to be here, but we are very pleased to have you here\n\nAlthough you raised a large issue, I notice the preceding witness also, Mr. Taylor, suggested that many of his people are out of work. I guess my question is, is this point unusual? Are you in a sort of decline at the moment with respect to employment or is this something that happens all the time because of the nature of your industry?\n\nMr. ALLEN. There have been other periods of unemployment in my career and I go back to 1936 as a blueprint boy at Warner Brothers and come up over all those years in various categories. I have never seen it as bad as this and it has been growing in the last 4 years to an alarming degree. The factors -- I am not making any case that any one thing caused that. Yet, what we have concern, a great concern, is that if it grows, if the numbers get larger and more of our people are out of work, their homes are gone. They are out of a business that they spent their lifetimes in and that the health and welfare plan designed to protect them, even in the area of retiree health and welfare, is going to seriously suffer, as will the pension plans themselves. We may in Hollywood have a reasonably sound pension plan. Other places in the country may not. My personal opinion, in Hollywood, the reason we have had a sound one is we never have been able to convince the employer to give us larger amounts of money per month to retire. It has always been through negotiations and they have kept it on the side of being a healthy plan, but that can go down drastically\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. That is why, in fact, I raised the question. Not, indeed, to understate the case or disagree necessarily with the case made by others, but whether the problem may be larger than a copyright problem that faces your industry. We were told that the United Auto Workers and others, you mentioned Japan, in competition with foreign production are seeking certain redress. Whether this is a larger trade problem or economic problem that goes well beyond the narrow copyright issue here isn't, to me, very clear. But I think your statement about unemployment among your members suggests that it might be\n\nMr. ALLEN. We feel that it has a direct bearing in it and what we are worried about is the growth of that problem caused by the entrepreneur not getting into the market. Unless there is the incentive for the producer to make the product, our people will not work\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Do you feel that we might approach this more generally with respect to, let's say, inhibiting certain foreign imports? Would this not also respond to this question?\n\nMr. ALLEN. I would not really answer the questions about imports or not imports. That isn't my area of expertise. I have very few areas of expertise. Mr. Valenti could probably tell me much more and yourself much more about that area\n\nMr. VALENTI. Mr. Chairman, may I speak up here, please?\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Valenti\n\nMr. VALENTI. I want to go on record as saying that the motion picture industry, and I hope I am including all of those who are allied with me today, we are free traders. We do not believe in duties and import quotas. We believe in free trade as long as trade is equal. At another time and another place, I can tell you about the problems we are having with Japan and being able to make a profit off of our pictures in Japan, simply because the entry to that marketplace is so riddled with barriers. There are many compulsions put upon us in the advertising end of pictures, where today the Japanese market is totally worthless to us as any profit market\n\nBut I am saying to you that we are opposed to anything that is not free trade. We think the marketplace should decide so long as you are competing equally and that means that the VCR must be licensed and then it competes equally with all the other marketplaces through which our pictures flow\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Well, I think I understand that position because the motion picture industry has been historically able to more than compete in the world and you would not want to abandon the open faith position in that regard\n\nMr. VALENTI. No, sir, not at all\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Railsback\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. I have no questions. Thank you for for your testimony\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Thank you\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you very much, Mr. Allen\n\nWe have two more witnesses. We are very sorry that someone who testified before this committee many times, Sanford Wolff, is not able to be here this afternoon. We originally hoped he might be, but in his stead, I understand that Howard Oliver, who is executive secretary of AFTRA, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, is here\n\nWhile Mr. Wolff has a rather lengthy statement, perhaps -- I don't know whether you are going to give the same statement or summarize it, but in any event we are pleased to have you here with us. We are sorry that Mr. Wolff isn't here today\n\nTESTIMONY OF HOWARD OLIVER. EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF\nAMERICAN FEDERATION OF TELEVISION AND RADIO ARTISTS\n\nMr. OLIVER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to be here. I am not going to read the entire statement. I wish I had some visual aids, but I don't have any with me, to enlighten the afternoon\n\nMy name is Wayne Oliver, Howard Wayne Oliver. I am the executive secretary of the Los Angeles local of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, acronym AFTRA, AFL-CIO. I am, as you say, substituting for AFTRA's national executive secretary, Sanford Wolff, who was unable to be here today\n\nMr. Chairman, I ask that Mr. Wolff's prepared statement be included for the record\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Without objection, it will be received and made part of the record\n\nMr. OLIVER. Thank you, sir\n\nI would like briefly to reiterate one or two points made by Mr. Wolff in his statement. AFTRA is the collective bargaining representative for over 70,000 actors, singers, dancers, newspersons, announcers, disc jockeys, and other professionals who entertain and inform the public from coast to coast on television, radio, sound recordings, slides, films, and cable. We exist in over 40 locals throughout the United States\n\nUnless we do something to insure that the creators of the material are not exploited by the electronics revolution, that same revolution which will make it possible for almost every household to have an audio and video recorder will surely undermine, cripple, and eventually wash away the very industries on which it feeds and which provide employment for thousands of our citizens\n\nFor example, the unemployment rate among union members in the entertainment industry in this area alone is already 50 percent. One of the assertions that opponents of H.R. 5705 are making which we find particularly offensive is that its principal beneficiaries will be the wealthy copyright owners such as motion picture producers, television networks, and record companies, which have no need for additional income\n\nLet me assure you, Mr. Chairman, that nothing could be further from reality. Certainly we would not be testifying in favor of the legislation if that were true. Granted, the royalty fees under H.R. 5705 will be paid to the copyright owners. However, you can be certain that AFTRA and the other unions in the entertainment industry will, as the record shows they have done in the past, bargain collectively to obtain an equitable share of those fees for their members who produce and perform in the audio and visual materials for which those fees are paid, just as we have for, over the years, network, syndicated television, pay cable, pay television, public television, including reuse fees\n\nAnd though AFTRA members are probably on the whole the best paid and most consistently employed workers in the entertainment industry, a fact in which we take great pride, they as a group are far from being affluent. Some of our members are; many are not. There aren't that many swimming pools really\n\nTo conclude, we see the passage of H.R. 5705 as a matter vital to our members. Without compensation to copyright owners, the industry in which our members labor will be harmed. If this were to occur, the already high level of unemployment in industry would surely worsen and that none of us want\n\nThank you\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you very much, Mr. Oliver\n\nDo I understand from not only you but the preceding witnesses, your membership is experiencing a sort of recession in terms of employment. Is that correct?\n\nMr. OIAVER. We are experiencing, some of that, yes. I can't give you statistics on it. I know that the number of persons seeking help from our sick fund has increased considerably in the last 6 months for several reasons\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. One of your companion labor organizations, I notice, is not here today, Screen Actors Guild. Is there any reason for that? Do they, as far as you know, support the same objective?\n\nMr. OLIVER. I can't speak to that\n\nMr. VALENTI. Mr. Chairman, I can. The Screen Actors Guild, the Producers Guild, and the Writers Guild are all part of this coalition, but since their testimony would be more or less the same, Mr. Taylor, in a sense, was speaking for the creative guilds and, of course, Mr. Eastwood belongs to three of those guilds\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. He does have a swimming pool\n\nMr. VALENTI. We wanted to spare you the burden, but the Screen Actors Guild is wholeheartedly in favor of this bill\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Railsback\n\nMr. . RAILSBACK. I really have no questions and thank you very much\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. I, too, join in thanking you\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Well, you can report back to Mr. Wolff things went rather easy today\n\nOur last witness today is Mr. Jack Copeland. He is the chairman of the Copyright Committee of the Training Media Distributors Association. I am sure he will tell us just what that is\n\nMr. Copeland\n\nTESTIMONY OF JACK L. COPELAND, CHAIRMAN, COPYRIGHT\nCOMMITTEE, TRAINING MEDIA DISTRIBUTORS ASSOCIATION\n\nMr. COPELAND. Thank your very much. It is a pleasure to be here\n\nMy name is Jack Copeland. I am chairman of the Copyright Committee of the training Media Distributors Association. Our association, known among it members as TMDA, represents 25 organizations, mostly small businesses -- and I might add, we are located throughout the United States. They are importantly involved in the producing and distributing of several thousand standardized audiovisual training programs, primarily motion pictures. These films are used by business, industry, Government, and education throughout the world\n\nEvery major organization in the United States depends to some degree on TMDA members' programs. We are today playing an essential role in the achieving of the productivity goals which are so important to American industry, Government and individuals. I might add on that score that we are looking today at a $3 trillion gross national product that we are hopefully in the process of influencing. If the influence of our materials is a scant 1 percent, that is a $30 billion figure\n\nToday, our programs are helping organizations like General Motors, Chrysler, United States Steel, and literally thousands of others upgrade management and the skills of their workers. We are training millions of workers in Government agencies, the Armed Forces, hospitals, stores, offices, and factories throughout our land in everything from computer operations, management training, and food service to sales, motivation and health care\n\nOur members have literally thousands of programs on virtually every important area of human endeavor and we,have invested tens of millions of dollars in the future of the training media industry\n\nIn the past our members sold or rented copies of their programs in the so-called non-theatrical market to customers who exhibit them by direct projection in their own organizations. But we see a different scenario in the future, one which involves the additional, secondary activity of television bringing important educational and training programs into American homes where people, both adolescents and adults, will receive individualized instruction on important subjects relating to their work and health under highly efficient and economical circumstances\n\nWe believe that the growth of cable systems and low-power television broadcasting stations will offer us an unparalleled opportunity. We shall at last reach the select audiences with highly specialized interests. We foresee a time when training and education, which today takes place on the job or in the school, will take place in the home\n\nWe foresee a time when we can bring valuable instructional knowledge to shut-ins, the housewife and mother attempting to develop skills for the world of work, students, senior citizens and workers with little time to go to school after a hard day at the office, all of whom want a better, more rewarding life, all of which they can be helped to attain through the use of our members' programs\n\nA growing number of our members' programs are already being used as informational programing for television and we see this activity as essential for our industry's future economic health. We are, therefore, vitally concerned with the issue of off-the-air video taping in the home, its proper control and proper compensation for copyright owners\n\nOur members generally agree that the permanent availability of their programs in the home, onced taped, will adversely affect the market for the sale and rental of copies, both to organizations and to the home video market. Home video taping will also diminish potentiality for future television reruns. All of this must be considered along with another factor, our experience which indicates that the receipts from televising our programs will fall far short of our production costs. We must, therefore, continue to look to other sources of revenue such as the nontheatrical market an royalty income\n\nWe recognize that home video recording is a technological reality. We must accept it and work with it creatively and positively. We only ask that legislation legalizing this activity do two things: First, institute a reasonable method to compensate copyright owners and, second, be strictly limited to private use of the copies\n\nIt is our position that any law which would authorize the free, uncontrolled off-the-air taping of our members' programs in a school, factory, office or home environment would be tantamount to the legalization of theft and the destruction of our small, but very vital industry. It is not inconceivable that dozens of offices in any organization could easily be equipped with inexpensive video recorders. Massive copying could take place. Many individual businesses already possess hundreds of video cassette player recorders\n\nAfter careful study our board of directors has concluded that H.R. 5705, the Edwards' bill, and amendment 1333 to S. 1758, the Mathias, Baker, Byrd amendment, meet our criteria for a proper approach to the off-the-air video taping in the home. Their scope is confined to home use only and they provide for a practical, compulsory royalty approach\n\nWe shall, of course, continue to be concerned should these measures become law, that the ultimate royalty formula reflects just compensation for the use of works belong to our memhers\n\nWe also support the provisions in these measures which permit copyright owners to control the rental, lease, or lending of copies of their works. The free market isn't working efficiently or effectively to accomplish this necessary end. Restrictions by our members are currently built into cumbersome written agreements which interfere with the smooth transaction of daily business. H.R. 5705 recognizes that rental, lease, and lending are rights which must be reserved to copyright owners to prevent undue exploitation\n\nLet me share with you the type of horror story that has accompanied this unauthorized subdistribution activity. Here is an example. We produce a very valuable training program. The audience for it is highly limited. There might be 1,000 potential customers in the entire country. Copies are sold to an organization, ostensibly for the purpose of internal training. Later, the organization decides to rent or loan out the program for either direct or indirect gain. By advertising, the organization soon reaches a significant percent age of the producer's potential market\n\nIt has taken no risk, spent no development money and may already have derived full value from the program by utilizing it for internal training. Unbelievable? Not at all. Most training media distributors live with the constant threat of this possibility and have had to contend with it on numerous occasions\n\nThe members of the Training Media Distributors Association wish to emphasize that an important group of producers/distributors, those who make training media, are not big business and are not involved in the entertainment business. They utilize the techniques of Hollywood, to be sure, but the results of their work are to serve the more serious needs of our society\n\nWeakening laws by making strawmen out of the entertainment industry can only result in severely damaging the specialized copy right owners who are members of the Training Media Distributors Association\n\nWe respectfully submit that H.R. 5705 and amendment 1333 to S. 1758 strike a proper balance between the needs of copyright owners, including TMDA members, and a public armed with tremendous technological power within the home. We encourage you to support these measures and look forward to answering any questions that you may have\n\nThank you very much\n\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Copeland follows:]\n\n[Two-page statement the same as Copeland's testimonny.]\n\nSTATEMENT OF JACK L. COPELAND\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Copeland. I am not altogether that knowledgeable about these problems, but it seems to a very great extent that your problem is not just of their videotaping in the home, but is an extension of the first sale doctrine problem that other film distribution -- commercial films and others have; that is to say, how the film is subsequently used or reproduced, once sold. Isn't that part of your problem?\n\nMr. COPELAND. Well, I think that one is a present problem and the other is a problem that will become of growing importance in the future. The first sale problem is a current problern.that we all live with at the present time. The off-the-air taping in the home activity is something that we see of tremendous importance in the future. If this whole question of the unlimited access afforded by cable television is to become a reality, then the kinds of products that we have must become ever more important to the viewing audience in the home and, therefore, the potential for off-the-air copying is ever more important to us\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. It is my impression that what you refer to, nonetheless, is dealt with in the bill, that the bill does deal with all of these problems. It is not in that sense a tiny bill. I does encompass a series of problems\n\nThank you for your testimony. It was very helpful\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Could I ask, are there efforts being made to prevent reproduction of off-the-air programing? Can you give us an idea, if you know, how it works?\n\nMr. COPELAND. Are you referring to technological effort?\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Yes, exactly\n\nMr. COPELAND. I am sorry. I don't have any familiarity with that and I might say that I know of nothing at this time that would achieve that purpose\n\nMr. RARSIBACK. I wonder -- do any of the witnesses -- Mr. Valenti, do you -- know about that --\n\nMr. VALENTI. I know of no technological device at this time that would bar taping in the home and if it did exist, it would only be a matter of days before the Japanese manufacturers would have an override piece of equipment on their machine and you would start from ground zero again\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Getting back to your statement, you are really in a little bit of a different position than, say, the motion picture producers in that you are producing something that is distinguished from just pure recreation and really has, I guess, what is called a societal value and that -- I am curious if you are familiar with that, I think it was the Williams and Wilkins Company case. What is your feeling about the outcome in that case? In other words, they were medical articles that were being reproduced in large quantities and it was held that there was fair use in that case\n\nMr. COPELAND. Yes, I have some familiarity with that case. I am not a lawyer, however, and don't know all of the ramifications of it. Therefore, I can't comment beyond the point of saying that we would be deeply concerned with any type of uncontrolled, unlicensed copying of our materials\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. In other words, it is your view that in your case, say a reproduction of one of your training programs in iis entirety and the distribution of that program certainly under no circumstances should constitute a fair use exception\n\nMr. COPELAND. Absolutely not. And you mentioned about the societal value of what we do. We feel that our business is the training of America and the members of our association are the primary forces in that activity\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Thank you\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. The gentlewoman from Colorado\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. I really appreciate your testimony. You did say that you were a little concerned about how the copyright moneys or the royalty moneys would be distributed. Is that because of how the bill is written or is that just because of how you wonder how all of this will unravel?\n\nMr. COPELAND. I really think it is the latter. I would say that our concern would be that when the time comes to sit down and discuss and negotiate, that our members would be given fair consideration. And, frankly, I am confident that that would be the case\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. But you are not asking for any specific amendment or anything? You are happy with the bill the way it is written at this moment?\n\nMr. COPELAND. Yes, I am\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Thank you very much\n\nMr. K.ASTENMEIER. Thank you, Mr. Copeland, for your testimony\n\nThat concludes the witnesses. I do have two questions I would like to put to Mr. Valenti. They are general questions, but I think they ought to be dealt with. One is about the court decision and the status of the litigation\n\nDo you have a special anticipation of what the Supreme Court will do with this? When it might be disposed of judicially? Do you have any information on that score?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Mr. Chairman, my seer quality does not extend to those dimensions. My answer is no, sir. I have no indication of any kind as to what the Supreme Court will or will not do\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. But you are prepared to move to a legislative solution, notwithstanding the fact it is still in litigation?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Yes --\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. On the assumption that the legislative solution to this would obviate the necessity of further litigation as far as the Sony case is concerned?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Yes, that is right, Mr. Chairman, because I think the ninth circuit said in its decision that is merely said it was copyright infringement and if there were damages due, it would hand it back to the district court. But it said in order to deal with the situation that there ought to be some mechanism and it suggested that copyright royalty fee. Now, whether that is administered by a court, as under the consent decree ASCAP is so administered, or whether it is done by the National Legislature or either alternative. We suggest that the National Legislature is the best way to handle it. Set up the mechanism, put it in force, and let it go forward\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. My second question goes to audio. While we will hear from representatives of the industry on Wednesday, nonetheless, of course, the first versions of the bill that you had given support to did not include audio, and I am wondering -- and because of the distinction drawn by the ninth circuit with respect to audio and visual use in the home, I am wondering what your position is. That is to say, obviously, you are supporting the second bill, 5705, but I am wondering are you willing to sink or swim: on whether audio is included?\n\nMr. VALENTI. I am very much in favor of audio being included, Mr. Chairman. I like to have audio there as a prime example of the latter part of the picture of Dorian Gray, if my metaphor doesn't get a bit too fancy, and that is to see what happens when an industry is absolutely devastated by recording instruments and the audio business is there. It is collapsing right before our very eyes and, therefore, I am very much in favor of the same kind of treatment\n\nObviously, it would have to be done a different way because there would be different mechanisms and apparatus of the marketplace, but the general concept of a copyright royalty fee for the use of somebody else's product is equally as appropriate in audio as it is in video\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. We have off-the-air taping, as you know, for educational purposes where there is a fair use, so there isn't absolutely pure principle. There are adjustments\n\nMr. VALENTI. I am suggesting that the copyright royalty fee lives under the canopy of fair use. The ninth circuit examined the four measures of fair use for video and dismissed all of them summarily, saying that they did not apply. Now, I am not knowledgeable about the legal background, the legal ancestry of the audio, as I am the video, but within the perimeters of fair use, we are talking about copyright royalty fee. I do know the ninth circuit dealt summarily and severely with the Japanese claims of fair use for their VCR's. They just threw that out the window\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Then you are aware that they distinguished between video use as a fair use question in the home, and audio?\n\nMr. VALENTI. That is right\n\nMr. KAbTENMEIER. And your position is that they were wrong on audio\n\nMr. VALENTI. No --\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. The ninth circuit was wrong. Is that what you are saying?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. I can't say that. As I said, I haven't applied my scrutiny with as much vigor to the audio as I have video. I am having enough trouble handling one side of this problem. But I am really saying that within the boundaries of what fair use is, within those boundaries, that wherever it leaks over the boundary of fair use, that I think audio is entitled to copyright royalty fees in that spillover beyond the limits of fair use, whatever they are and I am not prepard to discuss them right here. I would have to do a little home work on that\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Railsback, any questions?\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. Thank you, I do, Mr. Chairman\n\nThe ninth circuit, although it did seem to distinguish audio from video really did not deal with liability for audio. Am I right?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Let me confer with my counsel over here. Is that correct?\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. I think that is correct and what thye actually pointed out is that in the 1976 act we had actually removed report language that had been in the legislative history in the report accompanying the Record Piracy Act back in the early seventies, but they were very careful, I think, to point out, I believe, that that particular language was not picked up in our 1976 House report\n\nMr. VALENTI. My counsel, Mr. Jankowski\n\nMr. RAILSBACK.Yeah, a very bright guy. That is right\n\nNow, your industry has been called very resilient, I forget who called it that, but I think it is. From your standpoint, representing the motion picture industry, wouldn't it be a likely happening that if we don't do anything what could result would be more pay cable television, more video cassettes sold by the industry itself, less network showing, and less syndicated showings, which would then impact on free television viewing?\n\nMr. VALENTI. Mr. Railsback, I quoted from the Mediastat survey in which the Mediastat people, attending to one of your questions, said that one VCR owner wrote in his diary why buy prerecorded movies? You can record the same thing from a pay cable channel for lots cheaper. In my judgment, we will find the sale of prerecorded cassettes begin to decline as pay cable expands. The question, Mr Railsback, is not to try to balance out everything so that you can have like a balance sheet of what you lose and what you gain --\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. No, I know that. I am not asking that. What I am saying is it would seem to me that if I were in your shoes -- you know, I am just curious about this and if we don't do anything and there is the expected impact that you predict on your network sales, your syndicated sales, I would think that the motion picture industry would then try to do something different, which might have an adverse -- could have an adverse impact on, say, the public, because you would be losing some of your free viewing\n\nMr. VALENTI. Absolutely, Mr. Railsback. There are two things here. First, nobody, pay cable or nobody is going to pay for value they don't receive. Right now, you have a situation in the pay cable market where one company so dominates the pay cable market, they set the prices, HBO. They have about 70 percent of the business. Now, if you don't like their price, you don't have to do business with HBO, but you only have 30 percent of the market left to do business with. So, as a result, maybe the average price per subscriber is in the 8- to 10-cent category overall\n\nNo. 2, 1 think, from the standpoint of elected officials, that you have a right to look at the public interest in this thing and if there is a diminution in the amount and quality of programing that goes on free television, advertiser-supported television, it will have a singularly deleterious impact on those people who cannot afford these expensive machines or who don't even have access to cable. Now, that is the point I made earlier and I am saying to you that that will have a big impact\n\nNow, the program producer, if you insist that you are not going to license this one unlicensed market, the VCR, he is going to figure out some way to live with that and he may figure out ways which are anathematical to the public interest; that is, people who depend on home entertainment. He might do that\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. That is what I am asking. What would he do?\n\nMr. VALENTI . Well, for one thing you would cut back on your production. You wouldn't take his risk. Last year we put out 200 movies. We may cut back to 100 movies. Mr. Orear, who has unhappily had to depart, he would go out of business if we cut back our production in half. I mean, he literally would because you can't keep a movie in a theater if nobody wants to see it. You have to get rid of it and have a new movie come in. So, he needs a large supply. The same thing would happen with network and if you didn't have that kind of programing that the advertisers are going to pay for, you would have a subtraction in what the public has to offer -- I mean, what the public is offered\n\nThe scenarios can be written any number of ways, but I can assure you of this, prudent businessmen will adjust to whatever it is that you put before them\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. I guess, you know, I find a difference between home recording off the air of regular television programing and, say, somebody recording the pay -- say, somebody that has pay cable and, as you pointed out, there are a lot of homes that do not have access to cable. But I am just saying, even where somebody has cable and has subscribed to pay cable, at least in that case they have paid a fee or they have paid for the reception of that pay cable. It is a little bit different than recording, I think, something for which they haven't paid anything off the air\n\nMr. VALENTI. Mr. Railsback, let me respond this way. What they paid for is the same thing you and I pay for when we go into a theater. We go into a theater; we pay $4 to see that movie, but you don't bring a recording instrument in with you\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. A lot of people bring in audio to concerts\n\nMr. VALENTI. Well, that is what is wrong -- that is one of the problems that is wrong with the audio business today. That is why it is going down the tubes\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. We are going to hear from them --\n\nMr. VALENTI. You are going to hear from them on Wednesday. What I am saying to you, on the other hand, if you have 40 million pay cable homes, as you will have in a few short years, it is those pay cable homes who will be mostly owning VCR's and if you have 40 million and they are recording -- 25 to 30 million of them are recording \"Superman II\" or \"Firefox,\" No. 1, HBO knows that. They are not going to pay you a lot of money for the second, third and fourth run of that picture because it has already been recorded and nobody is going to watch it. No. 2, the networks will know it and they will know that the audience has diminished for the subsequent showing of that on network television and so forth on down the line\n\nAny time you imprison on tape to put in your permanent collection and see three or four times, by the time it goes on network television, your want to see has diminished severely. All of that goes into the marketing of a film and we are dealing with smart people. They have as good polling instincts and apparatus as we do. They know what is going on out there\n\nNow, the problem with 2 million, 3 million today, that is not what we are talking about, but this is growing exponentially. The Japanese already say this -- and this year they sold 2.5 million. They are probably going to sell 3.5 and then to 4 and then to 5 and then to 6 and pretty soon you got 40 million of those bloody machines out there and then you have a whole new universe\n\nMr. RAILSBACK. I didn't mean to give you that carte blanc opportunity\n\nMr. VALENTI. I am sorry, Mr. Railsback\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. The gentlewoman from Colorado\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Well, I thank you very much. We have kept you much longer than we said we would. You have done a wonderful job and everybody has done a great job that was here. One of the things that I hear in the cloakroom as I try to talk to people about this bill is their fear about not setting the fee the first time in the bill so that they know what it is. I guess there is a fear of delegating to the Royalty Tribunal that authority and I am wondering if we were to put in there the first time fee and then it is reviewed after 5 years -- I realize you can't answer \"yes\" or \"no' at this time\n\nMr. VALENTI. The answer is \"Yes,\" Mrs. Schroeder, something that is just and reasonable; we would have no problem with that at all\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. I guess I am looking at it from marketing. I am very pleased that you are seeing the audio and the other together because I think the audio shows what happens if the recorder suddenly starts selling for $30 and they can be -- so, I am really pleased that those are joined. And, as I say, from my marketing of it then, from other members or talking to them about it, I find that is one of their biggest fears\n\nMr. VALENTI. No barrier, Mrs. Schroeder. We would be absolutely delighted to discuss it, just a reasonable fee. We have no objections at all with what is in the bill\n\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Thank you\n\nMr. KASTENMEIER. Well, on behalf of the committee, we wish to compliment you, Mr. Valenti, and all of the witnesses who appeared here today.

sleet witht the widow Nolan\u2019s goats and the Brownes girls neats anyhow, wait till I tell you, what did he do, poor old Roderick O\u2019Conor Rex, the aus-picious waterproof monarch of all Ireland, when he found him \u2014 self all alone by himself in his grand old handwedown pile after all of them had all gone off with themselves to their castles of mud, as best they cud, on footback, owing to the leak of the McCarthy\u2019s mare, in extended order, a tree\u2019s length from the longest way out, down the switchbackward slidder of the land-sown route of Hauburnea\u2019s liveliest vinnage on the brain, the unimportant Parthalonians with the mouldy Firbolgs and the Tuatha de Danaan googs and the ramblers from Clane and all the rest of the notmuchers that he did not care the royal spit out of his ostensible mouth about, well, what do you think he did, sir, but, faix, he just went heeltapping through the winespilth and weevily popcorks that were kneedeep round his own right royal round rollicking toper\u2019s table, with his old Roderick Ran-dom pullon hat at a Lanty Leary can't on him and Mike Brady\u2019s shirt and Greene\u2019s linnet collarbow and his Ghenter\u2019s gaunts and his Macclefield\u2019s swash and his readymade Reillys and his pan-prestuberian poncho, the body you\u2019d pity him, the way the world is, poor he, the heart of Midleinster and the supereminent lord of them all, overwhelmed as he was with black ruin like a sponge out of water, allocutioning in bellcantos to his own oliverian society MacGuiney\u2019s Dreans of Ergen Adams

"Travelin\u2019 Prayer Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHey Lord, take a look all around\nAnd I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be\nHey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight\n'Cause she is far across the sea\nHey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight\nAnd make sure that she's gonna be alright\nAnd things are gonna be alright with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight\nAnd make sure that all her dreams are sweet\nSaid now, would ya guide her on the roads\nAnd make them softer for her feet\nHey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight\nAnd make sure that she's gonna be alright\nUntil she's home and here with me\n[Verse 3]\nHey, Lord would ya look out for her tonight\nIf she is sleepin' under the sky\nSaid now, make sure the ground she's sleepin' on\nIs always warm and dry\nUmmm, don'tcha give her too much rain\nTry to keep her away from pain\nBecause my baby hates to cry\n\n[Verse 4]\nHey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight\n'Cause it gets rough along the way\nSaid now, this song seems strange is just because\nI don't know how to pray\nUmm, won'tcha give her peace of mind\nAnd if you ever find the time\nWon'tcha tell her I miss her everyday\n\n[Verse 5]\nHey Lord, take a look all around\nAnd I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be\nHey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight\nCause she is far across the sea\nHey Lord, would ya look out for her

through Nebraska whinin'\nDoin' a hundred twenty, man the fields was bendin' over\nHeadin' out for the mountains knowin' we was travelin' further\nAll our fires were blazin'\nAnd the spinnin' wheels were turnin' turnin'\nHad my girl beside me brother brother she was burnin' burnin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nUp walked  a Baptist preachin' southern funky school teacher\nShe had a line on something heavy but we couldn't reach her\nWe told her that we needed something that would get us goin'\nShe put out all she had and laid it on the counter showin'\nAll I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up\nThe cops came bustin' in\nAnd then we lit out in a pickup truck and go\n[Chorus]\nGet out of Denver better go go\nGet out of Denver better go\nGet out of Denver better go go\nGet out of Denver cause you

had to pinch each other just to see if we were dreamin'\nMade it to Loveland Pass in under less than half an hour\nLord it started drizzlin' and it turned into a thunder shower\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe rain was drivin' but the Caddy kept on burnin' rubber\nWe kept on drivin' till we ran through some fog for cover\nWe couldn't see a thing, somehow we just kept on goin'\nWe kept on drivin' all night long

AWAKENS\n\nLuke Skywalker has vanished.\nIn his absence, the sinister\nFIRST ORDER has risen from\nthe ashes of the Empire\nand will not rest until\nSkywalker, the last Jedi,\nhas been destroyed.\nWith the support of the\nREPUBLIC, General Leia Organa\nleads a brave RESISTANCE.\nShe is desperate to find her\nbrother Luke and gain his\nhelp in restoring peace\nand justice to the galaxy.\n\nLeia has sent her most daring\npilot on a secret mission\nto Jakku, where an old ally\nhas discovered a clue to\nLuke's whereabouts....\n\nPAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is\nFELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --\nHURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the\nMoon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a\nHangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\nA GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an Instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER STORMTROOPER, then it's gone\nThe FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We ARE IN:\n\nINT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT\nTWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING QUIET:\nEXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\nWIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of\nNative animals. A single wind chime. suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY, orange and white, this is BB-8. Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND ROLLS OFF FAST --\nINT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT\n\nCLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it\nIn a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged, kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:\n\nLOR SAN TEKKA\nThis will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the Galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force.\n\nPOE\nWell, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time.\n\nLOR SAN TEKKA\n\"The General.\" To me, she's royalty. Well, she certainly is that.\n\nBB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San\nTekka.\n\nPOE (CONT'D)\nWe've got company.\n\nEXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT\nThe men exit fast.Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS\nPOE'S POV:LIGHTS on the horizon-- approaching ENEMY SHIPS\nPOE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.\n\nPOE\nYou have to hide.\n\nLOR SAN TEKKA\nYou have to leave. Go!\nPoe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off. BB-8 follows.\n\nEXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\nTRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,  various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position,prepared to defend.\n\nEXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\nA ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK \u2013 many are HIT!\n\nEXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\nPoe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the\nVillage, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.\n\nPOE\nCome on, BB-8! Hurry!\nPoe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he\nMoves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the\nCANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES  IN THE DISTANCE. Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS. The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE! But just then: Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!\n\nPOE (CONT'D)\nI see 'em!\nBB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster! The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS! Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL. They're in trouble.\n\nEXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\nLor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.\n\nEXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\nBack at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from\nThe leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.\n\nPOE\nYou take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me?\n(BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)\nI'll come back for you! It will be alright.\n\nBB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns\nAnd heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS\nAWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers from cover.\n\nEXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\nThe Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is\nHIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help. The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN\nHAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by the battle.\n\nAN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL -- LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES\nThe shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke\nKYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides through the chaos toward San Tekka. A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders HIM:\n\nSENIOR TROOPER\nStay here.\nOur Trooper nods. Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.\n\nKYLO REN\nLook how old you've become.\n\nLOR SAN TEKKA\nSomething far worse has happened to you.\nOur blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other stormtroopers.\n\nKYLO REN\nYou know what I've come for.\n\nLOR SAN TEKKA\nI know where you come from. Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.\n\nKYLO REN\nThe map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order.\nAdjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San Tekka exchange continue.\n\nLOR SAN TEKKA\nThe First Order rose from the Dark Side... you did not.\n\nKYLO REN\nI'll show you the dark side.\n\nLOR SAN TEKKA\nYou may try, but you cannot deny the truth that is your family.\nSuddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT --PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ --YELLOW/RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE --\n\nKYLO REN\nYou're so right.\nAnd as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA, Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES AT KYLO REN! Instantly:  Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR! Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to. He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren.A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's legs -- he lands hard on his knees. Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe.\n\nPOE\nSo who talks first? You talk first?\n\nKYLO REN\nThe old man gave it to you.\n\nPOE\n(INDICATES KYLO'S MASK)\nIt's just very hard to understand you with all the...\n\nKYLO REN\n(TO TROOPERS)\nSearch him!\n\nPOE\n... Apparatus.\nThe Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a\nBrutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. Poe just glares as the pat down ends.\n\nSTORMTROOPER #1\nNothing, sir.\n\nKYLO REN\nPut him on board.\nKylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up\nVillagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-CAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA.\n\nCAPTAIN PHASMA\nSir, the villagers...\n\nKYLO REN\nKill them all!\nPhasma nods, steps forward:\n\nCAPTAIN PHASMA\nOn my command!\nThe Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers.\n\nCAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D)\nFire!\nPoe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS\nAll around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH \u2013 except ours. Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS. Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows he's doomed. Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE, scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.\n\nEXT. EDGE OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\nA Stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of Poe's X-wing.\n\nBACKS AWAY:\n\nSTORMTROOPER #2\nNothing here. Go ahead!\nThree other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing -- destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION.\n\nEXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\nBB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL\nBB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark  desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING\nFrom the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps going. In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and frightened.\n\nEXT. SPACE - NIGHT\n\nWith the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER.\n\nINT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT\n\nPoe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the\nHangar. He is awed by the imposing space.\n\nPOE\nAll right. All right!\nOur Stormtrooper passes, moves fast:\n\nINT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT\n\nOur Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his\nHelmet. His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But in this moment, terrified, desperate. After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187 knows he's in trouble.\n\nCAPTAIN PHASMA\nFN-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection.\n\nFN-2187\nYes, Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN PHASMA\nAnd who gave you permission to remove that helmet?\n\nFN-2187\nI'm sorry, Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN PHASMA\nReport to my division at once!\n\nPhasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nA metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it.Uses TOOLS to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a  valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL, swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:\n\nINT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER\n\nAlone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS HARD onto rusty metal.\n\nINT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY\n\nThe Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found\nPiece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through\nThe dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT;\n\nEXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY\n\nThe Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young WOMAN. This is REY, 19.\nShe opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:\nRey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC\nENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND  of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of  sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune. She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER, tiny from here.Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputter  engine and DRIVES OFF.\n\nEXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY\n\nRey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED SPACESHIPS.\n\nEXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY\n\nRey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town.\nRefueling, small trade, scavengers. CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from her speeder toward the town.\n\nEXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY\n\nTIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage. Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning some salvage. Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small  passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another  language. She returns to work.\n\nINT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY\nRey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish, unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:\n\nUNKAR\nWhat you've brought me today is worth... Hmmm... One quarter portion.\nThough disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks\nUnkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:\nDRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.\nShe takes it. She swallows her resentment and heads off.\n\nEXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY\n\nThe IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's\nSPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.\n\nINT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY\n\nShe SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;\nAnother DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks. A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine. Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed. She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old plate. Grabs the loaf.\n\nEXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK\n\nRey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop. Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET, just 'cause. Puts it on. WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.\nThen, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up. Helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off. Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in A NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small Brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself. Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:\n\nREY\nTal'ama parqual!\nThe Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.\n\nREY (CONT'D)\nParqual zatana!\nA half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening. BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching a tennis match. Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch. Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks Out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and says, fiercely:\n\nREY (CONT'D)\nNOMA!\nThe Teedo barks a sort of \"AHHHHH!\"(As if to say, \"GO TO\nHELL!\"),Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.\n\nREY (CONT'D)\nShhhh\nBB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off. Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him\n\nREY (CONT'D)\nThat's just Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone... Your antenna's bent.\n(considers BB-8 for  the first time, STRAIGHTENS THE ANTENNA)\nWhere do you come from?\n(BB-8 BEEPS)\nClassified. Really? Me too. Big secret.\n(points to horizon)\nNiima Outpost is that way, stay off Kelvin Ridge.\nREY (CONT'D)\nKeep away from the Sinking Fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand.\n(stands, heads off)\n\nBB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops.\n\nREY (CONT'D)\nDon't follow me. Town is that way!\n(he BEEPS again)\nNo!\nShe heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else - This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, \"Come On.\" BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.\n\nREY (CONT'D)\nIn the morning, you go.\n(HE BEEPS)\nYou're welcome.\nThe two disappear behind a dune.\n\nEXT.

No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map.\n\nPOE\nMight wanna rethink your technique.\nKylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in  the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence --\n\nKYLO REN\nWhere is it?\n\nPOE\nThe Resistance will not be intimidated by you.\n\nKYLO REN\nWhere... is it?\nPoe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO:\n\nINT.

Come on.\nShe tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her.\n\nINT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY\n\nRey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window. He reviews her goods. He glances quickly at BB-8.\n\nUNKAR\nThese five pieces are worth... Let me see here... One half portion.\n\nREY\n(OBJECTS)\nLast week they were a half portion each.\nShe hates him. He leans forward.\n\nUNKAR\nWhat about the droid?\n\nREY\nWhat about him?\n\nUNKAR\nI'll pay for him...\nBB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious.\n\nUNKAR (CONT'D)\nSixty portions!\nCLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of food, her stomach practically rumbles. BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this conversation at all. She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all. Finally, she hears herself say:\n\nREY\nActually... the droid's not for sale.\n(TO BB-8)\nCome on!\nUnkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar watches her go with dark eyes. He picks up a communicator:\n\nUNKAR\nFollow the girl and get that droid!\nHe SLAMS the service window door SHUT.\n\nINT.

He gets up -- moves toward it, calling out:\n\nFINN\nPoe! Poe!\nFinn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER\nSMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it.

In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.\n\nFINN\nWater... water... water..\nHe sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.\n\nFINN (CONT'D)\n-- Awgh, GAH!\nBut he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE. ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically BEEPING BB-8. Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8 while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS OVER METAL URNS for sale -- Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING. He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted -- but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard. Finn just watches, stunned. Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM. Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!\nRey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...\nSEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something\nInsane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.\n\nREY\n(To BB-8) Who? Him?\nFinn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant. Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT HIM, quarterstaff in hand.Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF! Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She holds the staff on him threateningly:\n\nREY\nWhat's your hurry, thief?\n\nFINN\nWhat--?! Thief?\nBB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN!\n\nFINN (CONT'D)\nOW! HEY! What?!\n\nREY\nThe jacket! This droid says you stole it!\n\nFINN\nI've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!!\n(BB-8 has ZAPPED him  AGAIN)\nSTOP IT!\n\nREY\nWhere'd you get it? It belongs to his master.\nFinn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard decision:tell the truth.\n\nFINN\nIt belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right?\nRey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.\n\nFINN (CONT'D)\nHe was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed.\n(RELIVING IT)\nPoe didn't make it\n(sees BB-8 is sad,  ROLLS OFF)\nLook, I tried to help him. I'm  sorry...\nBB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8.Then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:\n\nREY\nSo you're with the Resistance?\n\nFinn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie.\n\nFINN\nObviously. Yes. I am. I'm with Resistance, yeah.\n(WHISPERS)\nI'm with the Resistance.\nRey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:\n\nREY\nI've never met a Resistance fighter before.\n\nFINN\nWell, this is what we look like.Some of us.Others look different.\n\nREY\nBB-8 says he's on a secret mission.\nHe has to get back to your base.\n\nFINN\nApparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and  everyone's after it.\nShe turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:\n\nREY\nLuke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth.\nJust then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees...\n\nREY (CONT'D)\nWhat is it?\nRey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!\nFinn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:\n\nREY (CONT'D)\n(re: her hand)\nWhat are you doing?!\n\nFINN\nCome on!\nSuddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST 'EM,HIT THE CLEANIN UNIT SPEWING STEAM!Rey SCREAMS--MORE BLASTS as they run!\n\nEXT.

BB-8 stay close! This way!\nNow Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing\nThem! They disappear through a tent, TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nCall in the air strike!\nREY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:\n\nINT.

You're marked!\n\nREY\nWell, thanks for that!\n\nFINN\nI'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?!\n\nREY\n(TO BB-8)\nAre you okay?\nFinn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING\nPUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly --\nHe GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY --\n\nREY (CONT'D)\nStop taking my hand!\n\nEXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY\n\nFinn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS -- As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW.\n\nFROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND.

Through his fog:\nFINN\n-- Are you okay?\nAnd that very question touches her -- having never in her life been asked it.\nREY\nYeah.\n(extends her hand)\nFollow me\nGrateful, Finn takes it.

Rey, coming to a quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:\n\nREY (CONT'D)\nThe garbage'll do!\nShe turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!\nTIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN.

One man in A SUIT (BALA-TIK), and five SECURITY SOLDIERS in badass UNIFORMS with ROUND-FACE HELMETS. They turn into and stop at one end of the corridor. Han, Chewie and BB-8 forty feet away in the middle of the long hall.\n\nBALA-TIK\nHan Solo. You are a dead man.\nHan smiles innocently, friendly. BB-8 nervously looks back and forth at the gang, and Han.\n\nHAN\nBala-Tik. What's the problem?\n\nBALA-TIK\nThe problem is we loaned you fifty thousand for this job.\n\nINTERCUT WITH:\n\nINT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY\nThey look up, trying to get a view\n\nREY\nCan you see them?\n\nFINN\nNo.\nThey start crawling down the crawl space.\n\nBALA-TIK\nI heard you also borrowed fifty thousand from Kanjiklub.\n\nHAN\nYou know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other?\nRey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER:\n\nREY\nThey have blasters...\n\nFINN\nA lot of 'em\nWe RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company in the distance\n\nBALA-TIK\nThe question is how much longer will we know each other? Not long. We our money back now\n\nHAN\nYa think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money.\n\nBALA-TIK\nKanjiklub wants their investment back, too.\n\nHAN\nI never made a deal with Kanjiklub!\n\nBALA-TIK\nTell that to Kanjiklub!\nSOUND of a PORTAL OPENING.Han's face GOES WHITE as he turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR,where KANJIKLUB MEMBERS APPEAR.A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style. Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. Its LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. Han tries to play it off:\n\nHAN\nTasu Leech. Good to see you.\nTasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:\n\nTASU LEECH\nWrong again, Solo. It's over for you\nTasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous\nFinn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start\nCRAWLING BACK the other way to see them\n\nHAN\nBoys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever\nNot delivered for you before?\n\nBALA-TIK\nYeah\n\nTASU LEECH\nTwice!\nHan realizes he's right\n\nHAN\nWhat was the second time?\n\nBALA-TIK\nYour game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle\n\nTASU LEECH\nNowhere left for you to hide\n\nBALA-TIK\nThat BB unit... the First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives\nFinn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense. BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes: Finn and Rey are in real trouble\n\nHAN\nFirst I've heard of it\nBelow the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid. Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED):\n\nRAZOO QIN-FEE\nSearch the freighter!\nOne of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor\nAIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for: FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING FAST in the opposite direction they came. Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at A JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls.\n\nREY\nWait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs!\n\nFINN\nClose the blast doors from here?\n\nREY\nResetting the fuses should do it\nRey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as they do. Finn quickly joins in. Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS -- SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE!\nBACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE. The GANGS look around. Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad.QUIETLY:\n\nHAN\n... I got a bad feeling about this...\nSuddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below\nWhere Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned\n\nREY\nOh no!\n\nFINN\nOh no, what?\n\nREY\n(PALE)\nWrong fuses...\n\nIN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, BACK WITH THE GANGS:\n\nBALA-TIK\nKill them! And take the droid!\nThe gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THE GUAVIAN DEATH GANG, GRABBING TWO MEMBERS! THE OTHERS SCREAM AND RUN! The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY! Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY!The gang turns--others run,FIRE AT IT\n\nINT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY\n\nHan, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE KANJIKLUB GANG comes around the corner. Han PUNCHES him with one blow, throws him toward the Rathtar. They keep steppin....\n\nINT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY\nRey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks\n\nFINN\nThis was a mistake!\n\nREY\nHuge!\n\nINT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY\n\nTwo Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship \u2013 passing Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction --they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out, quickly.  They turn a corridor --\n\nREY\nWhat do they look like?\n\nAnother corner -- and GANG MEMBERS ARE BATTLING A HORRIBLE RATHTAR! Rey COVERS HER MOUTH\n\nFINN\nThey look like that\nFinn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a\nRATHTAR IS THERE!\n\nFINN (CONT'D)\nThis way!\n\nREY\nAre you sure?\nThey scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY FAST!\n\nREY (CONT'D)\nFINN!\nBut the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey --\n\nFINN\nREY!\n\nINT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR E - DAY\n\nTIGHT ON FINN as he's being yanked down the hall, SCREAMING as he struggles to get loose!\nRey turns the corner -- Finn is gone -- nowhere to be seen\n\nREY\nFINN!!!!\n\nWithout Finn, she is instantly distraught -- then she realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP --           and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits... then\nSLAMS THE BUTTON!\n\nINT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR B - DAY\n\nThe BLAST DOOR INSTANTLY CLOSES ON ONE OF THE RATHTAR'S TENTACLES! It SCREAMS IN PAIN, ITS SEVERED TENTACLE STILL WRAPPED AROUND FINN'S LEG! Finn scrambles up, desperately shaking the sticky tentacle off his leg! Rey arrives, runs to Finn, beaming to see him alive -- he is\nAdrenaline-rushed, in shock:\n\nREY\nFinn!\n\nFINN\nIt had me! But the door--!\n\nREY\nThat was lucky!\nANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon\n\nINT.

Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls\nTHE HATCH OPENS (FALCON in the distance) -- just as CHEWIE IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a LOUD GROAN!\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\nChewie! You okay?\nHan GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS, BADASS!\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\n(looks at bowcaster)\nWow. Come on!

MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY\n\nHan stands at the navicomputer, hitting switches. Rey enters\nFast, moves past him to Chewie's seat\n\nHAN\nHey, where are you going?\n\nREY\nUnkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere.\n\nHAN\nI hate that guy!\nHan sits as, Rey hitting buttons:\n\nREY\nAnd you could use a co-pilot.\n\nHAN\nI got one, he's back there\n\nIN THE LOUNGE, CHEWIE IS IN PAIN --\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY\n\nHan and Rey in the seats:\n\nHAN\nWatch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed --\n\nREY\n(SHOCKED)\nFrom inside the hangar? Is that even possible?\n\nHAN\nI never ask that question until after I've done it\nA RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\nThis is not how I thought this day  was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there!\nIN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a first aid kit -- the ship is HIT again --\n\nFINN\n(HUGE PROBLEM)\nNo problem!\n\nINT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY\n\nThree GANG MEMBERS race out here and FIRE AT THE FALCON -- hitting FUEL LINES, BLASTING THE SHIP HARD! The ship is hit\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY\n\nHAN\nCome on baby, don't let me down!\nHe hits a switch -- but NOTHING.\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\nWhat?!\nBut Rey reaches over, points to a switch, matter-of-factly.\n\nREY\nCompressor.\nHan doesn't like it but she's right--he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES!The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES.In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:\n\nEXT.

CARGO SHIP - DAY\nPUSH IN on a HANGAR DOOR where Bala-Tik arrives at the window,  SEETHING. Makes a CALL:\n\nBALA-TIK\nInform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's  aboard the Millennium Falcon.\n\nEXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY\n\nA pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET\nFrozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet\nThat has been hacked and modified into something sinister. Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice very much in control, of power:\n\nSNOKE (V.O.)\nThe droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance...\n\nINT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT\nKYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at  someone addressing them. We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME   LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five  feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile  powerful, all at the same time\n\nSNOKE\n...Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise.\n\nGENERAL HUX\nSupreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th--\n\nSNOKE\nGeneral! Our strategy must now change.\n\nGENERAL HUX\nThe weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be , and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker.\nSnoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:\n\nSNOKE\nGo. Oversee preparations.\n\nGENERAL HUX\nYes, Supreme Leader!\nGeneral Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice.\n\nSNOKE\nThere's been an awakening. Have you felt it?\n\nKYLO REN\nYes.\n\nSNOKE\nThere's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium  Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo.\nKylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.\n\nKYLO REN\nHe means nothing to me.\n\nSNOKE\nEven you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test.\n\nKYLO REN\n(STEELY RESOLVE)\nBy the grace of your training, I will not be seduced.\n\nSNOKE\nWe shall see. We shall see...\nA gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed\nFilled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque\nEvil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been\nA HOLOGRAM all along.\n\nEXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY\n\nRACING with the Falcon through the STRINGLIGHT of lightspeed\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY\n\nCHAOS: INTERCUT between the COCKPIT where Han and Rey pilot ALARMS SOUNDING, problems everywhere, and the LOUNGE where CHEWIE YELPS as Finn nervously works to BANDAGE HIS SHOULDER. SPARKS!\n\nHAN\nElectrical overload!\n\nREY\nI can fix that!\n\nHAN\nThe coolant's leaking!\n\nREY\nTry transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank--\n\nHAN\n-- Secondary tank, I got it!\n\nINT. LOUNGE:\n\nCHEWIE HOWLS IN PAIN! Finn hangs in there, wraps a bandage on Chewie's shoulder: Chewie ROARS. BB-8 scurries off...\nFINN\nChewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie!\n\nINT. FALCON COCKPIT:\n\nHAN\nYou hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!\n\nINT. LOUNGE:\n\nAs Finn struggles to bandage the Wookiee:\n\nFINN\nHurt him?! He almost killed me six times!\n(Chewie GRABS HIM by the collar, ROARS)\nWhich is fine...\n\nINT. FALCON COCKPIT:\n\nHAN\nThis hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems!\nHan at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied, sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused.\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\nWhat'd you do?\n\nREY\nI by-passed the compressor.\nHe looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits walking past BB-8.\n\nHAN\nMove, Ball.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY\n\nHan kneels at Chewie, who lies awake but recovering. Han\nChecks his friend's wound with care. Chewie MOAN-TALKS.\n\nHAN\nNah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest.\nHan turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside  him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\nGood job, kid. And thanks.\n\nFINN\nYou're welcome.\nFinn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to turn it off.\n\nHAN\nSo, fugitives, huh?\n\nREY\nThe First Order wants the map.\n(re: Finn and BB-8)\nFinn is with the Resistance...\n(SHRUGS)\n... I'm just a scavenger.\nHan gives Finn a skeptical once-over as Finn finally manages\nTo TURN THE CHESS SET OFF as Rey enters. Han looks to BB-8.\n\nHAN\nLet's see whatcha got.\n\nREY\n(TO BB-8)\nGo ahead.\n\nBB-8 rolls forward -- and suddenly PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC\nMAP, FILLING THE ROOM. PLANETS, STARS, SYSTEMS. They all react. Chewie sits to look up. Han moves through stars, becomes reflective.\n\nHAN\nThis map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him.\n\nREY\nWhy'd he leave?\n\nHAN\nHe was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke  felt responsible... He walked away from everything.\n\nFINN\nDo you know what happened to him?\n\nHAN\nThere're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi Temple.\n\nREY\nThe Jedi were real?\n\nHAN\nI used to wonder that myself. Thought  it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo --magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light.\n(BEAT)\n'Crazy thing is, it's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true.\n\nAn alarm rings on the control station, prompting Han to toggle some switches. BB-8 cuts off the hologram. Chewie rises and moans to Han,but Han motions for Chewie to lay back DOWN:\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\nNo, you rest\n(To Rey and Finn)\nYou want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop.\nHan leaves towards the cockpit, Rey and Finn following.\n\nEXT. LIGHTSPEED TO SPACE - DAY\n\nBEHIND THE FALCON as it DROPS OUT OF LIGHTSPEED, revealing a BEAUTIFUL GREEN PLANET ahead, TAKODANA.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY\n\nHan pilots. Finn and BB-8 beside him, Rey as co-pilot\nHan notices Rey looking out the windshield, almost in tears.\n\nREY\n(QUIETLY)\n...I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy...\nHan watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him.\n\nEXT. TAKODANA PLANET - DAY\n\nThe Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a CASTLE on a picturesque LAKE. The Falcon lands near the castle, among dozens of WORN smallish freighters\n\nEXT. LANDING PAD - NEAR MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY\n\nRey steps off the Falcon, UP TO CAMERA, BB-8 at her side\nShe takes in the towering stone CASTLE, FOREST to one side\nLAKE to the other. Serene, beautiful, all new to her\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY\n\nFrom BLACKNESS: a storage unit opens. Han rummages\nRetrieving old BLASTERS. Finn arrives behind him, concerned\n\nFINN\nHey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here --\n\nHAN\nD'you just call me \"Solo\"?\n\nFINN\nSorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers?\n\nHAN\nListen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out  the truth.\nHands him a BLASTER.\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\nAlways.\nHan walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt.\n\nEXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY\n\nHan hands Rey a blaster pistol as she looks at the castle.\n\nHAN\nYou might need this.\n\nREY\nI think I can handle myself\n\nHAN\nI know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it\nRey picks it up. Grips it\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\nYou know how to use one of these?\n\nREY\nYeah, you pull the trigger.\n\nHAN\nThere's a little bit more to it than  that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name?\n\nREY\nRey.\n\nHAN\nRey. I've been thinkin' about  bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out.  Someone who can keep up with Chewie    and me, appreciates the Falcon.\n\nREY\nAre you offering me a job?\n\nHAN\nI wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much.\n\nREY\nYou're offering me a job.\n\nHAN\nI'm thinking about it.\nRey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross.\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\nWell?\n\nREY\nIf you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home.\nHan looks at her, questioningly.\n\nHAN\nJakku?\nRey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku.\n\nREY\n(BEAT)\nI've already been away too long.\n\nHAN\n(TO CHEWIE)\nChewie, check out the ship as best you can.\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\nIt's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.\nHan heads off. HOLD on Rey.\n\nEXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY\n\nHan walks them to the castle.\n\nFINN\nSolo, why are we here again?\n\nHAN\nTo get your droid on a clean ship.\n\nREY\nClean?\n\nHAN\nDo you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet.\n\nFINN\nWe can trust her, right?\n\nHAN\nRelax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare...\n\nREY AND FINN\nAt what?\n\nHAN\nAny of it\nThe door opens. Music. Madness. And...\n\nINT. MAZ'S CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - DAY\n\nWe ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble, drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who  suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES. This is MAZ KANATA.\n\nMAZ\nHan Solo!\nEveryone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here\n\nHAN\n(Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving)Hey, Maz!\nNOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away\n\nMAZ\nWhere's my boyfriend?\n\nHAN\nChewie's working on the Falcon.\n\nMAZ\nI like that Wookiee. I assume you need something.Desperately. Let's get to it.\n\nMaz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. Finn and Rey are confused. Han indicates for them to follow. They do -- passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE NETAL, who watches them suspiciously. A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8 following Rey across the room. GA-97, now animated, makes a Small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled.\n\nGA-97\nAlert the Resistance. Their missing droid is here!\nAnd we CUT TO:\n\nIN A DARK ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER\nBazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a\nCommunicator. Clearly, BAZINE IS A SPY. Subtitled:\n\nBAZINE\nInform the First Order... I've found the droid\n\nEXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY\n\nA massive Star Destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet.\n\nINT. STAR DESTROYER - KYLO REN'S CHAMBERS - DAY\n\nA dark space. Kylo Ren, CLOSE TO CAMERA, addresses someone OFF-CAMERA whom we do not see.\n\nKYLO REN\nForgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader\nSenses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me,    Grandfather, and I will finish what you started .\nAs his emotion builds, he stands and heads off--we FOLLOW HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to:THE BURNT ASHEN, GHOSTLY DEFORMED MASK OF DARTH VADER\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MAZ'S CASTLE - TABLE - DAY\n\nMaz is putting together some FOOD as she says:\n\nMAZ\nA map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess\n\nHAN\nMaz, I need you to get this droid to Leia\n\nMAZ\nHmm. No. You've been running away this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home!\n\nHAN\nLeia doesn't want to see me\n\nFINN\nPlease, we came here for your help\n\nREY\nWhat fight?\n\nMAZ\nThe only fight: against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us...\n\nFINN\nThere is no fight against the First  Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right--\n\nFinn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get HUGE\n\nFINN (CONT'D)\nWhat's this? What are you doing?\nMaz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly\nBIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the\nTabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards Finn\n\nFINN (CONT'D)\nSolo, what is she doing?\n\nHAN\nI don't know, but it ain't good.\n\nMAZ\nIf you live long enough you see the  same eyes in different people. I'm at the eyes of a man who wants to run.\n\nFINN\n(eyes on Maz)\nYou don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. You don't know the First Order like  I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run.\nRey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her  chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.\n\nMAZ\nYou see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear.\nFinn sees them. Considers.\n\nREY\nFinn!\n\nFINN\nCome with me.\n\nREY\nWhat about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base.\n\nFINN\nI can't...\nFinn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.\n\nHAN\nKeep it, kid.\nFinn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han.\n\nMAZ\nWho's the girl?\n\nFINN has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS.\n\nFINN\nI was told you could get me to the Outer Rim.\nRey barges into the conversation, interrupting.\n\nREY\nWhat are you doing?\nFinn gets up to talk to her.\n\nFINN\n(to Big Head)\nDon't leave without me.\n\nEmbarrassed, Finn moves her away.\n\nREY\nYou can't just go. I won't let you.\n\nFINN\nI'm not who you think I am.\n\nREY\nFinn, what are you talking about?\n\nFINN\nI'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper.\n(STOPS HER)\nLike all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing...\n(EMOTIONAL)\nBut my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't going to kill for them. So I ran...\nFINN (CONT'D)\nRight into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me.\n\nREY\nDon't go.\n\nFINN\nTake care of yourself. Please.\n\nRey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation,Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... And all three head off.He gets to the front door and walks through it. Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time.\n\nINT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nRey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE DOOR OPENS. Hesitant, Rey enters.\n\nINT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY\n\nRey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room.Old trea-sures line the floors and walls, but there is something specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX. She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside. The box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment heavy with tension. Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original   lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound. The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.\n\nYOUNG GIRL\nNO!\nShe stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY. We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS. She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to:\nR2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE, whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND\nWe PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --          and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --\nTo see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what sh esees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!\nCome back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see...\nA little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical\nUnkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her\n\nYOUNG GIRL\nNo, come back!\n\nUNKAR PLUTT\nQuiet, girl!\nThe ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely\nEclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around her to see she is...\nIn a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind, confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath\nSeen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING\nLIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound. Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:\n\nINT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nShe falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed. She HEARS something and turns to look. Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has just happened.\nREY\nWhat was that? I shouldn't have gone in there.\n\nMAZ\nThat lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him and now, it calls to you!\n\nREY\nI have to get back to Jakku.\n\nMAZ\nHan told me.\n(reaches out, hold REY'S HAND)\nDear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could.\n\nREY\nLuke\n\nMAZ\nThe belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi. But I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it. The light. It's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it\nRey suddenly stands\n\nREY\nI'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this.\nAnd Rey runs off, passing Maz. Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.\n\nEXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY\n\nRey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where. Heads toward the woods.\n\nEXT. FOREST - DAY\n\nRey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we\nHEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to come.\n\nEXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY\n\nA massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS, OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous  SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:\n\nGENERAL HUX\nToday is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while  secretly supporting the treachery of  the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon            which we stand, will bring an end to  the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this...as the last day of the Republic!\n\nINT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY\n\nENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL.

STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY\n\nGENERAL HUX\nFIRE!\nAnd Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a  ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!\n\nEXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY\n\nA view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily\nSILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC  BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO  THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR!   The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the   FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES! For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!   Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.  Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS eyes, CUT TO:\n\nINT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY\n\nTIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing\n\nEXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY\n\nFinn boards the Alien Freighter.

REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT\n\nThe galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive    structures. Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING -- FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN  APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING  NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED!\n\nEXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY\n\nA crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up\n\nFINN (O.S.)\nIt was the Republic.\nHan and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through the crowd. With dread:\n\nFINN (CONT'D)\nThe First Order, they've done it.  Where's Rey?\n\nEXT. FOREST - DAY\n\nRey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop, overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point, she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS\nA BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.\n\nREY\nWhat are you doing?\n(HE BEEPS)\nYou have to go back.\n(he BEEPS again)\nBB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you.\nThen, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER!\n\nINT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nMaz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast:\n\nMAZ\nI've had this for ages...\n\nMAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY\nMaz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn:\n\nMAZ\nKept it locked away\n\nHAN\nWhere'd you get that?\n\nMAZ\nA good question for another time\n(TO FINN)\nTake it!

TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --\n\nEXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY\n\nHan, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through debris.\nHAN\nCome on, Chewie!\nMaz turns to Finn:\nMAZ\nRey and BB-8, they need you. Now go.\nFINN\nI need a weapon.\nMaz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.\n\nMAZ\nYou have one!\nHe looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the\nLightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at Stormtroopers, taking some out!\n\nHAN\nHey, can I try that?\nHan borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers\nAnd sends them flying\n\nHAN (CONT'D)\n(TO CHEWBACCA)\nI like this thing\nFINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One\nStormtrooper has a MACE --\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nTraitor!\nFINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper KNOCKS FINN DOWN!

TK-338, we have targets in custody!\n\nNo way out, they DROP THEIR WEAPONS: TIGHT on the LIGHTSABER as it HITS THE GROUND. A STORMTROOPER HAND picks it up. Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them. Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward a transport, hands on their heads. But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, X-WINGS AND RESISTANCE SPACECRAFT APPEAR, BEGIN FIRING AT THE FIRST ORDER SHIPS!\nPUSH IN ON HAN, HOPE SURGING -- CHEWIE TALKS\n\nSTORMTROOPER (CONT'D)\nWe have incoming at two-eight-point-Six!

Her eyes dart around for her pursuer and then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER\nCOMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK. Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now. Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and Again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO DEFLECT EVERY BLAST. She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming!

He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears\nStream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind...\nShe stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony -- Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods\n\nSTORMTROOPER #5\nSir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops\nKylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face\n\nKYLO REN\nPull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need\nA GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS FROM FRAME!\n\nEXT.

FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS -- Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle\nHan is ROCKED\n\nFINN\nNO!! REY!!!\nHeroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY:\n\nFINN (CONT'D)\nNo, no, no, no... REY!!\nIn crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the receding First Order ships, Rey their captive...\n\nEXT. FOREST - DAY\n\nBB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order\nShips RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads BACK FOR THE CASTLE\n\nEXT.

She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and embers, no one says a word.\nThen C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field:\n\nC-3PO\nGoodness! Han Solo! It is I, See-Threepio!\n(sees Han, stops)\nYou probably don't recognize me because of the red arm\n(sees Leia, INCREASINGLY AWKWARD)\nLook who it is! Did you see who? Oh.

Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate, searching. Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down --\nFinn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF\nTHE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off...\nIT IS POE!\nFinn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in\nWARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the Droid tells him. Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't\nBelieve it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. From a distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive.\n\nFINN\nPoe. Poe Dameron!\nThey move to each other -- and embrace.\n\nFINN (CONT'D)\nYou're alive!\n\nPOE\nSo are you!\n\nFINN\nWhat happened to you?\n\nPOE\nWhat happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing--\nBB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn.\n\nPOE (CONT'D)\nBB-8 says that you saved him.\n\nFINN\nNo, no, no.

That was incredibly brave, what you did renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life --\n\nFINN\n(surprised she knows)\nThank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner--\n\nLEIA\nHan told me about the girl, I'm sorry\nFinn is startled -- Poe jumps in:\n\nPOE\nFinn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base.\n\nLEIA\nWe're desperate for anything you can tell us.\n\nFINN\nThat's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast.\n\nLEIA\nAnd I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know.\n\nINT.

PAN as she moves, REVEALING HAN. C-3PO is here and some others.\n\nC-3PO\nGeneral, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse: It matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke.\n\nLEIA\nI can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home.\n\nHAN\nLeia...\n\nLEIA\nDon't do that.\n\nHAN\nDo what?\nShe heads off.\n\nLEIA\nAnything!\nFlummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO.\n\nC-3PO\nPrincesses.\nHan follows Leia across the base floor:\n\nHAN\nI'm trying to be helpful!\n\nLEIA\nWhen did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star!\n\nHAN\n(SIGHS)\n\nINT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY\n\nLOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and\nDusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off the tarp and tries to start a conversation. But R2 DOESN'T RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES R2. Nothing. Then:\n\nC-3PO (O.S.)\nBB-8. You're wasting your time.\nBB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS.\n\nC-3PO (CONT'D)\nIt is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data.\n(BB-8 BEEPS)\nI am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again.\n\nINT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY\n\nLeia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. She turns\n\nHAN\nListen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him.\n\nLEIA\nYou think I want to forget him? I want him back!\nHan looks at her with sympathy.\n\nHAN\nThere was nothing we could've done.\n(hard for him to say)\nThere was too much Vader in him.\n\nLEIA\nThat's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.\n\nHAN\nWe both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only  thing I was ever good at\n\nLEIA\nWe both did.\n\nHAN\nWe lost our son, forever.\n\nLEIA\nNo.\n(LONG BEAT)\nIt was Snoke.\nHan takes this in.\nLEIA (CONT'D)\nHe seduced our son to the dark side.But we can still save him. Me.

STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY\n\nRey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright restraining rig.

She's fearful... but curious.\n\nKYLO REN (CONT'D)\nYou still want to kill me.\n\nREY\nThat happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask.\nKylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance\n\nKYLO REN\nTell me about the droid.\n\nREY\n(a nervous beat)\nHe's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --\n\nKYLO REN\nHe's carrying a section of a  navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece.  And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger--\nRey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?\nKYLO REN (CONT'D)\nYou know I can take whatever I want.\nTrepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...\nTHEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER. And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move, quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.\n\nKYLO REN (CONT'D)\n... You're so lonely... so afraid to leave...\n(then, slight smile)\nAt night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see the island...\nTears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to break free, but can't budge\n\nKYLO REN (CONT'D)\nAnd Han Solo. You feel like he's  the father you never had. He would've disappointed you.\n\nHis hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony:\n\nREY\n-- Get out of my head --\nBut this just makes Kylo lean closer\n\nKYLO REN\nI know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too.\nWhere her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:\n\nREY\nI'm not giving you anything!\n\nKYLO REN\nWe'll see.\nHe peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --\nDESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG. On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass...\n\nAND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!\nREY\n... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader!\nKYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. And we PRELAP:\n\nSNOKE (V.O.)\nThis scavenger, resisted you?\n\nINT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT\nKylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke\n\nKYLO REN\nShe's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows\nAnd while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:\n\nSNOKE\nAnd the droid?\n\nKylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then:\n\nGENERAL HUX (O.S.)\nRen believed it was no longer valuable to us\nRen turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the platform beside Ren\n\nGENERAL HUX (CONT'D)\nThat the girl was all we needed. As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already\nSnoke is visibly furious\n\nSNOKE\nThen the Resistance must be destroyed  before they get to Skywalker\n\nGENERAL HUX\nWe have their location.

Studies him for an   intense beat. Then says:\n\nREY\nYou will remove these restraints  and leave this cell, with the door open.\nThe Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.\n\nTROOPER GUARD #2\nWhat did you say?\nRey's eyes stay trained on him. She shifts in her seat, her confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority:\n\nREY\nYou will remove these restraints  and leave this cell, with the door open.\nThe Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER.\nRey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or\nLaughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:\n\nTROOPER GUARD #2\nI'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum!\n\nINT.

Then tries, quickly:\nREY\nAnd you will drop your weapon!\n\nTROOPER GUARD #2\nAnd I'll drop my weapon.\nThe Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back --Rey HEARS the gun fall.

As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears.\nAn OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD.\n\nLEIA\n(eyes on datacard)\nThe First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now.\n(then, heart sinking)\nOur system is the next target.\n\nC-3PO\nOh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed.\nThey all react to this horrible news.\n\nHAN\nOkay, how do we blow it up?\n(all eyes on him)\nThere's always a way to do that.\n\nBut no one has anything. Leia watches the silence. Frustrated. Finally, rallying them:\n\nLEIA\nHan's right.\nHan is surprised.\n\nADMIRAL STATURA\n(at first hesitant)\nIn order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator...\n\nFINN\nThere is one.\nAll eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE\n\nFINN (CONT'D)\nPrecinct 47. Here.\n\nADMIRAL STATURA\n(HYPOTHESIZING)\nIf we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon.\n\nMAJOR EMATT\n... Maybe the planet.\nPoe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator.\n\nPOE\nWe'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got.\n\nADMIRAL ACKBAR\nThey have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.\n\nHAN\nWe disable the shields.\n(TO FINN)\nKid, you worked there, what do you got?\n\nFINN\n(beat, then:)\nI can do it.\n\nHAN\nI like this guy\n\nFINN\nI can disable the shields. But I  have to be there, on the planet-\nHAN\nWe'll get you there.\n\nLEIA\nHan, how?\n\nHAN\nIf I told you, you wouldn't like it.\n\nPOE\nSo we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go!\nAnd everyone splits.\n\nEXT. HANGARS, RESISTANCE BASE - DAY\n\nSERIES OF SHOTS: THE RESISTANCE FLEET PREPARES FOR ITS\nMISSION.

Some of it was...good.\n\nLEIA\n... Pretty good.\n\nHAN\nSome things never change.\n\nLEIA\n(SMILES)\nTrue. You still drive me crazy.\nHan places his hands on her shoulders.

From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the whitepill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET. At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem: between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation. As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-  and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way! Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.  WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off, not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her. But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm.

Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings. WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING!

OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS\n\nHan takes one step toward his son, but stops himself.\n\nKYLO REN\nI know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me?\nHan hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.\n\nHAN\nYes. Anything...\nKylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to\nHan, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe\nIt. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the\nLAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch\nVANISHES. Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon -- But with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK!\n\nREY\nNooooooooo!\n\nKYLO REN\nThank you.\nABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM --\n\nFINN\n(PANTING)\nSolo.\n\nREY\n(ALSO PANTING)\nNo.\n\nHan's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S\nKNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO\nREN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his life slipping away. Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE STRUCTURE!\n\nINT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY\n\nLeia, feeling it instantly -- knowing -- drops into a seat, DEVASTATED.\n\nINT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NIGHT\n\nKylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. Himself horrified. His SHOCK is broken only when -- CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned.\n\nOur MUSIC TAKES OVER, EPIC AND HEARTBREAKING as Stormtroopers FIRE AT CHEWIE, who is forced to retreat down a corridor, where he holds the EXPLOSIVE REMOTE -- he PUSHES THE BUTTON! Hearing ONLY OUR SCORE, FIRST ONE, then TWO, then FOUR, then SIX EXPLOSIONS rock the structure -- CATWALKS FALL as the walls CAVE IN! Kylo Ren SEES REY AND FINN, WATCHING THE EXPLOSIONS IN SHOCK -- then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for them with long strides. Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED,REY FIRES BACK AS BLASTS HIT AROUND HER. FINN WRAPS AN ARM AROUND HER AND DRAGS/CARRIES HER OUT OF SIGHT!\n\nINT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY\n\nADMIRAL ACKBAR\nThe Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional.\nCOMMODORE META reacts.\n\nOFFICER TABALA ZO\nAdmiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes.\n\nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT\n\nFrom a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from\nthe explosives. Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a\nrising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest.\n\nFINN\nThe Falcon's this way.\nFinn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy\nforest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both\nout of breath. They look at each other. They both know:\nthey can't run.\n\nEXT. STARKILLER BASE - FOREST - NIGHT\n\nKylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes\nout the saber, ignites it. A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow.\n\nSTANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY. Finn holds LUKE'S LIGHTSABER, Rey the Stormtrooper BLASTER.\n\nKYLO REN\nWe're not done yet.\n\nREY\nYou're a monster!\n\nKYLO REN\nIt's just us now. Han Solo can't save you.\nAfter a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT!\nKylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER --  she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away! She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt.\n\nFINN\nRey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no...\nFinn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF\nKYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.\n\nKYLO REN\nTRAITOR!\nIn reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK.\n\nKYLO REN (CONT'D)\nThat lightsaber. It belongs to me!\n\nFINN\nCome get it.\nDespite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo\nRen CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but\nFinn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade!\nKylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS,\nCOUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys this challenge more!\nRey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two\nmen fighting, through the trees.\nKylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks\nwith a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE\nmoves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN!LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK - wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK, the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers: And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity -- Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness. Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses balance.\n\nThat's when KYLO REN STRIKES: HE LANDS A BLOW TO FINN'S TORSO --  LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FLIES FROM FINN'S HAND, THROWN TWENTY FEET!  Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS LIGHTSABER and REACHES FOR LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- BECKONING IT WITH THE FORCE. LUKE'S LIGHTSABER VIBRATES IN THE SNOW. Kylo Ren GESTURES, INCREASES HIS POWER -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FINALLY FLIES OUT OF THE SNOW, BULLETS TOWARD KYLO REN--AND SPEEDS PAST HIM!\n\nKYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF REY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF, BUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS SHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN!\nHolding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER\nFOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING. Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER. It's REY who charges now -- Kylo Ren immediately on the defensive. They BATTLE POWERFULLY -- He is clearly rocked by her raw,innate skill.\n\nINT. X-WING - NIGHT\n\nNIV LEK\nWe just lost R-1!\n\nJESS\nWe're overwhelmed! What do we do? It isn't working!\nAnother pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming\nfrom the OSCILLATOR.

Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF!\n\nKYLO REN\nYou need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force!\n\nREY\nThe Force.\nRey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them,\nshe is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS  BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber. And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE! But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.\n\nINT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a\ngiant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who\nwatches this out the control room window in horror.

Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over,\nsees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound.\n\nREY\nFinn! Finn...\nTears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless\nbody in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries,\nholding this boy who she just met, who she already adores.\nThey are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the\nplanet continues to COLLAPSE.

We've got a heartbeat.\nRey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.\nC-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering. Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry. The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's face in her hands.Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful. She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace. Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.\n\nINT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY\n\nChewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning their losses. As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly stirs. The droids beep at each other.\n\nC-3PO\nR2-D2! You've come back! You found what?

BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him --\n\nPOE\nYeah, all right, buddy, hold on --\nPoe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor\nSan Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it\nback inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he\nSHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY -- TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN R2-D2'S PERFECTLY!\nEveryone REACTS -- amazed --\n\nC-3PO\nOh!

Endless BLUE, dotted with random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted  with countless GREEN TREES.The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of the ISLANDS.\n\nEXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY\n\nRey,her staff strapped to her back,begins her hike up the con- siderable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,who watch her from the bottom of the ramp.A deep breath and Rey continues her journey.\n\nEXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY\n\nBuilt within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.\n\nEXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY\n\nRey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees\\senses no one.\n\nAnd then she stops. Feels something. She turns.Standing 40 ft away from her,his back to us,is a MAN In a CLOAK AND ROBE\nRey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY to her. Pulls back his hood.\n\nIT IS LUKE SKYWALKER. Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His look says it all.\nIn response, Rey pulls something from the pack:LUKE'S LIGHTSABER. And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's only hope.\nHOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise of an adventure, just beginning...\n\nTHE END8Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/2913328", "artist_names": "Lena Zavaroni", "full_title": "Ma!

A discipline it is in logic, arithmetic, taste, symmetry, poetry, language, rhetoric, ontology, morals, or practical wisdom. There was never such range of speculation. Out of Plato come all things that are still written and debated among men of thought. Great havoc makes he among our originalities. We have reached the mountain from which all these drift bowlders were detached. The Bible of the learned for twenty- two hundred years, every brisk young man, who says in succession fine things to each reluctant generation,\u2014Boethius, Rabelais, Erasmus, Bruno, Locke, Rousseau, Alfieri, Coleridge,\u2014is some reader of Plato, translating into the vernacular, wittily, his good things. Even the men of grander proportion suffer some deduction from the misfortune (shall I say?) of coming after this exhausting generalizer. St. Augustine, Copernicus, Newton, Behmen, Swedenborg, Goethe, are likewise his debtors, and must say after him. For it is fair to credit the broadest generalizer with all the particulars deducible from his thesis.\n\nPlato is philosophy, and philosophy, Plato,\u2014at once the glory and the shame of mankind, since neither Saxon nor Roman have availed to add any idea to his categories. No wife, no children had he, and the thinkers of all civilized nations are his posterity, and are tinged with his mind. How many great men Nature is incessantly sending up out of night, to be his men,\u2014Platonists! the Alexandrians, a constellation of genius; the Elizabethans, not less; Sir Thomas More, Henry More, John Hales, John Smith, Lord Bacon, Jeremy Taylor, Ralph Cudworth, Sydenham, Thomas Taylor; Marcilius Ficinus, and Picus Mirandola. Calvinism is in his Phaedo: Christianity is in it. Mahometanism draws all its philosophy, in its hand-book of morals, the Akhlak-y-Jalaly, from him. Mysticism finds in Plato all its texts. This citizen of a town in Greece is no villager nor patriot. An Englishman reads and says, \"how English!\" a German\u2014\"how Teutonic!\" an Italian\u2014\"how Roman and how Greek!\" As they say that Helen of Argos had that universal beauty that everybody felt related to her, so Plato seems, to a reader in New England, an American genius. His broad humanity transcends all sectional lines.\n\nThis range of Plato instructs us what to think of the vexed question concerning his reputed works,\u2014what are genuine, what spurious. It is singular that wherever we find a man higher, by a whole head, than any of his contemporaries, it is sure to come into doubt, what are his real works. Thus, Homer, Plato, Raffaelle, Shakspeare. For these men magnetize their contemporaries, so that their companions can do for them what they can never do for themselves; and the great man does thus live in several bodies; and write, or paint, or act, by many hands; and after some time, it is not easy to say what is the authentic work of the master, and what is only of his school.\n\nPlato, too, like every great man, consumed his own times. What is a great man, but one of great affinities, who takes up into himself all arts, sciences, all knowables, as his food? He can spare nothing; he can dispose of everything. What is not good for virtue is good for knowledge. Hence his contemporaries tax him with plagiarism. But the inventor only knows how to borrow; and society is glad to forget the innumerable laborers who ministered to this architect, and reserves all its gratitude for him. When we are praising Plato, it seems we are praising quotations from Solon, and Sophron, and Philolaus. Be it so. Every book is a quotation; and every house is a quotation out of all forests, and mines, and stone quarries; and every man is a quotation from all his ancestors. And this grasping inventor puts all nations under contribution.\n\nPlato absorbed the learning of his times,\u2014Philolaus, Timaeus, Heraclitus, Parmenides, and what else; then his master, Socrates; and finding himself still capable of a larger synthesis,\u2014beyond all example then or since,\u2014he traveled into Italy, to gain what Pythagoras had for him; then into Egypt, and perhaps still further east, to import the other element, which Europe wanted, into the European mind. This breadth entitles him to stand as the representative of philosophy. He says, in the Republic, \"Such a genius as philosophers must of necessity have, is wont but seldom, in all its parts, to meet in one man; but its different parts generally spring up in different persons.\" Every man, who would do anything well, must come to it from a higher ground. A philosopher must be more than a philosopher. Plato is clothed with the powers of a poet, stands upon the highest place of the poet, and (though I doubt he wanted the decisive gift of lyric expression) mainly is not a poet, because he chose to use the poetic gift to an ulterior purpose.\nGreat geniuses have the shortest biographies. Their cousins can tell you nothing about them. They lived in their writings, and so their house and street life was trivial and commonplace. If you would know their tastes and complexions, the most admiring of their readers most resembles them. Plato, especially, has no external biography. If he had lover, wife, or children, we hear nothing of them. He ground them all into paint. As a good chimney burns its smoke, so a philosopher converts the value of all his fortunes into his intellectual performances.\n\nHe was born 430 A. C., about the time of the death of Pericles; was of patrician connection in his times and city; and is said to have had an early inclination for war; but in his twentieth year, meeting with Socrates, was easily dissuaded from this pursuit, and remained for ten years his scholar, until the death of Socrates. He then went to Megara; accepted the invitations of Dion and of Dionysius, to the court of Sicily; and went thither three times, though very capriciously treated. He traveled into Italy; then into Egypt, where he stayed a long time; some say three,\u2014some say thirteen years. It is said, he went farther, into Babylonia: this is uncertain. Returning to Athens, he gave lessons, in the Academy, to those whom his fame drew thither; and died, as we have received it, in the act of writing, at eighty-one years.\n\nBut the biography of Plato is interior. We are to account for the supreme elevation of this man, in the intellectual history of our race,\u2014how it happens that, in proportion to the culture of men, they become his scholars; that, as our Jewish Bible has implanted itself in the table-talk and household life of every man and woman in the European and American nations, so the writings of Plato have pre-occupied every school of learning, every lover of thought, every church, every poet,\u2014making it impossible to think, on certain levels, except through him. He stands between the truth and every man's mind, and has almost impressed language, and the primary forms of thought, with his name and seal. I am struck, in reading him, with the extreme modernness of his style and spirit. Here is the germ of that Europe we know so well, in its long history of arts and arms; here are all its traits, already discernible in the mind of Plato,\u2014and in none before him. It has spread itself since into a hundred histories, but has added no new element. This perpetual modernness is the measure of merit, in every work of art; since the author of it was not misled by anything shortlived or local, but abode by real and abiding traits. How Plato came thus to be Europe, and philosophy, and almost literature, is the problem for us to solve.\n\nThis could not have happened, without a sound, sincere, and catholic man, able to honor, at the same time, the ideal, or laws of the mind, and fate, or the order of nature. The first period of a nation, as of an individual, is the period of unconscious strength. Children cry, scream and stamp with fury, unable to express their desires. As soon as they can speak and tell their want, and the reason of it, they become gentle. In adult life, whilst the perceptions are obtuse, men and women talk vehemently and superlatively, blunder and quarrel; their manners are full of desperation; their speech is full of oaths. As soon as, with culture, things have cleared up a little, and they see them no longer in lumps and masses, but accurately distributed, they desist from that weak vehemence, and explain their meaning in detail. If the tongue had not been framed for articulation, man would still be a beast in the forest. The same weakness and want, on a higher plane, occurs daily in the education of ardent young men and women. \"Ah! you don't understand me; I have never met with any one who comprehends me:\" and they sigh and weep, write verses, and walk alone,\u2014fault of power to express their precise meaning. In a month or two, through the favor of their good genius, they meet some one so related as to assist their volcanic estate; and, good communication being once established, they are thenceforward good citizens. It is ever thus. The progress is to accuracy, to skill, to truth, from blind force.\n\nThere is a moment, in the history of every nation, when, proceeding out of this brute youth, the perceptive powers reach their ripeness, and have not yet become microscopic: so that man, at that instant, extends across the entire scale; and, with his feet still planted on the immense forces of night, converses, by his eyes and brain, with solar and stellar creation. That is the moment of adult health, the culmination of power.\n\nSuch is the history of Europe, in all points; and such in philosophy. Its early records, almost perished, are of the immigrations from Asia, bringing with them the dreams of barbarians; a confusion of crude notions of morals, and of natural philosophy, gradually subsiding, through the partial insight of single teachers.\n\nBefore Pericles, came the Seven Wise Masters; and we have the beginnings of geometry, metaphysics, and ethics: then the partialists,\u2014deducing the origin of things from flux or water, or from air, or from fire, or from mind. All mix with these causes mythologic pictures. At last, comes Plato, the distributor, who needs no barbaric paint, or tattoo, or whooping; for he can define. He leaves with Asia the vast and superlative; he is the arrival of accuracy and intelligence. \"He shall be as a god to me, who can rightly divide and define.\"\n\nThis defining is philosophy. Philosophy is the account which the human mind gives to itself of the constitution of the world. Two cardinal facts lie forever at the base: the one, and the two.\u20141. Unity, or Identity; and, 2, Variety. We unite all things, by perceiving the law which pervades them; by perceiving the superficial differences, and the profound resemblances. But every mental act,\u2014this very perception of identity or oneness, recognizes the difference of things. Oneness and otherness. It is impossible to speak, or to think, without embracing both.\n\nThe mind is urged to ask for one cause of many effects; then for the cause of that; and again the cause, diving still into the profound; self-assured that it shall arrive at an absolute and sufficient one,\u2014a one that shall be all. \"In the midst of the sun is the light, in the midst of the light is truth, and in the midst of truth is the imperishable being, \"say the Vedas. All philosophy, of east and west, has the same centripetence. Urged by an opposite necessity, the mind returns from the one, to that which is not one, but other or many; from cause to effect; and affirms the necessary existence of variety, the self-existence of both, as each is involved in the other. These strictly-blended elements it is the problem of thought to separate, and to reconcile. Their existence is mutually contradictory and exclusive; and each so fast slides into the other, that we can never say what is one, and what it is not. The Proteus is as nimble in the highest as in the lowest grounds, when we contemplate the one, the true, the good,\u2014as in the surfaces and extremities of matter. In all nations, there are minds which incline to dwell in the conception of the fundamental Unity. The raptures of prayer and ecstasy of devotion lose all being in one Being. This tendency finds its highest expression in the religious writings of the East, and chiefly, in the Indian Scriptures, in the Vedas, the Bhagavat Geeta, and the Vishnu Purana. Those writings contain little else than this idea, and they rise to pure and sublime strains in celebrating it.\n\nThe Same, the Same! friend and foe are of one stuff; the ploughman, the plough, and the furrow, are of one stuff; and the stuff is such, and so much, that the variations of forms are unimportant. \"You are fit\" (says the supreme Krishna to a sage) \"to apprehend that you are not distinct from me. That which I am, thou art, and that also is this world, with its gods, and heroes, and mankind. Men contemplate distinctions, because they are stupefied with ignorance.\" \"The words I and mine constitute ignorance. What is the great end of all, you shall now learn from me. It is soul,\u2014one in all bodies, pervading, uniform, perfect, preeminent over nature, exempt from birth, growth, and decay, omnipresent, made up of true knowledge, independent, unconnected with unrealities, with name, species, and the rest, in time past, present, and to come. The knowledge that this spirit, which is essentially one, is in one's own, and in all other bodies, is the wisdom of one who knows the unity of things. As one diffusive air, passing through the perforations of a flute, is distinguished as the notes of a scale, so the nature of the Great Spirit is single, though its forms be manifold, arising from the consequences of acts. When the difference of the investing form, as that of god, or the rest, is destroyed, there is no distinction.\" \"The whole world is but a manifestation of Vishnu, who is identical with all things, and is to be regarded by the wise, as not differing from, but as the same as themselves. I neither am going nor coming; nor is my dwelling in any one place; nor art thou, thou; nor are others, others; nor am I, I.\" As if he had said, \"All is for the soul, and the soul is Vishnu; and animals and stars are transient painting; and light is whitewash; and durations are deceptive; and form is imprisonment; and heaven itself a decoy.\" That which the soul seeks is resolution into being, above form, out of Tartarus, and out of heaven,\u2014liberation from nature.\n\nIf speculation tends thus to a terrific unity, in which all things are absorbed, action tends directly backwards to diversity. The first is the course of gravitation of mind; the second is the power of nature. Nature is the manifold. The unity absorbs, and melts or reduces. Nature opens and creates. These two principles reappear and interpenetrate all things, all thought; the one, the many. One is being; the other, intellect; one is necessity; the other, freedom; one, rest; the other, motion; one, power; the other, distribution; one, strength; the other, pleasure; one, consciousness; the other, definition; one, genius; the other, talent, one, earnestness; the other, knowledge; one, possession; the other, trade; one, caste; the other, culture; one king; the other, democracy; and, if we dare carry these generalizations a step higher, and name the last tendency of both, we might say, that the end of the one is escape from organization,\u2014pure science; and the end of the other is the highest instrumentality, or use of means, or executive deity.\n\nEach student adheres, by temperament and by habit, to the first or to the second of these gods of the mind. By religion, he tends to unity; by intellect, or by the senses, to the many. A too rapid unification, and an excessive appliance to parts and particulars, are the twin dangers of speculation.\n\nTo this partiality the history of nations corresponded. The country of unity, of immovable institutions, the seat of a philosophy delighting in abstractions, of men faithful in doctrine and in practice to the idea of a deaf, unimplorable, immense fate, is Asia; and it realizes this fate in the social institution of caste. On the other side, the genius of Europe is active and creative; it resists caste by culture; its philosophy was a discipline; it is a land of arts, inventions, trade, freedom. If the East loved infinity, the West delighted in boundaries.\nEuropean civility is the triumph of talent, the extension of system, the sharpened understanding, adaptive skill, delight in forms, delight in manifestation, in comprehensible results. Pericles, Athens, Greece, had been working in this element with the joy of genius not yet chilled by any foresight of the detriment of an excess. They saw before them no sinister political economy; no ominous Malthus; no Paris or London; no pitiless subdivision of classes,\u2014the doom of the pinmakers, the doom of the weavers, of dressers, of stockingers, of carders, of spinners, of colliers; no Ireland; no Indian caste, superinduced by the efforts of Europe to throw it off. The understanding was in its health and prime. Art was in its splendid novelty. They cut the Pentelican marble as if it were snow, and their perfect works in architecture and sculpture seemed things of course, not more difficult than the completion of a new ship at the Medford yards, or new mills at Lowell. These things are in course, and may be taken for granted. The Roman legion, Byzantine legislation, English trade, the saloons of Versailles, the cafes of Paris, the steam-mill, steamboat, steam-coach, may all be seen in perspective; the town-meeting, the ballot-box, the newspaper and cheap press.\n\nMeantime, Plato, in Egypt, and in Eastern pilgrimages, imbibed the idea of one Deity, in which all things are absorbed. The unity of Asia, and the detail of Europe; the infinitude of the Asiatic soul, and the defining, result-loving, machine-making, surface-seeking, opera-going Europe,\u2014Plato came to join, and by contact to enhance the energy of each. The excellence of Europe and Asia are in his brain. Metaphysics and natural philosophy expressed the genius of Europe; he substructs the religion of Asia, as the base.\n\nIn short, a balanced soul was born, perceptive of the two elements. It is as easy to be great as to be small. The reason why we do not at once believe in admirable souls, is because they are not in our experience. In actual life, they are so rare, as to be incredible; but, primarily, there is not only no presumption against them, but the strongest presumption in favor of their appearance. But whether voices were heard in the sky, or not; whether his mother or his father dreamed that the infant man-child was the son of Apollo; whether a swarm of bees settled on his lips, or not; a man who could see two sides of a thing was born. The wonderful synthesis so familiar in nature; the upper and the under side of the medal of Jove; the union of impossibilities, which reappears in every object; its real and its ideal power,\u2014was now, also, transferred entire to the consciousness of a man.\n\nThe balanced soul came. If he loved abstract truth, he saved himself by propounding the most popular of all principles, the absolute good, which rules rulers, and judges the judge. If he made transcendental distinctions, he fortified himself by drawing all his illustrations from sources disdained by orators, and polite conversers; from mares and puppies; from pitchers and soup-ladles; from cooks and criers; the shops of potters, horse-doctors, butchers, and fishmongers. He cannot forgive in himself a partiality, but is resolved that the two poles of thought shall appear in his statement. His arguments and his sentences are self-poised and spherical. The two poles appear; yes, and become two hands, to grasp and appropriate their own.\n\nEvery great artist has been such by synthesis. Our strength is transitional, alternating; or, shall I say, a thread of two strands. The seashore, sea seen from shore, shore seen from sea; the taste of two metals in contact; and our enlarged powers at the approach and at the departure of a friend; the experience of poetic creativeness, which is not found in staying at home, nor yet in traveling, but in transitions from one to the other, which must therefore be adroitly managed to present as much transitional surface as possible; this command of two elements must explain the power and charm of Plato. Art expresses the one, or the same by the different. Thought seeks to know unity in unity; poetry to show it by variety; that is, always by an object or symbol. Plato keeps the two vases, one of aether and one of pigment, at his side, and invariably uses both. Things added to things, as statistics, civil history, are inventories. Things used as language are inexhaustibly attractive. Plato turns incessantly the obverse and the reverse of the medal of Jove.\n\nTo take an example:\u2014The physical philosophers have sketched each his theory of the world; the theory of atoms, of fire, of flux, of spirit; theories mechanical and chemical in their genius. Plato, a master of mathematics, studious of all natural laws and causes, feels these, as second causes, to be no theories of the world, but bare inventories and lists. To the study of nature he therefore prefixes the dogma,\u2014\"Let us declare the cause which led the Supreme Ordainer to produce and compose the universe. He was good; and he who is good has no kind of envy. Exempt from envy, he wished that all things should be as much as possible like himself. Whosoever, taught by wise men, shall admit this as the prime cause of the origin and foundation of the world, will be in the truth.\" \"All things are for the sake of the good, and it is the cause of everything beautiful.\" This dogma animates and impersonates his philosophy. The synthesis which makes the character of his mind appears in all his talents. Where there is great compass of wit, we usually find excellencies that combine easily in the living man, but in description appear incompatible. The mind of Plato is not to be exhibited by a Chinese catalogue, but is to be apprehended by an original mind in the exercise of its original power. In him the freest abandonment is united with the precision of a geometer. His daring imagination gives him the more solid grasp of facts; as the birds of highest flight have the strongest alar bones. His patrician polish, his intrinsic elegance, edged by an irony so subtle that it stings and paralyzes, adorn the soundest health and strength of frame. According to the old sentence, \"If Jove should descend to the earth, he would speak in the style of Plato.\"\n\nWith this palatial air, there is, for the direct aim of several of his works, and running through the tenor of them all, a certain earnestness, which mounts, in the Republic, and in the Phaedo, to piety. He has been charged with feigning sickness at the time of the death of Socrates. But the anecdotes that have come down from the times attest his manly interference before the people in his master's behalf, since even the savage cry of the assembly to Plato is preserved; and the indignation towards popular government, in many of his pieces, expresses a personal exasperation. He has a probity, a native reverence for justice and honor, and a humanity which makes him tender for the superstitions of the people. Add to this, he believes that poetry, prophecy, and the high insight, arc from a wisdom of which man is not master; that the gods never philosophize; but, by a celestial mania, these miracles are accomplished. Horsed on these winged steeds, he sweeps the dim regions, visits worlds which flesh cannot enter; he saw the souls in pain; he hears the doom of the judge; he beholds the penal metempsychosis; the Fates, with the rock and shears; and hears the intoxicating hum of their spindle.\n\nBut his circumspection never forsook him. One would say, he had read the inscription on the gates of Busyrane,\u2014\"Be bold;\" and on the second gate,\u2014\"Be bold, be bold and evermore be bold;\"and then again he paused well at the third gate,\u2014\"Be not too bold.\" His strength is like the momentum of a falling planet; and his discretion, the return of its due and perfect curve,\u2014so excellent is his Greek love of boundary, and his skill in definition. In reading logarithms, one is not more secure, than in following Plato in his flights. Nothing can be colder than his head, when the lightnings of his imagination are playing in the sky. He has finished his thinking, before he brings it to the reader; and he abounds in the surprises of a literary master. He has that opulence which furnishes, at every turn, the precise weapon he needs. As the rich man wears no more garments, drives no more horses, sits in no more chambers, than the poor,\u2014but has that one dress, or equipage, or instrument, which is fit for the hour and the need; so Plato, in his plenty, is never restricted, but has the fit word. There is, indeed, no weapon in all the armory of wit which he did not possess and use,\u2014epic, analysis, mania, intuition, music, satire, and irony, down to the customary and polite. His illustrations are poetry and his jests illustrations. Socrates' profession of obstetric art is good philosophy; and his finding that word \"cookery,\" and \"adulatory art,\" for rhetoric, in the Gorgias, does us a substantial service still. No orator can measure in effect with him who can give good nicknames.\n\nWhat moderation, and understatement, and checking his thunder in mid volley! He has good-naturedly furnished the courtier and citizen with all that can be said against the schools. \"For philosophy is an elegant thing, if any one modestly meddles with it; but, if he is conversant with it more than is becoming, it corrupts the man.\" He could well afford to be generous,\u2014he, who from the sunlike centrality and reach of his vision, had a faith without cloud. Such as his perception, was his speech: he plays with the doubt, and makes the most of it: he paints and quibbles; and by and by comes a sentence that moves the sea and land. The admirable earnest comes not only at intervals, in the perfect yes and no of the dialogue, but in bursts of light. \"I, therefore, Callicles, am persuaded by these accounts, and consider how I may exhibit my soul before the judge in a healthy condition. Wherefore, disregarding the honors that most men value, and looking to the truth, I shall endeavor in reality to live as virtuously as I can and, when I die, to die so. And I invite all other men, to the utmost of my power; and you, too, I in turn invite to this contest, which, I affirm, surpasses all contests here.\"\n\nHe is a great average man one who, to the best thinking, adds a proportion and equality in his faculties, so that men see in him their own dreams and glimpses made available, and made to pass for what they are. A great common sense is his warrant and qualification to be the world's interpreter. He has reason, as all the philosophic and poetic class have: but he has, also, what they have not,\u2014this strong solving sense to reconcile his poetry with the appearances of the world, and build a bridge from the streets of cities to the Atlantis. He omits never this graduation, but slopes his thought, however picturesque the precipice on one side, to an access from the plain. He never writes in ecstasy, or catches us up into poetic rapture.\n\nPlato apprehended the cardinal facts. He could prostrate himself on the earth, and cover his eyes, whilst he adorned that which cannot be numbered, or gauged, or known, or named: that of which everything can be affirmed and denied: that \"which is entity and nonentity.\" He called it super-essential. He even stood ready, as in the Parmenides, to demonstrate that it was so,\u2014that this Being exceeded the limits of intellect. No man ever more fully acknowledged the Ineffable. Having paid his homage, as for the human race, to the Illimitable, he then stood erect, and for the human race affirmed, \"And yet things are knowable!\"\u2014that is, the Asia in his mind was first heartily honored,\u2014the ocean of love and power, before form, before will, before knowledge, the Same, the Good, the One; and now, refreshed and empowered by this worship, the instinct of Europe, namely, culture, returns; and he cries, Yet things are knowable! They are knowable, because, being from one, things correspond. There is a scale: and the correspondence of heaven to earth, of matter to mind, of the part to the whole, is our guide. As there is a science of stars, called astronomy; a science of quantities called mathematics; a science of qualities, called chemistry; so there is a science of sciences,\u2014I call it Dialectic,\u2014which is the intellect discriminating the false and the true. It rests on the observation of identity and diversity; for, to judge, is to unite to an object the notion which belongs to it. The sciences, even the best,\u2014mathematics, and astronomy, are like sportsmen, who seize whatever prey offers, even without being able to make any use of them. Dialectic must teach the use of them. \"This is of that rank that no intellectual man will enter on any study for its own sake, but only with a view to advance himself in that one sole science which embraces all.\"\n\n\"The essence or peculiarity of man is to comprehend the whole; or that which in the diversity of sensations, can be comprised under a rational unity.\" \"The soul which has never perceived the truth, cannot pass into the human form.\" I announce to men the intellect. I announce the good of being interpenetrated by the mind that made nature: this benefit, namely, that it can understand nature, which it made and maketh. Nature is good, but intellect is better: as the law-giver is before the law-receiver. I give you joy, O sons of men: that truth is altogether wholesome; that we have hope to search out what might be the very self of everything. The misery of man is to be balked of the sight of essence, and to be stuffed with conjecture: but the supreme good is reality; the supreme beauty is reality; and all virtue and all felicity depend on this science of the real: for courage is nothing else than knowledge: the fairest fortune that can befall man, is to be guided by his daemon to that which is truly his own. This also is the essence of justice,\u2014to attend every one his own; nay, the notion of virtue is not to be arrived at, except through direct contemplation of the divine essence. Courage, then, for \"the persuasion that we must search that which we do not know, will render us, beyond comparison, better, braver, and more industrious, than if we thought it impossible to discover what we do not know, and useless to search for it.\" He secures a position not to be commanded, by his passion for reality; valuing philosophy only as it is the pleasure of conversing with real being.\n\nThus, full of the genius of Europe, he said, \"Culture.\" He saw the institutions of Sparta, and recognized more genially, one would say, than any since, the hope of education. He delighted in every accomplishment, in every graceful and useful and truthful performance; above all, in the splendors of genius and intellectual achievement. \"The whole of life, O Socrates,\" said Glauco, \"is, with the wise the measure of hearing such discourses as these.\" What a price he sets on the feats of talent, on the powers of Pericles, of Isocrates, of Parmenides! What price, above price on the talents themselves! He called the several faculties, gods, in his beautiful personation. What value he gives to the art of gymnastics in education; what to geometry; what to music, what to astronomy, whose appeasing and medicinal power he celebrates! In the Timseus, he indicates the highest employment of the eyes. \"By us it is asserted, that God invented and bestowed sight on us for this purpose,\u2014that, on surveying the circles of intelligence in the heavens, we might properly employ those of our own minds, which, though disturbed when compared with the others that are uniform, are still allied to their circulations; and that, having thus learned, and being naturally possessed of a correct reasoning faculty, we might, by imitating the uniform revolutions of divinity, set right our own wanderings and blunders.\" And in the Republic,\u2014\"By each of these disciplines, a certain organ of the soul is both purified and reanimated, which is blinded and buried by studies of another kind; an organ better worth saving than ten thousand eyes, since truth is perceived by this alone.\"\nHe said, Culture; but he first admitted its basis, and gave immeasurably the first place to advantages of nature. His patrician tastes laid stress on the distinctions of birth. In the doctrine of the organic character and disposition is the origin of caste. \"Such as were fit to govern, into their composition the informing Deity mingled gold: into the military, silver; iron and brass for husbandmen and artificers.\" The East confirms itself, in all ages, in this faith. The Koran is explicit on this point of caste. \"Men have their metal, as of gold and silver. Those of you who were the worthy ones in the state of ignorance, will be the worthy ones in the state of faith, as soon as you embrace it.\" Plato was not less firm. \"Of the five orders of things, only four can be taught in the generality of men.\" In the Republic, he insists on the temperaments of the youth, as the first of the first.\n\nA happier example of the stress laid on nature, is in the dialogue with the young Theages, who wishes to receive lessons from Socrates. Socrates declares that, if some have grown wise by associating with him, no thanks are due to him; but, simply, whilst they were with him, they grew wise, not because of him; he pretends not to know the way of it. \"It is adverse to many, nor can those be benefited by associating with me, whom the Daemons oppose, so that it is not possible for me to live with these. With many, however, he does not prevent me from conversing, who yet are not at all benefited by associating with me. Such, O Theages, is the association with me; for, if it pleases the God, you will make great and rapid proficiency: you will not, if he does not please. Judge whether it is not safer to be instructed by some one of those who have power over the benefit which they impart to men, than by me, who benefit or not, just as it may happen.\" As if he had said, \"I have no system. I cannot be answerable for you. You will be what you must. If there is love between us, inconceivably delicious and profitable will our intercourse be; if not, your time is lost, and you will only annoy me. I shall seem to you stupid, and the reputation I have, false. Quite above us, beyond the will of you or me, is this secret affinity or repulsion laid. All my good is magnetic, and I educate, not by lessons, but by going about my business.\"\n\nHe said, Culture; he said, Nature; and he failed not to add, \"There is also the divine.\" There is no thought in any mind, but it quickly tends to convert itself into a power, and organizes a huge instrumentality of means. Plato, lover of limits, loved the illimitable, saw the enlargement and nobility which come from truth itself, and good itself, and attempted, as if on the part of the human intellect, once for all, to do it adequate homage,\u2014homage fit for the immense soul to receive, and yet homage becoming the intellect to render. He said, then, \"Our faculties run out into infinity, and return to us thence. We can define but a little way; but here is a fact which will not be skipped, and which to shut our eyes upon is suicide. All things are in a scale; and, begin where we will, ascend and ascend. All things are symbolical; and what we call results are beginnings.\"\n\nA key to the method and completeness of Plato is his twice bisected line. After he has illustrated the relation between the absolute good and true, and the forms of the intelligible world, he says:\u2014\"Let there be a line cut in two, unequal parts. Cut again each of these two parts,\u2014one representing the visible, the other the intelligible world,\u2014and these two new sections, representing the bright part and the dark part of these worlds, you will have, for one of the sections of the visible world,\u2014images, that is, both shadows and reflections; for the other section, the objects of these images,-that is, plants, animals, and the works of art and nature. Then divide the intelligible world in like manner; the one section will be of opinions and hypotheses, and the other section, of truths.\" To these four sections, the four operations of the soul correspond,\u2014conjecture, faith, understanding, reason. As every pool reflects the image of the sun, so every thought and thing restores us an image and creature of the supreme Good. The universe is perforated by a million channels for his activity. All things mount and mount.\n\nAll his thought has this ascension; in Phaedrus, teaching that \"beauty is the most lovely of all things, exciting hilarity, and shedding desire and confidence through the universe, wherever it enters; and it enters, in some degree, into all things; but that there is another, which is as much more beautiful than beauty, as beauty is than chaos; namely, wisdom, which our wonderful organ of sight cannot reach unto, but which, could it be seen, would ravish us with its perfect reality.\" He has the same regard to it as the source of excellence in works of art. \"When an artificer, in the fabrication of any work, looks to that which always subsists according to the same; and, employing a model of this kind, expresses its idea and power in his work; it must follow, that his production should be beautiful. But when he beholds that which is born and dies, it will be far from beautiful.\"\n\nThus ever: the Banquet is a teaching in the same spirit, familiar now to all the poetry, and to all the sermons of the world, that the love of the sexes is initial; and symbolizes, at a distance, the passion of the soul for that immense lake of beauty it exists to seek. This faith in the Divinity is never out of mind, and constitutes the limitation of all his dogmas. Body cannot teach wisdom;\u2014God only. In the same mind, he constantly affirms that virtue cannot be taught; that it is not a science, but an inspiration; that the greatest goods are produced to us through mania, and are assigned to us by a divine gift.\n\nThis leads me to that central figure, which he has established in his Academy, as the organ through which every considered opinion shall be announced, and whose biography he has likewise so labored, that the historic facts are lost in the light of Plato's mind. Socrates and Plato are the double star, which the most powerful instruments will not entirely separate. Socrates, again, in his traits and genius, is the best example of that synthesis which constitutes Plato's extraordinary power. Socrates, a man of humble stem, but honest enough; of the commonest history; of a personal homeliness so remarkable, as to be a cause of wit in others,\u2014the rather that his broad good nature and exquisite taste for a joke invited the sally, which was sure to be paid. The players personated him on the stage; the potters copied his ugly face on their stone jugs. He was a cool fellow, adding to his humor a perfect temper, and a knowledge of his man, be he who he might whom he talked with, which laid the companion open to certain defeat in any debate,\u2014and in debate he immoderately delighted. The young men are prodigiously fond of him, and invite him to their feasts, whither he goes for conversation. He can drink, too; has the strongest head in Athens; and, after leaving the whole party under the table, goes away, as if nothing had happened, to begin new dialogues with somebody that is sober. In short, he was what our country-people call an old one.\n\nHe affected a good many citizen-like tastes, was monstrously fond of Athens, hated trees, never willingly went beyond the walls, knew the old characters, valued the bores and philistines, thought everything in Athens a little better than anything in any other place. He was plain as a Quaker in habit and speech, affected low phrases, and illustrations from cocks and quails, soup-pans and sycamore-spoons, grooms and farriers, and unnameable offices,\u2014especially if he talked with any superfine person. He had a Franklin-like wisdom. Thus, he showed one who was afraid to go on foot to Olympia, that it was no more than his daily walk within doors, if continuously extended, would easily reach.\n\nPlain old uncle as he was, with his great ears,\u2014an immense talker,\u2014the rumor ran, that, on one or two occasions, in the war with Boeotia, he had shown a determination which had covered the retreat of a troop; and there was some story that, under cover of folly, he had, in the city government, when one day he chanced to hold a seat there, evinced a courage in opposing singly the popular voice, which had well-nigh ruined him. He is very poor; but then he is hardy as a soldier, and can live on a few olives; usually, in the strictest sense, on bread and water, except when entertained by his friends. His necessary expenses were exceedingly small, and no one could live as he did. He wore no undergarment; his upper garment was the same for summer and winter; and he went barefooted; and it is said that, to procure the pleasure, which he loves, of talking at his ease all day with the most elegant and cultivated young men, he will now and then return to his shop, and carve statues, good or bad, for sale. However that be, it is certain that he had grown to delight in nothing else than this conversation; and that, under his hypocritical pretense of knowing nothing, he attacks and brings down all the fine speakers, all the fine philosophers of Athens, whether natives, or strangers from Asia Minor and the islands. Nobody can refuse to talk with him, he is so honest, and really curious to know; a man who was willingly confuted, if he did not speak the truth, and who willingly confuted others, asserting what was false; and not less pleased when confuted than when confuting; for he thought not any evil happened to men, of such a magnitude as false opinion respecting the just and unjust. A pitiless disputant, who knows nothing, but the bounds of whose conquering intelligence no man had ever reached; whose temper was imperturbable; whose dreadful logic was always leisurely and sportive; so careless and ignorant as to disarm the weariest, and draw them, in the pleasantest manner, into horrible doubts and confusion. But he always knew the way out; knew it, yet would not tell it. No escape; he drives them to terrible choices by his dilemmas, and tosses the Hippiases and Gorgiases, with their grand reputations, as a boy tosses his balls. The tyrannous realist!-Meno has discoursed a thousand times, at length, on virtue, before many companies, and very well, as it appeared to him; but, at this moment, he cannot even tell what it is,\u2014this cramp-fish of a Socrates has so bewitched him.\n\nThis hard-headed humorist, whose strange conceits, drollery, and bon-hommie, diverted the young patricians, whilst the rumor of his sayings and quibbles gets abroad every day, turns out, in a sequel, to have a probity as invincible as his logic and to be either insane, or, at least, under cover of this play, enthusiastic in his religion. When accused before the judges of subverting the popular creed, he affirms the immortality of the soul, the future reward and punishment; and, refusing to recant, in a caprice of the popular government, was condemned to die, and sent to the prison. Socrates entered the prison, and took away all ignominy from the place, which could not be a prison, whilst he was there. Crito bribed the jailor; but Socrates would not go out by treachery. \"Whatever inconvenience ensue, nothing is to be preferred before justice. These things I hear like pipes and drums, whose sound makes me deaf to everything you say.\" The fame of this prison, the fame of the discourses there, and the drinking of the hemlock, are one of the most precious passages in the history of the world.\n\nThe rare coincidence, in one ugly body, of the droll and the martyr, the keen street and market debater with the sweetest saint known to any history at that time, had forcibly struck the mind of Plato, so capacious of these contrasts; and the figure of Socrates, by a necessity, placed itself in the foreground of the scene, as the fittest dispenser of the intellectual treasurers he had to communicate. It was a rare fortune, that this Aesod of the mob, and this robed scholar, should meet, to make each other immortal in their mutual faculty. The strange synthesis, in the character of Socrates, capped the synthesis in the mind of Plato. Moreover, by this means, he was able, in the direct way, and without envy, to avail himself of the wit and weight of Socrates, to which unquestionably his own debt was great; and these derived again their principal advantage from the perfect art of Plato.\n\nIt remains to say, that the defect of Plato in power is only that which results inevitably from his quality. He is intellectual in his aim; and, therefore, in expression, literary. Mounting into heaven, driving into the pit, expounding the laws of the state, the passion of love, the remorse of crime, the hope of the parting soul,\u2014he is literary, and never otherwise. It is almost the sole deduction from the merit of Plato, that his writings have not,\u2014what is, no doubt, incident to this regnancy of intellect in his work,\u2014the vital authority which the screams of prophets and the sermons of unlettered Arabs and Jews possess. There is an interval; and to cohesion, contact is necessary.\n\nI know not what can be said in reply to this criticism, but that we have come to a fact in the nature of things: an oak is not an orange. The qualities of sugar remain with sugar, and those of salt, with salt.\n\nIn the second place, he has not a system. The dearest defenders and disciples are at fault. He attempted a theory of the universe, and his theory is not complete or self-evident. One man thinks he means this, and another, that: he has said one thing in one place, and the reverse of it in another place. He is charged with having failed to make the transition from ideas to matter. Here is the world, sound as a nut, perfect, not the smallest piece of chaos left, never a stitch nor an end, not a mark of haste, or botching, or second thought; but the theory of the world is a thing of shreds and patches.\n\nThe longest wave is quickly lost in the sea. Plato would willingly have a Platonism, a known and accurate expression for the world, and it should be accurate. It shall be the world passed through the mind of Plato,\u2014nothing less. Every atom shall have the Platonic tinge; every atom, every relation or quality you knew before, you shall know again and find here, but now ordered; not nature, but art. And you shall feel that Alexander indeed overran, with men and horses, some countries of the planet; but countries, and things of which countries are made, elements, planet itself, laws of planet and of men, have passed through this man as bread into his body, and become no longer bread, but body: so all this mammoth morsel has become Plato. He has clapped copyright on the world. This is the ambition of individualism. But the mouthful proves too large. Boa constrictor has good will to eat it, but he is foiled. He falls abroad in the attempt; and biting, gets strangled: the bitten world holds the biter fast by his own teeth. There he perishes: unconquered nature lives on, and forgets him. So it fares with all: so must it fare with Plato. In view of eternal nature, Plato turns out to be philosophical exercitations. He argues on this side, and on that. The acutest German, the lovingest disciple, could never tell what Platonism was; indeed, admirable texts can be quoted on both sides of every great question from him.\n\nThese things we are forced to say, if we must consider the effort of Plato, or of any philosopher, to dispose of Nature,\u2014which will not be disposed of. No power of genius has ever yet had the smallest success in explaining existence. The perfect enigma remains. But there is an injustice in assuming this ambition for Plato. Let us not seem to treat with flippancy his venerable name. Men, in proportion to their intellect, have admitted his transcendent claims. The way to know him, is to compare him, not with nature, but with other men. How many ages have gone by, and he remains unapproached! A chief structure of human wit, like Karnac, or the mediaeval cathedrals, or the Etrurian remains, it requires all the breadth of human faculty to know it. I think it is truliest seen, when seen with the most respect. His sense deepens, his merits multiply, with study. When we say, here is a fine collection of fables; or, when we praise the style; or the common sense; or arithmetic; we speak as boys, and much of our impatient criticism of the dialectic, I suspect, is no better. The criticism is like our impatience of miles when we are in a hurry; but it is still best that a mile should have seventeen hundred and sixty yards. The great-eyed Plato proportioned the lights and shades after the genius of our life.\n\nPlato: New Readings\n\nThe publication, in Mr. Bohn's \"Serial Library,\" of the excellent translations of Plato, which we esteem one of the chief benefits the cheap press has yielded, gives us an occasion to take hastily a few more notes of the elevation and bearings of this fixed star; or, to add a bulletin, like the journals, of Plato at the latest dates.\n\nModern science, by the extent of its generalization, has learned to indemnify the student of man for the defects of individuals, by tracing growth and ascent in races; and, by the simple expedient of lighting up the vast background, generates a feeling of complacency and hope. The human being has the saurian and the plant in his rear. His arts and sciences, the easy issue of his brain, look glorious when prospectively beheld from the distant brain of ox, crocodile, and fish. It seems as if nature, in regarding the geologic night behind her, when, in five or six millenniums, she had turned out five or six men, as Homer, Phidias, Menu, and Columbus, was nowise discontented with the result. These samples attested the virtue of the tree. These were a clear amelioration of trilobite and saurus, and a good basis for further proceeding. With this artist time and space are cheap, and she is insensible of what you say of tedious preparation. She waited tranquilly the flowing periods of paleontology, for the hour to be struck when man should arrive. Then periods must pass before the motion of the earth can be suspected; then before the map of the instincts and the cultivable powers can be drawn. But as of races, so the succession of individual men is fatal and beautiful, and Plato has the fortune, in the history of mankind, to mark an epoch.\n\nPlato's fame does not stand on a syllogism, or on any masterpieces of the Socratic, or on any thesis, as, for example, the immortality of the soul. He is more than an expert, or a school-man, or a geometer, or the prophet of a peculiar message. He represents the privilege of the intellect, the power, namely, of carrying up every fact to successive platforms, and so disclosing, in every fact, a germ of expansion. These expansions are in the essence of thought. The naturalist would never help us to them by any discoveries of the extent of the universe, but is as poor, when cataloguing the resolved nebula of Orion, as when measuring the angles of an acre. But the Republic of Plato, by these expansions, may be said to require, and so to anticipate, the astronomy of Laplace. The expansions are organic. The mind does not create what it perceives, any more than the eye creates the rose. In ascribing to Plato the merit of announcing them, we only say, here was a more complete man, who could apply to nature the whole scale of the senses, the understanding, and the reason. These expansions, or extensions, consist in continuing the spiritual sight where the horizon falls on our natural vision, and, by this second sight, discovering the long lines of law which shoot in every direction. Everywhere he stands on a path which has no end, but runs continuously round the universe. Therefore, every word becomes an exponent of nature. Whatever he looks upon discloses a second sense, and ulterior senses. His perception of the generation of contraries, of death out of life, and life out of death,\u2014that law by which, in nature, decomposition is recomposition, and putrefaction and cholera are only signals of a new creation; his discernment of the little in the large, and the large in the small; studying the state in the citizen, and the citizen in the state; and leaving it doubtful whether he exhibited the Republic as an allegory on the education of the private soul; his beautiful definitions of ideas, of time, of form, of figure, of the line, sometimes hypothetically given, as his defining of virtue, courage, justice, temperance; his love of the apologue, and his apologues themselves; the cave of Trophonius; the ring of Gyges; the charioteer and two horses; the golden, silver, brass, and iron temperaments; Theuth and Thamus; and the visions of Hades and the Fates\u2014fables which have imprinted themselves in the human memory like the signs of the zodiac; his soliform eye and his boniform soul; his doctrine of assimilation; his doctrine of reminiscence; his clear vision of the laws of return, or reaction, which secure instant justice throughout the universe, instanced everywhere, but specially in the doctrine, \"what comes from God to us, returns from us to God,\" and in Socrates' belief that the laws below are sisters of the laws above.\n\nMore striking examples are his moral conclusions. Plato affirms the coincidence of science and virtue; for vice can never know itself and virtue; but virtue knows both itself and vice. The eye attested that justice was best, as long as it was profitable; Plato affirms that it is profitable throughout; that the profit is intrinsic, though the just conceal his justice from gods and men; that it is better to suffer injustice, than to do it; that the sinner ought to covet punishment; that the lie was more hurtful than homicide; and that ignorance, or the involuntary lie, was more calamitous than involuntary homicide; that the soul is unwillingly deprived of true opinions; and that no man sins willingly; that the order of proceeding of nature was from the mind to the body; and, though a sound body cannot restore an unsound mind, yet a good soul can, by its virtue, render the body the best possible. The intelligent have a right over the ignorant, namely, the right of instructing them. The right punishment of one out of tune, is to make him play in tune; the fine which the good, refusing to govern, ought to pay, is, to be governed by a worse man; that his guards shall not handle gold and silver, but shall be instructed that there is gold and silver in their souls, which will make men willing to give them everything which they need. This second sight explains the stress laid on geometry. He saw that the globe of earth was not more lawful and precise than was the supersensible; that a celestial geometry was in place there, as a logic of lines and angles here below; that the world was throughout mathematical; the proportions are constant of oxygen, azote, and lime; there is just so much water, and slate, and magnesia; not less are the proportions constant of moral elements.\n\nThis eldest Goethe, hating varnish and falsehood, delighted in revealing the real at the base of the accidental; in discovering connection, continuity, and representation, everywhere; hating insulation; and appears like the god of wealth among the cabins of vagabonds, opening power and capability in everything he touches. Ethical science was new and vacant, when Plato could write thus:\u2014\"Of all whose arguments are left to the men of the present time, no one has ever yet condemned injustice, or praised justice, otherwise than as respects the repute, honors, and emoluments arising therefrom; while, as respects either of them in itself, and subsisting by its own power in the soul of the possessor, and concealed both from gods and men, no one has yet sufficiently investigated, either in poetry or prose writings,\u2014how, namely, that the one is the greatest of all the evils that the soul has within it, and justice the greatest good.\"\n\nHis definition of ideas, as what is simple, permanent, uniform, and self-existent, forever discriminating them from the notions of the understanding, marks an era in the world. He was born to behold the self-evolving power of spirit, endless generator of new ends; a power which is the key at once to the centrality and the evanescence of things. Plato is so centered, that he can well spare all his dogmas. Thus the fact of knowledge and ideas reveals to him the fact of eternity; and the doctrine of reminiscence he offers as the most probable particular explication. Call that fanciful,\u2014it matters not; the connection between our knowledge and the abyss of being is still real, and the explication must be not less magnificent.\n\nHe has indicated every eminent point in speculation. He wrote on the scale of the mind itself, so that all things have symmetry in his tablet. He put in all the past, without weariness, and descended into detail with a courage like that he witnessed in nature. One would say, that his forerunners had mapped out each a farm, or a district, or an island, in intellectual geography, but that Plato first drew the sphere. He domesticates the soul in nature; man is the microcosm. All the circles of the visible heaven represent as many circles in the rational soul. There is no lawless particle, and there is nothing casual in the action of the human mind. The names of things, too, are fatal, following the nature of things. All the gods of the Pantheon are, by their names, significant of a profound sense. The gods are the ideas. Pan is speech, or manifestation; Saturn, the contemplative; Jove, the regal soul; and Mars, passion. Venus is proportion; Calliope, the soul of the world; Aglaia, intellectual illustration.\n\nThese thoughts, in sparkles of light, had appeared often to pious and to poetic souls; but this well-bred, all-knowing Greek geometer comes with command, gathers them all up into rank and gradation, the Euclid of holiness, and marries the two parts of nature. Before all men, he saw the intellectual values of the moral sentiment. He describes his own ideal, when he paints in Timaeus a god leading things from disorder into order. He kindled a fire so truly in the center, that we see the sphere illuminated, and can distinguish poles, equator, and lines of latitude, every arc and node; a theory so averaged, so modulated, that you would say, the winds of ages had swept through this rhythmic structure, and not that it was the brief extempore blotting of one short-lived scribe. Hence it has happened that a very well-marked class of souls, namely those who delight in giving a spiritual, that is, an ethico-intellectual expression to every truth by exhibiting an ulterior end which is yet legitimate to it, are said to Platonize. Thus, Michel Angelo is a Platonist, in his sonnets. Shakspeare is a Platonist, when he writes, \"Nature is made better by no mean, but nature makes that mean,\" or,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\"He that can endure\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspTo follow with allegiance a fallen lord,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspDoes conquer him that did his master conquer,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspAnd earns a place in the story.\"\nHamlet is a pure Platonist, and 'tis the magnitude only of Shakspeare's proper genius that hinders him from being classed as the most eminent of this school. Swedenborg, throughout his prose poem of \"Conjugal Love,\" is a Platonist.\n\nHis subtlety commended him to men of thought. The secret of his popular success is the moral aim, which endeared him to mankind. \"Intellect,\" he said, \"is king of heaven and of earth;\" but, in Plato, intellect is always moral. His writings have also the sempiternal youth of poetry. For their arguments, most of them, might have been couched in sonnets; and poetry has never soared higher than in the Timaeus and the Phaedrus. As the poet, too, he is only contemplative. He did not, like Pythagoras, break himself with an institution. All his painting in the Republic must be esteemed mythical, with intent to bring out, sometimes in violent colors, his thought. You cannot institute, without peril of charlatan.\n\nIt was a high scheme, his absolute privilege for the best (which, to make emphatic, he expressed by community of women), as the premium which he would set on grandeur. There shall be exempts of two kinds: first, those who by demerit have put themselves below protection,\u2014outlaws; and secondly, those who by eminence of nature and desert are out of the reach of your rewards; let such be free of the city, and above the law. We confide them to themselves; let them do with us as they will. Let none presume to measure the irregularities of Michel Angelo and Socrates by village scales.\n\nIn his eighth book of the Republic, he throws a little mathematical dust in our eyes. I am sorry to see him, after such noble superiorities, permitting the lie to governors. Plato plays Providence a little with the baser sort, as people allow themselves with their dogs and cats.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1714971", "artist_names":

your son\nLord, oh Lord, oh Lord, have mercy on me\n'cause I don't wanna die in an air disaster\nAnd I don't wanna die in a freeway pile-up\nAnd I don't wanna go like a fading chorus\nAnd I don't

day\nAnd every night, I'd meet you on the patio\nAnd we'd take a flight\nAnd all of them were magical we don't ever fight\nAnd I've never felt so right\nAnd I love every single thing you do to me\nAnd I love the way you smell and look so beautifully\nAnd I wanna thank you for choosing me and I\nI think I'm addicted\n[Chorus]\nI said I think I'm addicted\nI think I'm addicted ohhh\nI think I'm addicted\nOr maybe just lifted\nI said I think I'm addicted\nI think I'm addicted ohhh\nI think I'm addicted\nYea girl we're just lifted\n\n[Verse 2]\nCan I take you to an island out in Maui Wowee\nBlue dreams got me seeing new things\nI'm not looking at any other girl you're pretty in every color\nYou and me purple blue and green like a mood ring\nI love you and you love me purple and green Barney\nThree little words three little birds Marley\nDon't worry about a thing I'll let the three birds sing\nWhen I wake up in the morning gotta have you first thing I'm addicted\n\n[Chorus]\nI said I think I'm addicted\nI think I'm addicted ohhh\nI think I'm addicted\nOr maybe just lifted\nI said I think I'm addicted\nI think I'm addicted ohhh\nI think I'm

"Woman in the Nineteenth Century (Chap. 1) LyricsWoman In The Nineteenth Century.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFrailty, thy name is WOMAN.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Earth waits for her Queen.\u201d\n\nThe connection between these quotations may not be obvious, but it is strict. Yet would any contradict us, if we made them applicable to the other side, and began also,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frailty, thy name is MAN.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Earth waits for its King?\n\nYet Man, if not yet fully installed in his powers, has given much earnest of his claims. Frail he is indeed,\u2014how frail! how impure! Yet often has the vein of gold displayed itself amid the baser ores, and Man has appeared before us in princely promise worthy of his future.\nIf, oftentimes, we see the prodigal son feeding on the husks in the fair field no more his own, anon we raise the eyelids, heavy from bitter tears, to behold in him the radiant apparition of genius and love, demanding not less than the all of goodness, power and beauty. We see that in him the largest claim finds a due foundation. That claim is for no partial sway, no exclusive possession. He cannot be satisfied with any one gift of life, any one department of knowledge or telescopic peep at the heavens. He feels himself called to understand and aid Nature, that she may, through his intelligence, be raised and interpreted; to be a student of, and servant to, the universe-spirit; and king of his planet, that, as an angelic minister he may bring it into conscious harmony with the law of that spirit.\n\nIn clear, triumphant moments, many times, has rung through the spheres the prophecy of his jubilee; and those moments, though past in time, have been translated into eternity by thought; the bright signs they left hang in the heavens, as single stars or constellations, and, already, a thickly sown radiance consoles the wanderer in the darkest night. Other heroes since Hercules have fulfilled the zodiac of beneficent labors, and then given up their mortal part to the fire without a murmur; while no God dared deny that they should have their reward,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Siquis tamen, Hercule, siquis\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forte Deo doliturus erit, daia praemia nollet,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sed meruise dari sciet, invitus que probabit,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assensere Dei\n\nSages and lawgivers have bent their whole nature to the search for truth, and thought themselves happy if they could buy, with the sacrifice of all temporal ease and pleasure, one seed for the future Eden. Poets and priests have strung the lyre with the heart-strings, poured out their best blood upon the altar, which, reared anew from age to age, shall at last sustain the flame pure enough to rise to highest heaven. Shall we not name with as deep a benediction those who, if not so immediately, or so consciously, in connection with the eternal truth, yet, led and fashioned by a divine instinct, serve no less to develop and interpret the open secret of love passing into life, energy creating for the purpose of happiness; the artist whose hand, drawn by a preexistent harmony to a certain medium, moulds it to forms of life more highly and completely organized than are seen elsewhere, and, by carrying out the intention of nature, reveals her meaning to those who are not yet wise enough to divine it; the philosopher who listens steadily for laws and causes, and from those obvious infers those yet unknown; the historian who, in faith that all events must have their reason and their aim, records them, and thus fills archives from which the youth of prophets may be fed; the man of science dissecting the statements, testing the facts and demonstrating order, even where he cannot its purpose?\n\nLives, too, which bear none of these names, have yielded tones of no less significance. The candlestick set in a low place has given light as faithfully, where it was needed, as that upon the hill, In close alleys, in dismal nooks, the Word has been read as distinctly, as when shown by angels to holy men in the dark prison. Those who till a spot of earth scarcely larger than is wanted for a grave, have deserved that the sun should shine upon its sod till violets answer.\n\nSo great has been, from time to time, the promise, that, in all ages, men have said the gods themselves came down to dwell with them; that the All-Creating wandered on the earth to taste, in a limited nature, the sweetness of virtue; that the All-Sustaining incarnated himself to guard, in space and time, the destinies of this world; that heavenly genius dwelt among the shepherds, to sing to them and teach them how to sing. Indeed,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDer stets den Hirten gnadig sich bewies.\u201d\n\u201cHe has constantly shown himself favorable to shepherds.\u201d\n\nAnd the dwellers in green pastures and natural students of the stars were selected to hail, first among men, the holy child, whose life and death were to present the type of excellence, which has sustained the heart of so large a portion of mankind in these later generations.\n\nSuch marks have been made by the footsteps of man (still, alas! to be spoken of as the ideal man), wherever he has passed through the wilderness of men, and whenever the pigmies stepped in one of those, they felt dilate within the breast somewhat that promised nobler stature and purer blood. They were impelled to forsake their evil ways of decrepit scepticism and covetousness of corruptible possessions. Convictions flowed in upon them. They, too, raised the cry: God is living, now, to-day; and all beings are brothers, for they are his children. Simple words enough, yet which only angelic natures can use or hear in their full, free sense.\n\nThese were the triumphant moments; but soon the lower nature took its turn, and the era of a truly human life was postponed.\n\nThus is man still a stranger to his inheritance, still a pleader, still a pilgrim. Yet his happiness is secure in the end. And now, no more a glimmering consciousness, but assurance begins to be felt and spoken, that the highest ideal Man can form of his own powers is that which he is destined to attain. Whatever the soul knows how to seek, it cannot fail to obtain. This is the Law and the Prophets. Knock and it shall be opened; seek and ye shall find. It is demonstrated; it is a maxim. Man no longer paints his proper nature in some form, and says, \u201cPrometheus had it; it is God-like;\u201d but \u201cMan must have it; it is human.\u201d However disputed by many, however ignorantly used, or falsified by those who do receive it, the fact of an universal, unceasing revelation has been too clearly stated in words to be lost sight of in thought; and sermons preached from the text, \u201cBe ye perfect,\u201d are the only sermons of a pervasive and deep-searching influence.\nBut, among those who meditate upon this text, there is a great difference of view as to the way in which perfection shall be sought.\n\n\u201cThrough the intellect,\u201d say some. \u201cGather from every growth of life its seed of thought; look behind every symbol for its law; if thou canst see clearly, the rest will follow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough the life,\u201d say others. \u201cDo the best thou knowest today. Shrink not from frequent error in this gradual, fragmentary state. Follow thy light for as much as it will show thee; be faithful as far as thou canst, in hope that faith presently will lead to sight. Help others, without blaming their need of thy help. Love much, and be forgiven.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt needs not intellect, needs not experience,\u201d says a third. \u201cIf you took the true way, your destiny would be accomplished, in a purer and more natural order. You would not learn through facts of thought or action, but express through them the certainties of wisdom. In quietness yield thy soul to the causal soul. Do not disturb thy apprenticeship by premature effort; neither check the tide of instruction by methods of thy own. Be still; seek not, but wait in obedience. Thy commission will be given.\u201d\n\nCould we indeed say what we want, could we give a description of the child that is lost, he would be found. As soon as the soul can affirm clearly that a certain demonstration is wanted, it is at hand. When the Jewish prophet described the Lamb, as the expression of what was required by the coming era, the time drew nigh. But we say not, see not as yet, clearly, what we would. Those who call for a more triumphant expression of love, a love that cannot be crucified, show not a perfect sense of what has already been given. Love has already been expressed, that made all things new, that gave the worm its place and ministry as well as the eagle; a love to which it was alike to descend into the depths of hell, or to sit at the right hand of the Father.\n\nYet, no doubt, a new manifestation is at hand, a new hour in the day of Man. We cannot expect to see any one sample of completed being, when the mass of men still lie engaged in the sod, or use the freedom of their limbs only with wolfish energy. The tree cannot come to flower till its root be free from the cankering worm, and its whole growth open to air and light. While any one is base, none can be entirely free and noble. Yet something new shall presently be shown of the life of man, for hearts crave, if minds do not know how to ask it.\n\nAmong the strains of prophecy, the following, by an earnest mind of a foreign land, written some thirty years ago, is not yet outgrown; and it has the merit of being a positive appeal from the heart, instead of a critical declaration what Man should not do.\n\n\u201cThe ministry of Man implies that he must be filled from the divine fountains which are being engendered through all eternity, so that, at the mere name of his master, he may be able to cast all his enemies into the abyss; that he may deliver all parts of nature from the barriers that imprison them; that he may purge the terrestrial atmosphere from the poisons that infect it; that he may preserve the bodies of men from the corrupt influences that surround, and the maladies that afflict them; still more, that he may keep their souls pure from the malignant insinuations which pollute, and the gloomy images that obscure them; that he may restore its serenity to the Word, which false words of men fill with mourning and sadness; that he may satisfy the desires of the angels, who await from him the development of the marvels of nature; that, in fine, his world may be filled with God, as eternity is.\u201d [Footnote: St. Martin]\n\nAnother attempt we will give, by an obscure observer of our own day and country, to draw some lines of the desired image. It was suggested by seeing the design of Crawford's Orpheus, and connecting with the circumstance of the American, in his garret at Rome, making choice of this subject, that of Americans here at home showing such ambition to represent the character, by calling their prose and verse \u201cOrphic sayings\u201d\u2014\u201dOrphics.\u201d We wish we could add that they have shown that musical apprehension of the progress of Nature through her ascending gradations which entitled them so to do, but their attempts are frigid, though sometimes grand; in their strain we are not warmed by the fire which fertilized the soil of Greece.\n\nOrpheus was a lawgiver by theocratic commission. He understood nature, and made her forms move to his music. He told her secrets in the form of hymns, Nature as seen in the mind of God. His soul went forth toward all beings, yet could remain sternly faithful to a chosen type of excellence. Seeking what he loved, he feared not death nor hell; neither could any shape of dread daunt his faith in the power of the celestial harmony that filled his soul.\n\nIt seemed significant of the state of things in this country, that the sculptor should have represented the seer at the moment when he was obliged with his hand to shade his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Orpheus must to the depths descend;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For only thus the Poet can be wise;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must make the sad Persephone his friend,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And buried love to second life arise;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again his love must lose through too much love,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must lose his life by living life too true,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For what he sought below is passed above,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Already done is all that he would do\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must tune all being with his single lyre,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must melt all rooks free from their primal pain,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must search all nature with his one soul's fire,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must bind anew all forms in heavenly chain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If he already sees what he must do,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well may he shade his eyes from the far-shining view.\nA better comment could not be made on what is required to perfect Man, and place him in that superior position for which he was designed, than by the interpretation of Bacon upon the legends of the Syren coast \u201cWhen the wise Ulysses passed,\u201d says he, \u201che caused his mariners to stop their ears, with wax, knowing there was in them no power to resist the lure of that voluptuous song. But he, the much experienced man, who wished to be experienced in all, and use all to the service of wisdom, desired to hear the song that he might understand its meaning. Yet, distrusting his own power to be firm in his better purpose, he caused himself to be bound to the mast, that he might be kept secure against his own weakness. But Orpheus passed unfettered, so absorbed in singing hymns to the gods that he could not even hear those sounds of degrading enchantment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, not a few believe, and men themselves have expressed the opinion, that the time is come when Eurydice is to call for an Orpheus, rather than Orpheus for Eurydice; that the idea of Man, however imperfectly brought out, has been far more so than that of Woman; that she, the other half of the same thought, the other chamber of the heart of life, needs now take her turn in the full pulsation, and that improvement in the daughters will best aid in the reformation of the sons of this age.\n\nIt should be remarked that, as the principle of liberty is better understood, and more nobly interpreted, a broader protest is made in behalf of Woman. As men become aware that few men have had a fair chance, they are inclined to say that no women have had a fair chance. The French Revolution, that strangely disguised angel, bore witness in favor of Woman, but interpreted her claims no less ignorantly than those of Man. Its idea of happiness did not rise beyond outward enjoyment, unobstructed by the tyranny of others. The title it gave was \u201ccitoyen,\u201d \u201ccitoyenne;\u201d and it is not unimportant to Woman that even this species of equality was awarded her. Before, she could be condemned to perish on the scaffold for treason, not as a citizen, but as a subject. The right with which this title then invested a human being was that of bloodshed and license. The Goddess of Liberty was impure. As we read the poem addressed to her, not long since, by Beranger, we can scarcely refrain from tears as painful as the tears of blood that flowed when \u201csuch crimes were committed in her name.\u201d Yes! Man, born to purify and animate the unintelligent and the cold, can, in his madness, degrade and pollute no less the fair and the chaste. Yet truth was prophesied in the ravings of that hideous fever, caused by long ignorance and abuse. Europe is conning a valued lesson from the blood-stained page. The same tendencies, further unfolded, will bear good fruit in this country.\n\nYet, by men in this country, as by the Jews, when Moses was leading them to the promised land, everything has been done that inherited depravity could do, to hinder the promise of Heaven from its fulfilment. The cross, here as elsewhere, has been planted only to be blasphemed by cruelty and fraud. The name of the Prince of Peace has been profaned by all kinds of injustice toward the Gentile whom he said he came to save. But I need not speak of what has been done towards the Red Man, the Black Man. Those deeds are the scoff of the world; and they have been accompanied by such pious words that the gentlest would not dare to intercede with \u201cFather, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\u201d\n\nHere, as elsewhere, the gain of creation consists always in the growth of individual minds, which live and aspire, as flowers bloom and birds sing, in the midst of morasses; and in the continual development of that thought, the thought of human destiny, which is given to eternity adequately to express, and which ages of failure only seemingly impede. Only seemingly; and whatever seems to the contrary, this country is as surely destined to elucidate a great moral law, as Europe was to promote the mental culture of Man.\n\nThough the national independence be blurred by the servility of individuals; though freedom and equality have been proclaimed only to leave room for a monstrous display of slave-dealing and slave-keeping; though the free American so often feels himself free, like the Roman, only to pamper his appetites end his indolence through the misery of his fellow-beings; still it is not in vain that the verbal statement has been made, \u201cAll men are born free and equal.\u201d There it stands, a golden certainty wherewith to encourage the good, to shame the bad. The New World may be called clearly to perceive that it incurs the utmost penalty if it reject or oppress the sorrowful brother. And, if men are deaf, the angels hear. But men cannot be deaf. It is inevitable that an external freedom, an independence of the encroachments of other men, such as has been achieved for the nation, should be so also for every member of it. That which has once been clearly conceived in the intelligence cannot fail, sooner or later, to be acted out. It has become a law as irrevocable as that of the Medes in their ancient dominion; men will privately sin against it, but the law, as expressed by a leading mind of the age,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTutti fatti a semblanza d'un Solo,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Figli tutti d'un solo riscatto,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In qual'ora, in qual parte del suolo\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trascorriamo quest' aura vital,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Siam fratelli, siam stretti ad un patto:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maladetto colui che lo infrange,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Che s'innalza sul finoco che piange\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Che contrista uno spirto immortal.\u201d [Footnote: Manzoni]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll made in the likeness of the One.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All children of one ransom,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In whatever hour, in whatever part of the soil,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We draw this vital air,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are brothers; we must be bound by one compact;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accursed he who infringes it,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who raises himself upon the weak who weep,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who saddens an immortal spirit.\u201d\n\nThis law cannot fail of universal recognition.

Accursed be he who sins in ignorance, if that ignorance be caused by sloth.\n\nWe sicken no less at the pomp than the strife of words. We feel that never were lungs so puffed with the wind of declamation, on moral and religious subjects, as now. We are tempted to implore these \u201cword-heroes,\u201d these word-Catos, word-Christs, to beware of can't [Footnote: Dr. Johnson's one piece of advice should be written on every door: \u201cClear your mind of can't.\u201d But Byron, to whom it was so acceptable, in clearing away the noxious vine, shook down the building. Sterling's emendation is worthy of honor:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRealize your can't, not cast it off.\u201d]\n\nabove all things; to remember that hypocrisy is the most hopeless as well as the meanest of crimes, and that those must surely be polluted by it, who do not reserve a part of their morality and religion for private use. Landor says that he cannot have a great deal of mind who cannot afford to let the larger part of it lie fallow; and what is true of genius is not less so of virtue. The tongue is a valuable member, but should appropriate but a small part of the vital juices that are needful all over the body. We feel that the mind may \u201cgrow black and rancid in the smoke\u201d even \u201cof altars.\u201d We start up from the harangue to go into our closet and shut the door. There inquires the spirit, \u201cIs this rhetoric the bloom of healthy blood, or a false pigment artfully laid on?\u201d And yet again we know where is so much smoke, must be some fire; with so much talk about virtue and freedom, must be mingled some desire for them; that it cannot be in vain that such have become the common topics of conversation among men, rather than schemes for tyranny and plunder, that the very newspapers see it best to proclaim themselves \u201cPilgrims,\u201d \u201cPuritans,\u201d \u201cHeralds of Holiness.\u201d The king that maintains so costly a retinue cannot be a mere boast, or Carabbas fiction. We have waited here long in the dust; we are tired and hungry; but the triumphal procession must appear at last.\n\nOf all its banners, none has been more steadily upheld, and under none have more valor and willingness for real sacrifices been shown, than that of the champions of the enslaved African. And this band it is, which, partly from a natural following out of principles, partly because many women have been prominent in that cause, makes, just now, the warmest appeal in behalf of Woman.\n\nThough there has been a growing liberality on this subject, yet society at large is not so prepared for the demands of this party, but that its members are, and will be for some time, coldly regarded as the Jacobins of their day.\n\n\u201cIs it not enough,\u201d cries the irritated trader, \u201cthat you have done all you could to break up the national union, and thus destroy the prosperity of our country, but now you must be trying to break up family union, to take my wife away from the cradle and the kitchen-hearth to vote at polls, and preach from a pulpit? Of course, if she does such things, she cannot attend to those of her own sphere. She is happy enough as she is. She has more leisure than I have,\u2014every means of improvement, every indulgence.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you asked her whether she was satisfied with these indulgences?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but I know she is. She is too amiable to desire what would make me unhappy, and too judicious to wish to step beyond the sphere of her sex. I will never consent to have our peace disturbed by any such discussions.\u201d\n\n\u201c'Consent\u2014you?' it is not consent from you that is in question\u2014it is assent from your wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm not I the head of my house?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not the head of your wife. God has given her a mind of her own.\n\n\u201cI am the head, and she the heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod grant you play true to one another, then! I suppose I am to be grateful that you did not say she was only the hand. If the head represses no natural pulse of the heart, there can be no question as to your giving your consent. Both will be of one accord, and there needs but to present any question to get a full and true answer. There is no need of precaution, of indulgence, nor consent. But our doubt is whether the heart does consent with the head, or only obeys its decrees with a passiveness that precludes the exercise of its natural powers, or a repugnance that turns sweet qualities to bitter, or a doubt that lays waste the fair occasions of life. It is to ascertain the truth that we propose some liberating measures.\u201d\n\nThus vaguely are these questions proposed and discussed at present. But their being proposed at all implies much thought, and suggests more. Many women are considering within themselves what they need that they have not, and what they can have if they find they need it. Many men are considering whether women are capable of being and having more than they are and have, and whether, if so, it will be best to consent to improvement in their condition.\n\nThis morning, I open the Boston \u201cDaily Mail,\u201d and find in its \u201cpoet's corner\u201d a translation of Schiller's \u201cDignity of Woman.\u201d In the advertisement of a book on America, I see in the table of contents this sequence, \u201cRepublican Institutions. American Slavery. American Ladies.\u201d\n\nI open the \u201cDeutsche Schnellpost\u201d published in New York, and find at the head of a column, Juden und Frauenemancipation in Ungarn\u2014\u201dEmancipation of Jews and Women in Hungary.\u201d\n\nThe past year has seen action in the Rhode Island legislature, to secure married women rights over their own property, where men showed that a very little examination of the subject could teach them much; an article in the Democratic Review on the same subject more largely considered, written by a woman, impelled, it is said, by glaring wrong to a distinguished friend, having shown the defects in the existing laws, and the state of opinion from which they spring; and on answer from the revered old man, J. Q. Adams, in some respects the Phocion of his time, to an address made him by some ladies. To this last I shall again advert in another place.\n\nThese symptoms of the times have come under my view quite accidentally: one who seeks, may, each month or week, collect more.\n\nThe numerous party, whose opinions are already labeled and adjusted too much to their mind to admit of any new light, strive, by lectures on some model-woman of bride-like beauty and gentleness, by writing and lending little treatises, intended to mark out with precision the limits of Woman's sphere, and Woman's mission, to prevent other than the rightful shepherd from climbing the wall, or the flock from using any chance to go astray.\n\nWithout enrolling ourselves at once on either side, let us look upon the subject from the best point of view which to-day offers; no better, it is to be feared, than a high house-top. A high hill-top, or at least a cathedral-spire, would be desirable.\n\nIt may well be an Anti-Slavery party that pleads for Woman, if we consider merely that she does not hold property on equal terms with men; so that, if a husband dies without making a will, the wife, instead of taking at once his place as head of the family, inherits only a part of his fortune, often brought him by herself, as if she were a child, or ward only, not an equal partner.\n\nWe will not speak of the innumerable instances in which profligate and idle men live upon the earnings of industrious wives; or if the wives leave them, and take with them the children, to perform the double duty of mother and father, follow from place to place, and threaten to rob them of the children, if deprived of the rights of a husband, as they call them, planting themselves in their poor lodgings, frightening them into paying tribute by taking from them the children, running into debt at the expense of these otherwise so overtasked helots. Such instances count up by scores within my own memory. I have seen the husband who had stained himself by a long course of low vice, till his wife was wearied from her heroic forgiveness, by finding that his treachery made it useless, and that if she would provide bread for herself and her children, she must be separate from his ill fame\u2014I have known this man come to install himself in the chamber of a woman who loathed him, and say she should never take food without his company. I have known these men steal their children, whom they knew they had no means to maintain, take them into dissolute company, expose them to bodily danger, to frighten the poor woman, to whom, it seems, the fact that she alone had borne the pangs of their birth, and nourished their infancy, does not give an equal right to them. I do believe that this mode of kidnapping\u2014and it is frequent enough in all classes of society\u2014will be by the next age viewed as it is by Heaven now, and that the man who avails himself of the shelter of men's laws to steal from a mother her own children, or arrogate any superior right in them, save that of superior virtue, will bear the stigma he deserves, in common with him who steals grown men from their mother-land, their hopes, and their homes.\n\nI said, we will not speak of this now; yet I have spoken, for the subject makes me feel too much. I could give instances that would startle the most vulgar and callous; but I will not, for the public opinion of their own sex is already against such men, and where cases of extreme tyranny are made known, there is private action in the wife's favor. But she ought not to need this, nor, I think, can she long. Men must soon see that as, on their own ground, Woman is the weaker party, she ought to have legal protection, which would make such oppression impossible. But I would not deal with \u201catrocious instances,\u201d except in the way of illustration, neither demand from men a partial redress in some one matter, but go to the root of the whole. If principles could be established, particulars would adjust themselves aright. Ascertain the true destiny of Woman; give her legitimate hopes, and a standard within herself; marriage and all other relations would by degrees be harmonized with these.\n\nBut to return to the historical progress of this matter. Knowing that there exists in the minds of men a tone of feeling toward women as toward slaves, such as is expressed in the common phrase, \u201cTell that to women and children;\u201d that the infinite soul can only work through them in already ascertained limits; that the gift of reason, Man's highest prerogative, is allotted to them in much lower degree; that they must be kept from mischief and melancholy by being constantly engaged in active labor, which is to be furnished and directed by those better able to think, &c., &c.,\u2014we need not multiply instances, for who can review the experience of last week without recalling words which imply, whether in jest or earnest, these views, or views like these,\u2014knowing this, can we wonder that many reformers think that measures are not likely to be taken in behalf of women, unless their wishes could be publicly represented by women?\n\n\u201cThat can never be necessary,\u201d cry the other side. \u201cAll men are privately influenced by women; each has his wife, sister, or female friends, and is too much biased by these relations to fail of representing their interests; and, if this is not enough, let them propose and enforce their wishes with the pen. The beauty of home would be destroyed, the delicacy of the sex be violated, the dignity of halls of legislation degraded, by an attempt to introduce them there. Such duties are inconsistent with those of a mother;\u201d and then we have ludicrous pictures of ladies in hysterics at the polls, and senate-chambers filled with cradles.\n\nBut if, in reply, we admit as truth that Woman seems destined by nature rather for the inner circle, we must add that the arrangements of civilized life have not been, as yet, such as to secure it to her. Her circle, if the duller, is not the quieter. If kept from \u201cexcitement,\u201d she is not from drudgery. Not only the Indian squaw carries the burdens of the camp, but the favorites of Louis XIV. accompany him in his journeys, and the washerwoman stands at her tub, and carries home her work at all seasons, and in all states of health. Those who think the physical circumstances of Woman would make a part in the affairs of national government unsuitable, are by no means those who think it impossible for negresses to endure field-work, even during pregnancy, or for sempstresses to go through their killing labors.\n\nAs to the use of the pen, there was quite as much opposition to Woman's possessing herself of that help to free agency as there is now to her seizing on the rostrum or the desk; and she is likely to draw, from a permission to plead her cause that way, opposite inferences to what might be wished by those who now grant it.\n\nAs to the possibility of her filling with grace and dignity any such position, we should think those who had seen the great actresses, and heard the Quaker preachers of modern times, would not doubt that Woman can express publicly the fulness of thought and creation, without losing any of the peculiar beauty of her sex. What can pollute and tarnish is to act thus from any motive except that something needs to be said or done. Woman could take part in the processions, the songs, the dances of old religion; no one fancied her delicacy was impaired by appearing in public for such a cause.\n\nAs to her home, she is not likely to leave it more than she now does for balls, theatres, meetings for promoting missions, revival meetings, and others to which she flies, in hope of an animation for her existence commensurate with what she sees enjoyed by men. Governors of ladies'-fairs are no less engrossed by such a charge, than the governor of a state by his; presidents of Washingtonian societies no less away from home than presidents of conventions. If men look straitly to it, they will find that, unless their lives are domestic, those of the women will not be. A house is no home unless it contain food and fire for the mind as well as for the body. The female Greek, of our day, is as much in the street as the male to cry, \u201cWhat news?\u201d We doubt not it was the same in Athens of old. The women, shut out from the market-place, made up for it at the religious festivals. For human beings are not so constituted that they can live without expansion. If they do not get it in one way, they must in another, or perish.\n\nAs to men's representing women fairly at present, while we hear from men who owe to their wives not only all that is comfortable or graceful, but all that is wise, in the arrangement of their lives, the frequent remark, \u201cYou cannot reason with a woman,\u201d\u2014when from those of delicacy, nobleness, and poetic culture, falls the contemptuous phrase \u201cwomen and children,\u201d and that in no light sally of the hour, but in works intended to give a permanent statement of the best experiences,\u2014when not one man, in the million, shall I say? no, not in the hundred million, can rise above the belief that Woman was made for Man,\u2014when such traits as these are daily forced upon the attention, can we feel that Man will always do justice to the interests of Woman? Can we think that he takes a sufficiently discerning and religious view of her office and destiny ever to do her justice, except when prompted by sentiment,\u2014accidentally or transiently, that is, for the sentiment will vary according to the relations in which he is placed? The lover, the poet, the artist, are likely to view her nobly. The father and the philosopher have some chance of liberality; the man of the world, the legislator for expediency, none.\n\nUnder these circumstances, without attaching importance, in themselves, to the changes demanded by the champions of Woman, we hail them as signs of the times. We would have every arbitrary barrier thrown down. We would have every path laid open to Woman as freely as to Man. Were this done, and a slight temporary fermentation allowed to subside, we should see crystallizations more pure and of more various beauty. We believe the divine energy would pervade nature to a degree unknown in the history of former ages, and that no discordant collision, but a ravishing harmony of the spheres, would ensue.\n\nYet, then and only then will mankind be ripe for this, when inward and outward freedom for Woman as much as for Man shall be acknowledged as a right, not yielded as a concession. As the friend of the negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage, so should the friend of Woman assume that Man cannot by right lay even well-meant restrictions on Woman. If the negro be a soul, if the woman be a soul, apparelled in flesh, to one Master only are they accountable. There is but one law for souls, and, if there is to be an interpreter of it, he must come not as man, or son of man, but as son of God.\n\nWere thought and feeling once so far elevated that Man should esteem himself the brother and friend, but nowise the lord and tutor, of Woman,\u2014were he really bound with her in equal worship,\u2014arrangements as to function and employment would be of no consequence. What Woman needs is not as a woman to act or rule, but as a nature to grow, as an intellect to discern, as a soul to live freely and unimpeded, to unfold such powers as were given her when we left our common home. If fewer talents were given her, yet if allowed the free and full employment of these, so that she may render back to the giver his own with usury, she will not complain; nay, I dare to say she will bless and rejoice in her earthly birth-place, her earthly lot. Let us consider what obstructions impede this good era, and what signs give reason to hope that it draws near.\n\nI was talking on this subject with Miranda, a woman, who, if any in the world could, might speak without heat and bitterness of the position of her sex. Her father was a man who cherished no sentimental reverence for Woman, but a firm belief in the equality of the sexes. She was his eldest child, and came to him at an age when he needed a companion. From the time she could speak and go alone, he addressed her not as a plaything, but as a living mind. Among the few verses he ever wrote was a copy addressed to this child, when the first locks were cut from her head; and the reverence expressed on this occasion for that cherished head, he never belied. It was to him the temple of immortal intellect. He respected his child, however, too much to be an indulgent parent. He called on her for clear judgment, for courage, for honor and fidelity; in short, for such virtues as he knew. In so far as he possessed the keys to the wonders of this universe, he allowed free use of them to her, and, by the incentive of a high expectation, he forbade, so far as possible, that she should let the privilege lie idle.\n\nThus this child was early led to feel herself a child of the spirit. She took her place easily, not only in the world of organized being, but in the world of mind. A dignified sense of self-dependence was given as all her portion, and she found it a sure anchor. Herself securely anchored, her relations with others were established with equal security. She was fortunate in a total absence of those charms which might have drawn to her bewildering flatteries, and in a strong electric nature, which repelled those who did not belong to her, and attracted those who did. With men and women her relations were noble,\u2014affectionate without passion, intellectual without coldness. The world was free to her, and she lived freely in it. Outward adversity came, and inward conflict; but that faith and self-respect had early been awakened which must always lead, at last, to an outward serenity and an inward peace.\n\nOf Miranda I had always thought as an example, that the restraints upon the sex were insuperable only to those who think them so, or who noisily strive to break them. She had taken a course of her own, and no man stood in her way. Many of her acts had been unusual, but excited no uproar. Few helped, but none checked her; and the many men who knew her mind and her life, showed to her confidence as to a brother, gentleness as to a sister. And not only refined, but very coarse men approved and aided one in whom they saw resolution and clearness of design. Her mind was often the leading one, always effective.\n\nWhen I talked with her upon these matters, and had said very much what I have written, she smilingly replied; \u201cAnd yet we must admit that I have been fortunate, and this should not be. My good father's early trust gave the first bias, and the rest followed, of course. It is true that I have had less outward aid, in after years, than most women; but that is of little consequence. Religion was early awakened in my soul,\u2014a sense that what the soul is capable to ask it must attain, and that, though I might be aided and instructed by others, I must depend on myself as the only constant friend. This self-dependence, which was honored in me, is deprecated as a fault in most women. They are taught to learn their rule from without, not to unfold it from within.\n\n\u201cThis is the fault of Man, who is still vain, and wishes to be more important to Woman than, by right, he should be.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen have not shown this disposition toward you,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo; because the position I early was enabled to take was one of self-reliance. And were all women as sure of their wants as I was, the result would be the same. But they are so overloaded with precepts by guardians, who think that nothing is so much to be dreaded for a woman as originality of thought or character, that their minds are impeded by doubts till they lose their chance of fair, free proportions. The difficulty is to got them to the point from which they shall naturally develop self-respect, and learn self-help.\n\n\u201cOnce I thought that men would help to forward this state of things more than I do now. I saw so many of them wretched in the connections they had formed in weakness and vanity. They seemed so glad to esteem women whenever they could.\n\n\u201c'The soft arms of affection,' said one of the most discerning spirits, 'will not suffice for me, unless on them I see the steel bracelets of strength.'\n\n\u201cBut early I perceived that men never, in any extreme of despair, wished to be women. On the contrary, they were ever ready to taunt one another, at any sign of weakness, with,\n\n\u201c'Art thou not like the women, who,'\u2014\nThe passage ends various ways, according to the occasion and rhetoric of the speaker. When they admired any woman, they were inclined to speak of her as 'above her sex.' Silently I observed this, and feared it argued a rooted scepticism, which for ages had been fastening on the heart, and which only an age of miracles could eradicate. Ever I have been treated with great sincerity; and I look upon it as a signal instance of this, that an intimate friend of the other sex said, in a fervent moment, that I 'deserved in some star to be a man.' He was much surprised when I disclosed my view of my position and hopes, when I declared my faith that the feminine side, the side of love, of beauty, of holiness, was now to have its full chance, and that, if either were better, it was better now to be a woman; for even the slightest achievement of good was furthering an especial work of our time. He smiled incredulously. 'She makes the best she can of it,' thought he. 'Let Jews believe the pride of Jewry, but I am of the better sort, and know better.'\n\n\u201cAnother used as highest praise, in speaking of a character in literature, the words 'a manly woman.'\n\n\u201cSo in the noble passage of Ben Jonson:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I meant the day-star should not brighter ride,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor shed like influence, from its lucent seat;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I meant she should be courteous, facile, sweet,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Free from that solemn vice of greatness, pride;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I meant each softest virtue there should meet,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fit in that softer bosom to abide,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only a learned and a manly soul\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I purposed her, that should with even powers\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rock, the spindle, and the shears control\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of destiny, and spin her own free hours.'\u201c\n\n\u201cMe thinks,\u201d said I, \u201cyou are too fastidious in objecting to this. Jonson, in using the word 'manly,' only meant to heighten the picture of this, the true, the intelligent fate, with one of the deeper colors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said she, \u201cso invariable is the use of this word where a heroic quality is to be described, and I feel so sure that persistence and courage are the most womanly no less than the most manly qualities, that I would exchange these words for others of a larger sense, at the risk of marring the fine tissue of the verse. Read, 'A heavenward and instructed soul,' and I should be satisfied. Let it not be said, wherever there is energy or creative genius, 'She has a masculine mind.'\u201c\n\nThis by no means argues a willing want of generosity toward Woman. Man is as generous towards her as he knows how to be.\n\nWherever she has herself arisen in national or private history, and nobly shone forth in any form of excellence, men have received her, not only willingly, but with triumph. Their encomiums, indeed, are always, in some sense, mortifying; they show too much surprise. \u201cCan this be you?\u201d he cries to the transfigured Cinderella; \u201cwell, I should never have thought it, but I am very glad. We will tell every one that you have 'surpassed your sex.'\u201c\n\nIn every-day life, the feelings of the many are stained with vanity. Each wishes to be lord in a little world, to be superior at least over one; and he does not feel strong enough to retain a life-long ascendency over a strong nature. Only a Theseus could conquer before he wed the Amazonian queen. Hercules wished rather to rest with Dejanira, and received the poisoned robe as a fit guerdon. The tale should be interpreted to all those who seek repose with the weak.\n\nBut not only is Man vain and fond of power, but the same want of development, which thus affects him morally, prevents his intellectually discerning the destiny of Woman: The boy wants no woman, but only a girl to play ball with him, and mark his pocket handkerchief.\n\nThus, in Schiller's Dignity of Woman, beautiful as the poem is, there is no \u201cgrave and perfect man,\u201d but only a great boy to be softened and restrained by the influence of girls. Poets\u2014the elder brothers of their race\u2014have usually seen further; but what can you expect of every-day men, if Schiller was not more prophetic as to what women must be? Even with Richter, one foremost thought about a wife was that she would \u201ccook him something good.\u201d But as this is a delicate subject, and we are in constant danger of being accused of slighting what are called \u201cthe functions,\u201d let me say, in behalf of Miranda and myself, that we have high respect for those who \u201ccook something good,\u201d who create and preserve fair order in houses, and prepare therein the shining raiment for worthy inmates, worthy guests. Only these \u201cfunctions\u201d must not be a drudgery, or enforced necessity, but a part of life. Let Ulysses drive the beeves home, while Penelope there piles up the fragrant loaves; they are both well employed if these be done in thought and love, willingly. But Penelope is no more meant for a baker or weaver solely, than Ulysses for a cattle-herd.\nThe sexes should not only correspond to and appreciate, but prophesy to one another. In individual instances this happens. Two persons love in one another the future good which they aid one another to unfold. This is imperfectly or rarely done in the general life. Man has gone but little way; now he is waiting to see whether Woman can keep step with him; but, instead of calling but, like a good brother, \u201cYou can do it, if you only think so,\u201d or impersonally, \u201cAny one can do what he tries to do;\u201d he often discourages with school-boy brag: \u201cGirls can't do that; girls can't play ball.\u201d But let any one defy their taunts, break through and be brave and secure, they rend the air with shouts.\n\nThis fluctuation was obvious in a narrative I have lately seen, the story of the life of Countess Emily Plater, the heroine of the last revolution in Poland. The dignity, the purity, the concentrated resolve, the calm, deep enthusiasm, which yet could, when occasion called, sparkle up a holy, an indignant fire, make of this young maiden the figure I want for my frontispiece. Her portrait is to be seen in the book, a gentle shadow of her soul. Short was the career. Like the Maid of Orleans, she only did enough to verify her credentials, and then passed from a scene on which she was, probably, a premature apparition.\n\nWhen the young girl joined the army, where the report of her exploits had preceded her, she was received in a manner that marks the usual state of feeling. Some of the officers were disappointed at her quiet manners; that she had not the air and tone of a stage-heroine. They thought she could not have acted heroically unless in buskins; had no idea that such deeds only showed the habit of her mind. Others talked of the delicacy of her sex, advised her to withdraw from perils and dangers, and had no comprehension of the feelings within her breast that made this impossible. The gentle irony of her reply to these self-constituted tutors (not one of whom showed himself her equal in conduct or reason), is as good as her indignant reproof at a later period to the general, whose perfidy ruined all.\n\nBut though, to the mass of these men, she was an embarrassment and a puzzle, the nobler sort viewed her with a tender enthusiasm worthy of her. \u201cHer name,\u201d said her biographer, \u201cis known throughout Europe. I paint her character that she may be as widely loved.\u201d\n\nWith pride, he shows her freedom from all personal affections; that, though tender and gentle in an uncommon degree, there was no room for a private love in her consecrated life. She inspired those who knew her with a simple energy of feeling like her own. \u201cWe have seen,\u201d they felt, \u201ca woman worthy the name, capable of all sweet affections, capable of stern virtue.\u201d\n\nIt is a fact worthy of remark, that all these revolutions in favor of liberty have produced female champions that share the same traits, but Emily alone has found a biographer. Only a near friend could have performed for her this task, for the flower was reared in feminine seclusion, and the few and simple traits of her history before her appearance in the field could only have been known to the domestic circle. Her biographer has gathered them up with a brotherly devotion.\n\nNo! Man is not willingly ungenerous. He wants faith and love, because he is not yet himself an elevated being. He cries, with sneering scepticism, \u201cGive us a sign.\u201d But if the sign appears, his eyes glisten, and he offers not merely approval, but homage.\n\nThe severe nation which taught that the happiness of the race was forfeited through the fault of a Woman, and showed its thought of what sort of regard Man owed her, by making him accuse her on the first question to his God,\u2014who gave her to the patriarch as a handmaid, and, by the Mosaical law, bound her to allegiance like a serf,\u2014even they greeted, with solemn rapture, all great and holy women as heroines, prophetesses, judges in Israel; and, if they made Eve listen to the serpent, gave Mary as a bride to the Holy Spirit. In other nations it has been the same down to our day. To the Woman who could conquer a triumph was awarded. And not only those whose strength was recommended to the heart by association with goodness and beauty, but those who were bad, if they were steadfast and strong, had their claims allowed. In any age a Semiramis, an Elizabeth of England, a Catharine of Russia, makes her place good, whether in a large or small circle. How has a little wit, a little genius, been celebrated in a Woman! What an intellectual triumph was that of the lonely Aspasia, and how heartily acknowledged! She, indeed, met a Pericles. But what annalist, the rudest of men, the most plebeian of husbands, will spare from his page one of the few anecdotes of Roman women\u2014Sappho! Eloisa! The names are of threadbare celebrity. Indeed, they were not more suitably met in their own time than the Countess Colonel Plater on her first joining the army. They had much to mourn, and their great impulses did not find due scope. But with time enough, space enough, their kindred appear on the scene. Across the ages, forms lean, trying to touch the hem of their retreating robes. The youth here by my side cannot be weary of the fragments from the life of Sappho. He will not believe they are not addressed to himself, or that he to whom they were addressed could be ungrateful. A recluse of high powers devotes himself to understand and explain the thought of Eloisa; he asserts her vast superiority in soul and genius to her master; he curses the fate that casts his lot in another age than hers. He could have understood her; he would have been to her a friend, such as Abelard never could. And this one Woman he could have loved and reverenced, and she, alas! lay cold in her grave hundreds of years ago. His sorrow is truly pathetic. These responses, that come too late to give joy, are as tragic as anything we know, and yet the tears of later ages glitter as they fall on Tasso's prison bars. And we know how elevating to the captive is the security that somewhere an intelligence must answer to his.\n\nThe Man habitually most narrow towards Woman will be flushed, as by the worst assault on Christianity, if you say it has made no improvement in her condition. Indeed, those most opposed to new acts in her favor, are jealous of the reputation of those which have been done.\n\nWe will not speak of the enthusiasm excited by actresses, improvisatrici, female singers,\u2014for here mingles the charm of beauty and grace,\u2014but female authors, even learned women, if not insufferably ugly and slovenly, from the Italian professor's daughter who taught behind the curtain, down to Mrs. Carter and Madame Dacier, are sure of an admiring audience, and, what is far better, chance to use what they have learned, and to learn more, if they can once get a platform on which to stand.\n\nBut how to get this platform, or how to make it of reasonably easy access, is the difficulty. Plants of great vigor will almost always struggle into blossom, despite impediments. But there should be encouragement, and a free genial atmosphere for those of move timid sort, fair play for each in its own kind. Some are like the little, delicate flowers which love to hide in the dripping mosses, by the sides of mountain torrents, or in the shade of tall trees. But others require an open field, a rich and loosened soil, or they never show their proper hues.\n\nIt may be said that Man does not have his fair play either; his energies are repressed and distorted by the interposition of artificial obstacles. Ay, but he himself has put them there; they have grown out of his own imperfections. If there is a misfortune in Woman's lot, it is in obstacles being interposed by men, which do not mark her state; and, if they express her past ignorance, do not her present needs. As every Man is of Woman born, she has slow but sure means of redress; yet the sooner a general justness of thought makes smooth the path, the better.\n\nMan is of Woman born, and her face bends over him in infancy with an expression he can never quite forget. Eminent men have delighted to pay tribute to this image, and it is an hackneyed observation, that most men of genius boast some remarkable development in the mother. The rudest tar brushes off a tear with his coat-sleeve at the hallowed name. The other day, I met a decrepit old man of seventy, on a journey, who challenged the stage company to guess where he was going. They guessed aright, \u201cTo see your mother.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cshe is ninety-two, but has good eyesight still, they say. I have not seen her these forty years, and I thought I could not die in peace without.\u201d I should have liked his picture painted as a companion-piece to that of a boisterous little boy, whom I saw attempt to declaim at a school exhibition\u2014\n\n\u201cO that those lips had language! Life has passed\nWith me but roughly since I heard thee last.\u201d\nHe got but very little way before sudden tears shamed him from the stage.\n\nSome gleams of the same expression which shone down upon his infancy, angelically pure and benign, visit Man again with hopes of pure love, of a holy marriage. Or, if not before, in the eyes of the mother of his child they again are seen, and dim fancies pass before his mind, that Woman may not have been born for him alone, but have come from heaven, a commissioned soul, a messenger of truth and love; that she can only make for him a home in which he may lawfully repose, in so far as she is\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTrue to the kindred points of Heaven and home.\u201d\n\nIn gleams, in dim fancies, this thought visits the mind of common men. It is soon obscured by the mists of sensuality, the dust of routine, and he thinks it was only some meteor or ignis fatuus that shone. But, as a Rosicrucian lamp, it burns unwearied, though condemned to the solitude of tombs; and to its permanent life, as to every truth, each age has in some form borne witness. For the truths, which visit the minds of careless men only in fitful gleams, shine with radiant clearness into those of the poet, the priest, and the artist.\n\nWhatever may have been the domestic manners of the ancients, the idea of Woman was nobly manifested in their mythologies and poems, whore she appears as Site in the Ramayana, a form of tender purity; as the Egyptian Isis, [Footnote: For an adequate description of the Isis, see Appendix A.] of divine wisdom never yet surpassed. In Egypt, too, the Sphynx, walking the earth with lion tread, looked out upon its marvels in the calm, inscrutable beauty of a virgin's face, and the Greek could only add wings to the great emblem. In Greece, Ceres and Proserpine, significantly termed \u201cthe great goddesses,\u201d were seen seated side by side. They needed not to rise for any worshipper or any change; they were prepared for all things, as those initiated to their mysteries knew. More obvious is the meaning of these three forms, the Diana, Minerva, and Vesta. Unlike in the expression of their beauty, but alike in this,\u2014that each was self-sufficing. Other forms were only accessories and illustrations, none the complement to one like these. Another might, indeed, be the companion, and the Apollo and Diana set off one another's beauty. Of the Vesta, it is to be observed, that not only deep-eyed, deep-discerning Greece, but ruder Rome, who represents the only form of good man (the always busy warrior) that could be indifferent to Woman, confided the permanence of its glory to a tutelary goddess, and her wisest legislator spoke of meditation as a nymph.\n\nPerhaps in Rome the neglect of Woman was a reaction on the manners of Etruria, where the priestess Queen, warrior Queen, would seem to have been so usual a character.\n\nAn instance of the noble Roman marriage, where the stern and calm nobleness of the nation was common to both, we see in the historic page through the little that is told us of Brutus and Portia. Shakspeare has seized on the relation in its native lineaments, harmonizing the particular with the universal; and, while it is conjugal love, and no other, making it unlike the same relation as seen in Cymbeline, or Othello, even as one star differeth from another in glory.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBy that great vow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which did incorporate and make us one,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfold to me, yourself, your other half,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why you are heavy. ...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dwell I but in the suburbs\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of your good pleasure?

In Sparta, thought, in this respect as in all others, was expressed in the characters of real life, and the women of Sparta were as much Spartans as the men. The \u201ccitoyen, citoyenne\u201d of France was here actualized. Was not the calm equality they enjoyed as honorable as the devotion of chivalry? They intelligently shared the ideal life of their nation.\n\nLike the men they felt:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHonor gone, all's gone:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Better never have been born.\u201d\n\nThey were the true friends of men. The Spartan, surely, would not think that he received only his body from his mother. The sage, had he lived in that community, could not have thought the souls of \u201cvain and foppish men will be degraded after death to the forms of women; and, if they do not then make great efforts to retrieve themselves, will become birds.\u201d\n\n(By the way, it is very expressive of the hard intellectuality of the merely mannish mind, to speak thus of birds, chosen always by the feminine poet as the symbols of his fairest thoughts.)\n\nWe are told of the Greek nations in general, that Woman occupied there an infinitely lower place than Man. It is difficult to believe this, when we see such range and dignity of thought on the subject in the mythologies, and find the poets producing such ideals as Cassandra, Iphigenia, Antigone, Macaria; where Sibylline priestesses told the oracle of the highest god, and he could not be content to reign with a, court of fewer than nine muses. Even Victory wore a female form.\n\nBut, whatever were the facts of daily life, I cannot complain of the age and nation which represents its thought by such a symbol as I see before me at this moment. It is a zodiac of the busts of gods and goddesses, arranged in pairs. The circle breathes the music of a heavenly order. Male and female heads are distinct in expression, but equal in beauty, strength and calmness. Each male head is that of a brother and a king,\u2014each female of a sister and a queen. Could the thought thus expressed be lived out, there would be nothing more to be desired. There would be unison in variety, congeniality in difference.\n\nComing nearer our own time, we find religion and poetry no less true in their revelations. The rude man, just disengaged from the sod, the Adam, accuses Woman to his God, and records her disgrace to their posterity. He is not ashamed to write that he could be drawn from heaven by one beneath him,\u2014one made, he says, from but a small part of himself. But in the same nation, educated by time, instructed by a succession of prophets, we find Woman in as high a position as she has ever occupied, No figure that has ever arisen to greet our eyes has been received with more fervent reverence than that of the Madonna. Heine calls her the Dame du Comptoir of the Catholic church, and this jeer well expresses a serious truth.\n\nAnd not only this holy and significant image was worshipped by the pilgrim, and the favorite subject of the artist, but it exercised an immediate influence on the destiny of the sex. The empresses who embraced the cross converted sons and husbands. Whole calendars of female saints, heroic dames of chivalry, binding the emblem of faith on the heart of the best-beloved, and wasting the bloom of youth in separation and loneliness, for the sake of duties they thought it religion to assume, with innumerable forms of poesy, trace their lineage to this one. Nor, however imperfect may be the action, in our day, of the faith thus expressed, and though we can scarcely think it nearer this ideal than that of India or Greece was near their ideal, is it in vain that the truth has been recognized, that Woman is not only a part of Man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, born that men might not be lonely\u2014but that women are in themselves possessors of and possessed by immortal souls. This truth undoubtedly received a greater outward stability from the belief of the church that the earthly parent of the Saviour of souls was a woman.\n\nThe Assumption of the Virgin, as painted by sublime artists, as also Petrarch's Hymn to the Madonna, [Footnote: Appendix B.] cannot have spoken to the world wholly without result, yet oftentimes those who had ears heard not.\n\nSee upon the nations the influence of this powerful example. In Spain look only at the ballads. Woman in these is \u201cvery Woman;\u201d she is the betrothed, the bride, the spouse of Man; there is on her no hue of the philosopher, the heroine, the savante, but she looks great and noble. Why? Because she is also, through her deep devotion, the betrothed of Heaven. Her upturned eyes have drawn down the light that casts a radiance round her. See only such a ballad as that of \u201cLady Teresa's Bridal,\u201d where the Infanta, given to the Moorish bridegroom, calls down the vengeance of Heaven on his unhallowed passion, and thinks it not too much to expiate by a life in the cloister the involuntary stain upon her princely youth. [Footnote: Appendix C.] It was this constant sense of claims above those of earthly love or happiness that made the Spanish lady who shared this spirit a guerdon to be won by toils and blood and constant purity, rather than a chattel to be bought for pleasure and service.\n\nGermany did hot need to learn a high view of Woman; it was inborn in that race. Woman was to the Teuton warrior his priestess, his friend, his sister,\u2014in truth, a wife. And the Christian statues of noble pairs, as they lie above their graves in stone, expressing the meaning of all the by-gone pilgrimage by hands folded in mutual prayer, yield not a nobler sense of the place and powers of Woman than belonged to the altvater day. The holy love of Christ which summoned them, also, to choose \u201cthe better part\u2014that which could not be taken from them,\u201d refined and hallowed in this nation a native faith; thus showing that it was not the warlike spirit alone that left the Latins so barbarous in this respect.\n\nBut the Germans, taking so kindly to this thought, did it the more justice. The idea of Woman in their literature is expressed both to a greater height and depth than elsewhere.\n\nI will give as instances the themes of three ballads:\n\nOne is upon a knight who had always the name of the Virgin on his lips. This protected him all his life through, in various and beautiful modes, both from sin and other dangers; and, when he died, a plant sprang from his grave, which so gently whispered the Ave Maria that none could pass it by with an unpurified heart.\n\nAnother is one of the legends of the famous Drachenfels. A maiden, one of the earliest converts to Christianity, was carried by the enraged populace to this dread haunt of \u201cthe dragon's fabled brood,\u201d to be their prey. She was left alone, but undismayed, for she knew in whom she trusted. So, when the dragons came rushing towards her, she showed them a crucifix and they crouched reverently at her feet. Next day the people came, and, seeing these wonders, were all turned to the faith which exalts the lowly.\n\nThe third I have in mind is another of the Rhine legends. A youth is sitting with the maid he loves on the shore of an isle, her fairy kingdom, then perfumed by the blossoming grape-vines which draped its bowers. They are happy; all blossoms with them, and life promises its richest vine. A boat approaches on the tide; it pauses at their foot. It brings, perhaps, some joyous message, fresh dew for their flowers, fresh light on the wave. No! it is the usual check on such great happiness. The father of the count departs for the crusade; will his son join him, or remain to rule their domain, and wed her he loves? Neither of the affianced pair hesitates a moment. \u201cI must go with my father,\u201d\u2014\u201dThou must go with thy father.\u201d It was one thought, one word. \u201cI will be here again,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen these blossoms have turned to purple grapes.\u201d \u201cI hope so,\u201d she sighed, while the prophetic sense said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nAnd there she waited, and the grapes ripened, and were gathered into the vintage, and he came not. Year after year passed thus, and no tidings; yet still she waited.\n\nHe, meanwhile, was in a Moslem prison. Long he languished there without hope, till, at last, his patron saint appeared in vision and announced his release, but only on condition of his joining the monastic order for the service of the saint.\n\nAnd so his release was effected, and a safe voyage home given. And once more he sets sail upon the Rhine. The maiden, still watching beneath the vines, sees at last the object of all this patient love approach\u2014approach, but not to touch the strand to which she, with outstretched arms, has rushed. He dares not trust himself to land, but in low, heart-broken tones, tells her of Heaven's will; and that he, in obedience to his vow, is now on his way to a convent on the river-bank, there to pass the rest of his earthly life in the service of the shrine. And then he turns his boat, and floats away from her and hope of any happiness in this world, but urged, as he believes, by the breath of Heaven.\n\nThe maiden stands appalled, but she dares not murmur, and cannot hesitate long. She also bids them prepare her boat. She follows her lost love to the convent gate, requests an interview with the abbot, and devotes her Elysian isle, where vines had ripened their ruby fruit in vain for her, to the service of the monastery where her love was to serve. Then, passing over to the nunnery opposite, she takes the veil, and meets her betrothed at the altar; and for a life-long union, if not the one they had hoped in earlier years.\n\nIs not this sorrowful story of a lofty beauty? Does it not show a sufficiently high view of Woman, of Marriage? This is commonly the chivalric, still more the German view.\n\nYet, wherever there was a balance in the mind of Man, of sentiment with intellect, such a result was sure. The Greek Xenophon has not only painted us a sweet picture of the domestic Woman, in his Economics, but in the Cyropedia has given, in the picture of Panthea, a view of Woman which no German picture can surpass, whether lonely and quiet with veiled lids, the temple of a vestal loveliness, or with eyes flashing, and hair flowing to the free wind, cheering on the hero to fight for his God, his country, or whatever name his duty might bear at the time. This picture I shall copy by and by. Yet Xenophon grew up in the same age with him who makes Iphigenia say to Achilles,\n\n\u201cBetter a thousand women should perish than one man cease to see\nthe light.\u201d\nThis was the vulgar Greek sentiment. Xenophon, aiming at the ideal Man, caught glimpses of the ideal Woman also. From the figure of a Cyrus the Pantheas stand not afar. They do not in thought; they would not in life.\n\nI could swell the catalogue of instances far beyond the reader's patience. But enough have been brought forward to show that, though there has been great disparity betwixt the nations as between individuals in their culture on this point, yet the idea of Woman has always cast some rays and often been forcibly represented.\n\nFar less has Woman to complain that she has not had her share of power. This, in all ranks of society, except the lowest, has been hers to the extent that vanity would crave, far beyond what wisdom would accept. In the very lowest, where Man, pressed by poverty, sees in Woman only the partner of toils and cares, and cannot hope, scarcely has an idea of, a comfortable home, he often maltreats her, and is less influenced by her. In all ranks, those who are gentle and uncomplaining, too candid to intrigue, too delicate to encroach, suffer much. They suffer long, and are kind; verily, they have their reward. But wherever Man is sufficiently raised above extreme poverty, or brutal stupidity, to care for the comforts of the fireside, or the bloom and ornament of life, Woman has always power enough, if she choose to exert it, and is usually disposed to do so, in proportion to her ignorance and childish vanity. Unacquainted with the importance of life and its purposes, trained to a selfish coquetry and love of petty power, she does not look beyond the pleasure of making herself felt at the moment, and governments are shaken and commerce broken up to gratify the pique of a female favorite. The English shopkeeper's wife does not vote, but it is for her interest that the politician canvasses by the coarsest flattery. France suffers no woman on her throne, but her proud nobles kiss the dust at the feet of Pompadour and Dubarry; for such flare in the lighted foreground where a Roland would modestly aid in the closet. Spain (that same Spain which sang of Ximena and the Lady Teresa) shuts up her women in the care of duennas, and allows them no book but the breviary; but the ruin follows only the more surely from the worthless favorite of a worthless queen. Relying on mean precautions, men indeed cry peace, peace, where there is no peace.\n\nIt is not the transient breath of poetic incense that women want; each can receive that from a lover. It is not life-long sway; it needs but to become a coquette, a shrew, or a good cook, to be sure of that. It is not money, nor notoriety, nor the badges of authority which men have appropriated to themselves. If demands, made in their behalf, lay stress on any of these particulars, those who make them have not searched deeply into the need. The want is for that which at once includes these and precludes them; which would not be forbidden power, lest there be temptation to steal and misuse it; which would not have the mind perverted by flattery from a worthiness of esteem; it is for that which is the birthright of every being capable of receiving it,\u2014the freedom, the religious, the intelligent freedom of the universe to use its means, to learn its secret, as far as Nature has enabled them, with God alone for their guide and their judge.\n\nYe cannot believe it, men; but the only reason why women over assume what is more appropriate to you, is because you prevent them from finding out what is fit for themselves. Were they free, were they wise fully to develop the strength and beauty of Woman; they would never wish to be men, or man-like. The well-instructed moon flies not from her orbit to seize on the glories of her partner. No; for she knows that one law rules, one heaven contains, one universe replies to them alike. It is with women as with the slave:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVor dem Sklaven, wenn er die Kette bricht,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vor dem frelen Menschen erzittert nicht.\u201d\n\nTremble not before the free man, but before the slave who has chains to break.\n\nIn slavery, acknowledged slavery, women are on a par with men. Each is a work-tool, an article of property, no more! In perfect freedom, such as is painted in Olympus, in Swedenborg's angelic state, in the heaven where there is no marrying nor giving in marriage, each is a purified intelligence, an enfranchised soul,\u2014no less.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJene himmlische Gestalten\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sie fragen nicht nach Mann und Welb,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Und keine kielder, keine Falten\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Umgeben den verklarten Leib.\u201d\n\nThe child who song this was a prophetic form, expressive of the longing for a state of perfect freedom, pure love. She could not remain here, but was translated to another air. And it may be that the air of this earth will never be so tempered that such can bear it long. But, while they stay, they must bear testimony to the truth they are constituted to demand.\n\nThat an era approaches which shall approximate nearer to such a temper than any has yet done, there are many tokens; indeed, so many that only a few of the most prominent can here be enumerated.\n\nThe reigns of Elizabeth of England and Isabella of Castile foreboded this era. They expressed the beginning of the new state; while they forwarded its progress. These were strong characters, and in harmony with the wants of their time. One showed that this strength did not unfit a woman for the duties of a wife and a mother; the other, that it could enable her to live and die alone, a wide energetic life, a courageous death. Elizabeth is certainly no pleasing example. In rising above the weakness, she did not lay aside the foibles ascribed to her sex; but her strength must be respected now, as it was in her own time.\n\nMary Stuart and Elizabeth seem types, moulded by the spirit of the time, and placed upon an elevated platform, to show to the coming ages Woman such as the conduct and wishes of Man in general is likely to make her. The first shows Woman lovely even to allurement; quick in apprehension and weak in judgment; with grace and dignity of sentiment, but no principle; credulous and indiscreet, yet artful; capable of sudden greatness or of crime, but not of a steadfast wisdom, nor self-restraining virtue. The second reveals Woman half-emancipated and jealous of her freedom, such as she has figured before or since in many a combative attitude, mannish, not equally manly; strong and prudent more than great or wise; able to control vanity, and the wish to rule through coquetry and passion, but not to resign these dear deceits from the very foundation, as unworthy a being capable of truth and nobleness. Elizabeth, taught by adversity, put on her virtues as armor, more than produced them in a natural order from her soul. The time and her position called on her to act the wise sovereign, and she was proud that she could do so, but her tastes and inclinations would have led her to act the weak woman. She was without magnanimity of any kind.\n\nWe may accept as an omen for ourselves that it was Isabella who furnished Columbus with the means of coming hither. This land must pay back its debt to Woman, without whose aid it would not have been brought into alliance with the civilized world.\n\nA graceful and meaning figure is that introduced to us by Mr. Prescott, in the Conquest of Mexico, in the Indian girl Marina, who accompanied Cortez, and was his interpreter in all the various difficulties of his career. She stood at his side, on the walls of the besieged palace, to plead with her enraged countrymen. By her name he was known in New Spain, and, after the conquest, her gentle intercession was often of avail to the conquered. The poem of the Future may be read in some features of the story of \u201cMalinche.\u201d\n\nThe influence of Elizabeth on literature was real, though, by sympathy with its finer productions, she was no more entitled to give name to an era than Queen Anne. It was simply that the fact of having a female sovereign on the throne affected the course of a writer's thoughts. In this sense, the presence of a woman on the throne always makes its mark. Life is lived before the eyes of men, by which their imaginations are stimulated as to the possibilities of Woman. \u201cWe will die for our king, Maria, Theresa,\u201d cry the wild warriors, clashing their swords; and the sounds vibrate through the poems of that generation. The range of female character in Spenser alone might content us for one period. Britomart and Belphoebe have as much room on the canvas as Florimel; and, where this is the case, the haughtiest Amazon will not murmur that Una should be felt to be the fairest type.\n\nUnlike as was the English queen to a fairy queen, we may yet conceive that it was the image of a queen before the poet's mind that called up this splendid court of women. Shakspeare's range is also great; but he has left out the heroic characters, such as the Macaria of Greece, the Britomart of Spenser. Ford and Massinger have, in this respect, soared to a higher flight of feeling than he. It was the holy and heroic Woman they most loved, and if they could not paint an Imogen, a Desdemona, a Rosalind, yet, in those of a stronger mould, they showed a higher ideal, though with so much less poetic power to embody it, than we see in Portia or Isabella, the simple truth of Cordelia, indeed, is of this sort. The beauty of Cordelia is neither male nor female; it is the beauty of virtue.\n\nThe ideal of love and marriage rose high in the mind of all the Christian nations who were capable of grave and deep feeling. We may take as examples of its English aspect the lines,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI could not love thee, dear, so much,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loved I not honor more.\u201d\n\nOr the address of the Commonwealth's man to his wife, as she looked out from the Tower window to see him, for the last time, on his way to the scaffold. He stood up in the cart, waved his hat, and cried, \u201cTo Heaven, my love, to Heaven, and leave you in the storm!\u201d\n\nSuch was the love of faith and honor,\u2014a love which stopped, like Colonel Hutchinson's, \u201con this side idolatry,\u201d because it was religious. The meeting of two such souls Donne describes as giving birth to an \u201cabler soul.\u201d\n\nLord Herbert wrote to his love,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWere not our souls immortal made,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our equal loves can make them such.\u201d\n\nIn the \u201cBroken Heart,\u201d of Ford, Penthea, a character which engages my admiration even more deeply than the famous one of Calanthe, is made to present to the mind the most beautiful picture of what these relations should be in their purity. Her life cannot sustain the violation of what she so clearly feels.\n\nShakspeare, too, saw that, in true love, as in fire, the utmost ardor is coincident with the utmost purity. It is a true lover that exclaims in the agony of Othello,\n\n\u201cIf thou art false, O then Heaven mocks Itself!\u201d\nThe son, framed, like Hamlet, to appreciate truth in all the beauty of relations, sinks into deep melancholy when he finds his natural expectations disappointed. He has no other. She to whom he gave the name, disgraces from his heart's shrine all the sex.\n\n\u201cFrailty, thy name is Woman.\u201d\nIt is because a Hamlet could find cause to say so, that I have put the line, whose stigma has never been removed, at the head of my work. But, as a lover, surely Hamlet would not have so far mistaken, as to have finished with such a conviction. He would have felt the faith of Othello, and that faith could not, in his more dispassionate mind, have been disturbed by calumny.\n\nIn Spain, this thought is arrayed in a sublimity which belongs to the sombre and passionate genius of the nation. Calderon's Justina resists all the temptation of the Demon, and raises her lover, with her, above the sweet lures of mere temporal happiness. Their marriage is vowed at the stake; their goals are liberated together by the martyr flame into \u201ca purer state of sensation and existence.\u201d\n\nIn Italy, the great poets wove into their lives an ideal love which answered to the highest wants. It included those of the intellect and the affections, for it was a love of spirit for spirit. It was not ascetic, or superhuman, but, interpreting all things, gave their proper beauty to details of the common life, the common day. The poet spoke of his love, not as a flower to place in his bosom, or hold carelessly in his hand, but as a light toward which he must find wings to fly, or \u201ca stair to heaven.\u201d He delighted to speak of her, not only as the bride of his heart, but the mother of his soul; for he saw that, in cases where the right direction had been taken, the greater delicacy of her frame and stillness of her life left her more open than is Man to spiritual influx. So he did not look upon her as betwixt him and earth, to serve his temporal needs, but, rather, betwixt him and heaven, to purify his affections and lead him to wisdom through love. He sought, in her, not so much the Eve as the Madonna.\n\nIn these minds the thought, which gleams through all the legends of chivalry, shines in broad intellectual effulgence, not to be misinterpreted; and their thought is reverenced by the world, though it lies far from the practice of the world as yet,\u2014so far that it seems as though a gulf of death yawned between.\n\nEven with such men the practice was, often, widely different from the mental faith. I say mental; for if the heart were thoroughly alive with it, the practice could not be dissonant. Lord Herbert's was a marriage of convention, made for him at fifteen; he was not discontented with it, but looked only to the advantages it brought of perpetuating his family on the basis of a great fortune. He paid, in act, what he considered a dutiful attention to the bond; his thoughts travelled elsewhere; and while forming a high ideal of the companionship of minds in marriage, he seems never to have doubted that its realization must be postponed to some other state of being. Dante, almost immediately after the death of Beatrice, married a lady chosen for him by his friends, and Boccaccio, in describing the miseries that attended, in this case,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe form of an union where union is none,\u201d\n\nspeaks as if these were inevitable to the connection, and as if the scholar and poet, especially, could expect nothing but misery and obstruction in a domestic partnership with Woman.\n\nCenturies have passed since, but civilized Europe is still in a transition state about marriage; not only in practice but in thought. It is idle to speak with contempt of the nations where polygamy is an institution, or seraglios a custom, while practices far more debasing haunt, well-nigh fill, every city and every town, and so far as union of one with one is believed to be the only pure form of marriage, a great majority of societies and individuals are still doubtful whether the earthly bond must be a meeting of souls, or only supposes a contract of convenience and utility. Were Woman established in the rights of an immortal being, this could not be. She would not, in some countries, be given away by her father, with scarcely more respect for her feelings than is shown by the Indian chief, who sells his daughter for a horse, and beats her if she runs away from her new home. Nor, in societies where her choice is left free, would she be perverted, by the current of opinion that seizes her, into the belief that she must marry, if it be only to find a protector, and a home of her own. Neither would Man, if he thought the connection of permanent importance, form it so lightly. He would not deem it a trifle, that he was to enter into the closest relations with another soul, which, if not eternal in themselves, must eternally affect his growth. Neither, did he believe Woman capable of friendship, [Footnote: See Appendix D, Spinoza's view] would he, by rash haste, lose the chance of finding a friend in the person who might, probably, live half a century by his side. Did love, to his mind, stretch forth into infinity, he would not miss his chance of its revelations, that he might the sooner rest from his weariness by a bright fireside, and secure a sweet and graceful attendant \u201cdevoted to him alone.\u201d Were he a step higher, he would not carelessly enter into a relation where he might not be able to do the duty of a friend, as well as a protector from external ill, to the other party, and have a being in his power pining for sympathy, intelligence and aid, that he could not give.\n\nWhat deep communion, what real intercourse is implied in sharing the joys and cares of parentage, when any degree of equality is admitted between the parties! It is true that, in a majority of instances, the man looks upon his wife as an adopted child, and places her to the other children in the relation of nurse or governess, rather than that of parent. Her influence with them is sure; but she misses the education which should enlighten that influence, by being thus treated. It is the order of nature that children should complete the education, moral and mental, of parents, by making them think what is needed for the best culture of human beings, and conquer all faults and impulses that interfere with their giving this to these dear objects, who represent the world to them. Father and mother should assist one another to learn what is required for this sublime priesthood of Nature. But, for this, a religious recognition of equality is required.\n\nWhere this thought of equality begins to diffuse itself, it is shown in four ways.\n\nFirst;\u2014The household partnership. In our country, the woman looks for a \u201csmart but kind\u201d husband; the man for a \u201ccapable, sweet-tempered\u201d wife. The man furnishes the house; the woman regulates it. Their relation is one of mutual esteem, mutual dependence. Their talk is of business; their affection shows itself by practical kindness. They know that life goes more smoothly and cheerfully to each for the other's aid; they are grateful and content. The wife praises her husband as a \u201cgood provider;\u201d the husband, in return, compliments her as a \u201ccapital housekeeper.\u201d This relation is good so far as it goes.\n\nNext comes a closer tie, which takes the form either of mutual idolatry or of intellectual companionship. The first, we suppose, is to no one a pleasing subject of contemplation. The parties weaken and narrow one another; they lock the gate against all the glories of the universe, that they may live in a cell together. To themselves they seem the only wise; to all others, steeped in infatuation; the gods smile as they look forward to the crisis of cure; to men, the woman seems an unlovely syren; to women, the man an effeminate boy.\n\nThe other form, of intellectual companionship, has become more and more frequent. Men engaged in public life, literary men, and artists, have often found in their wives companions and confidants in thought no less than in feeling. And, as the intellectual development of Woman has spread wider and risen higher, they have, not unfrequently, shared the same employment; as in the case of Roland and his wife, who were friends in the household and in the nation's councils, read, regulated home affairs, or prepared public documents together, indifferently. It is very pleasant, in letters begun by Roland and finished by his wife, to see the harmony of mind, and the difference of nature; one thought, but various ways of treating it.\n\nThis is one of the best instances of a marriage of friendship. It was only friendship, whose basis was esteem; probably neither party knew love, except by name. Roland was a good man, worthy to esteem, and be esteemed; his wife as deserving of admiration as able to do without it.\n\nMadame Roland is the fairest specimen we yet have of her class; as clear to discern her aim, as valiant to pursue it, as Spenser's Britomart; austerely set apart from all that did not belong to her, whether as Woman or as mind. She is an antetype of a class to which the coming time will afford a field\u2014the Spartan matron, brought by the culture of the age of books to intellectual consciousness and expansion. Self-sufficingness, strength, and clearsightedness were, in her, combined with a power of deep and calm affection. She, too, would have given a son or husband the device for his shield, \u201cReturn with it or upon it;\u201d and this, not because she loved little, but much. The page of her life is one of unsullied dignity. Her appeal to posterity is one against the injustice of those who committed such crimes in the name of Liberty. She makes it in behalf of herself and her husband. I would put beside it, on the shelf, a little volume, containing a similar appeal from the verdict of contemporaries to that of mankind, made by Godwin in behalf of his wife, the celebrated, the by most men detested, Mary Wolstonecraft. In his view, it was an appeal from the injustice of those who did such wrong in the name of virtue. Were this little book interesting for no other cause, it would be so for the generous affection evinced under the peculiar circumstances. This man had courage to love and honor this woman in the face of the world's sentence, and of all that was repulsive in her own past history. He believed he saw of what soul she was, and that the impulses she had struggled to act out were noble, though the opinions to which they had led might not be thoroughly weighed. He loved her, and he defended her for the meaning and tendency of her inner life. It was a good fact.\n\nMary Wolstonecraft, like Madame Dudevant (commonly known as George Sand) in our day, was a woman whose existence better proved the need of some new interpretation of Woman's Rights than anything she wrote. Such beings as these, rich in genius, of most tender sympathies, capable of high virtue and a chastened harmony, ought not to find themselves, by birth, in a place so narrow, that, in breaking bonds, they become outlaws. Were there as much room in the world for such, as in Spenser's poem for Britomart, they would not run their heads so wildly against the walls, but prize their shelter rather. They find their way, at last, to light and air, but the world will not take off the brand it has set upon them. The champion of the Rights of Woman found, in Godwin, one who would plead that cause like a brother. He who delineated with such purity of traits the form of Woman in the Marguerite, of whom the weak St. Leon could never learn to be worthy,\u2014a pearl indeed whose price was above rubies,\u2014was not false in life to the faith by which he had hallowed his romance. He acted, as he wrote, like a brother. This form of appeal rarely fails to touch the basest man:\u2014\u201dAre you acting toward other women in the way you would have men act towards your sister?\u201d George Sand smokes, wears male attire, wishes to be addressed as \u201cMon fr\u00e8re;\u201d\u2014perhaps, if she found those who were as brothers indeed, she would not care whether she were brother or sister. [Footnote: A note appended by my sister in this place, in the first edition, is here omitted, because it is incorporated in another article in this volume, treating of George Sand more at length.\u2014[ED.]] We rejoice to see that she, who expresses such a painful contempt for men in most of her works, as shows she must have known great wrong from them, depicts, in \u201cLa Roche Mauprat,\u201d a man raised by the workings of love from the depths of savage sensualism to a moral and intellectual life. It was love for a pure object, for a steadfast woman, one of those who, the Italian said, could make the \u201cstair to heaven.\u201d\n\nThis author, beginning like the many in assault upon bad institutions, and external ills, yet deepening the experience through comparative freedom, sees at last that the only efficient remedy must come from individual character. These bad institutions, indeed, it may always be replied, prevent individuals from forming good character, therefore we must remove them. Agreed; yet keep steadily the higher aim in view. Could you clear away all the bad forms of society, it is vain, unless the individual begin to be ready for better. There must be a parallel movement in these two branches of life. And all the rules left by Moses availed less to further the best life than the living example of one Messiah.\n\nStill the mind of the age struggles confusedly with these problems, better discerning as yet the ill it can no longer bear, than the good by which it may supersede it. But women like Sand will speak now and cannot be silenced; their characters and their eloquence alike foretell an era when such as they shall easier learn to lead true lives. But though such forebode, not such shall be parents of it. [Footnote: Appendix E.] Those who would reform the world must show that they do not speak in the heat of wild impulse; their lives must be unstained by passionate error; they must be severe lawgivers to themselves. They must be religious students of the divine purpose with regard to man, if they would not confound the fancies of a day with the requisitions of eternal good. Their liberty must be the liberty of law and knowledge. But as to the transgressions against custom which have caused such outcry against those of noble intention, it may be observed that the resolve of Eloisa to be only the mistress of Abelard, was that of one who saw in practice around her the contract of marriage made the seal of degradation. Shelley feared not to be fettered, unless so to be was to be false. Wherever abuses are seen, the timid will suffer; the bold will protest. But society has a right to outlaw them till she has revised her law; and this she must be taught to do, by one who speaks with authority, not in anger or haste.\n\nIf Godwin's choice of the calumniated authoress of the \u201cRights of Woman,\u201d for his honored wife, be a sign of a new era, no less so is an article to which I have alluded some pages back, published five or six years ago in one of the English Reviews, where the writer, in doing fall justice to Eloisa, shows his bitter regret that she lives not now to love him, who might have known bettor how to prize her love than did the egotistical Abelard.\n\nThese marriages, these characters, with all their imperfections, express an onward tendency. They speak of aspiration of soul, of energy of mind, seeking clearness and freedom. Of a like promise are the tracts lately published by Goodwyn Barmby (the European Pariah, as he calls himself) and his wife Catharine. Whatever we may think of their measures, we see in them wedlock; the two minds are wed by the only contract that can permanently avail, that of a common faith and a common purpose.\n\nWe might mention instances, nearer home, of minds, partners in work and in life, sharing together, on equal terms, public and private interests, and which wear not, on any side, the aspect of offence shown by those last-named: persons who steer straight onward, yet, in our comparatively free life, have not been obliged to run their heads against any wall. But the principles which guide them might, under petrified and oppressive institutions, have made them warlike, paradoxical, and, in some sense, Pariahs. The phenomena are different, the law is the same, in all these cases. Men and women have been obliged to build up their house anew from the very foundation. If they found stone ready in the quarry, they took it peaceably; otherwise they alarmed the country by pulling down old towers to get materials.\n\nThese are all instances of marriage as intellectual companionship. The parties meet mind to mind, and a mutual trust is produced, which can buckler them against a million. They work together for a common, purpose, and, in all these instances, with the same implement,\u2014the pen. The pen and the writing-desk furnish forth as naturally the retirement of Woman as of Man.\n\nA pleasing expression, in this kind, is afforded by the union in the names of the Howitts. William and Mary Howitt we heard named together for years, supposing them to be brother and sister; the equality of labors and reputation, even so, was auspicious; more so, now we find them man and wife. In his late work on Germany, Howitt mentions his wife, with pride, as one among the constellation of distinguished English-women, and in a graceful, simple manner. And still we contemplate with pleasure the partnership in literature and affection between the Howitts,\u2014the congenial pursuits and productions\u2014the pedestrian tours wherein the married pair showed that marriage, on a wide enough basis, does not destroy the \u201cinexhaustible\u201d entertainment which lovers find in one another's company.\n\nIn naming these instances, I do not mean to imply that community of employment is essential to the union of husband and wife, more than to the union of friends. Harmony exists in difference, no less than in likeness, if only the same key-note govern both parts. Woman the poem, Man the poet! Woman the heart, Man the head! Such divisions are only important when they are never to be transcended. If nature is never bound down, nor the voice of inspiration stifled, that is enough. We are pleased that women should write and speak, if they feel need of it, from having something to tell; but silence for ages would be no misfortune, if that silence be from divine command, and not from Man's tradition.\n\nWhile Goetz Von Berlichingen rides to battle, his wife is busy in the kitchen; but difference of occupation does not prevent that community of inward life, that perfect esteem, with which he says,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhom God loves, to him gives he such a wife.\u201d\n\nManzoni thus dedicates his \u201cAdelchi.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo his beloved and venerated wife, Enrichetta Luigia Blondel, who, with conjugal affection and maternal wisdom, has preserved a virgin mind, the author dedicates this 'Adelchi,' grieving that he could not, by a more splendid and more durable monument, honor the dear name, and the memory of so many virtues.\u201d\n\nThe relation could not be fairer, nor more equal, if she, too, had written poems. Yet the position of the parties might have been the reverse as well; the Woman might have sung the deeds, given voice to the life of the Man, and beauty would have been the result; as we see, in pictures of Arcadia, the nymph singing to the shepherds, or the shepherd, with his pipe, alluring the nymphs; either makes a good picture. The sounding lyre requires not muscular strength, but energy of soul to animate the hand which would control it. Nature seems to delight in varying the arrangements, as if to show that she will be fettered by no rule; and we must admit the same varieties that she admits.\n\nThe fourth and highest grade of marriage union is the religious, which may be expressed as pilgrimage toward a common shrine. This includes the others: home sympathies and household wisdom, for these pilgrims must know how to assist each other along the dusty way; intellectual communion, for how sad it would be on such a journey to have a companion to whom you could not communicate your thoughts and aspirations as they sprang to life; who would have no feeling for the prospects that open, more and more glorious as we advance; who would never see the flowers that may be gathered by the most industrious traveller! It must include all these.\n\nSuch a fellow-pilgrim Count Zinzendorf seems to have found in his countess, of whom he thus writes:\n\n\u201cTwenty-five years' experience has shown me that just the help-meet whom I have is the only one that could suit my vocation. Who else could have so carried through my family affairs? Who lived so spotlessly before the world? Who so wisely aided me in my rejection of a dry morality? Who so clearly set aside the Pharisaism which, as years passed, threatened to creep in among us? Who so deeply discerned as to the spirits of delusion which sought to bewilder us? Who would have governed my whole economy so wisely, richly and hospitably, when circumstances commanded? Who have taken indifferently the part of servant or mistress, without, on the one side, affecting an especial spirituality; on the other, being sullied by any worldly pride? Who, in a community where all ranks are eager to be on a level, would, from wise and real causes, have known how to maintain inward and outward distinctions? Who, without a murmur, have seen her husband encounter such dangers by land and sea? Who undertaken with him, and sustained, such astonishing pilgrimages? Who, amid such difficulties, would have always held up her head and supported me? Who found such vast sums of money, and acquitted them on her own credit? And, finally, who, of all human beings, could so well understand and interpret to others my inner and outer being as this one, of such nobleness in her way of thinking, such great intellectual capacity, and so free from the theological perplexities that enveloped me!\u201d\n\nLet any one peruse, with all intentness, the lineaments of this portrait, and see if the husband had not reason, with this air of solemn rapture and conviction, to challenge comparison? We are reminded of the majestic cadence of the line whose feet stop in the just proportion of Humanity,\n\n\u201cDaughter of God and Mati, accomplished Eve!\u201d\nAn observer [Footnote: Spangenberg] adds this testimony:\n\n\u201cWe may, in many marriages, regard it as the best arrangement, if the man has so much advantage over his wife, that she can, without much thought of her own, be led and directed by him as by a father. But it was not so with the count and his consort. She was not made to be a copy; she was an original; and, while she loved and honored him, she thought for herself, on all subjects, with so much intelligence, that he could and did look on her as a sister and friend also.\u201d\n\nCompare with this refined specimen of a religiously civilized life the following imperfect sketch of a North American Indian, and we shall see that the same causes will always produce the same results, The Flying Pigeon (Ratchewaine) was the wife of a barbarous chief, who had six others; but she was his only true wife, because the only one of a strong and pure character, and, having this, inspired a veneration, as like as the mind of the man permitted to that inspired by the Countess Zinzendorf. She died when her son was only four years old, yet left on his mind a feeling of reverent love worthy the thought of Christian chivalry. Grown to manhood, he shed tears on seeing her portrait.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE FLYING PIGEON.\n\n\u201cRatchewaine was chaste, mild, gentle in her disposition, kind, generous, and devoted to her husband. A harsh word was never known to proceed from her mouth; nor was she ever known to be in a passion. Mabaskah used to say of her, after her death, that her hand was shut when those who did not want came into her presence; but when the really poor came in, it was like a strainer full of holes, letting all she held in it pass through. In the exercise of generous feeling she was uniform, It was not indebted for its exercise to whim, nor caprice, nor partiality. No matter of what nation the applicant for her bounty was, or whether at war or peace with her nation; if he were hungry, she fed him; if naked, she clothed him; and, if houseless, she gave him shelter. The continued exercise of this generous feeling kept her poor. And she has been known to give away her last blanket\u2014all the honey that was in the lodge, the last bladder of bear's oil, and the last piece of dried meat.\n\n\u201cShe was scrupulously exact in the observance of all the religious rites which her faith imposed upon her. Her conscience is represented to have been extremely tender. She often feared that her acts were displeasing to the Great Spirit, when she would blacken her face, and retire to some lone place, and fast and pray.\u201d\n\nTo these traits should be added, but for want of room, anecdotes which show the quick decision and vivacity of her mind. Her face was in harmony with this combination. Her brow is as ideal and the eyes and lids as devout and modest as the Italian picture of the Madonna, while the lower part of the face has the simplicity and childish strength of the Indian race. Her picture presents the finest specimen of Indian beauty we have ever seen. Such a Woman is the sister and friend of all beings, as the worthy Man is their brother and helper.\n\nWith like pleasure we survey the pairs wedded on the eve of missionary effort They, indeed, are fellow-pilgrims on the well-made road, and whether or no they accomplish all they hope for the sad Hindoo, or the nearer savage, we feel that in the burning waste their love is like to be a healing dew, in the forlorn jungle a tent of solace to one another. They meet, as children of one Father, to read together one book of instruction.\n\nWe must insert in this connection the most beautiful picture presented by ancient literature of wedded love under this noble form.\n\nIt is from the romance in which Xenophon, the chivalrous Greek, presents his ideal of what human nature should be.\n\nThe generals of Cyrus had taken captive a princess, a woman of unequalled beauty, and hastened to present her to the prince as that part of the spoil he would think most worthy of his acceptance. Cyrus visits the lady, and is filled with immediate admiration by the modesty and majesty with which she receives him. He finds her name is Panthea, and that she is the wife of Abradatus, a young king whom she entirely loves. He protects her as a sister, in his camp, till he can restore her to her husband.\n\nAfter the first transports of joy at this reunion, the heart of Panthea is bent on showing her love and gratitude to her magnanimous and delicate protector. And as she has nothing so precious to give as the aid of Abradatus, that is what she most wishes to offer. Her husband is of one soul with her in this, as in all things.\n\nThe description of her grief and self-destruction, after the death which ensued upon this devotion, I have seen quoted, but never that of their parting when she sends him forth to battle. I shall copy both. If they have been read by any of my readers, they may be so again with profit in this connection, for never were the heroism of a true Woman, and the purity of love in a true marriage, painted in colors more delicate and more lively.\n\n\u201cThe chariot of Abradatus, that had four perches and eight horses, was completely adorned for him; and when he was going to put on his linen corslet, which was a sort of armor used by those of his country, Panthea brought him a golden helmet, and arm-pieces, broad bracelets for his wrists, a purple habit that reached down to his feet, and hung in folds at the bottom, and a crest dyed of a violet color. These things she had made, unknown to her husband, and by taking the measure of his armor. He wondered when he saw them, and inquired thus of Panthea: 'And have you made me these arms, woman, by destroying your own ornaments?' 'No, by Jove!' said Panthea, 'not what is the most valuable of them; for it is you, if you appear to others to be what I think you, that will be my greatest ornament.' And, saying that, she put on him the armor, and, though she endeavored to conceal it, the tears poured down her checks. When Abradatus, who was before a man of fine appearance, was set out in those arms, he appeared the most beautiful and noble of all, especially being likewise so by nature. Then, taking the reins from the driver, he was just preparing to mount the chariot, when Panthea, after she had desired all that were there to retire, thus said:\n\n\u201c'O Abradatus! if ever there was a woman who had a greater regard to her husband than to her own soul, I believe you know that I am such an one; what need I therefore speak of things in particular? for I reckon that my actions have convinced you more than any words I can now use. And yet, though I stand thus affected toward you, as you know I do, I swear, by this friendship of mine and yours, that I certainly would rather choose to be put under ground jointly with you, approving yourself a brave man, than to live with you in disgrace and shame; so much do I think you and myself worthy of the noblest things. Then I think that we both lie under great obligations to Cyrus, that, when I was a captive, and chosen out for himself, he thought fit to treat me neither as a slave, nor, indeed, as a woman of mean account, but he took and kept me for you, as if I were his brother's wife. Besides, when Araspes, who was my guard, went away from him, I promised him, that, if he would allow me to send for you, you would come to him, and approve yourself a much better and move faithful friend than Araspes.'\n\n\u201cThus she spoke; and Abradatus, being struck with admiration at her discourse, laying, his hand gently on her head, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, made this prayer: 'Do thou, O greatest Jove! I grant me to appear a husband worthy of Panthea, and a friend worthy of Cyrus, who has done us so much honor!'\n\n\u201cHaving said this, he mounted the chariot by the door of the driver's seat; and, after he had got up, when the driver shut the door, Panthea, who had now no other way to salute him, kissed the seat of the chariot. The chariot then moved, and she, unknown to him, followed, till Abradatus turning about, and seeing her, said: 'Take courage, Panthea! Fare you happily and well, and now go your ways.' On this her women and servants carried her to her conveyance, and, laying her down, concealed her by throwing the covering of a tent over her. The people, though Abradatus and his chariot made a noble spectacle, were not able to look at him till Panthea was gone.\u201d\n\nAfter the battle\u2014\n\n\u201cCyrus calling to some of his servants, 'Tell me, said he, 'has any one seen Abradatus? for I admire that he now does not appear.' One replied, 'My sovereign, it is because he is not living, but died in the battle as he broke in with his chariot on the Egyptians. All the rest, except his particular companions, they say, turned off when they saw the Egyptians' compact body. His wife is now said to have taken up his dead body, to have placed it in the carriage that she herself was conveyed in, and to have brought it hither to some place on the river Pactolus, and her servants are digging a grave on a certain elevation. They say that his wife, after setting him out with all the ornaments she has, is sitting on the ground with his head on her knees.' Cyrus, hearing this, gave himself a blow on the thigh, mounted his horse at a leap, and, taking with him a thousand horse, rode away to this scene of affliction; but gave orders to Gadatas and Gobryas to take with them all the rich ornaments proper for a friend and an excellent man deceased, and to follow after him; and whoever had herds of cattle with him, he ordered them to take both oxen, and horses, and sheep in good number, and to bring them away to the place where, by inquiry, they should find him to be, that he might sacrifice these to Abradatus.\n\n\u201cAs soon as he saw the woman sitting on the ground, and the dead body there lying, he shed tears at the afflicting sight, and said: 'Alas! thou brave and faithful soul, hast thou left us, and art thou gone?' At the same time he took him by the right hand, and the hand of the deceased came away, for it had been cut off with a sword by the Egyptians. He, at the sight of this, became yet much more concerned than before. The woman shrieked out in a lamentable manner, and, taking the hand from Cyrus, kissed it, fitted it to its proper place again, as well as she could, and said: 'The rest, Cyrus, is in the same condition, but what need you see it? And I know that I was not one of the least concerned in these his sufferings, and, perhaps, you were not less so; for I, fool that I was! frequently exhorted him to behave in such a manner as to appear a friend to you, worthy of notice; and I know he never thought of what he himself should suffer, but of what he should do to please you. He is dead, therefore,' said she, 'without reproach, and I, who urged him on, sit here alive.' Cyrus, shedding tears for some time in silence, then spoke:\u2014'He has died, woman, the noblest death; for he has died victorious! Do you adorn him with these things that I furnish you with.' (Gobryas and Gadatas were then come up, and had brought rich ornaments in great abundance with them.) 'Then,' said he, 'be assured that he shall not want respect and honor in all other things; but, over and above, multitudes shall concur in raising him a monument that shall be worthy of us, and all the sacrifices shall be made him that are proper to be made in honor of a brave man. You shall not be left destitute, but, for the sake of your modesty and every other virtue, I will pay you all other honors, as well as place those about you who will conduct you wherever you please. Do you but make it known to me where it is that you desire to be conveyed to.' And Panthea replied: 'Be confident, Cyrus, I will not conceal from you to whom it is that I desire to go.'\n\n\u201cHe, having said this, went away with great pity for her that she should have lost such a husband, and for the man that he should have left such a wife behind him, never to see her more. Panthea then gave orders for her servants to retire, 'till such time,' said she, 'as I shall have lamented my husband as I please.' Her nurse she bid to stay, and gave orders that, when she was dead, she would wrap her and her husband up in one mantle together. The nurse, after having repeatedly begged her not to do this, and meeting with no success, but observing her to grow angry, sat herself down, breaking out into tears. She, being beforehand provided with a sword, killed herself, and, laying her head down on her husband's breast, she died. The nurse set up a lamentable cry, and covered them both, as Panthea had directed.\n\n\u201cCyrus, as soon as he was informed of what the woman had done, being struck with it, went to help her if he could. The servants, three in number, seeing what had been done, drew their swords and killed themselves, as they stood at the place where she bad ordered them. And the monument is now said to have been raised by continuing the mound on to the servants; and on a pillar above, they say, the names of the man and woman were written in Syriac letters.\n\n\u201cBelow were three pillars, and they were inscribed thus, 'Of the servants.' Cyrus, when he came to this melancholy scene, was struck with admiration of the woman, and, having lamented over her, went away. He took care, as was proper, that all the funeral rites should be paid them in the noblest manner, and the monument, they say, was raised up to a very great size.\u201d\n\nThese be the ancients, who, so many assert, had no idea of the dignity of Woman, or of marriage. Such love Xenophon could paint as subsisting between those who after death \u201cwould see one another never more.\u201d Thousands of years have passed since, and with the reception of the Cross, the nations assume the belief that those who part thus may meet again and forever, if spiritually fitted to one another, as Abradatus and Panthea were, and yet do we see such marriages among them? If at all, how often?\n\nI must quote two more short passages from Xenophon, for he is a writer who pleases me well.\n\nCyrus, receiving the Armenians whom he had conquered\u2014\n\n\u201c'Tigranes,' said he, 'at what rate would you purchase the regaining of your wife?' Now Tigranes happened to be but lately married, and had a very great love for his wife.\u201d (That clause perhaps sounds modern.)\n\n\u201c'Cyrus,' said he, 'I would ransom her at the expense of my life.'\n\n\u201c'Take then your own to yourself,' said he. ...\n\n\u201cWhen they came home, one talked of Cyrus' wisdom, another of his patience and resolution, another of his mildness. One spoke of his beauty and smallness of his person, and, on that, Tigranes asked his wife, 'And do you, Armenian dame, think Cyrus handsome?' 'Truly,' said she, 'I did not look at him.' 'At whom, then, did you look?' said Tigranes. 'At him who said that, to save me from servitude, he would ransom me at the expense of his own life.'\u201c\n\nFrom the Banquet.\u2014\n\n\u201cSocrates, who observed her with pleasure, said, 'This young girl has confirmed me in the opinion I have had, for a long time, that the female sex are nothing inferior to ours, excepting only in strength of body, or, perhaps, his steadiness of judgment.'\u201c\n\nIn the Economics, the manner in which the husband gives counsel to his young wife presents the model of politeness and refinement. Xenophon is thoroughly the gentleman; gentle in breeding and in soul. All the men he describes are so, while the shades of manner are distinctly marked. There is the serene dignity of Socrates, with gleams of playfulness thrown across its cool, religious shades, the princely mildness of Cyrus, and the more domestic elegance of the husband in the Economics.\n\nThere is no way that men sin more against refinement, as well as discretion, than in their conduct toward their wives. Let them look at the men of Xenophon. Such would know how to give counsel, for they would know how to receive it. They would feel that the most intimate relations claimed most, not least, of refined courtesy. They would not suppose that confidence justified carelessness, nor the reality of affection want of delicacy in the expression of it.\n\nSuch men would be too wise to hide their affairs from the wife, and then expect her to act as if she knew them. They would know that, if she is expected to face calamity with courage, she must be instructed and trusted in prosperity, or, if they had failed in wise confidence, such as the husband shows in the Economics, they would be ashamed of anger or querulous surprise at the results that naturally follow.\n\nSuch men would not be exposed to the bad influence of bad wives; for all wives, bad or good, loved or unloved, inevitably influence their husbands, from the power their position not merely gives, but necessitates, of coloring evidence and infusing feelings in hours when the\u2014patient, shall I call him?\u2014is off his guard. Those who understand the wife's mind, and think it worth while to respect her springs of action, know bettor where they are. But to the bad or thoughtless man, who lives carelessly and irreverently so near another mind, the wrong he does daily back upon himself recoils. A Cyrus, an Abradatus, knows where he stands.\n\nBut to return to the thread of my subject.\n\nAnother sign of the times is furnished by the triumphs of Female Authorship. These have been great, and are constantly increasing. Women have taken possession of so many provinces for which men had pronounced them unfit, that, though these still declare there are some inaccessible to them, it is difficult to say just where they must stop.\n\nThe shining names of famous women have cast light upon the path of the sex, and many obstructions have been removed. When a Montague could learn better than her brother, and use her lore afterwards to such purpose as an observer, it seemed amiss to hinder women from preparing themselves to see, or from seeing all they could, when prepared. Since Somerville has achieved so much, will any young girl be prevented from seeking a knowledge of the physical sciences, if she wishes it? De Stael's name was not so clear of offence; she could not forget the Woman in the thought; while she was instructing you as a mind, she wished to be admired as a Woman; sentimental tears often dimmed the eagle glance. Her intellect, too, with all its splendor, trained in a drawing-room, fed on flattery, was tainted and flawed; yet its beams make the obscurest school-house in New England warmer and lighter to the little rugged girls who are gathered together on its wooden bench. They may never through life hear her name, but she is not the less their benefactress.\n\nThe influence has been such, that the aim certainly is, now, in arranging school instruction for girls, to give them as fair a field as boys. As yet, indeed, these arrangements are made with little judgment or reflection; just as the tutors of Lady Jane Grey, and other distinguished women of her time, taught them Latin and Greek, because they knew nothing else themselves, so now the improvement in the education of girls is to be made by giving them young men as teachers, who only teach what has been taught themselves at college, while methods and topics need revision for these new subjects, which could better be made by those who had experienced the same wants. Women are, often, at the head of these institutions; but they have, as yet, seldom been thinking women, capable of organizing a new whole for the wants of the time, and choosing persons to officiate in the departments. And when some portion of instruction of a good sort is got from the school, the far greater proportion which is infused from the general atmosphere of society contradicts its purport. Yet books and a little elementary instruction are not furnished in vain. Women are better aware how great and rich the universe is, not so easily blinded by narrowness or partial views of a home circle. \u201cHer mother did so before her\u201d is no longer a sufficient excuse. Indeed, it was never received as an excuse to mitigate the severity of censure, but was adduced as a reason, rather, why there should be no effort made for reformation.\n\nWhether much or little has been done, or will be done,\u2014whether women will add to the talent of narration the power of systematizing,\u2014whether they will carve marble, as well as draw and paint,\u2014is not important. But that it should be acknowledged that they have intellect which needs developing\u2014that they should not be considered complete, if beings of affection and habit alone\u2014is important.\n\nYet even this acknowledgment, rather conquered by Woman than proffered by Man, has been sullied by the usual selfishness. Too much is said of women being better educated, that they may become better companions and mothers for men. They should be fit for such companionship, and we have mentioned, with satisfaction, instances where it has been established. Earth knows no fairer, holier relation than that of a mother. It is one which, rightly understood, must both promote and require the highest attainments. But a being of infinite scope must not be treated with an exclusive view to any one relation. Give the soul free course, let the organization, both of body and mind, be freely developed, and the being will be fit for any and every relation to which it may be called. The intellect, no more than the sense of hearing, is to be cultivated merely that Woman may be a more valuable companion to Man, but because the Power who gave a power, by its mere existence signifies that it must be brought out toward perfection.\n\nIn this regard of self-dependence, and a greater simplicity and fulness of being, we must hail as a preliminary the increase of the class contemptuously designated as \u201cold maids.\u201d\n\nWe cannot wonder at the aversion with which old bachelors and old maids have been regarded. Marriage is the natural means of forming a sphere, of taking root in the earth; it requires more strength to do this without such an opening; very many have failed, and their imperfections have been in every one's way. They have been more partial, more harsh, more officious and impertinent, than those compelled by severer friction to render themselves endurable. Those who have a more full experience of the instincts have a distrust as to whether the unmarried can be thoroughly human and humane, such as is hinted in the saying, \u201cOld-maids' and bachelors' children are well cared for,\u201d which derides at once their ignorance and their presumption.\n\nYet the business of society has become so complex, that it could now scarcely be carried on without the presence of these despised auxiliaries; and detachments from the army of aunts and uncles are wanted to stop gaps in every hedge. They rove about, mental and moral Ishmaelites, pitching their tents amid the fixed and ornamented homes of men.\n\nIn a striking variety of forms, genius of late, both at home and abroad, has paid its tribute to the character of the Aunt and the Uncle, recognizing in these personages the spiritual parents, who have supplied defects in the treatment of the busy or careless actual parents.\n\nThey also gain a wider, if not so deep experience. Those who are not intimately and permanently linked with others, are thrown upon themselves; and, if they do not there find peace and incessant life, there is none to flatter them that they are not very poor, and very mean.\n\nA position which so constantly admonishes, may be of inestimable benefit. The person may gain, undistracted by other relationships, a closer communion with the one. Such a use is made of it by saints and sibyls. Or she may be one of the lay sisters of charity, a canoness, bound by an inward vow,\u2014or the useful drudge of all men, the Martha, much sought, little prized,\u2014or the intellectual interpreter of the varied life she sees; the Urania of a half-formed world's twilight.\n\nOr she may combine all these. Not needing to care that she may please a husband, a frail and limited being, her thoughts may turn to the centre, and she may, by steadfast contemplation entering into the secret of truth and love, use it for the good of all men, instead of a chosen few, and interpret through it all the forms of life. It is possible, perhaps, to be at once a priestly servant and a loving muse.\n\nSaints and geniuses have often chosen a lonely position, in the faith that if, undisturbed by the pressure of near ties, they would give themselves up to the inspiring spirit, it would enable them to understand and reproduce life better than actual experience could.\n\nHow many \u201cold maids\u201d take this high stand we cannot say: it is an unhappy fact that too many who have come before the eye are gossips rather, and not always good-natured gossips. But if these abuse, and none make the best of their vocation, yet it has not failed to produce some good results. It has been seen by others, if not by themselves, that beings, likely to be left alone, need to be fortified and furnished within themselves; and education and thought have tended more and more to regard these beings as related to absolute Being, as well as to others. It has been seen that, as the breaking of no bond ought to destroy a man, so ought the missing of none to hinder him from growing. And thus a circumstance of the time, which springs rather from its luxury than its purity, has helped to place women on the true platform.\n\nPerhaps the next generation, looking deeper into this matter, will find that contempt is put upon old maids, or old women, at all, merely because they do not use the elixir which would keep them always young. Under its influence, a gem brightens yearly which is only seen to more advantage through the fissures Time makes in the casket. [Footnote: Appendix F.] No one thinks of Michael Angelo's Persican Sibyl, or St. Theresa, or Tasso's Leonora, or the Greek Electra, as an old maid, more than of Michael Angelo or Canova as old bachelors, though all had reached the period in life's course appointed to take that degree.\n\nSee a common woman at forty; scarcely has she the remains of beauty, of any soft poetic grace which gave her attraction as Woman, which kindled the hearts of those who looked on her to sparkling thoughts, or diffused round her a roseate air of gentle love. See her, who was, indeed, a lovely girl, in the coarse, full-blown dahlia flower of what is commonly matron-beauty, \u201cfat, fair, and forty,\u201d showily dressed, and with manners as broad and full as her frill or satin cloak. People observe, \u201cHow well she is preserved!\u201d \u201cShe is a fine woman still,\u201d they say. This woman, whether as a duchess in diamonds, or one of our city dames in mosaics, charms the poet's heart no more, and would look much out of place kneeling before the Madonna. She \u201cdoes well the honors of her house,\u201d\u2014\u201dleads society,\u201d\u2014is, in short, always spoken and thought of upholstery-wise.\n\nOr see that care-worn face, from which every soft line is blotted,\u2014those faded eyes, from which lonely tears have driven the flashes of fancy, the mild white beam of a tender enthusiasm. This woman is not so ornamental to a tea-party; yet she would please better, in picture. Yet surely she, no more than the other, looks as a human being should at the end of forty years. Forty years! have they bound those brows with no garland? shed in the lamp no drop of ambrosial oil?\n\nNot so looked the Iphigenia in Aulis. Her forty years had seen her in anguish, in sacrifice, in utter loneliness. But those pains were borne for her father and her country; the sacrifice she had made pure for herself and those around her. Wandering alone at night in the vestal solitude of her imprisoning grove, she has looked up through its \u201cliving summits\u201d to the stars, which shed down into her aspect their own lofty melody. At forty she would not misbecome the marble.\n\nNot so looks the Persica. She is withered; she is faded; the drapery that enfolds her has in its dignity an angularity, too, that tells of age, of sorrow, of a stern resignation to the must. But her eye, that torch of the soul, is untamed, and, in the intensity of her reading, we see a soul invincibly young in faith and hope. Her age is her charm, for it is the night of the past that gives this beacon-fire leave to shine. Wither more and more, black Chrysalid! thou dost but give the winged beauty time to mature its splendors!\n\nNot so looked Victoria Colonna, after her life of a great hope, and of true conjugal fidelity. She had been, not merely a bride, but a wife, and each hour had helped to plume the noble bird. A coronet of pearls will not shame her brow; it is white and ample, a worthy altar for love and thought.\n\nEven among the North American Indians, a race of men as completely engaged in mere instinctive life as almost any in the world, and where each chief, keeping many wives as useful servants, of course looks with no kind eye on celibacy in Woman, it was excused in the following instance mentioned by Mrs. Jameson. A woman dreamt in youth that she was betrothed to the Sun. She built her a wigwam apart, filled it with emblems of her alliance, and means of on independent life. There she passed her days, sustained by her own exertions, and true to her supposed engagement.\n\nIn any tribe, we believe, a woman, who lived as if she was betrothed to the Sun, would be tolerated, and the rays which made her youth blossom sweetly, would crown her with a halo in age.\n\nThere is, on this subject, a nobler view than heretofore, if not the noblest, and improvement here must coincide with that in the view taken of marriage. \u201cWe must have units before we can have union,\u201d says one of the ripe thinkers of the times.\n\nIf larger intellectual resources begin to be deemed needful to Woman, still more is a spiritual dignity in her, or even the mere assumption of it, looked upon with respect. Joanna Southcote and Mother Anne Lee are sure of a band of disciples; Ecstatica, Dolorosa, of enraptured believers who will visit them in their lowly huts, and wait for days to revere them in their trances. The foreign noble traverses land and sea to hear a few words from the lips of the lowly peasant girl, whom he believes especially visited by the Most High. Very beautiful, in this way, was the influence of the invalid of St. Petersburg, as described by De Maistre.\n\nMysticism, which may be defined as the brooding soul of the world, cannot fail of its oracular promise as to Woman. \u201cThe mothers,\u201d \u201cThe mother of all things,\u201d are expressions of thought which lead the mind towards this side of universal growth. Whenever a mystical whisper was heard, from Behmen down to St. Simon, sprang up the thought, that, if it be true, as the legend says, that Humanity withers through a fault committed by and a curse laid upon Woman, through her pure child, or influence, shall the new Adam, the redemption, arise. Innocence is to be replaced by virtue, dependence by a willing submission, in the heart of the Virgin-Mother of the new race.\n\nThe spiritual tendency is toward the elevation of Woman, but the intellectual by itself is not so. Plato sometimes seems penetrated by that high idea of love, which considers Man and Woman as the two-fold expression of one thought. This the angel of Swedenborg, the angel of the coming age, cannot surpass, but only explain more fully. But then again Plato, the man of intellect, treats Woman in the Republic as property, and, in the Tim\u00e6us, says that Man, if he misuse the privileges of one life, shall be degraded into the form of Woman; and then, if ho do not redeem himself, into that of a bird. This, as I said above, expresses most happily how antipoetical is this state of mind. For the poet, contemplating the world of things, selects various birds as the symbols of his most gracious and ethereal thoughts, just as he calls upon his genius as muse rather than as God. But the intellect, cold, is ever more masculine than feminine; warmed by emotion, it rushes toward mother-earth, and puts on the forms of beauty.\n\nThe electrical, the magnetic element in Woman has not been fairly brought out at any period. Everything might be expected from it; she has far more of it than Man. This is commonly expressed by saying that her intuitions are more rapid and more correct. You will often see men of high intellect absolutely stupid in regard to the atmospheric changes, the fine invisible links which connect the forms of life around them, while common women, if pure and modest, so that a vulgar self do not overshadow the mental eye, will seize and delineate these with unerring discrimination.\n\nWomen who combine this organization with creative genius are very commonly unhappy at present. They see too much to act in conformity with those around them, and their quick impulses seem folly to those who do not discern the motives. This is an usual effect of the apparition of genius, whether in Man or Woman, but is more frequent with regard to the latter, because a harmony, an obvious order and self-restraining decorum, is most expected from her.\n\nThen women of genius, even more than men, are likely to be enslaved by an impassioned sensibility. The world repels them more rudely, and they are of weaker bodily frame.\n\nThose who seem overladen with electricity frighten those around them. \u201cWhen she merely enters the room, I am what the French call heriss\u00e9,\u201d said a man of petty feelings and worldly character of such a woman, whose depth of eye and powerful motion announced the conductor of the mysterious fluid.\n\nWoe to such a woman who finds herself linked to such a man in bonds too close! It is the crudest of errors. He will detest her with all the bitterness of wounded self-love. He will take the whole prejudice of manhood upon himself, and, to the utmost of his power, imprison and torture her by its imperious rigors.\n\nYet, allow room enough, and the electric fluid will be found to invigorate and embellish, not destroy life. Such women are the great actresses, the songsters. Such traits we read in a late searching, though too French, analysis of the character of Mademoiselle Rachel, by a modern, La Rochefeucault. The Greeks thus represent the muses; they have not the golden serenity of Apollo; they are overflowed with thought; there is something tragic in their air. Such are the Sibyls of Gueroino; the eye is overfull of expression, dilated and lustrous; it seems to have drawn the whole being into it.\n\nSickness is the frequent result of this overcharged existence. To this region, however misunderstood, or interpreted with presumptuous carelessness, belong the phenomena of magnetism, or mesmerism, as it is now often called, where the trance of the Ecstatica purports to be produced by the agency of one human being on another, instead of, as in her case, direct from the spirit.\n\nThe worldling has his sneer at this as at the services of religion. \u201cThe churches can always be filled with women\u201d\u2014\u201dShow me a man in one of your magnetic states, and I will believe.\u201d\n\nWomen are, indeed, the easy victims both of priestcraft and self-delusion; but this would not be, if the intellect was developed in proportion to the other powers. They would then have a regulator, and be more in equipoise, yet must retain the same nervous susceptibility while their physical structure is such as it is.\n\nIt is with just that hope that we welcome everything that tends to strengthen the fibre and develop the nature on more sides. When the intellect and affections are in harmony; when intellectual consciousness is calm and deep; inspiration will not be confounded with fancy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, \u201cshe who advances\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With rapturous, lyrical glances,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Singing the song of the earth, singing\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Its hymn to the Gods,\u201d\n\nwill not be pitied as a mad-woman, nor shrunk from as unnatural.\n\nThe Greeks, who saw everything in forms, which we are trying to ascertain as law, and classify as cause, embodied all this in the form of Cassandra. Cassandra was only unfortunate in receiving her gift too soon. The remarks, however, that the world still makes in such cases, are well expressed by the Greek dramatist.\n\nIn the Trojan dames there are fine touches of nature with regard to Cassandra. Hecuba shows that mixture of shame and reverence that prosaic kindred always do toward the inspired child, the poet, the elected sufferer for the race.\n\nWhen the herald announces that Cassandra is chosen to be the mistress of Agamemnon, Hecuba answers, with indignation, betraying the pride and faith she involuntarily felt in this daughter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHec. The maiden of Phoebus, to whom the golden-haired\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gave as a privilege a virgin life!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tal. Love of the inspired maiden hath pierced him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hec. Then cast away, my child, the sacred keys, and from thy person\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consecrated garlands which thou wearest.\u201d\n\nYet, when, a moment after, Cassandra appears, singing, wildly, her inspired song, Hecuba calls her, \u201cMy frantic child.\u201d\n\nYet how graceful she is in her tragic raptus, the chorus shows.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cChorus. How sweetly at thy house's ills thou smil'st,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chanting what, haply, thou wilt not show true.\u201d\n\nIf Hecuba dares not trust her highest instinct about her daughter, still less can the vulgar mind of the herald Talthybius, a man not without feeling, but with no princely, no poetic blood, abide the wild, prophetic mood which insults all his prejudices.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTal. The venerable, and that accounted wise,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is nothing better than that of no repute;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the greatest king of all the Greeks,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dear son of Atreus, a possessed with the love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of this mad-Woman. I, indeed, am poor;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet I would not receive her to my bed.\u201d\n\nThe royal Agamemnon could see the beauty of Cassandra; he was not afraid of her prophetic gifts.\n\nThe best topic for a chapter on this subject, in the present day, would be the history of the Seeress of Prevorst, the best observed subject of magnetism in our present times, and who, like her ancestresses of Delphos, was roused to ecstasy or phrensy by the touch of the laurel.\n\nI observe in her case, and in one known to me here, that what might have been a gradual and gentle disclosure of remarkable powers was broken and jarred into disease by an unsuitable marriage. Both these persons were unfortunate in not understanding what was involved in this relation, but acted ignorantly, as their friends desired. They thought that this was the inevitable destiny of Woman. But when engaged in the false position, it was impossible for them to endure its dissonances, as those of less delicate perceptions can; and the fine flow of life was checked and sullied. They grew sick; but, even so, learned and disclosed more than those in health are won't to do.\n\nIn such cases, worldlings sneer; but reverent men learn wondrous news, either from the person observed, or by thoughts caused in themselves by the observation. Fenelon learns from Guyon, Kerner from his Seeress, what we fain would know. But to appreciate such disclosures one must be a child; and here the phrase, \u201cwomen and children,\u201d may, perhaps, be interpreted aright, that only little children shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n\nAll these motions of the time, tides that betoken a waxing moon, overflow upon our land. The world at large is readier to let Woman learn and manifest the capacities of her nature than it ever was before, and here is a less encumbered field and freer air than anywhere else. And it ought to be so; we ought to pay for Isabella's jewels.\n\nThe names of nations are feminine\u2014Religion, Virtue and Victory are feminine. To those who have a superstition, as to outward reigns, it is not without significance that the name of the queen of our motherland should at this crisis be Victoria,\u2014Victoria the First. Perhaps to us it may be given to disclose the era thus outwardly presaged.\n\nAnother Isabella too at this time ascends the throne. Might she open a new world to her sex! But, probably, these poor little women are, least of any, educated to serve as examples or inspirers for the rest. The Spanish queen is younger; we know of her that she sprained her foot the other day, dancing in her private apartments; of Victoria, that she reads aloud, in a distinct voice and agreeable manner, her addresses to Parliament on certain solemn days, and, yearly, that she presents to the nation some new prop of royalty. These ladies have, very likely, been trained more completely to the puppet life than any other. The queens, who have been queens indeed, were trained by adverse circumstances to know the world around them and their own powers.\n\nIt is moving, while amusing, to read of the Scottish peasant measuring the print left by the queen's foot as she walks, and priding himself on its beauty. It is so natural to wish to find what is fair and precious in high places,\u2014so astonishing to find the Bourbon a glutton, or the Guelph a dullard or gossip.\n\nIn our own country, women are, in many respects, better situated than men. Good books are allowed, with more time to read them. They are not so early forced into the bustle of life, nor so weighed down by demands for outward success. The perpetual changes, incident to our society, make the blood circulate freely through the body politic, and, if not favorable at present to the grace and bloom of life, they are so to activity, resource, and would be to reflection, but for a low materialist tendency, from which the women are generally exempt in themselves, though its existence, among the men, has a tendency to repress their impulses and make them doubt their instincts, thus often paralyzing their action during the best years.\n\nBut they have time to think, and no traditions chain them, and few conventionalities, compared with what must be met in other nations. There is no reason why they should not discover that the secrets of nature are open, the revelations of the spirit waiting, for whoever will seek them. When the mind is once awakened to this consciousness, it will not be restrained by the habits of the past, but fly to seek the seeds of a heavenly future.\n\nTheir employments are more favorable to meditation than those of men.\n\nWoman is not addressed religiously here more than elsewhere. She is told that she should be worthy to be the mother of a Washington, or the companion of some good man.' But in many, many instances, she has already learned that all bribes have the same flaw; that truth and good are to be sought solely for their own sakes. And, already, an ideal sweetness floats over many forms, shines in many eyes.\n\nAlready deep questions are put by young girls on the great theme: What shall I do to enter upon the eternal life?\n\nMen are very courteous to them. They praise them often, check them seldom. There is chivalry in the feeling toward \u201cthe ladies,\u201d which gives them the best seats in the stage-coach, frequent admission, not only to lectures of all sorts, but to courts of justice, halls of legislature, reform conventions. The newspaper editor \u201cwould be better pleased that the Lady's Book should be filled up exclusively by ladies. It would then, indeed, be a true gem, worthy, to be presented by young men to the, mistress of their affections.\u201d Can gallantry go further?\n\nIn this country is venerated, wherever seen, the character which Goethe spoke of as an Ideal, which he saw actualized in his friend and patroness, the Grand Duchess Amelia: \u201cThe excellent woman is she, who, if the husband dies, can be a father to the children.\u201d And this, if read aright, tells a great deal.\n\nWomen who speak in public, if they have a moral power, such as has been felt from Angelina Grimke and Abby Kelly,\u2014that is, if they speak for conscience' sake, to serve a cause which they hold sacred,\u2014invariably subdue the prejudices of their hearers, and excite an interest proportionate to the aversion with which it had been the purpose to regard them.\n\nA passage in a private letter so happily illustrates this, that it must be inserted here.\n\nAbby Kelly in the Town-House of \u2014\u2014.\n\n\u201cThe scene was not unheroic\u2014to see that woman, true to humanity and her own nature, a centre of rude eyes and tongues, even gentlemen feeling licensed to make part of a species of mob around a female out of her sphere. As she took her seat in the desk amid the great noise, and in the throng, full, like a wave, of something to ensue, I saw her humanity in a gentleness and unpretension, tenderly open to the sphere around her, and, had she not been supported by the power of the will of genuineness and principle, she would have failed. It led her to prayer, which, in Woman especially, is childlike; sensibility and will going to the side of God and looking up to him; and humanity was poured out in aspiration.\n\n\u201cShe acted like a gentle hero, with her mild decision and womanly calmness. All heroism is mild, and quiet, and gentle, for it is life and possession; and combativeness and firmness show a want of actualness. She is as earnest, fresh and simple, as when she first entered the crusade. I think she did much good, more than the men in her place could do, for Woman feels more as being and reproducing\u2014this brings the subject more into home relations. Men speak through, and mostly from intellect, and this addresses itself to that in others which is combative.\u201d\n\nNot easily shall we find elsewhere, or before this time, any written observations on the same subject, so delicate and profound.\n\nThe late Dr. Channing, whose enlarged and tender and religious nature shared every onward impulse of his tune, though his thoughts followed his wishes with a deliberative caution which belonged to his habits and temperament, was greatly interested in these expectations for women. His own treatment of them was absolutely and thoroughly religious. He regarded them as souls, each of which had a destiny of its own, incalculable to other minds, and whose leading it must follow, guided by the light of a private conscience. He had sentiment, delicacy, kindness, taste; but they were all pervaded and ruled by this one thought, that all beings had souls, and must vindicate their own inheritance. Thus all beings were treated by him with an equal, and sweet, though solemn, courtesy. The young and unknown, the woman and the child, all felt themselves regarded with an infinite expectation, from which there was no reaction to vulgar prejudice. He demanded of all he met, to use his favorite phrase, \u201cgreat truths.\u201d\n\nHis memory, every way dear and reverend, is, by many, especially cherished for this intercourse of unbroken respect.\n\nAt one time, when the progress of Harriet Martineau through this country, Angelina Grimke's appearance in public, and the visit of Mrs. Jameson, had turned his thoughts to this subject, he expressed high hopes as to what the coming era would bring to Woman. He had been much pleased with the dignified courage of Mrs. Jameson in taking up the defence of her sex in from which women usually shrink, because, if they express themselves on such subjects with sufficient force and clearness to do any good, they are exposed to assaults whose vulgarity makes them painful. In intercourse with such a woman, he had shared her indignation at the base injustice, in many respects, and in many regions, done to the sex; and been led to think of it far more than ever before. He seemed to think that he might some time write upon the subject. That his aid is withdrawn from the cause is a subject of great regret; for, on this question as on others, he would have known how to sum up the evidence, and take, in the noblest spirit, middle ground. He always furnished a platform on which opposing parties could stand and look at one another under the influence of his mildness and enlightened candor.\n\nTwo younger thinkers, men both, have uttered noble prophecies, auspicious for Woman. Kinmont, all whose thoughts tended towards the establishment of the reign of love and peace, thought that the inevitable means of this would be an increased predominance given to the idea of Woman. Had he lived longer, to see the growth of the Peace Party, the reforms in life and medical practice which seek to substitute water for wine and drugs, pulse for animal food, he would have been confirmed in his view of the way in which the desired changes are to be effected.\n\nIn this connection I must mention Shelley, who, like all men of genius, shared the feminine development, and, unlike many, knew it. His life was one of the first pulse-beats in the present reform-growth. He, too, abhorred blood and heat, and, by his system and his song, tended to reinstate a plant-like gentleness in the development of energy. In harmony with this, his ideas of marriage were lofty, and, of course, no less so of Woman, her nature, and destiny.\n\nFor Woman, if, by a sympathy as to outward condition, she is led to aid the enfranchisement of the slave, must be no less so, by inward tendency, to favor measures which promise to bring the world more thoroughly and deeply into harmony with her nature. When the lamb takes place of the lion as the emblem of nations, both women and men will be as children of one spirit, perpetual learners of the word and doers thereof, not hearers only.\n\nA writer in the New York Pathfinder, in two articles headed \u201cFemality,\u201d has uttered a still more pregnant word than any we have named. He views Woman truly from the soul, and not from society, and the depth and leading of his thoughts are proportionably remarkable. He views the feminine nature as a harmonizer of the vehement elements, and this has often been hinted elsewhere; but what he expresses most forcibly is the lyrical, the inspiring and inspired apprehensiveness of her being.\n\nThis view being identical with what I have before attempted to indicate, as to her superior susceptibility to magnetic or electric influence, I will now try to express myself more fully.\n\nThere are two aspects of Woman's nature, represented by the ancients as Muse and Minerva. It is the former to which the writer in the Pathfinder looks. It is the latter which Wordsworth has in mind, when he says,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith a placid brow,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which woman ne'er should forfeit, keep thy vow.\u201d\n\nThe especial genius of Woman I believe to be electrical in movement, intuitive in function, spiritual in tendency. She excels not so easily in classification, or recreation, as in an instinctive seizure of causes, and a simple breathing out of what she receives, that has the singleness of life, rather than the selecting and energizing of art.\n\nMore native is it to her to be the living model of the artist than to set apart from herself any one form in objective reality; more native to inspire and receive the poem, than to create it. In so far as soul is in her completely developed, all soul is the same, but in so far as it is modified in her as Woman, it flows, it breathes, it sings, rather than deposits soil, or finishes work; and that which is especially feminine flushes, in blossom, the face of earth, and pervades, like air and water, all this seeming solid globe, daily renewing and purifying its life. Such may be the especially feminine element spoken of as Femality. But it is no more the order of nature that it should be incarnated pure in any form, than that the masculine energy should exist unmingled with it in any form.\n\nMale and female represent the two sides of the great radical dualism. But, in fact, they are perpetually passing into one another. Fluid hardens to solid, solid rushes to fluid. There is no wholly masculine man, no purely feminine woman.\n\nHistory jeers at the attempts of physiologists to bind great original laws by the forms which flow from them. They make a rule; they say from observation what can and cannot be. In vain! Nature provides exceptions to every rule. She sends women to battle, and sets Hercules spinning; she enables women to bear immense burdens, cold, and frost; she enables the man, who feels maternal love, to nourish his infant like a mother. Of late she plays still gayer pranks. Not only she deprives organizations, but organs, of a necessary end. She enables people to read with the top of the head, and see with the pit of the stomach. Presently she will make a female Newton, and a male Syren.\n\nMan partakes of the feminine in the Apollo, Woman of the masculine as Minerva.\n\nWhat I mean by the Muse is that unimpeded clearness of the intuitive powers, which a perfectly truthful adherence to every admonition of the higher instincts would bring to a finely organized human being. It may appear as prophecy or as poesy. It enabled Cassandra to foresee the results of actions passing round her; the Seeress to behold the true character of the person through the mask of his customary life. (Sometimes she saw a feminine form behind the man, sometimes the reverse.) It enabled the daughter of Linn\u00e6us to see the soul of the flower exhaling from the flower. [Footnote: The daughter of Linnaeus states, that, while looking steadfastly at the red lily, she saw its spirit hovering above it, as a red flame. It is true, this, like many fair spirit-stories, may be explained away as an optical illusion, but its poetic beauty and meaning would, even then, make it valuable, as an illustration of the spiritual fact.] It gave a man, but a poet-man, the power of which he thus speaks: \u201cOften in my contemplation of nature, radiant intimations, and as it were sheaves of light, appear before me as to the facts of cosmogony, in which my mind has, perhaps, taken especial part.\u201d He wisely adds, \u201cbut it is necessary with earnestness to verify the knowledge we gain by these flashes of light.\u201d And none should forget this. Sight must be verified by light before it can deserve the honors of piety and genius. Yet sight comes first, and of this sight of the world of causes, this approximation to the region of primitive motions, women I hold to be especially capable. Even without equal freedom with the other sex, they have already shown themselves so; and should these faculties have free play, I believe they will open new, deeper and purer sources of joyous inspiration than have as yet refreshed the earth.\n\nLet us be wise, and not impede the soul. Let her work as she will. Let us have one creative energy, one incessant revelation. Let it take what form it will, and let us not bind it by the past to man or woman, black or white. Jove sprang from Rhea, Pallas from Jove. So let it be.\n\nIf it has been the tendency of these remarks to call Woman rather to the Minerva side,\u2014if I, unlike the more generous writer, have spoken from society no less than the soul,\u2014let it be pardoned! It is love that has caused this,\u2014love for many incarcerated souls, that might be freed, could the idea of religious self-dependence be established in them, could the weakening habit of dependence on others be broken up.\n\nProclus teaches that every life has, in its sphere, a totality or wholeness of the animating powers of the other spheres; having only, as its own characteristic, a predominance of some one power. Thus Jupiter comprises, within himself, the other twelve powers, which stand thus: The first triad is demiurgic or fabricative, that is, Jupiter, Neptune, Vulcan; the second, defensive, Vesta, Minerva, Mars; the third, vivific, Ceres, Juno, Diana; and the fourth, Mercury, Venus, Apollo, elevating and harmonic. In the sphere of Jupiter, energy is predominant\u2014with Venus, beauty; but each comprehends and apprehends all the others.\n\nWhen the same community of life and consciousness of mind begin among men, humanity will have, positively and finally, subjugated its brute elements and Titanic childhood; criticism will have perished; arbitrary limits and ignorant censure be impossible; all will have entered upon the liberty of law, and the harmony of common growth.\n\nThen Apollo will sing to his lyre what Vulcan forges on the anvil, and the Muse weave anew the tapestries of Minerva.\n\nIt is, therefore, only in the present crisis that the preference is given to Minerva. The power of continence must establish the legitimacy of freedom, the power of self-poise the perfection of motion.\n\nEvery relation, every gradation of nature is incalculably precious, but only to the soul which is poised upon itself, and to whom no loss, no change, can bring dull discord, for it is in harmony with the central soul.\n\nIf any individual live too much in relations, so that he becomes a stranger to the resources of his own nature, he falls, after a while, into a distraction, or imbecility, from which he can only be cured by a time of isolation, which gives the renovating fountains time to rise up. With a society it is the same. Many minds, deprived of the traditionary or instinctive means of passing a cheerful existence, must find help in self-impulse, or perish. It is therefore that, while any elevation, in the view of union, is to be hailed with joy, we shall not decline celibacy as the great fact of the time. It is one from which no vow, no arrangement, can at present save a thinking mind. For now the rowers are pausing on their oars; they wait a change before they can pull together. All tends to illustrate the thought of a wise cotemporary. Union is only possible to those who are units. To be fit for relations in time, souls, whether of Man or Woman, must be able to do without them in the spirit.\n\nIt is therefore that I would have Woman lay aside all thought, such as she habitually cherishes, of being taught and led by men. I would have her, like the Indian girl, dedicate herself to the Sun, the Sun of Truth, and go nowhere if his beams did not make clear the path. I would have her free from compromise, from complaisance, from helplessness, because I would have her good enough and strong enough to love one and all beings, from the fulness, not the poverty of being.\n\nMen, as at present instructed, will not help this work, because they also are under the slavery of habit. I have seen with delight their poetic impulses. A sister is the fairest ideal, and how nobly Wordsworth, and even Byron, have written of a sister!\n\nThere is no sweeter sight than to see a father with his little daughter. Very vulgar men become refined to the eye when leading a little girl by the hand. At that moment, the right relation between the sexes seems established, and you feel as if the man would aid in the noblest purpose, if you ask him in behalf of his little daughter. Once, two fine figures stood before me, thus. The father of very intellectual aspect, his falcon eye softened by affection as he looked down on his fair child; she the image of himself, only more graceful and brilliant in expression. I was reminded of Southey's Kehama; when, lo, the dream was rudely broken! They were talking of education, and he said,\n\n\u201cI shall not have Maria brought too forward. If she knows too much, she will never find a husband; superior women hardly ever can.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely,\u201d said his wife, with a blush, \u201cyou wish Maria to be as good and wise as she can, whether it will help her to marriage or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he persisted, \u201cI want her to have a sphere and a home, and some one to protect her when I am gone.\u201d\n\nIt was a trifling incident, but made a deep impression. I felt that the holiest relations fail to instruct the unprepared and perverted mind. If this man, indeed, could have looked at it on the other side, he was the last that would have been willing to have been taken himself for the home and protection he could give, but would have been much more likely to repeat the tale of Alcibiades with his phials.\n\nBut men do not look at both sides, and women must leave off asking them and being influenced by them, but retire within themselves, and explore the ground-work of life till they find their peculiar secret. Then, when they come forth again, renovated and baptized, they will know how to turn all dross to gold, and will be rich and free though they live in a hut, tranquil if in a crowd. Then their sweet singing shall not be from passionate impulse, but the lyrical overflow of a divine rapture, and a new music shall be evolved from this many-chorded world.\n\nGrant her, then, for a while, the armor and the javelin. Let her put from her the press of other minds, and meditate in virgin loneliness. The same idea shall reappear in due time as Muse, or Ceres, the all-kindly, patient Earth-Spirit.\n\nAmong the throng of symptoms which denote the present tendency to a crisis in the life of Woman,\u2014which resembles the change from girlhood, with its beautiful instincts, but unharmonized thoughts, its blind pupilage and restless seeking, to self-possessed, wise and graceful womanhood,\u2014I have attempted to select a few.\n\nOne of prominent interest is the unison upon the subject of three male minds, which, for width of culture, power of self-concentration and dignity of aim, take rank as the prophets of the coming age, while their histories and labors are rooted in the past.\n\nSwedenborg came, he tells us, to interpret the past revelation and unfold a new. He announces the New Church that is to prepare the way for the New Jerusalem, a city built of precious stones, hardened and purified by secret processes in the veins of earth through the ages.\n\nSwedenborg approximated to that harmony between the scientific and poetic lives of mind, which we hope from the perfected man. The links that bind together the realms of nature, the mysteries that accompany her births and growths, were unusually plain to him. He seems a man to whom insight was given at a period when the mental frame was sufficiently matured to retain and express its gifts.\n\nHis views of Woman are, in the main, satisfactory. In some details we my object to them, as, in all his system, there are still remains of what is arbitrary and seemingly groundless\u2014fancies that show the marks of old habits, and a nature as yet not thoroughly leavened with the spiritual leaven. At least, so it seems to me now. I speak reverently, for I find such reason to venerate Swedenborg, from an imperfect knowledge of his mind, that I feel one more perfect might explain to me much that does not now secure my sympathy.\n\nHis idea of Woman is sufficiently large and noble to interpose no obstacle to her progress. His idea of marriage is consequently sufficient. Man and Woman share an angelic ministry; the union is of one with one, permanent and pure.\n\nAs the New Church extends its ranks, the needs of Woman must be more considered.\n\nQuakerism also establishes Woman on a sufficient equality with Man. But, though the original thought of Quakerism is pure, its scope is too narrow, and its influence, having established a certain amount of good and made clear some truth, must, by degrees, be merged in one of wider range. [Footnote: In worship at stated periods, in daily expression, whether by word or deed, the Quakers have placed Woman on the same platform with Man. Can any one assert that they have reason to repent this?] The mind of Swedenborg appeals to the various nature of Man, and allows room for aesthetic culture and the free expression of energy.\n\nAs apostle of the new order, of the social fabric that is to rise from love, and supersede the old that was based on strife, Charles Fourier comes next, expressing, in an outward order, many facts of which Swedenborg saw the secret springs. The mind of Fourier, though grand and clear, was, in some respects, superficial. He was a stranger to the highest experiences. His eye was fixed on the outward more than the inward needs of Man. Yet he, too, was a seer of the divine order, in its musical expression, if not in its poetic soul. He has filled one department of instruction for the new era, and the harmony in action, and freedom for individual growth, he hopes, shall exist; and, if the methods he proposes should not prove the true ones, yet his fair propositions shall give many hints, and make room for the inspiration needed for such.\n\nHe, too, places Woman on an entire equality with Man, and wishes to give to one as to the other that independence which must result from intellectual and practical development.\n\nThose who will consult him for no other reason, might do so to see how the energies of Woman may be made available in the pecuniary way. The object of Fourier was to give her the needed means of self-help, that she might dignify and unfold her life for her own happiness, and that of society. The many, now, who see their daughters liable to destitution, or vice to escape from it, may be interested to examine the means, if they have not yet soul enough to appreciate the ends he proposes.\n\nOn the opposite side of the advancing army leads the great apostle of individual culture, Goethe. Swedenborg makes organization and union the necessary results of solitary thought. Fourier, whose nature was, above all, constructive, looked to them too exclusively. Better institutions, he thought, will make better men. Goethe expressed, in every way, the other side. If one man could present better forms, the rest could not use them till ripe for them.\n\nFourier says, As the institutions, so the men! All follies are excusable and natural under bad institutions.\n\nGoethe thinks, As the man, so the institutions! There is no excuse for ignorance and folly. A man can grow in any place, if he will.\n\nAy! but, Goethe, bad institutions are prison-walls and impure air, that make him stupid, so that he does not will.\n\nAnd thou, Fourier, do not expect to change mankind at once, or even \u201cin three generations,\u201d by arrangement of groups and series, or flourish of trumpets for attractive industry. If these attempts are made by unready men, they will fail.\n\nYet we prize the theory of Fourier no less than the profound suggestion of Goethe. Both are educating the age to a clearer consciousness of what Man needs, what Man can be; and better life must ensue.\n\nGoethe, proceeding on his own track, elevating the human being, in the most imperfect states of society, by continual efforts at self-culture, takes as good care of women as of men. His mother, the bold, gay Frau Aja, with such playful freedom of nature; the wise and gentle maiden, known in his youth, over whose sickly solitude \u201cthe Holy Ghost brooded as a dove;\u201d his sister, the intellectual woman par excellence; the Duchess Amelia; Lili, who combined the character of the woman of the world with the lyrical sweetness of the shepherdess, on whose chaste and noble breast flowers and gems were equally at home; all these had supplied abundant suggestions to his mind, as to the wants and the possible excellences of Woman. And from his poetic soul grew up forms new and more admirable than life has yet produced, for whom his clear eye marked out paths in the future.\n\nIn Faust Margaret represents the redeeming power, which, at present, upholds Woman, while waiting for a better day. The lovely little girl, pure in instinct, ignorant in mind, is misled and profaned by man abusing her confidence.[Footnote: As Faust says, her only fault was a \u201ckindly delusion,\u201d\u2014\u201dein guter wahn.\u201d] To the Mater Dolorosa she appeals for aid. It is given to the soul, if not against outward sorrow; and the maiden, enlightened by her sufferings, refusing to receive temporal salvation by the aid of an evil power, obtains the eternal in its stead.\n\nIn the second part, the intellectual man, after all his manifold strivings, owes to the interposition of her whom he had betrayed his salvation. She intercedes, this time, herself a glorified spirit, with the Mater Gloriosa.\n\nLeonora, too, is Woman, as we see her now, pure, thoughtful, refined by much acquaintance with grief.\n\nIphigenia he speaks of in his journals as his \u201cdaughter,\u201d and she is the daughter [Footnote: Goethe was as false to his ideas, in practice, as Lord Herbert. And his punishment was the just and usual one of connections formed beneath the standard of right, from the impulses of the baser self. Iphigenia was the worthy daughter of his mind; but the son, child of his degrading connection in actual life, corresponded with that connection. This son, on whom Goethe vainly lavished so much thought and care, was like his mother, and like Goethe's attachment for his mother. \u201cThis young man,\u201d says a late well-informed writer (M. Henri Blaze), \u201cWieland, with good reason, called the son of the servant, der Sohn der Magd. He inherited from his father only his name and his physique.\u201d] whom a man will wish, even if he has chosen his wife from very mean motives. She is the virgin, steadfast, soul, to whom falsehood is more dreadful than any other death.\n\nBut it is to Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and Wandering Years that I would especially refer, as these volumes contain the sum of the Sage's observations during a long life, as to what Man should do, under present circumstances, to obtain mastery over outward, through an initiation into inward life, and severe discipline of faculty.\n\nAs Wilhelm advances into the upward path, he becomes acquainted with better forms of Woman, by knowing how to seek, and how to prize them when found. For the weak and immature man will, often, admire a superior woman, but he will not be able to abide by a feeling which is too severe a tax on his habitual existence. But, with Wilhelm, the gradation is natural, and expresses ascent in the scale of being. At first, he finds charm in Mariana and Philina, very common forms of feminine character, not without redeeming traits, no less than charms, but without wisdom or purity. Soon he is attended by Mignon, the finest expression ever yet given to what I have called the lyrical element in Woman. She is a child, but too full-grown for this man; he loves, but cannot follow her; yet is the association not without an enduring influence. Poesy has been domesticated in his life; and, though he strives to bind down her heavenward impulse, as art or apothegm, these are only the tents, beneath which he may sojourn for a while, but which may be easily struck, and carried on limitless wanderings.\n\nAdvancing into the region of thought, he encounters a wise philanthropy in Natalia (instructed, let us observe, by an uncle); practical judgment and the outward economy of life in Theresa; pure devotion in the Fair Saint.\n\nFurther, and last, he comes to the house of Macaria, the soul of a star; that is, a pure and perfected intelligence embodied in feminine form, and the centre of a world whose members revolve harmoniously around her. She instructs him in the archives of a rich human history, and introduces him to the contemplation of the heavens.\n\nFrom the hours passed by the side of Mariana to these with Macaria, is a wide distance for human feet to traverse. Nor has Wilhelm travelled so far, seen and suffered so much, in vain, He now begins to study how he may aid the next generation; he sees objects in harmonious arrangement, and from his observations deduces precepts by which to guide his course as a teacher and a master, \u201chelp-full, comfort-full.\u201d\n\nIn all these expressions of Woman, the aim of Goethe is satisfactory to me. He aims at a pure self-subsistence, and a free development of any powers with which they may be gifted by nature as much for them as for men. They are units, addressed as souls. Accordingly, the meeting between Man and Woman, as represented by him, is equal and noble; and, if he does not depict marriage, he makes it possible.\n\nIn the Macaria, bound with the heavenly bodies in fixed revolutions, the centre of all relations, herself unrelated, he expresses the Minerva side of feminine nature. It was not by chance that Goethe gave her this name. Macaria, the daughter of Hercules, who offered herself as a victim for the good of her country, was canonized by the Greeks, and worshipped as the Goddess of true Felicity. Goethe has embodied this Felicity as the Serenity that arises from Wisdom, a Wisdom such as the Jewish wise man venerated, alike instructed in the designs of heaven, and the methods necessary to carry them into effect upon earth.\n\nMignon is the electrical, inspired, lyrical nature. And wherever it appears we echo in our aspirations that of the child,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo let me seem until I be:\u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take not the white robe away.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * * * *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThough I lived without care and toil,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet felt I sharp pain enough to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make me again forever young.\u201d\n\nAll these women, though we see them in relations, we can think of as unrelated. They all are very individual, yet seem nowhere restrained. They satisfy for the present, yet arouse an infinite expectation.\n\nThe economist Theresa, the benevolent Natalia, the fair Saint, have chosen a path, but their thoughts are not narrowed to it. The functions of life to them are not ends, but suggestions.\n\nThus, to them, all things are important, because none is necessary. Their different characters have fair play, and each is beautiful in its minute indications, for nothing is enforced or conventional; but everything, however slight, grows from the essential life of the being.\n\nMignon and Theresa wear male attire when they like, and it is graceful for them to do so, while Macaria is confined to her arm-chair behind the green curtain, and the Fair Saint could not bear a speck of dust on her robe.\n\nAll things are in their places in this little world, because all is natural and free, just as \u201cthere is room for everything out of doors.\u201d Yet all is rounded in by natural harmony, which will always arise where Truth and Love are sought in the light of Freedom.\n\nGoethe's book bodes an era of freedom like its own of \u201cextraordinary, generous seeking,\u201d and new revelations. New individualities shall be developed in the actual world, which shall advance upon it as gently as the figures come out upon his canvas.\n\nI have indicated on this point the coincidence between his hopes and those of Fourier, though his are directed by an infinitely higher and deeper knowledge of human nature. But, for our present purpose, it is sufficient to show how surely these different paths have conducted to the same end two earnest thinkers. In some other place I wish to point out similar coincidences between Goethe's model school and the plans of Fourier, which may cast light upon the page of prophecy.\n\nMany women have observed that the time drew nigh for a better care of the sex, and have thrown out hints that may be useful. Among these may be mentioned\u2014\n\nMiss Edgeworth, who, although restrained by the habits of her age and country, and belonging more to the eighteenth than the nineteenth century, has done excellently as far as she goes. She had a horror of sentimentalism, and of the love of notoriety, and saw how likely women, in the early stages of culture, were to aim at these. Therefore she bent her efforts to recommending domestic life. But the methods she recommends are such as will fit a character for any position to which it may be called. She taught a contempt of falsehood, no less in its most graceful, than in its meanest apparitions; the cultivation of a clear, independent judgment, and adherence to its dictates; habits of various and liberal study and employment, and a capacity for friendship. Her standard of character is the same for both sexes,\u2014Truth, honor, enlightened benevolence, and aspiration after knowledge. Of poetry, she knows nothing, and her religion consists in honor and loyalty to obligations once assumed\u2014in short, in \u201cthe great idea of duty which holds us upright.\u201d Her whole tendency is practical.\n\nMrs. Jameson is a sentimentalist, and, therefore, suits us ill in some respects, but she is full of talent, has a just and refined perception of the beautiful, and a genuine courage when she finds it necessary. She does not appear to have thought out, thoroughly, the subject on which we are engaged, and her opinions, expressed as opinions, are sometimes inconsistent with one another. But from the refined perception of character, admirable suggestions are given in her \u201cWomen of Shakspeare,\u201d and \u201cLoves of the Poets.\u201d\n\nBut that for which I most respect her is the decision with which she speaks on a subject which refined women are usually afraid to approach, for fear of the insult and scurrile jest they may encounter; but on which she neither can nor will restrain the indignation of a full heart. I refer to the degradation of a large portion of women into the sold and polluted slaves of men, and the daring with which the legislator and man of the world lifts his head beneath the heavens, and says, \u201cThis must be; it cannot be helped; it is a necessary accompaniment of civilization.\u201d\n\nSo speaks the citizen. Man born of Woman, the father of daughters, declares that he will and must buy the comforts and commercial advantages of his London, Vienna, Paris, New York, by conniving at the moral death, the damnation, so far as the action of society can insure it, of thousands of women for each splendid metropolis.\n\nO men! I speak not to you. It is true that your wickedness (for you must not deny that at least nine thousand out of the ten fall through the vanity you have systematically flattered, or the promises you have treacherously broken); yes, it is true that your wickedness is its own punishment. Your forms degraded and your eyes clouded by secret sin; natural harmony broken and fineness of perception destroyed in your mental and bodily organization; God and love shut out from your hearts by the foul visitants you have permitted there; incapable of pure marriage; incapable of pure parentage; incapable of worship; O wretched men, your sin is its own punishment! You have lost the world in losing yourselves. Who ruins another has admitted the worm to the root of his own tree, and the fuller ye fill the cup of evil, the deeper must be your own bitter draught. But I speak not to you\u2014you need to teach and warn one another. And more than one voice rises in earnestness. And all that women say to the heart that has once chosen the evil path is considered prudery, or ignorance, or perhaps a feebleness of nature which exempts from similar temptations.\n\nBut to you, women, American women, a few words may not be addressed in vain. One here and there may listen.\n\nYou know how it was in the Oriental clime, One man, if wealth permitted, had several wives and many handmaidens. The chastity and equality of genuine marriage, with \u201cthe thousand decencies that flow\u201d from its communion, the precious virtues that gradually may be matured within its enclosure, were unknown.\n\nBut this man did not wrong according to his light. What he did, he might publish to God and Man; it was not a wicked secret that hid in vile lurking-places and dens, like the banquets of beasts of prey. Those women were not lost, not polluted in their own eyes, nor those of others. If they were not in a state of knowledge and virtue, they were at least in one of comparative innocence.\n\nYou know how it was with the natives of this continent. A chief had many wives, whom he maintained and who did his household work; those women were but servants, still they enjoyed the respect of others and their own. They lived together, in peace. They knew that a sin against what was in their nation esteemed virtue, would be as strictly punished in Man as in Woman.\n\nNow pass to the countries where marriage is between one and one. I will not speak of the Pagan nations, but come to those which own the Christian rule. We all know what that enjoins; there is a standard to appeal to.\n\nSee, now, not the mass of the people, for we all know that it is a proverb and a bitter jest to speak of the \u201cdown-trodden million.\u201d We know that, down to our own time, a principle never had so fair a chance to pervade the mass of the people, but that we must solicit its illustration from select examples.\n\nTake the Paladin, take the Poet. Did they believe purity more impossible to Man than to Woman? Did they wish Woman to believe that Man was less amenable to higher motives,\u2014that pure aspirations would not guard him against bad passions,\u2014that honorable employments and temperate habits would not keep him free from slavery to the body? O no! Love was to them a part of heaven, and they could not even wish to receive its happiness, unless assured of being worthy of it. Its highest happiness to them was that it made them wish to be worthy. They courted probation. They wished not the title of knight till the banner had been upheld in the heats of battle, amid the rout of cowards.\n\nI ask of you, young girls\u2014I do not mean you whose heart is that of an old coxcomb, though your looks have not yet lost their sunny tinge. Not of you whose whole character is tainted with vanity, inherited or taught, who have early learned the love of coquettish excitement, and whose eyes rove restlessly in search of a \u201cconquest\u201d or a \u201cbeau;\u201d you who are ashamed not to be seen by others the mark of the most contemptuous flattery or injurious desire. To such I do not speak. But to thee, maiden, who, if not so fair, art yet of that unpolluted nature which Milton saw when he dreamed of Comus and the Paradise. Thou, child of an unprofaned wedlock, brought up amid the teachings of the woods and fields, kept fancy-free by useful employment and a free flight into the heaven of thought, loving to please only those whom thou wouldst not be ashamed to love; I ask of thee, whose cheek has not forgotten its blush nor thy heart its lark-like hopes, if he whom thou mayest hope the Father will send thee, as the companion of life's toils and joys, is not to thy thought pure? Is not manliness to thy thought purity, not lawlessness? Can his lips speak falsely? Can he do, in secret, what he could not avow to the mother that bore him? O say, dost thou not look for a heart free, open as thine own, all whose thoughts may be avowed, incapable of wronging the innocent, or still further degrading the fallen\u2014a man, in short, in whom brute nature is entirely subject to the impulses of his better self?\n\nYes! it was thus that thou didst hope; for I have many, many times seen the image of a future life, of a destined spouse, painted on the tablets of a virgin heart.\n\nIt might be that she was not true to these hopes. She was taken into what is called \u201cthe world,\u201d froth and scum as it mostly is on the social caldron. There, she saw fair Woman carried in the waltz close to the heart of a being who appeared to her a Satyr. Being warned by a male friend that he was in fact of that class, and not fit for such familiar nearness to a chaste being, the advised replied that \u201cwomen should know nothing about such things.\u201d She saw one fairer given in wedlock to a man of the same class. \u201cPapa and mamma said that 'all men were faulty at some time in their lives; they had a great many temptations.' Frederick would be so happy at home; he would not want to do wrong.\u201d She turned to the married women; they, O tenfold horror! laughed at her supposing \u201cmen were like women.\u201d Sometimes, I say, she was not true, and either sadly accommodated herself to \u201cWoman's lot,\u201d or acquired a taste for satyr-society, like some of the Nymphs, and all the Bacchanals of old. But to those who could not and would not accept a mess of pottage, or a Circe cup, in lieu of their birthright, and to these others who have yet their choice to make, I say, Courage! I have some words of cheer for you. A man, himself of unbroken purity, reported to me the words of a foreign artist, that \u201cthe world would never be better till men subjected themselves to the same laws they had imposed on women;\u201d that artist, he added, was true to the thought. The same was true of Canova, the same of Beethoven. \u201cLike each other demi-god, they kept themselves free from stain;\u201d and Michael Angelo, looking over here from the loneliness of his century, might meet some eyes that need not shun his glance.\n\nIn private life, I am assured by men who are not so sustained and occupied by the worship of pure beauty, that a similar consecration is possible, is practised; that many men feel that no temptation can be too strong for the will of man, if he invokes the aid of the Spirit instead of seeking extenuation from the brute alliances of his nature. In short, what the child fancies is really true, though almost the whole world declares it a lie. Man is a child of God; and if he seeks His guidance to keep the heart with diligence, it will be so given that all the issues of life may be pure. Life will then be a temple.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The temple round\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spread green the pleasant ground;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fair colonnade\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be of pure marble pillars made;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strong to sustain the roof,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Time and tempest proof;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet, amidst which, the lightest breeze\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can play as it please;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The audience hall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be free to all\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who revere\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The power worshipped here,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sole guide of youth,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unswerving Truth.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the inmost shrine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stands the image divine,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only seen\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By those whose deeds have worthy been\u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Priestlike clean.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those, who initiated are,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Declare,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the hours\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Usher in varying hopes and powers;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It changes its face,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It changes its age,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now a young, beaming grace,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now Nestorian sage;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, to the pure in heart,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This shape of primal art\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In age is fair,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In youth seems wise,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beyond compare,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Above surprise;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What it teaches native seems,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Its new lore our ancient dreams;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incense rises from the ground;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Music flows around;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Firm rest the feet below, clear gaze the eyes above,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Truth, to point the way through life, assumes the wand of Love;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, if she cast aside the robe of green,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Winter's silver sheen,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0White, pure as light,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Makes gentle shroud as worthy weed as bridal robe had been.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Footnote: As described by the historians:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe temple of Juno is like what the character of Woman should be.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Columns! graceful decorums, attractive yet sheltering.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Porch! noble, inviting aspect of the life.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaos! receives the worshippers.

From polygamy, Europe passed to the marriage de convenance. This was scarcely an improvement An attempt was then made to substitute genuine marriage (the mutual choice of souls inducing a permanent union), as yet baffled on every side by the haste, the ignorance, or the impurity of Man.\n\nWhere Man assumes a high principle to which he is not yet ripened, it will happen, for a long time, that the few will be nobler than before; the many, worse. Thus now. In the country of Sidney and Milton, the metropolis is a den of wickedness, and a sty of sensuality; in the country of Lady Russell, the custom of English peeresses, of selling their daughters to the highest bidder, is made the theme and jest of fashionable novels by unthinking children who would stare at the idea of sending them to a Turkish slave-dealer, though the circumstances of the bargain are there less degrading, as the will and thoughts of the person sold are not so degraded by it, and it is not done in defiance of an acknowledged law of right in the land and the age.\n\nI must here add that I do not believe there ever was put upon record more depravation of Man, and more despicable frivolity of thought and aim in Woman; than in the novels which purport to give the picture of English fashionable life, which are read with such favor in our drawing-rooms, and give the tone to the manners of some circles. Compared with the cold, hard-hearted folly there described, crime is hopeful; for it, at least, shows some power remaining in the mental constitution.\n\nTo return:\u2014Attention has been awakened among men to the stains of celibacy, and the profanations of marriage. They begin to write about it and lecture about it. It is the tendency now to endeavor to help the erring by showing them the physical law. This is wise and excellent; but forget not the better half. Cold bathing and exercise will not suffice to keep a life pure, without an inward baptism, and noble, exhilarating employment for the thoughts and the passions. Early marriages are desirable, but if (and the world is now so out of joint that there are a hundred thousand chances to one against it) a man does not early, or at all, find the person to whom he can be united in the marriage of souls, will you give him in the marriage de convenance? or, if not married, can you find no way for him to lead a virtuous and happy life? Think of it well, ye who think yourselves better than pagans, for many of them knew this sure way. [Footnote: The Persian sacred books, the Desatir, describe the great and holy prince Ky Khosrou, as being \u201can angel, and the son of an angel,\u201d one to whom the Supreme says, \u201cThou art not absent from before me for one twinkling of an eye. I am never out of thy heart. And I am contained in nothing but in thy heart, and in a heart like thy heart. And I am nearer unto thee than thou art to thyself.\u201d This prince had in his Golden Seraglio three ladies of surpassing beauty, and all four, in this royal monastery, passed their lives, and left the world as virgins.\n\nThe Persian people had no scepticism when the history of such a mind was narrated.]\n\nTo you, women of America, it is more especially my business to address myself on this subject, and my advice may be classed under three heads:\n\nClear your souls from the taint of vanity.\n\nDo not rejoice in conquests, either that your power to allure may be seen by other women, or for the pleasure of rousing passionate feelings that gratify your love of excitement.\n\nIt must happen, no doubt, that frank and generous women will excite love they do not reciprocate, but, in nine cases out of ten, the woman has, half consciously, done much to excite. In this case, she shall not be held guiltless, either as to the unhappiness or injury of the lover. Pure love, inspired by a worthy object, must ennoble and bless, whether mutual or not; but that which is excited by coquettish attraction of any grade of refinement, must cause bitterness and doubt, as to the reality of human goodness, so soon as the flush of passion is over. And, that you may avoid all taste for these false pleasures,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSteep the soul\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In one pure love, and it will lost thee long.\u201d\n\nThe love of truth, the love of excellence, whether you clothe them in the person of a special object or not, will have power to save you from following Duessa, and lead you in the green glades where Una's feet have trod.\n\nIt was on this one subject that a venerable champion of good, the last representative of the spirit which sanctified the Revolution, and gave our country such a sunlight of hope in the eyes of the nations, the same who lately, in Boston, offered anew to the young men the pledge taken by the young men of his day, offered, also, his counsel, on being addressed by the principal of a girl's school, thus:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPLY OF MR. ADAMS.\n\nMr. Adams was so deeply affected by the address of Miss Foster, as to be for some time inaudible. When heard, he spoke as follows:\n\n\u201cThis is the first instance in which a lady has thus addressed me personally; and I trust that all the ladies present will be able sufficiently to enter into my feelings to know that I am more affected by this honor than by any other I could hare received,\n\n\u201cYou have been pleased, madam, to allude to the character of my father, and the history of my family, and their services to the country. It is indeed true that, from the existence of the republic as an independent nation, my father and myself have been in the public service of the country, almost without interruption. I came into the world, as a person having personal responsibilities, with the Declaration of Independence, which constituted us a nation. I was a child at that time, and had then perhaps the greatest of blessings that can be bestowed on man\u2014a mother who was anxious and capable to form her children to be what they ought to be. From that mother I derived whatever instruction\u2014religious especially and moral\u2014has pervaded a long life; I will not say perfectly, and as it ought to be; but I will say, because it is justice only to the memory of her whom I revere, that if, in the course of my life, there has been any imperfection, or deviation from what she taught me, the fault is mine, and not hers.\n\n\u201cWith such a mother, and such other relations with the sex, of sister, wife, and daughter, it has been the perpetual instruction of my life to love and revere the female sex. And in order to carry that sentiment of love and reverence to its highest degree of perfection, I know of nothing that exists in human society better adapted to produce that result, than institutions of the character that I have now the honor to address.\n\n\u201cI have been taught, as I have said, through the course of my life, to love and to revere the female sex; but I have been taught, also\u2014and that lesson has perhaps impressed itself on my mind even more strongly, it may be, than the other\u2014I have been taught not to flatter them. It is not unusual, in the intercourse of Man with the other sex\u2014and especially for young men\u2014to think that the way to win the hearts of ladies is by flattery. To love and to revere the sex, is what I think the duty of Man; but not to flatter them; and this I would say to the young ladies here\u2014and if they, and others present, will allow me, with all the authority which nearly four score years may have with those who have not yet attained one score\u2014I would say to them what I have no doubt they say to themselves, and are taught here, not to take the flattery of men as proof of perfection.\n\n\u201cI am now, however, I fear, assuming too much of a character that does not exactly belong to me. I therefore conclude, by assuring you, madam, that your reception of me has affected me, as you perceive, more than I can express in words; and that I shall offer my best prayers, till my latest hour, to the Creator of us all, that this institution especially, and all others of a similar kind, designed to form the female mind to wisdom and virtue, may prosper to the end of time.\u201d\n\nIt will be interesting to add here the character of Mr. Adams' mother, as drawn by her husband, the first John Adams, in a family letter [Footnote: Journal and Correspondence of Miss Adams, vol. i., p. 246.] written just before his death.\n\n\u201cI have reserved for the last the life of Lady Russell. This I have not yet read, because I read it more than forty years ago. On this hangs a tale which you ought to know and communicate it to your children. I bought the Life and Letters of Lady Russell in the year 1775, and sent it to your grandmother, with an express intent and desire that she should consider it a mirror in which to contemplate herself; for, at that time, I thought it extremely probable, from the daring and dangerous career I was determined to run, that she would one day find herself in the situation of Lady Russell, her husband without a head. This lady was more beautiful than Lady Russell, had a brighter genius, more information, a more refined taste, and, at least, her equal in the virtues of the heart; equal fortitude and firmness of character, equal resignation to the will of Heaven, equal in all the virtues and graces of the Christian life. Like Lady Russell, she never, by word or look, discouraged me from running all hazards for the salvation of my country's liberties; she was willing to share with me, and that her children should share with us both, in all the dangerous consequences we had to hazard.\u201d\n\nWill a woman who loves flattery or an aimless excitement, who wastes the flower of her mind on transitory sentiments, ever be loved with a love like that, when fifty years' trial have entitled to the privileges of \u201cthe golden marriage?\u201d\n\nSuch was the love of the iron-handed warrior for her, not his hand-maid, but his help-meet:\n\n\u201cWhom God loves, to him gives he such a wife.\u201d\n\nI find the whole of what I want in this relation, in the two epithets by which Milton makes Adam address his wife.\n\nIn the intercourse of every day he begins:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDaughter of God and man, accomplished Eve.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Footnote: See Appendix H.]\nIn a moment of stronger feeling,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDaughter of God and man, IMMORTAL Eve.\u201d\n\nWhat majesty in the cadence of the line; what dignity, what reverence in the attitude both of giver and receiver!\n\nThe woman who permits, in her life, the alloy of vanity; the woman who lives upon flattery, coarse or fine, shall never be thus addressed, She is not immortal so far as her will is concerned, and every woman who does so creates miasma, whose spread is indefinite. The hand which casts into the waters of life a stone of offence knows not how far the circles thus caused may spread their agitations.\n\nA little while since I was at one of the most fashionable places of public resort. I saw there many women, dressed without regard to the season or the demands of the place, in apery, or, as it looked, in mockery, of European fashions. I saw their eyes restlessly courting attention. I saw the way in which it was paid; the style of devotion, almost an open sneer, which it pleased those ladies to receive from men whose expression marked their own low position in the moral and intellectual world. Those women went to their pillows with their heads full of folly, their hearts of jealousy, or gratified vanity; those men, with the low opinion they already entertained of Woman confirmed. These were American ladies; that is, they were of that class who have wealth and leisure to make full use of the day, and confer benefits on others. They were of that class whom the possession of external advantages makes of pernicious example to many, if these advantages be misused.\n\nSoon after, I met a circle of women, stamped by society as among the most degraded of their sex. \u201cHow,\u201d it was asked of them, \u201cdid you come here?\u201d for by the society that I saw in the former place they were shut up in a prison. The causes were not difficult to trace: love of dress, love of flattery, love of excitement. They had not dresses like the other ladies, so they stole them; they could not pay for flattery by distinctions, and the dower of a worldly marriage, so they paid by the profanation of their persons. In excitement, more and more madly sought from day to day, they drowned the voice of conscience.\n\nNow I ask you, my sisters, if the women at the fashionable house be not answerable for those women being in the prison?\n\nAs to position in the world of souls, we may suppose the women of the prison stood fairest, both because they had misused less light, and because loneliness and sorrow had brought some of them to feel the need of better life, nearer truth and good. This was no merit in them, being an effect of circumstance, but it was hopeful. But you, my friends (and some of you I have already met), consecrate yourselves without waiting for reproof, in free love and unbroken energy, to win and to diffuse a better life. Offer beauty, talents, riches, on the altar; thus shall you keep spotless your own hearts, and be visibly or invisibly the angels to others.\n\nI would urge upon those women who have not yet considered this subject, to do so. Do not forget the unfortunates who dare not cross your guarded way. If it do not suit you to act with those who have organized measures of reform, then hold not yourself excused from acting in private. Seek out these degraded women, give them tender sympathy, counsel, employment. Take the place of mothers, such as might have saved them originally.\n\nIf you can do little for those already under the ban of the world,\u2014and the best-considered efforts have often failed, from a want of strength in those unhappy ones to bear up against the sting of shame and the prejudices of the world, which makes them seek oblivion again in their old excitements,\u2014you will at least leave a sense of love and justice in their hearts, that will prevent their becoming utterly embittered and corrupt. And you may learn the means of prevention for those yet uninjured. These will be found in a diffusion of mental culture, simple tastes, best taught by your example, a genuine self-respect, and, above all, what the influence of Man tends to hide from Woman, the love and fear of a divine, in preference to a human tribunal.\n\nBut suppose you save many who would have lost their bodily innocence (for as to mental, the loss of that is incalculably more general), through mere vanity and folly; there still remain many, the prey and spoil of the brute passions of Man; for the stories frequent in our newspapers outshame antiquity, and vie with the horrors of war.\n\nAs to this, it must be considered that, as the vanity and proneness to seduction of the imprisoned women represented a general degradation in their sex; so do these acts a still more general and worse in the male. Where so many are weak, it is natural there should be many lost; where legislators admit that ten thousand prostitutes are a fair proportion to one city, and husbands tell their wives that it is folly to expect chastity from men, it is inevitable that there should be many monsters of vice.\n\nI must in this place mention, with respect and gratitude, the conduct of Mrs. Child in the case of Amelia Norman. The action and speech of this lady was of straightforward nobleness, undeterred by custom or cavil from duty toward an injured sister. She showed the case and the arguments the counsel against the prisoner had the assurance to use in their true light to the public. She put the case on the only ground of religion and equity. She was successful in arresting the attention of many who had before shrugged their shoulders, and let sin pass as necessarily a part of the company of men. They begin to ask whether virtue is not possible, perhaps necessary, to Man as well as to Woman. They begin to fear that the perdition of a woman must involve that of a man. This is a crisis. The results of this case will be important.\n\nIn this connection I must mention Eugene Sue, the French novelist, several of whose works have been lately translated among us, as having the true spirit of reform as to women. Like every other French writer, he is still tainted with the transmissions of the old regime. Still, falsehood may be permitted for the sake of advancing truth, evil as the way to good. Even George Sand, who would trample on every graceful decorum, and every human law, for the sake of a sincere life, does not see that she violates it by making her heroines able to tell falsehoods in a good cause. These French writers need ever to be confronted by the clear perception of the English and German mind, that the only good man, consequently the only good reformer, is he\n\n\u201cWho bases good on good alone, and owes\nTo virtue every triumph that he knows.\u201d\n\nStill, Sue has the heart of a reformer, and especially towards women; he sees what they need, and what causes are injuring them. From the histories of Fleur de Marie and La Louve, from the lovely and independent character of Rigolette, from the distortion given to Matilda's mind, by the present views of marriage, and from the truly noble and immortal character of the \u201chump-backed Sempstress\u201d in the \u201cWandering Jew,\u201d may be gathered much that shall elucidate doubt and direct inquiry on this subject. In reform, as in philosophy, the French are the interpreters to the civilized world. Their own attainments are not great, but they make clear the post, and break down barriers to the future.\n\nObserve that the good man of Sue is as pure as Sir Charles Grandison.\n\nApropos to Sir Charles. Women are accustomed to be told by men that the reform is to come from them. \u201cYou,\u201d say the men, \u201cmust frown upon vice; you must decline the attentions of the corrupt; you must not submit to the will of your husband when it seems to you unworthy, but give the laws in marriage, and redeem it from its present sensual and mental pollutions.\u201d\n\nThis seems to us hard. Men have, indeed, been, for more than a hundred years, rating women for countenancing vice. But, at the same time, they have carefully hid from them its nature, so that the preference often shown by women for bad men arises rather from a confused idea that they are bold and adventurous, acquainted with regions which women are forbidden to explore, and the curiosity that ensues, than a corrupt heart in the woman. As to marriage, it has been inculcated on women, for centuries, that men have not only stronger passions than they, but of a sort that it would be shameful for them to share or even understand; that, therefore, they must \u201cconfide in their husbands,\u201d that is, submit implicitly to their will; that the least appearance of coldness or withdrawal, from whatever cause, in the wife is wicked, because liable to turn her husband's thoughts to illicit indulgence; for a man is so constituted that he must indulge his passions or die!\n\nAccordingly, a great part of women look upon men as a kind of wild beasts, but \u201csuppose they are all alike;\u201d the unmarried are assured by the married that, \u201cif they knew men as they do,\u201d that is, by being married to them, \u201cthey would not expect continence or self-government from them.\u201d\n\nI might accumulate illustrations on this theme, drawn from acquaintance with the histories of women, which would startle and grieve all thinking men, but I forbear. Let Sir Charles Grandison preach to his own sex; or if none there be who feels himself able to speak with authority from a life unspotted in will or deed, let those who are convinced of the practicability and need of a pure life, as the foreign artist was, advise the others, and warn them by their own example, if need be.\n\nThe following passage, from a female writer, on female affairs, expresses a prevalent way of thinking on this subject:\n\n\u201cIt may be that a young woman, exempt from all motives of vanity, determines to take for a husband a man who does not inspire her with a very decided inclination. Imperious circumstances, the evident interest of her family, or the danger of suffering celibacy, may explain such a resolution. If, however, she were to endeavor to surmount a personal repugnance, we should look upon this as injudicious. Such a rebellion of nature marks the limit that the influence of parents, or the self-sacrifice of the young girl, should never pass. We shall be told that this repugnance is an affair of the imagination. It may be so; but imagination is a power which it is temerity to brave; and its antipathy is more difficult to conquer than its preference.\u201d [Footnote: Madame Necker de Saussure.]\n\nAmong ourselves, the exhibition of such a repugnance from a woman who had been given in marriage \u201cby advice of friends,\u201d was treated by an eminent physician as sufficient proof of insanity. If he had said sufficient cause for it, he would have been nearer right.\n\nIt has been suggested by men who were pained by seeing bad men admitted, freely, to the society of modest women,\u2014thereby encouraged to vice by impunity, and corrupting the atmosphere of homes,\u2014that there should be a senate of the matrons in each city and town, who should decide what candidates were fit for admission to their houses and the society of their daughters. [Footnote: See Goethe's Tasso. \u201cA synod of good women should decide,\u201d\u2014if the golden age is to be restored.]\n\nSuch a plan might have excellent results; but it argues a moral dignity and decision which does not yet exist, and needs to be induced by knowledge and reflection. It has been the tone to keep women ignorant on these subjects, or, when they were not, to command that they should seem so. \u201cIt is indelicate,\u201d says the father or husband, \u201cto inquire into the private character of such an one. It is sufficient that I do not think him unfit to visit you.\u201d And so, this man, who would not tolerate these pages in his house, \u201cunfit for family reading,\u201d because they speak plainly, introduces there a man whose shame is written on his brow, as well as the open secret of the whole town, and, presently, if respectable still, and rich enough, gives him his daughter to wife. The mother affects ignorance, \u201csupposing he is no worse than most men.\u201d The daughter is ignorant; something in the mind of the new spouse seems strange to her, but she supposes it is \u201cwoman's lot\u201d not to be perfectly happy in her affections; she has always heard, \u201cmen could not understand women,\u201d so she weeps alone, or takes to dress and the duties of the house. The husband, of course, makes no avowal, and dreams of no redemption.\n\n\u201cIn the heart of every young woman,\u201d says the female writer above quoted, addressing herself to the husband, \u201cdepend upon it, there is a fund of exalted ideas; she conceals, represses, without succeeding in smothering them. So long as these ideas in your wife are directed to YOU, they are, no doubt, innocent, but take care that they be not accompanied with too much pain. In other respects, also, spare her delicacy. Let all the antecedent parts of your life, if there are such, which would give her pain, be concealed from her; her happiness and her respect for you would suffer from this misplaced confidence. Allow her to retain that flower of purity, which should distinguish her, in your eyes, from every other woman.\u201d We should think so, truly, under this canon. Such a man must esteem purity an exotic that could only be preserved by the greatest care. Of the degree of mental intimacy possible, in such a marriage, let every one judge for himself!\n\nOn this subject, let every woman, who has once begun to think, examine herself; see whether she does not suppose virtue possible and necessary to Man, and whether she would not desire for her son a virtue which aimed at a fitness for a divine life, and involved, if not asceticism, that degree of power over the lower self, which shall \u201cnot exterminate the passions, but keep them chained at the feet of reason.\u201d The passions, like fire, are a bad muster; but confine them to the hearth and the altar, and they give life to the social economy, and make each sacrifice meet for heaven.\n\nWhen many women have thought upon this subject, some will be fit for the senate, and one such senate in operation would affect the morals of the civilized world.\n\nAt present I look to the young. As preparatory to the senate, I should like to see a society of novices, such as the world has never yet seen, bound by no oath, wearing no badge, In place of an oath, they should have a religious faith in the capacity of Man for virtue; instead of a badge, should wear in the heart a firm resolve not to stop short of the destiny promised him as a son of God. Their service should be action and conservatism, not of old habits, but of a better nature, enlightened by hopes that daily grow brighter.\n\nIf sin was to remain in the world, it should not be by their connivance at its stay, or one moment's concession to its claims.\n\nThey should succor the oppressed, and pay to the upright the reverence due in hero-worship by seeking to emulate them. They would not denounce the willingly bad, but they could not be with them, for the two classes could not breathe the same atmosphere.\n\nThey would heed no detention from the time-serving, the worldly and the timid.\n\nThey could love no pleasures that were not innocent and capable of good fruit,\n\nI saw, in a foreign paper, the title now given to a party abroad, \u201cLos Exaltados.\u201d Such would be the title now given these children by the world: Los Exaltados, Las Exaltadas; but the world would not sneer always, for from them would issue a virtue by which it would, at last, be exalted too.\n\nI have in my eye a youth and a maiden whom I look to as the nucleus of such a class. They are both in early youth; both as yet uncontaminated; both aspiring, without rashness; both thoughtful; both capable of deep affection; both of strong nature and sweet feelings; both capable of large mental development. They reside in different regions of earth, but their place in the soul is the same. To them I look, as, perhaps, the harbingers and leaders of a new era, for never yet have I known minds so truly virgin, without narrowness or ignorance.\n\nWhen men call upon women to redeem them, they mean such maidens. But such are not easily formed under the present influences of society. As there are more such young men to help give a different tone, there will be more such maidens.\n\nThe English, novelist, D'Israeli, has, in his novel of \u201cThe Young Duke,\u201d made a man of the most depraved stock be redeemed by a woman who despises him when he has only the brilliant mask of fortune and beauty to cover the poverty of his heart and brain, but knows how to encourage him when he enters on a better course. But this woman was educated by a father who valued character in women.\n\nStill, there will come now and then one who will, as I hope of my young Exaltada, be example and instruction for the rest. It was not the opinion of Woman current among Jewish men that formed the character of the mother of Jesus.\n\nSince the sliding and backsliding men of the world, no less than the mystics, declare that, as through Woman Man was lost, so through Woman must Man be redeemed, the time must be at hand. When she knows herself indeed as \u201caccomplished,\u201d still more as \u201cimmortal Eve,\u201d this may be.\n\nAs an immortal, she may also know and inspire immortal love, a happiness not to be dreamed of under the circumstances advised in the last quotation. Where love is based on concealment, it must, of course, disappear when the soul enters the scene of clear vision!\n\nAnd, without this hope, how worthless every plan, every bond, every power!\n\n\u201cThe giants,\u201d said the Scandinavian Saga, \u201chad induced Loke (the spirit that hovers between good and ill) to steal for them Iduna (Goddess of Immortality) and her apples of pure gold. He lured her out, by promising to show, on a marvellous tree he had discovered, apples beautiful as her own, if she would only take them with her for a comparison. Thus having lured her beyond the heavenly domain, she was seized and carried away captive by the powers of misrule.\n\n\u201cAs now the gods could not find their friend Iduna, they were confused with grief; indeed, they began visibly to grow old and gray. Discords arose, and love grew cold. Indeed, Odur, spouse of the goddess of love and beauty, wandered away, and returned no more. At last, however, the gods, discovering the treachery of Loke, obliged him to win back Iduna from the prison in which she sat mourning. He changed himself into a falcon, and brought her back as a swallow, fiercely pursued by the Giant King, in the form of an eagle. So she strives to return among us, light and small as a swallow. We must welcome her form as the speck on the sky that assures the glad blue of Summer. Yet one swallow does not make a summer. Let us solicit them in flights and flocks!\u201d\n\nReturning from the future to the present, let us see what forms Iduna takes, as she moves along the declivity of centuries to the valley where the lily flower may concentrate all its fragrance.\n\nIt would seem as if this time were not very near to one fresh from books, such as I have of late been\u2014no: not reading, but sighing over. A crowd of books having been sent me since my friends knew me to be engaged in this way, on Woman's \u201cSphere,\u201d, Woman's \u201cMission,\u201d and Woman's \u201cDestiny,\u201d I believe that almost all that is extant of formal precept has come under my eye. Among these I read with refreshment a little one called \u201cThe Whole Duty of Woman,\u201d \u201cindited by a noble lady at the request of a noble lord,\u201d and which has this much of nobleness, that the view it takes is a religious one. It aims to fit Woman for heaven; the main bent of most of the others is to fit her to please, or, at least, not to disturb, a husband.\n\nAmong these I select, as a favorable specimen, the book I have already quoted, \u201cThe Study [Footnote: This title seems to be incorrectly translated from the French. I have not seen the original] of the Life of Woman, by Madame Necker de Saussure, of Geneva, translated from the French.\u201d This book was published at Philadelphia, and has been read with much favor here. Madame Necker is the cousin of Madame de Stael, and has taken from her works the motto prefixed to this.\n\n\u201cCette vie n'a quelque prix que si elle sert a' l'education morale do notre coeur.\u201d\n\nMde. Necker is, by nature, capable of entire consistency in the application of this motto, and, therefore, the qualifications she makes, in the instructions given to her own sex, show forcibly the weight which still paralyzes and distorts the energies of that sex.\n\nThe book is rich in passages marked by feeling and good suggestions; but, taken in the whole, the impression it leaves is this:\n\nWoman is, and shall remain, inferior to Man and subject to his will, and, in endeavoring to aid her, we must anxiously avoid anything that can be misconstrued into expression of the contrary opinion, else the men will be alarmed, and combine to defeat our efforts.\n\nThe present is a good time for these efforts, for men are less occupied about women than formerly. Let us, then, seize upon the occasion, and do what we can to make our lot tolerable. But we must sedulously avoid encroaching on the territory of Man. If we study natural history, our observations may be made useful, by some male naturalist; if we draw well, we may make our services acceptable to the artists. But our names must not be known; and, to bring these labors to any result, we must take some man for our head, and be his hands.\n\nThe lot of Woman is sad. She is constituted to expect and need a happiness that cannot exist on earth. She must stifle such aspirations within her secret heart, and fit herself, as well as she can, for a life of resignations and consolations.\n\nShe will be very lonely while living with her husband. She must not expect to open her heart to him fully, or that, after marriage, he will be capable of the refined service of love. The man is not born for the woman, only the woman for the man. \u201cMen cannot understand the hearts of women.\u201d The life of Woman must be outwardly a well-intentioned, cheerful dissimulation of her real life.\n\nNaturally, the feelings of the mother, at the birth of a female child, resemble those of the Paraguay woman, described by Southey as lamenting in such heart-breaking tones that her mother did not kill her the hour she was born,\u2014\u201dher mother, who knew what this life of a woman must be;\u201d\u2014or of those women seen at the north by Sir A. Mackenzie, who performed this pious duty towards female infants whenever they had an opportunity.\n\n\u201cAfter the first delight, the young mother experiences feelings a little different, according as the birth of a son or a daughter has been announced.\n\n\u201cIs it a son? A sort of glory swells at this thought the heart of the mother; she seems to feel that she is entitled to gratitude. She has given a citizen, a defender, to her country; to her husband an heir of his name; to herself a protector. And yet the contrast of all these fine titles with this being, so humble, soon strikes her. At the aspect of this frail treasure, opposite feelings agitate her heart; she seems to recognise in him a nature superior to her own, but subjected to a low condition, and she honors a future greatness in the object of extreme compassion. Somewhat of that respect and adoration for a feeble child, of which some fine pictures offer the expression in the features of the happy Mary, seem reproduced with the young mother who has given birth to a son.\n\n\u201cIs it a daughter? There is usually a slight degree of regret; so deeply rooted is the idea of the superiority of Man in happiness and dignity; and yet, as she looks upon this child, she is more and more softened towards it. A deep sympathy\u2014a sentiment of identity with this delicate being\u2014takes possession of her; an extreme pity for so much weakness, a more pressing need of prayer, stirs her heart. Whatever sorrows she may have felt, she dreads for her daughter; but she will guide her to become much wiser, much better than herself. And then the gayety, the frivolity of the young woman have their turn. This little creature is a flower to cultivate, a doll to decorate.\u201d\n\nSimilar sadness at the birth of a daughter I have heard mothers express not unfrequently.\n\nAs to this living so entirely for men, I should think when it was proposed to women they would feel, at least, some spark of the old spirit of races allied to our own. \u201cIf he is to be my bridegroom and lord\u201d cries Brunhilda, [Footnote: See the Nibelungen Lays.] \u201che must first be able to pass through fire and water.\u201d \u201cI will serve at the banquet,\u201d says the Walkyrie, \u201cbut only him who, in the trial of deadly combat, has shown himself a hero.\u201d\n\nIf women are to be bond-maids, let it be to men superior to women in fortitude, in aspiration, in moral power, in refined sense of beauty. You who give yourselves \u201cto be supported,\u201d or because \u201cone must love something,\u201d are they who make the lot of the sex such that mothers are sad when daughters are born.\n\nIt marks the state of feeling on this subject that it was mentioned, as a bitter censure on a woman who had influence over those younger than herself,\u2014\u201dShe makes those girls want to see heroes?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd will that hurt them?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly; how can you ask? They will find none, and so they will never be married.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet married\u201d is the usual phrase, and the one that correctly indicates the thought; but the speakers, on this occasion, were persons too outwardly refined to use it. They were ashamed of the word, but not of the thing. Madame Necker, however, sees good possible in celibacy.\n\nIndeed, I know not how the subject could be better illustrated, than by separating the wheat from the chaff in Madame Necker's book; place them in two heaps, and then summon the reader to choose; giving him first a near-sighted glass to examine the two;\u2014it might be a Christian, an astronomical, or an artistic glass,\u2014any kind of good glass to obviate acquired defects in the eye. I would lay any wager on the result.\n\nBut time permits not here a prolonged analysis. I have given the clues for fault-finding.\n\nAs a specimen of the good take the following passage, on the phenomena of what I have spoken of, as the lyrical or electric element in Woman.\n\n\u201cWomen have been seen to show themselves poets in the most pathetic pantomimic scenes, where all the passions were depicted full of beauty; and these poets used a language unknown to themselves, and, the performance once over, their inspiration was a forgotten dream. Without doubt there is an interior development to beings so gifted; but their sole mode of communication with us is their talent. They are, ill all besides, the inhabitants of another planet.\u201d\n\nSimilar observations have been made by those who have seen the women at Irish wakes, or the funeral ceremonies of modern Greece or Brittany, at times when excitement gave the impulse to genius; but, apparently, without a thought that these rare powers belonged to no other planet, but were a high development of the growth of this, and might, by wise and reverent treatment, be made to inform and embellish the scenes of every day. But, when Woman has her fair chance, she will do so, and the poem of the hour will vie with that of the ages.\n\nI come now with satisfaction to my own country, and to a writer, a female writer, whom I have selected as the clearest, wisest, and kindliest, who has, as yet, used pen here on these subjects. This is Miss Sedgwick.\n\nMiss Sedgwick, though she inclines to the private path, and wishes that, by the cultivation of character, might should vindicate right, sets limits nowhere, and her objects and inducements are pure. They are the free and careful cultivation of the powers that have been given, with an aim at moral and intellectual perfection. Her speech is moderate and sane, but never palsied by fear or sceptical caution.\n\nHerself a fine example of the independent and beneficent existence that intellect and character can give to Woman, no less than Man, if she know how to seek and prize it,\u2014also, that the intellect need not absorb or weaken, but rather will refine and invigorate, the affections,\u2014the teachings of her practical good sense come with great force, and cannot fail to avail much. Every way her writings please me both as to the means and the ends. I am pleased at the stress she lays on observance of the physical laws, because the true reason is given. Only in a strong and clean body can the soul do its message fitly.\n\nShe shows the meaning of the respect paid to personal neatness, both in the indispensable form of cleanliness, and of that love of order and arrangement, that must issue from a true harmony of feeling.\n\nThe praises of cold water seem to me an excellent sign in the age. They denote a tendency to the true life. We are now to have, as a remedy for ills, not orvietan, or opium, or any quack medicine, but plenty of air and water, with due attention to warmth and freedom in dress, and simplicity of diet.\n\nEvery day we observe signs that the natural feelings on these subjects are about to be re\u00efnstated, and the body to claim care as the abode and organ of the soul; not as the tool of servile labor, or the object of voluptuous indulgence.\n\nA poor woman, who had passed through the lowest grades of ignominy, seemed to think she had never been wholly lost, \u201cfor,\u201d said she, \u201cI would always have good under-clothes;\u201d and, indeed, who could doubt that this denoted the remains of private self-respect in the mind?\n\nA woman of excellent sense said, \u201cIt might seem childish, but to her one of the most favorable signs of the times was that the ladies had been persuaded to give up corsets.\u201d\n\nYes! let us give up all artificial means of distortion. Let life be healthy, pure, all of a piece. Miss Sedgwick, in teaching that domestics must have the means of bathing us much as their mistresses, and time, too, to bathe, has symbolized one of the most important of human rights.\n\nAnother interesting sign of the time is the influence exercised by two women, Miss Martineau and Miss Barrett, from their sick-rooms. The lamp of life which, if it had been fed only by the affections, depended on precarious human relations, would scarce have been able to maintain a feeble glare in the lonely prison, now shines far and wide over the nations, cheering fellow-sufferers and hallowing the joy of the healthful.\n\nThese persons need not health or youth, or the charms of personal presence, to make their thoughts available. A few more such, and \u201cold woman\u201d [Footnote: An apposite passage is quoted in Appendix F.] shall not be the synonyme for imbecility, nor \u201cold maid\u201d a term of contempt, nor Woman be spoken of as a reed shaken by the wind.\n\nIt is time, indeed, that men and women both should cease to grow old in any other way than as the tree does, full of grace and honor. The hair of the artist turns white, but his eye shines clearer than ever, and we feel that age brings him maturity, not decay. So would it be with all, were the springs of immortal refreshment but unsealed within the soul; then, like these women, they would see, from the lonely chamber window, the glories of the universe; or, shut in darkness, be visited by angels.\n\nI now touch on my own place and day, and, as I write, events are occurring that threaten the fair fabric approached by so long an avenue. Week before last, the Gentile was requested to aid the Jew to return to Palestine; for the Millennium, the reign of the Son of Mary was near. Just now, at high and solemn mass, thanks were returned to the Virgin for having delivered O'Connell from unjust imprisonment, in requital of his having consecrated to her the league formed in behalf of Liberty on Tara's Hill. But last week brought news which threatens that a cause identical with the enfranchisement of Jews, Irish, women, ay, and of Americans in general, too, is in danger, for the choice of the people threatens to rivet the chains of slavery and the leprosy of sin permanently on this nation, through the Annexation of Texas!\n\nAh! if this should take place, who will dare again to feel the throb of heavenly hope, as to the destiny of this country? The noble thought that gave unity to all our knowledge, harmony to all our designs,\u2014the thought that the progress of history had brought on the era, the tissue of prophecies pointed out the spot, where humanity was, at last, to have a fair chance to know itself, and all men be born free and equal for the eagle's flight,\u2014flutters as if about to leave the breast, which, deprived of it, will have no more a nation, no more a home on earth.\n\nWomen of my country!\u2014Exaltadas! if such there be,\u2014women of English, old English nobleness, who understand the courage of Boadicea, the sacrifice of Godiva, the power of Queen Emma to tread the red-hot iron unharmed,\u2014women who share the nature of Mrs. Hutchinson, Lady Russell, and the mothers of our own revolution,\u2014have you nothing to do with this? You see the men, how they are willing to sell shamelessly the happiness of countless generations of fellow-creatures, the honor of their country, and their immortal souls, for a money market and political power. Do you not feel within you that which can reprove them, which can check, which can convince them? You would not speak in vain; whether each in her own home, or banded in unison.\n\nTell these men that you will not accept the glittering baubles, spacious dwellings, and plentiful service, they mean to offer you through those means. Tell them that the heart of Woman demands nobleness and honor in Man, and that, if they have not purity, have not mercy, they are no longer fathers, lovers, husbands, sons of yours.\n\nThis cause is your own, for, as I have before said, there is a reason why the foes of African Slavery seek more freedom for women; but put it not upon that ground, but on the ground of right.\n\nIf you have a power, it is a moral power. The films of interest are not so close around you as around the men. If you will but think, you cannot fail to wish to save the country from this disgrace. Let not slip the occasion, but do something to lift off the curse incurred by Eve.\n\nYou have heard the women engaged in the Abolition movement accused of boldness, because they lifted the voice in public, and lifted the latch of the stranger. But were these acts, whether performed judiciously or no, so bold as to dare before God and Man to partake the fruits of such offence as this?\n\nYou hear much of the modesty of your sex. Preserve it by filling the mind with noble desires that shall ward off the corruptions of vanity and idleness. A profligate woman, who left her accustomed haunts and took service in a New York boarding-house, said \u201cshe had never heard talk so vile at the Five Points, as from the ladies at the boarding-house.\u201d And why? Because they were idle; because, having nothing worthy to engage them, they dwelt, with unnatural curiosity, on the ill they dared not go to see.\n\nIt will not so much injure your modesty to have your name, by the unthinking, coupled with idle blame, as to have upon your soul the weight of not trying to save a whole race of women from the scorn that is put upon their modesty.\n\nThink of this well! I entreat, I conjure you, before it is too late. It is my belief that something effectual might be done by women, if they would only consider the subject, and enter upon it in the true spirit,\u2014a spirit gentle, but firm, and which feared the offence of none, save One who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity.\n\nAnd now I have designated in outline, if not in fulness, the stream which is ever flowing from the heights of my thought.\n\nIn the earlier tract I was told I did not make my meaning sufficiently clear. In this I have consequently tried to illustrate it in various ways, and may have been guilty of much repetition. Yet, as I am anxious to leave no room for doubt, I shall venture to retrace, once more, the scope of my design in points, as wad done in old-fashioned sermons.\n\nMan is a being of two-fold relations, to nature beneath, and intelligences above him. The earth is his school, if not his birth-place; God his object; life and thought his means of interpreting nature, and aspiring to God.\n\nOnly a fraction of this purpose is accomplished in the life of any one man. Its entire accomplishment is to be hoped only from the sum of the lives of men, or Man considered as a whole.\n\nAs this whole has one soul and one body, any injury or obstruction to a part, or to the meanest member, affects the whole. Man can never be perfectly happy or virtuous, till all men are so.\n\nTo address Man wisely, you must not forget that his life is partly animal, subject to the same laws with Nature.\n\nBut you cannot address him wisely unless you consider him still more as soul, and appreciate the conditions and destiny of soul.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The growth of Man is two-fold, masculine and feminine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as these two methods can be distinguished, they are so as\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Energy and Harmony;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Power and Beauty;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intellect and Love;\n\nor by some such rude classification; for we have not language primitive and pure enough to express such ideas with precision.\n\nThese two sides are supposed to be expressed in Man and Woman, that is, as the more and the less, for the faculties have not been given pure to either, but only in preponderance. There are also exceptions in great number, such as men of far more beauty than power, and the reverse. But, as a general rule, it seems to have been the intention to give a preponderance on the one side, that is called masculine, and on the other, one that is called feminine.\n\nThere cannot be a doubt that, if these two developments were in perfect harmony, they would correspond to and fulfil one another, like hemispheres, or the tenor and bass in music.\n\nBut there is no perfect harmony in human nature; and the two parts answer one another only now and then; or, if there be a persistent consonance, it can only be traced at long intervals, instead of discoursing an obvious melody.\n\nWhat is the cause of this?\n\nMan, in the order of time, was developed first; as energy comes before harmony; power before beauty.\n\nWoman was therefore under his care as an elder. He might have been her guardian and teacher.\n\nBut, as human nature goes not straight forward, but by excessive action and then reaction in an undulated course, he misunderstood and abused his advantages, and became her temporal master instead of her spiritual sire.\n\nOn himself came the punishment. He educated Woman more as a servant than a daughter, and found himself a king without a queen.\n\nThe children of this unequal union showed unequal natures, and, more and more, men seemed sons of the handmaid, rather than princess.\n\nAt last, there were so many Ishmaelites that the rest grew frightened and indignant. They laid the blame on Hagar, and drove her forth into the wilderness.\n\nBut there were none the fewer Ishmaelites for that.\n\nAt last men became a little wiser, and saw that the infant Moses was, in every case, saved by the pure instincts of Woman's breast. For, as too much adversity is better for the moral nature than too much prosperity, Woman, in this respect, dwindled less than Man, though in other respects still a child in leading-strings.\n\nSo Man did her more and more justice, and grew more and more kind.\n\nBut yet\u2014his habits and his will corrupted by the past\u2014he did not clearly see that Woman was half himself; that her interests were identical with his; and that, by the law of their common being, he could never reach his true proportions while she remained in any wise shorn of hers.\n\nAnd so it has gone on to our day; both ideas developing, but more slowly than they would under a clearer recognition of truth and justice, which would have permitted the sexes their due influence on one another, and mutual improvement from more dignified relations.\n\nWherever there was pure love, the natural influences were, for the time, restored.\n\nWherever the poet or artist gave free course to his genius, he saw the truth, and expressed it in worthy forms, for these men especially share and need the feminine principle. The divine birds need to be brooded into life and song by mothers.\n\nWherever religion (I mean the thirst for truth and good, not the love of sect and dogma) had its course, the original design was apprehended in its simplicity, and the dove presaged sweetly from Dodona's oak.\n\nI have aimed to show that no age was left entirely without a witness of the equality of the sexes in function, duty and hope.\n\nAlso that, when there was unwillingness or ignorance, which prevented this being acted upon, women had not the less power for their want of light and noble freedom. But it was power which hurt alike them and those against whom they made use of the arms of the servile,\u2014cunning, blandishment, and unreasonable emotion.\n\nThat now the time has come when a clearer vision and better action are possible\u2014when Man and Woman may regard one another, as brother and sister, the pillars of one porch, the priests of one worship.\n\nI have believed and intimated that this hope would receive an ampler fruition, than ever before, in our own land.\n\nAnd it will do so if this land carry out the principles from which sprang our national life.\n\nI believe that, at present, women are the best helpers of one another.\n\nLet them think; let them act; till they know what they need.\n\nWe only ask of men to remove arbitrary barriers. Some would like to do more. But I believe it needs that Woman show herself in her native dignity, to teach them how to aid her; their minds are so encumbered by tradition.\n\nWhen Lord Edward Fitzgerald travelled with the Indians, his manly heart obliged him at once to take the packs from the squaws and carry them. But we do not read that the red men followed his example, though they are ready enough to carry the pack of the white woman, because she seems to them a superior being.\n\nLet Woman appear in the mild majesty of Ceres, and rudest churls will be willing to learn from her.\n\nYou ask, what use will she make of liberty, when she has so long been sustained and restrained?\n\nI answer; in the first place, this will not be suddenly given. I read yesterday a debate of this year on the subject of enlarging women's rights over property. It was a leaf from the class-book that is preparing for the needed instruction. The men learned visibly as they spoke. The champions of Woman saw the fallacy of arguments on the opposite side, and were startled by their own convictions. With their wives at home, and the readers of the paper, it was the same. And so the stream flows on; thought urging action, and action leading to the evolution of still better thought.\n\nBut, were this freedom to come suddenly, I have no fear of the consequences. Individuals might commit excesses, but there is not only in the sex a reverence for decorums and limits inherited and enhanced from generation to generation, which many years of other life could not efface, but a native love, in Woman as Woman, of proportion, of \u201cthe simple art of not too much,\u201d\u2014a Greek moderation, which would create immediately a restraining party, the natural legislators and instructors of the rest, and would gradually establish such rules as are needed to guard, without impeding, life.\n\nThe Graces would lead the choral dance, and teach the rest to regulate their steps to the measure of beauty.\n\nBut if you ask me what offices they may fill, I reply\u2014any. I do not care what case you put; let them be sea-captains, if you will. I do not doubt there are women well fitted for such an office, and, if so, I should be as glad to see them in it, as to welcome the maid of Saragossa, or the maid of Missolonghi, or the Suliote heroine, or Emily Plater.\n\nI think women need, especially at this juncture, a much greater range of occupation than they have, to rouse their latent powers. A party of travellers lately visited a lonely hut on a mountain. There they found an old woman, who told them she and her husband had lived there forty years. \u201cWhy,\u201d they said, \u201cdid you choose so barren a spot?\u201d She \u201cdid not know; it was the man's notion.\u201d\n\nAnd, during forty years, she had been content to act, without knowing why, upon \u201cthe man's notion.\u201d I would not have it so.\n\nIn families that I know, some little girls like to saw wood, others to use carpenters' tools. Where these tastes are indulged, cheerfulness and good-humor are promoted. Where they are forbidden, because \u201csuch things are not proper for girls,\u201d they grow sullen and mischievous.\n\nFourier had observed these wants of women, as no one can fail to do who watches the desires of little girls, or knows the ennui that haunts grown women, except where they make to themselves a serene little world by art of some kind. He, therefore, in proposing a great variety of employments, in manufactures or the care of plants and animals, allows for one third of women as likely to have a taste for masculine pursuits, one third of men for feminine.\n\nWho does not observe the immediate glow and serenity that is diffused over the life of women, before restless or fretful, by engaging in gardening, building, or the lowest department of art? Here is something that is not routine, something that draws forth life towards the infinite.\n\nI have no doubt, however, that a large proportion of women would give themselves to the same employments as now, because there are circumstances that must lead them. Mothers will delight to make the nest soft and warm. Nature would take care of that; no need to clip the wings of any bird that wants to soar and sing, or finds in itself the strength of pinion for a migratory flight unusual to its kind. The difference would be that all need not be constrained to employments for which some are unfit.\n\nI have urged upon the sex self-subsistence in its two forms of self-reliance and self-impulse, because I believe them to be the needed means of the present juncture.\n\nI have urged on Woman independence of Man, not that I do not think the sexes mutually needed by one another, but because in Woman this fact has led to an excessive devotion, which has cooled love, degraded marriage, and prevented either sex from being what it should be to itself or the other.\n\nI wish Woman to live, first for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man her god, and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty. Then, if she finds what she needs in Man embodied, she will know how to love, and be worthy of being loved.\n\nBy being more a soul, she will not be less Woman, for nature is perfected through spirit.\n\nNow there is no woman, only an overgrown child.\n\nThat her hand may be given with dignity, she must be able to stand alone. I wish to see men and women capable of such relations as are depicted by Landor in his Pericles and Aspasia, where grace is the natural garb of strength, and the affections are calm, because deep. The softness is that of a firm tissue, as when\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe gods approve\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The depth, but not the tumult of the soul,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A fervent, not ungovernable love.\u201d\n\nA profound thinker has said, \u201cNo married woman can represent the female world, for she belongs to her husband. The idea of Woman must be represented by a virgin.\u201d\n\nBut that is the very fault of marriage, and of the present relation between the sexes, that the woman does belong to the man, instead of forming a whole with him. Were it otherwise, there would be no such limitation to the thought.\n\nWoman, self-centred, would never be absorbed by any relation; it would be only an experience to her as to man. It is a vulgar error that love, a love, to Woman is her whole existence; she also is born for Truth and Love in their universal energy. Would she but assume her inheritance, Mary would not be the only virgin mother. Not Manzoni alone would celebrate in his wife the virgin mind with the maternal wisdom and conjugal affections. The soul is ever young, ever virgin.\n\nAnd will not she soon appear?\u2014the woman who shall vindicate their birthright for all women; who shall teach them what to claim, and how to use what they obtain? Shall not her name be for her era Victoria, for her country and life Virginia? Yet predictions are rash; she herself must teach us to give her the fitting name.\n\nAn idea not unknown to ancient times has of late been revived, that, in the metamorphoses of life, the soul assumes the form, first of Man, then of Woman, and takes the chances, and reaps the benefits of either lot. Why then, say some, lay such emphasis on the rights or needs of Woman? What she wins not as Woman will come to her as Man.\n\nThat makes no difference. It is not Woman, but the law of right, the law of growth, that speaks in us, and demands the perfection of each being in its kind\u2014apple as apple, Woman as Woman. Without adopting your theory, I know that I, a daughter, live through the life of Man; but what concerns me now is, that my life be a beautiful, powerful, in a word, a complete life in its kind. Had I but one more moment to live I must wish the same.\n\nSuppose, at the end of your cycle, your great world-year, all will be completed, whether I exert myself or not (and the supposition is false,\u2014but suppose it true), am I to be indifferent about it? Not so! I must beat my own pulse true in the heart of the world; for that is virtue, excellence, health.\n\nThou, Lord of Day! didst leave us to-night so calmly glorious, not dismayed that cold winter is coming, not postponing thy beneficence to the fruitful summer! Thou didst smile on thy day's work when it was done, and adorn thy down-going as thy up-rising, for thou art loyal, and it is thy nature to give life, if thou canst, and shine at all events!\n\nI stand in the sunny noon of life. Objects no longer glitter in the dews of morning, neither are yet softened by the shadows of evening. Every spot is seen, every chasm revealed. Climbing the dusty hill, some fair effigies that once stood for symbols of human destiny have been broken; those I still have with me show defects in this broad light. Yet enough is left, even by experience, to point distinctly to the glories of that destiny; faint, but not to be mistaken streaks of the future day. I can say with the bard,\n\n\u201cThough many have suffered shipwreck, still beat noble hearts.\u201d\nAlways the soul says to us all, Cherish your best hopes as a faith, and abide by them in action. Such shall be the effectual fervent means to their fulfilment;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Power to whom we bow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Has

refined,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shall hear all music loud and clear,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whose first notes they ventured here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then fear not thou to wind the horn,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though elf and gnome thy courage scorn;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ask for the castle's King and Queen;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though rabble rout may rush between,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beat thee senseless to the ground,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the dark beset thee round;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Persist to ask, and it will come;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seek not for rest in humbler home;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So shalt thou see, what few have seen,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The palace home of King and Queen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a015th November, 1844.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1658797", "artist_names": "Dorothy Norwood",

"Howard-zinn", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Howard-zinn"}, "artist": "Howard Zinn", "lyrics": "Chapter 22: The Unreported Resistance LyricsIn the early 1990s, a writer for the New Republic magazine, reviewing with approval in the New York Times a book about the influence of dangerously unpatriotic elements among American intellectuals, warned his readers of the existence of \"a permanent adversarial culture\" in the United States\n\nIt was an accurate observation. Despite the political consensus of Democrats and Republicans in Washington which set limits on American reform, making sure that capitalism was in place, that national military strength was maintained, that wealth and power remained in the hands of a few, there were millions of Americans, probably tens of millions, who refused, either actively or silently, to go along. Their activities were largely unreported by the media. They constituted this \"permanent adversarial culture.\"\n\nThe Democratic party was more responsive to these Americans, on whose votes it depended. But its responsiveness was limited by its own captivity to corporate interests, and its domestic reforms were severely limited by the system's dependency on militarism and war. Thus, President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty in the sixties became a victim of the war in Vietnam, and Jimmy Carter could not go far so long as he insisted on a huge outlay of money for the military, much of this to stockpile more nuclear weapons\n\nAs these limits became clear in the Carter years, a small but determined movement against nuclear arms began to grow. The pioneers were a tiny group of Christian pacifists who had been active against the Vietnam war (among them were a former priest, Philip Berrigan, and his wife, Elizabeth McAlister, a former nun). Again and again, members of this group would be arrested for engaging in nonviolent acts of dramatic protest against nuclear war at the Pentagon and the White House\u2014trespassing on forbidden areas, pouring their own blood on symbols of the war machine\n\nIn 1980, small delegations of peace activists from all over the country maintained a series of demonstrations at the Pentagon, in which over a thousand people were arrested for acts of nonviolent civil disobedience\n\nIn September of that year, Philip Berrigan, his brother Daniel (the Jesuit priest and poet), Molly Rush (a mother of six), Anne Montgomery (a nun and counselor to young runaways and prostitutes in Manhattan), and four of their friends made their way past a guard in the General Electric Plant at King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where nose cones for nuclear missiles were manufactured. They used sledgehammers to smash two of the nose cones and smeared their own blood over missile parts, blueprints, and furniture. Arrested, sentenced to years in prison, they said they were trying to set an example to do as the Bible suggested, to beat swords into plowshares\nThey pointed to the huge allocations of taxpayers' money to corporations producing weaponry: \"G.E. drains $3 million a day from the public treasury-an enormous larceny against the poor.\" Before their trial (they came to be known as the Plowshares Eight), Daniel Berrigan had written in the Catholic Worker\n\nI know of no sure way of predicting where things will go from there, whether others will hear and respond, or how quickly or slowly. Or whether the act will fail to vitalize others, will come to a grinding halt then and there, its actors stigmatized or dismissed as fools. One swallows dry and takes a chance\n\nIn fact, the movement did not come to a halt. Over the next decade, a national movement against nuclear weapons developed, from a small number of men and women willing to go to jail to make others stop and think to millions of Americans frightened at the thought of nuclear holocaust, indignant at the billions of dollars spent on weaponry while people were in need of life's necessities\n\nEven the very Middle-American Pennsylvania jurors who convicted the Plowshares Eight showed remarkable sympathy with their actions. One juror, Michael DeRosa, told a reporter, \"I didn't think they really went to commit a crime. They went to protest.\" Another, Mary Ann Ingram, said the jury argued about that: \"We . . . really didn't want to convict them on anything. But we had to because of the way the judge said the thing you can use is what you get under the law.\" She added: \"These people are not criminals. Here are people who are trying to do some good for the country. But the judge said nuclear power wasn't the issue.\"\n\nReagan's huge military budget was to provoke a national movement against nuclear weapons. In the election of 1980 that brought him into the Presidency, local referenda in three districts in western Massachusetts permitted voters to say whether they believed in a mutual Soviet-American halt to testing, production, and deployment of all nuclear weapons, and wanted Congress to devote those funds instead to civilian use. Two peace groups had worked for months on the campaign and all three districts approved the resolution (94,000 to 65,000), even those that voted for Reagan as President. Similar referenda received majority votes between 1978 and 1981 in San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland, Madison, and Detroit\n\nWomen were in the forefront of the new antinuclear movement. Randall Forsberg, a young specialist in nuclear arms, organized the Council for a Nuclear Weapons Freeze, whose simple program\u2014a mutual Soviet-American freeze on the production of new nuclear weapons\u2014began to catch on throughout the country. Shortly after Reagan's election, two thousand women assembled in Washington, marched on the Pentagon, and surrounded it in a great circle, linking arms or stretching to hold the ends of brightly colored scarves. One hundred forty women were arrested for blocking the Pentagon entrance\n\nA small group of doctors began to organize meetings around the country to teach citizens the medical consequences of nuclear war. They were the core of the Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Dr. Helen Caldicott, the group's president, became one of the most powerful and eloquent national leaders of the movement. At one of their public symposia, Howard Hiatt, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, gave a graphic description of the results of one twenty-megaton nuclear bomb falling on Boston. Two million people would die. Survivors would be burned, blinded, crippled. In a nuclear war there would be 25 million severe burn cases in the nation, yet all existing facilities could take care of only 200 cases\n\nAt a national meeting of Catholic bishops early in the Reagan administration, the majority opposed any use of nuclear weapons. In November 1981, there were meetings on 151 college campuses around the country on the issue of nuclear war. And at local elections in Boston that month, a resolution calling for increased federal spending on social programs \"by reducing the amount of our tax dollars spent on nuclear weapons and programs of foreign intervention\" won a majority in every one of Boston's twenty-two wards, including both white and black working-class districts\n\nOn June 12, 1982, the largest political demonstration in the history of the country took place in Central Park, New York City. Close to a million people gathered to express their determination to bring an end to the arms race\n\nScientists who had worked on the atom bomb added their voices to the growing movement. George Kistiakowsky, a Harvard University chemistry professor who had worked on the first atomic bomb, and later was science adviser to President Eisenhower, became a spokesman for the disarmament movement. His last public remarks, before his death from cancer at the age of eighty-two, were in an editorial for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists in December 1982. \"I tell you as my parting words: Forget the channels. There simply is not enough time left before the world explodes. Concentrate instead on organizing, with so many others of like mind, a mass movement for peace such as there has not been before.\"\n\nBy the spring of 1983, the nuclear freeze had been endorsed by 368 city and county councils across the country, by 444 town meetings and 17 state legislatures, and by the House of Representatives. A Harris poll at this time indicated that 79 percent of the population wanted a nuclear freeze agreement with the Soviet Union. Even among evangelical Christians\u2014a group of 40 million people presumed to be conservative and pro-Reagan\u2014a Gallup poll sampling showed 60 percent favoring a nuclear freeze\n\nA year after the great Central Park demonstration, there were over three thousand antiwar groups around the country. And the antinuclear feeling was being reflected in the culture-in books, magazine articles, plays, motion pictures. Jonathan Schells impassioned book against the arms race, The Fate of the Earth, became a national best-seller. A documentary film on the arms race made in Canada was forbidden to enter the country by the Reagan administration, but a federal court ordered it admitted\n\nIn less than three years, there had come about a remarkable change in public opinion. At the time of Reagan's election, nationalist feeling\u2014drummed up by the recent hostage crisis in Iran and by the Russian invasion of Afghanistan\u2014was strong; the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center found that only 12 percent of those it polled thought too much was being spent on arms. But when it took another poll in the spring of 1982, that figure rose to 32 percent. And in the spring of 1983, a New York Time/CBS News poll found that the figure had risen again, to 48 percent\nAntimilitarist feeling expressed itself also in resistance to the draft. When President Jimmy Carter, responding to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, called for the registration of young men for a military draft, more than 800,000 men (10 percent) failed to register. One mother wrote to the New York Time:\n\nTo the Editor: Thirty-six years ago I stood in front of the crematorium. The ugliest force in the world had promised itself that I should be removed from the cycle of life-that I should never know the pleasure of giving life. With great guns and great hatred, this force thought itself the equal of the force of lift\n\nI survived the great guns, and with every smile of my son, they grow smaller. It is not for me, sir, to offer my son's blood as lubricant for the next generation of guns. I remove myself and my own from the cycle of death\nIsabella Leitner\n\nFormer Nixon aide Alexander Haig warned, in an interview in the French journal Politique Internationale, that there might reappear in the U.S. the conditions that forced President Nixon to stop the draft. \"There is a Jane Fonda on every doorstep,\" he said\n\nOne of the young men who refused to register, James Peters, wrote an open letter to President Carter:\n\nDear Mr. President: On July 23, 1980, I ... am expected to report to my local post office for the purpose of registering with the Selective Service System. I hereby inform you, Mr. President, that I will not register on July 23, or at any time thereafter... . We have tried militarism, and it has failed the human race in every way imaginable\n\nOnce he was in office, Ronald Reagan hesitated to renew draft registration, because, as his Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, explained, \"President Reagan believes that resuming the draft to meet manpower problems would lead to public unrest comparable to that in the sixties and seventies.\" William Beecher, a former Pentagon reporter, wrote in November 1981 that Reagan was \"obviously concerned, even alarmed, by the mounting voices of discontent and suspicion over emerging U.S. nuclear strategy both in the streets of Europe and more recently on American campuses.\"\n\nHoping to intimidate this opposition, the Reagan administration began to prosecute draft resisters. One of those facing prison was Benjamin Sasway, who cited U.S. military intervention in El Salvador as a good reason not to register for the draft\n\nAroused by Sasway's civil disobedience, a right-wing columnist (William A. Rusher, of the National Review) wrote indignantly that one heritage of the sixties was a new generation of antiwar teachers:\n\nAlmost certainly there was a teacher, or teachers, who taught Benjamin Sasway to look at American society as a hypocritical, exploitative, materialistic roadblock on the path of human progress. The generation of the Vietnam protesters is now in its early thirties, and the academicians among them are already ensconced in the faculties of the country's high schools and colleges.... What a pity our jurisprudence doesn't allow us to reach and penalize the real architects of this sort of destruction!\n\nReagan's policy of giving military aid to the dictatorship of El Salvador was not accepted quietly around the nation. He had barely taken office when the following report appeared in the Boston Globe:\n\nIt was a scene reminiscent of the 1960s, a rally of students in Harvard Yard shouting antiwar slogans, a candlelight march through the streets of Cambridge.. .. 2000 persons, mostly students, gathered to protest U.S. involvement in El Salvador... . Students from Tufts, MIT, Boston University and Boston College, the University of Massachusetts, Brandeis, Suffolk, Dartmouth, Northeastern, Vassar, Yale and Simmons were represented\n\nDuring commencement exercises that spring of 1981 at Syracuse University, when Reagan's Secretary of State, Alexander Haig, was given an honorary doctorate in \"public service,\" two hundred students and faculty turned their backs on the presentation. During Haig's address, the press reported, \"Nearly every pause in Mr. Haig's fifteen-minute address was punctuated by chants: 'Human needs, not military greed!' 'Get out of El Salvador!' 'Washington guns killed American nuns!'\"\nThe last slogan was a reference to the execution in the fall of 1980 of four American nuns by Salvadoran soldiers. Thousands of people in El Salvador were being murdered each year by \"death squads\" sponsored by a government armed by the United States, and the American public was beginning to pay attention to events in this tiny Central American country\n\nAs has been true generally in the making of U.S. foreign policy, there was no pretense at democracy. Public opinion was simply ignored. A New York Time/CBS News poll in the spring of 1982 reported that only 16 percent of its sampling favored Reagan's program of sending military and economic aid to El Salvador\n\nIn the spring of 1983, it was disclosed that an American physician named Charles Clement was working with the Salvadoran rebels. As an Air Force pilot in Southeast Asia, he had become disillusioned with U.S. policy there, having seen firsthand that his government was lying, and refused to fly any more missions. The Air Force response was to commit him to a psychiatric hospital, then to discharge him as psychologically unfit. He went to medical school, and then volunteered to be a doctor with the guerrillas in El Salvador\n\nThere was much talk in the American press in the early eighties about the political cautiousness of a new generation of college students concerned mostly with their own careers. But when, at the Harvard commencement of June 1983, Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes criticized American intervention in Latin America, and said, \"Because we are your true friends, we will not permit you to conduct yourselves in Latin American affairs as the Soviet Union conducts itself in Central European and Central Asian affairs,\" he was interrupted twenty times by applause and received a standing ovation when finished\n\nAmong my own students at Boston University, I did not find the pervasive selfishness and unconcern with others that the media kept reporting, in deadening repetition, about the students of the eighties. In the journals they kept, I found the following comments:\n\nA male student: \"Do you think anything good that has happened in the world had anything to do with government? I work in Roxbury [a black neighborhood]. I know the government doesn't work. Not for the people of Roxbury, and not for the people anywhere. It works for people with money.\"\n\nA graduate of a Catholic high school: \"America to me is a society, a culture. America is my home; if someone were to rob that culture from me, then perhaps there would be reason to resist. I will not die, however, to defend the honor of the government.\"\n\nA young woman: \"As a white middle class person I've never felt discriminated against at all. But I'll say this: If anyone ever tried to make me sit in a different schoolroom, use a different bathroom, or anything like that, I would knock them right on their ass.. . . The people are the last ones that need their rights stated on paper, for if they're abused or injusticed by government or authority, they can act on the injustice directly.. . . When you look at the ... statements of rights and laws, it's really government and authority and institutions and corporations that need laws and rights to insulate them from the physicality, the directness of the people.\"\n\nBeyond the campuses, out in the country, there was opposition to government policy, not widely known. A report from Tucson, Arizona, early in the Reagan presidency described \"demonstrators, mainly middle-aged,\" protesting at the Federal Building against U.S. involvement in El Salvador. Over a thousand people in Tucson marched in a procession and attended a mass to commemorate the anniversary of the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, who had spoken out against the Salvadoran death squads\n\nOver 60,000 Americans signed pledges to take action of some sort, including civil disobedience, if Reagan moved to invade Nicaragua. When the President instituted a blockade of the tiny country to try to force its government out of power, there were demonstrations around the country. In Boston alone, 550 people were arrested protesting the blockade\n\nDuring Reagan's presidency, there were hundreds of actions throughout the nation against his policies in South Africa. He obviously did not want to see the white ruling minority of South Africa displaced by the radical African National Congress, which represented the black majority. Chester Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, in his memoirs, called Reagan \"insensitive\" to the conditions under which blacks lived there. Public opinion was strong enough to cause Congress to legislate economic sanctions against the South African Government in 1986, overriding Reagan's veto\n\nReagan's cuts in social services were felt on the local level as vital needs could not he taken care of, and there were angry reactions. In the spring and summer of 1981, residents of East Boston took to the streets; for fifty-five nights they blocked major thoroughfares and the Sumner Tunnel during rush hour, in order to protest cutbacks in funds for fire, police, and teachers. The police superintendent, John Doyle, said: \"Maybe these people are starting to take lessons from the protests of the sixties and seventies.\" The Boston Globe reported: \"The demonstrators in East Boston were mostly middle-aged, middle- or working-class people who said they had never protested anything before.\"\n\nThe Reagan administration took away federal funds for the arts, suggesting that the performing arts seek help from private donors. In New York, two historic Broadway theaters were razed to make way for a luxury fifty-story hotel, after two hundred theater people demonstrated, picketing, reading plays and singing songs, refusing to disperse when ordered by police. Some of the nation's best-known theater personalities were arrested, including producer Joseph Papp, actresses Tammy Grimes, Estelle Parsons, and Celeste Holm, actors Richard Gere and Michael Moriarty\n\nThe budget cuts spurred strikes across the country, often by groups unaccustomed to striking. In the fall of 1982, United Press International reported:\n\nAngered by layoffs, salary cuts and uncertainty about job security, more schoolteachers throughout the country have decided to go on strike. Teachers' strikes last week in seven states, from Rhode Island to Washington, have idled more than 300,000 students\n\nSurveying a series of news events in the first week of January 1983, David Nyhan of the Boston Globe wrote: \"There is something brewing in the land that bodes ill for those in Washington who ignore it. People have moved from the frightened state to the angry stage and are acting out their frustrations in ways that will test the fabric of civil order.\" He gave some examples:\n\nIn Little Washington, Pennsylvania, in early 1983, when a 50-year-old computer science teacher who led a teachers' strike was sent to jail, 2000 people demonstrated outside the jailhouse in his support, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called it \"the largest crowd in Washington County since the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion.\"\n\nWhen unemployed or bankrupt home owners in the Pittsburgh area could no longer make mortgage payments, and foreclosure sales were scheduled, 60 pickets jammed the courthouse to protest the auction, and Allegheny sheriff Eugene Coon halted the proceedings\n\nThe foreclosure of a 320-acre wheat farm in Springfield, Colorado, was interrupted by 200 angry farmers, who had to be dispersed by tear gas and Mace\n\nWhen Reagan arrived in Pittsburgh in April 1983 to make a speech, 3000 people, many of them unemployed steelworkers, demonstrated against him, standing in the rain outside his hotel. Demonstrations by the unemployed were taking place in Detroit, Flint, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Washington\u2014over twenty cities in all\n\nJust around that time, Miami blacks rioted against police brutality; they were reacting against their general deprivation as well. The unemployment rate among young African-Americans had risen above 50 percent, and the Reagan administration's only response to poverty was to build more jails. Understanding that blacks would not vote for him, Reagan tried, unsuccessfully, to get Congress to eliminate a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which had been very effective in safeguarding the right of blacks to vote in Southern states\n\nReagan's policies clearly joined the two issues of disarmament and social welfare. It was guns versus children, and this was expressed dramatically by the head of the Children's Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman, in a commencement speech at the Milton Academy in Massachusetts in the summer of 1983:\n\nYou are graduating into a nation and world teetering on the brink of moral and economic bankruptcy. Since 1980, our President and Congress have been turning our national plowshares into swords and been bringing good news to the rich at the expense of the poor. .. . Children are the major victims. Our misguided national and world choices are literally killing children daily.... Yet governments throughout the world, led by our own, spend over $600 billion a year on arms, while an estimated 1 billion of our world's people live in poverty and 600 million are under- or unemployed. Where is the human commitment and political will to find the relative pittance of money needed to protect children?\n\nShe urged her listeners: \"Pick a piece of the problem that you can help solve while trying to see how your piece fits into the broader social change puzzle.\"\n\nHer words seemed to represent a growing mood that worried the Reagan administration. It withdrew some of its proposed cutbacks, and Congress eliminated others. When, in its second year, the administration proposed $9 billion in cuts in support for children and poor families, Congress accepted only $1 billion. The Washington correspondent of the New York Time reported: \"Political concerns about the fairness of Mr. Reagan's programs have forced the Administration to curtail its efforts to make further cutbacks in programs for the poor.\"\n\nThe repeated elections of Republican candidates, Reagan in 1980 and 1984, George Bush in 1988, were treated by the press with words like \"landslide\" and \"overwhelming victory.\" They were ignoring four facts: that roughly half the population, though eligible to vote, did not; that those who did vote were limited severely in their choices to the two parties that monopolized the money and the media; that as a result many of their votes were cast without enthusiasm; and that there was little relationship between voting for a candidate and voting for specific policies\n\nIn 1980 Reagan received 51.6 percent of the popular vote, while Jimmy Carter received 41.7 percent and John Anderson (a liberal Republican running on a third-party ticket) received 6.7 percent. Only 54 percent of the voting-age population voted, so that\u2014of the total eligible to vote\u201427 percent voted for Reagan\n\nA survey by the New York Time found that only 11 percent of those who voted for Reagan did so because \"he's a real conservative.\" Three times as many said they voted for him because \"it is time for a change.\"\n\nFor a second term, running against former Vice-President Walter Mondale, Reagan won 59 percent of the popular vote, but with half the electorate not voting, he had 29 percent of the voting population\n\nIn the 1988 election, with Vice-President George Bush running against Democrat Michael Dukakis, Bush's 54 percent victory added up to 27 percent of the eligible voters\n\nBecause our peculiar voting arrangements allow a small margin of popular votes to become a huge majority of electoral votes, the media can talk about \"overwhelming victory,\" thus deceiving their readers and disheartening those who don't look closely at the statistics. Could one say from these figures that \"the American people\" wanted Reagan, or Bush, as President? One could certainly say that more voters preferred the Republican candidates to their opponents. But even more seemed to want neither candidate. Nevertheless, on the basis of these slim electoral pluralities, Reagan and Bush would claim that \"the people\" had spoken\n\nIndeed, when the people did speak about issues, in surveys of public opinion, they expressed beliefs to which neither the Republican nor Democratic parties paid attention\n\nFor instance, both parties, through the eighties and early nineties, kept strict limits on social programs for the poor, on the grounds that this would require more taxes, and \"the people\" did not want higher taxes\n\nThis was certainly true as a general proposition, that Americans wanted to pay as little in taxes as possible. But when they were asked if they would be willing to pay higher taxes for specific purposes like health and education, they said yes, they would. For instance, a 1990 poll of Boston area voters showed that 54 percent of them would pay more taxes if that would go toward cleaning up the environment\n\nAnd when higher taxes were presented in class terms, rather than as a general proposal, people were quite clear. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in December 1990 showed that 84 percent of the respondents favored a surtax on millionaires (this provision was dropped around that time from a Democratic-Republican budget compromise). Even though 51 percent of the respondents were in favor of raising the capital gains tax, neither major party favored that\n\nA Harris/Harvard School of Public Health poll of 1989 showed that most Americans (61 percent) favored a Canadian-type health system, in which the government was the single payer to doctors and hospitals, bypassing the insurance companies, and offering universal medical coverage to everyone. Neither the Democratic nor the Republican party adopted that as its program, although both insisted they wanted to \"reform\" the health system\n\nA survey by the Gordon Black Corporation for the National Press Club in 1992 found that 59 percent of all voters wanted a 50 percent cut in defense spending in five years. Neither of the major parties was willing to make major cuts in the military budget\n\nHow the public felt about government aid to the poor seemed to depend on how the question was put. Both parties, and the media, talked incessantly about the \"welfare\" system, that it was not working, and the word \"welfare\" became a signal for opposition. When people were asked (a New York Times/CBS News poll of 1992) if more money should he allocated to welfare, 23 percent said no. But when the same people were asked, should the government help the poor, 64 percent said yes\n\nThis was a recurring theme. When, at the height of the Reagan presidency, in 1987, people were asked if the government should guarantee food and shelter to needy people, 62 percent answered yes\n\nClearly, there was something amiss with a political system, supposed to be democratic, in which the desires of the voters were repeatedly ignored. They could be ignored with impunity so long as the political system was dominated by two parties, both tied to corporate wealth. An electorate forced to choose between Carter and Reagan, or Reagan and Mondale, or Bush and Dukakis could only despair (or decide not to vote) because neither candidate was capable of dealing with a fundamental economic illness whose roots were deeper than any single presidency\n\nThat illness came from a fact which was almost never talked about: that the United States was a class society, in which I percent of the population owned 33 percent of the wealth, with an underclass of 30 to 40 million people living in poverty. The social programs of the sixties- Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps, etc.-did not do much more than maintain the historic American maldistribution of resources\n\nWhile the Democrats would give more help to the poor than the Republicans, they were not capable (indeed, not really desirous) of seriously tampering with an economic system in which corporate profit comes before human need\n\nThere was no important national movement for radical change, no social democratic (or democratic socialist) party such as existed in countries in Western Europe, Canada, and New Zealand. But there were a thousand signs of alienation, voices of protest, local actions in every part of the country to call attention to deep-felt grievances, to demand that some injustice be remedied\n\nFor instance, the Citizens' Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes in Washington, D.C., which had been formed early in the Reagan administration by housewife and activist Lois Gibbs, reported that it was giving help to 8000 local groups around the country. One of these groups, in Oregon, brought a series of successful lawsuits to force the Environmental Protection Agency to do something about unsafe drinking water in the Bull Run reservoir near Portland\n\nIn Seabrook, New Hampshire, there were years of persistent protest against a nuclear power plant which residents considered a danger to themselves and their families. Between 1977 and 1989, over 3500 people were arrested in these protests. Ultimately, the plant, plagued by financial problems and opposition, had to shut down\n\nFear of nuclear accidents was intensified by disastrous events at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 and by an especially frightening calamity in Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in 1986. All of this was having an effect on the once-booming nuclear industry. By 1994, the Tennessee Valley Authority had stopped the construction of three nuclear plants, which the New York Time called \"the symbolic death notice for the current generation of reactors in the United States.\"\n\nIn Minneapolis, Minnesota, thousands of people demonstrated year after year against the Honeywell Corporation's military contracts, and between 1982 and 1988 over 1800 people were arrested\n\nFurthermore, when those who engaged in such civil disobedience were brought into court, they often found sympathetic support from juries, winning acquittals from ordinary citizens who seemed to understand that even if they had technically broken the law, they had done so in a good cause\n\nIn 1984, a group of Vermont citizens (the \"Winooski Forty-four\") refused to leave the hallway outside a U.S. Senator's office, protesting his votes to give arms to the Nicaraguan contras. They were arrested, but at their trial they were treated sympathetically by the judge and acquitted by the jury\n\nAt another trial shortly after, a number of people (including activist Abbie Hoffman and Amy Carter, daughter of former President Jimmy Carter) were charged with blocking CIA recruiters at the University of Massachusetts. They called to the witness stand ex-CIA agents who told the jury that the CIA had engaged in illegal and murderous activities all around the world. The jury acquitted them\n\nOne juror, a woman hospital worker, said later: \"I was not familiar with the CIA's activities.... I was shocked.... I was kind of proud of the students.\" Another juror said: \"It was very educational.\" The county district attorney, prosecuting the case, concluded: \"If there is a message, it was that this jury was composed of middle America.. .. Middle America doesn't want the CIA doing what they are doing.\"\n\nIn the South, while there was no great movement comparable to the civil rights movement of the Sixties, there were hundreds of local groups organizing poor people, white and black. In North Carolina, Linda Stout, the daughter of a mill worker who had died of industrial poisons, coordinated a multiracial network of 500 textile workers, farmers, maids\u2014most of them low-income women of color\u2014in the Piedmont Peace Project\n\nThe historic Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, which had nurtured so many black and white activists throughout the South, was now joined by other folk schools and popular education centers\n\nAnne Braden, a veteran of racial and labor struggles in the South, was still organizing, leading the Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice. The group gave help in local actions: to 300 African-Americans in Tift County, Georgia, who were protesting the existence of a chemical plant which was making them sick; to Native Americans in Cherokee County, North Carolina, who were organizing to stop a polluted landfill\n\nBack in the sixties, Chicane farm workers, people of Mexican descent who came to work and live mostly in California and the Southwestern states, rebelled against their feudal working conditions. They went out on strike and organized a national boycott of grapes, under the leadership of Cesar Chavez. Soon farmworkers were organizing in other parts of the country\n\nIn the seventies and eighties, their struggles against poverty and discrimination continued. The Reagan years hit them hard, as it did poor people all over the country. By 1984, 42 percent of all Latino children and one-fourth of the families lived below the poverty line\n\nCopper miners in Arizona, mostly Mexican, went on strike against the Phelps-Dodge company after it cut wages, benefits, and safety measures in 1983. They were attacked by National Guardsmen and state troopers, by tear gas and helicopters, but held out for three years until a combination of governmental and corporate power finally defeated them\n\nThere were victories too. In 1985, 1700 cannery workers, most of them Mexican women, went on strike in Watsonville, California, and won a union contract with medical benefits. In 1990 workers who had been laid off from the Levi Strauss company in San Antonio because the company was moving to Costa Rica called a boycott, organized a hunger strike, and won concessions. In Los Angeles, Latino janitors went on strike in 1990 and despite police attacks, won recognition of their union, a pay raise, and sick benefits\n\nLatino and Latina activists (not necessarily Chicano, which refers to those of Mexican ancestry), through the eighties and early nineties, campaigned for better labor conditions, for representation in local government, for tenants' rights, for bilingual education in the schools. Kept out of the media, they organized a bilingual radio movement, and by 1991 had fourteen Latino stations in the country, twelve of them bilingual\n\nIn New Mexico, Latinos fought for land and water rights against real estate developers who tried to throw them off land they had lived on for decades. In 1988 there was a confrontation, and the people organized an armed occupation, built bunkers for protection against attack, and won support from other communities in the Southwest; finally, a court ruled in their favor\n\nAbnormal rates of cancer for farmworkers in California aroused the Chicano community. Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers fasted for thirty-five days in 1988 to call attention to these conditions. There were now United Farm Workers unions in Texas, Arizona, and other states\n\nThe importation of Mexican workers for low wages, under terrible conditions, spread from the Southwest to other parts of the country. By 1991, 80,000 Latinos lived in North Carolina, 30,000 in north Georgia. The Farm Labor Organizing Committee, which had won a difficult strike in the Ohio tomato fields in 1979, the largest agricultural strike ever in the Midwest, brought thousands of farmworkers together in several Midwest states\n\nAs the Latino population of the country kept growing, it soon matched the 12 percent of the population that was African-American and began to have a distinct effect on American culture. Much of its music, art, and drama was much more consciously political and satirical than mainstream culture\n\nThe Border Arts workshop was formed in 1984 by artists and writers in San Diego and Tijuana, and its work dealt powerfully with issues of racism and injustice. In Northern California, Teatro Campesino and Teatro de la Esperanza performed for working people all over the country, turning schoolhouses, churches, and fields into theaters\n\nLatinos were especially conscious of the imperial role the United States had played in Mexico and the Caribbean, and many of them became militant critics of U.S. policy toward Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Cuba. In 1970 a great march in Los Angeles against the Vietnam war, which had been attacked by police, left three Chicanos dead\n\nWhen the Bush administration was preparing for war against Iraq in the summer of 1990, thousands of people in Los Angeles marched along the same route they had taken twenty years before, when they were protesting the Vietnam war. As Elizabeth Martinez wrote (500 Years of Chicano History in Pictures):\n\nBefore and during President Bush's war in the Persian Gulf many people- including Raza [literally \"race\"; a term adopted by Latino activists]-had doubts about it or were opposed. We had learned some lessons about wars started in the name of democracy that turned out to benefit only the rich and powerful. Raza mobilized to protest this war of mass murder, even faster than the U.S. war in Vietnam, though we could not stop it\n\nIn 1992, a fund-raising group which came out of the Vietnam war called Resist made donations to 168 organizations around the country- community groups, peace groups, Native American groups, prisoners' rights organizations, health and environmental groups\n\nA new generation of lawyers, schooled in the sixties, constituted a small but socially conscious minority within the legal profession. They were in court defending the poor and the helpless, or bringing suit against powerful corporations. One law firm used its talent and energy to defend whistleblowers\u2014men and women who were fired because they \"blew the whistle\" on corporate corruption that victimized the public\n\nThe women's movement, which had managed to raise the consciousness of the whole nation on the issue of sexual equality, faced a powerful backlash in the eighties. The Supreme Court's defense of abortion rights in its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision aroused a pro-life movement that had strong supporters in Washington. Congress passed, and the Supreme Court later let stand, a law that eliminated federal medical benefits to help poor women pay for abortions. But the National Organization of Women and other groups remained strong; in 1989, a Washington rally for what had come to be known as the right to choose drew over 300,000 people. When, in 1994 and 1995, abortion clinics were attacked and several supporters murdered, the conflict became grimly intense\n\nThe rights of gay and lesbian Americans had come vividly to the forefront in the Seventies with radical changes in ideas about sexuality and freedom. The gay movement then became a visible presence in the nation, with parades, demonstrations, campaigns for the elimination of state statutes discriminating against homosexuals. One result was a growing literature about the hidden history of gay life in the United States and in Europe\n\nIn 1994, there was a Stonewall 25 march in Manhattan, which commemorated an event homosexuals regarded as a turning point: twenty-five years earlier, gay men fought back vigorously against a police raid on the Stonewall bar in Greenwich Village. In the early nineties, gay and lesbian groups campaigned more openly, more determinedly, against discrimination, and for more attention to the scourge of AIDS, which they claimed was being given only marginal attention by the national government\n\nIn Rochester, New York, a local campaign achieved an unprecedented decision barring military recruiters from a school district because of the Defense Department discrimination against gay soldiers\n\nThe labor movement in the eighties and nineties was considerably weakened by the decline of manufacturing, by the flight of factories to other countries, by the hostility of the Reagan administration and its appointees on the National Labor Relations Board. Yet organizing continued, especially among white collar workers and low-income people of color. The AFL-CIO put on hundreds of new organizers to work among Latinos, African-Americans, and Asian-Americans\n\nRank-and-file workers in old, stagnant unions began to rebel. In 1991, the notoriously corrupt leadership of the powerful Teamsters Union was voted out of office by a reform slate. The new leadership immediately became a force in Washington, and took the lead in working for independent political coalitions outside the two major parties. But the labor movement as a whole, much diminished, was struggling for survival\n\nAgainst the overwhelming power of corporate wealth and governmental authority, the spirit of resistance was kept alive in the early nineties, often by small-scale acts of courage and defiance. On the West Coast, a young activist named Keith McHenry and hundreds of others were arrested again and again for distributing free food to poor people without a license. They were part of a program called Food Not Bombs. More Food Not Bombs groups sprang up in communities around the country\n\nIn 1992, a New York group interested in revising traditional ideas about American history received approval from the New York City Council to put up thirty metal plaques high on lampposts around the city. One of them, placed opposite the Morgan corporate headquarters, identified the famous banker J.P. Morgan as a Civil War \"draft dodger.\" In fact, Morgan had avoided the draft and profited in business deals with the government during the war. Another plaque, placed near the Stock Exchange, portrayed a suicide and carried the label \"Advantage of an Unregulated Free Market.\"\n\nThe general disillusionment with government during the Vietnam years and the Watergate scandals, the exposure of anti-democratic actions by the FBI and the CIA, led to resignations from government and open criticism by former employees\n\nA number of former CIA officials left the agency, and wrote books critical of its activities. John Stockwell, who had headed the CIA operation in Angola, resigned, wrote a hook exposing the CIA's activities, and lectured all over the country about his experiences. David MacMichael, a historian and former CIA specialist, testified at trials on behalf of people who had protested government policy in Central America\n\nFBI Agent Jack Ryan, a twenty-one-year veteran of the bureau, was fired when he refused to investigate peace groups. He was deprived of his pension and for some time had to live in a shelter for homeless people\n\nSometimes the war in Vietnam, which had ended in 1975, came back to public attention in the eighties and nineties through people who had been involved in the conflicts of that day. Some of them had since made dramatic turnabouts in their thinking. John Wall, who prosecuted Dr. Benjamin Spock and four others in Boston for \"conspiring\" to obstruct the draft, showed up at a dinner honoring the defendants in 1994, saying the trial had changed his ideas\n\nEven more striking was the statement by Charles Hutto, a U.S. soldier who had participated in the atrocity known as the My Lai massacre, in which a company of American soldiers shot to death women and children by the hundreds in a tiny Vietnamese village. Interviewed in the eighties, Hutto told a reporter:\n\nI was nineteen years old, and I'd always been told to do what the grown-ups told me to do. , . . But now I'll tell my sons, if the government calls, to go, to serve their country, but to use their own judgment at times ... to forget about authority ... to use their own conscience. I wish somebody had told me that before I went to Vietnam. I didn't know. Now I don't think there should be even a thing called war ... cause it messes up a person's mind\n\nIt was this legacy of the Vietnam war-the feeling among a great majority of Americans that it was a terrible tragedy, a war that should not have been fought-that plagued the Reagan and Bush administrations, which still hoped to extend American power around the world\n\nIn 1985, when George Bush was Vice-President, former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger had warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \"Vietnam brought a sea change in domestic attitudes ... a breakdown in the political consensus behind foreign policy. . ..\"\n\nWhen Bush became President, he was determined to overcome what came to be called the Vietnam syndrome-the resistance of the American people to a war desired by the Establishment. And so, he launched the air war against Iraq in mid-January 1991 with overwhelming force, so the war could be over quickly, before there was time for a national antiwar movement to develop\n\nThe signs of a possible movement were there in the months of the prewar buildup. On Halloween, 600 students marched through downtown Missoula, Montana, shouting \"Hell no, we won't go!\" In Shreveport, Louisiana, despite the Shreveport Journal's front-page headline: \"Poll Favors Military Action,\" the story was that 42 percent of the respondents thought the U.S. should \"initiate force\" and 41 percent said \"wait and see.\"\n\nThe November 11, 1990, Veterans Parade in Boston was joined by a group called Veterans for Peace, carrying signs: \"No More Vietnams. Bring 'Em Home Now\" and \"Oil and Blood Do Not Mix, Wage Peace.\" The Boston Globe reported that \"the protesters were greeted with respectful applause and, at some places, strong demonstrations of support by onlookers.\" One of those onlookers, a woman named Mary Belle Dressier, said: \"Personally, parades that honor the military are somewhat troublesome to me because the military is about war, and war is troublesome to me.\"\n\nMost Vietnam veterans were supporting military action, but there was a strong dissident minority. In one survey that showed 53 percent of the veterans polled saying they would gladly serve in the Gulf War, 37 percent said they would not\n\nPerhaps the most famous Vietnam veteran, Ron Kovic, author of Born on the Fourth of July, made a thirty-second television speech as Bush moved toward war. In the appeal, broadcast on 200 television stations in 120 cities across the country, he asked all citizens to \"stand up and speak out\" against war. \"How many more Americans coming home in wheelchairs\u2014like me\u2014will it take before we learn?\"\n\nThat November of 1990, several months into the Kuwait crisis, college students in St. Paul, Minnesota, demonstrated against war. The local press reported:\n\nIt was a full-blown antiwar demonstration with mothers pushing kids in strollers, college professors and grade school teachers carrying signs, peace activists bedecked in peace symbols, and hundreds of students from a dozen schools singing, beating drums and chanting, \"Hey, hey, ho ho, we won't fight for Amoco.\"\n\nTen days before the bombing began, at a town meeting in Boulder, Colorado, with 800 people present, the question was put: \"Do you support Bush's policy for war?\" Only four people raised their hands. A few days before the war began, 4100 people in Santa Fe, New Mexico, blocked a four-lane highway for an hour, asking that there be no war. Residents said this was larger than any demonstration in the Vietnam era\n\nOn the eve of war, 6000 people marched through Ann Arbor, Michigan, to ask for peace. On the night the war began, 5000 people gathered in San Francisco to denounce the war and formed a human chain around the Federal Building. Police broke the chain by swinging their clubs at the hands of the protesters. But the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution declaring the city and county a sanctuary for those who for \"moral, ethical or religious reasons cannot participate in war.\"\n\nThe night before Bush gave the order to launch the bombing, a seven-year-old girl in Lexington, Massachusetts, told her mother she wanted to write a letter to the President. Her mother suggested it was late and she should write the next day. \"No, tonight,\" the girl said. She was still learning to write, so she dictated a letter:\n\nDear President Bush. I don't like the way you are behaving. If you would make up your mind there won't be a war we won't have to have peace vigils. If you were in a war you wouldn't want to get hurt. What I'm saying is: I don't want any fighting to happen. Sincerely yours, Serena Kabat\n\nAfter the bombing of Iraq began along with the bombardment of public opinion, the polls showed overwhelming support for Bush's action, and this continued through the six weeks of the war. But was it an accurate reflection of the citizenry's long-term feelings about war? The split vote in the polls just before the war reflected a public still thinking its opinion might have an effect. Once the war was on, and clearly irreversible, in an atmosphere charged with patriotic fervor (the president of the United Church of Christ spoke of \"the steady drumbeat of war messages\"), it was not surprising that a great majority of the country would declare its support\n\nNevertheless, even with little time to organize, and with the war over very fast, there was an opposition-a minority for sure, but a determined one, and with the potential to grow. Compared to the first months of the military escalation in Vietnam, the movement against the Gulf War expanded with extraordinary speed and vigor\n\nThat first week of the war, while it was clear most Americans were supporting Bush's action, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest, in towns and cities all over the country. In Athens, Ohio, over 100 people were arrested, as they clashed with a prowar group. In Portland, Maine, 500 marched wearing white arm bands or carrying white paper crosses with one word, \"Why?,\" written in red\n\nAt the University of Georgia, 70 students opposed to the war held an all-night vigil, and in the Georgia Legislature, Representative Cynthia McKinnon made a speech attacking the bombing of Iraq, leading many of the other legislators to walk off the floor. She held her ground, and it seemed that there had been at least some change In thinking since Representative Julian Bond was expelled from the very same legislature for criticizing the war in Vietnam during the 1960s. At a junior high school in Newton, Massachusetts, 350 students marched to city hall to present a petition to the mayor declaring their opposition to the war in the Gulf. Clearly, many were trying to reconcile their feelings about war with their sympathy for soldiers sent to the Middle East. A student leader, Carly Baker, said: \"We don't think bloodshed is the right way. We are supporting the troops and are proud of them, but we don't want war.\"\n\nIn Ada, Oklahoma, while East Central Oklahoma State University was \"adopting\" two National Guard units, two young women sat quietly on top of the concrete entrance gate with signs that read \"Teach Peace ... Not War.\" One of them, Patricia Biggs, said: \"I don't think we should be over there. I don't think it's about justice and liberty, I think it's about economics. The big oil corporations have a lot to do with what is going on over there. . . . We are risking people's lives for money.\"\n\nFour days after the United States launched its air attack, 75,000 people (the estimate of the Capitol Police) marched in Washington, rallying near the White House to denounce the war. In Southern California, Ron Kovic addressed 6000 people who chanted \"Peace Now!\" In Fayetteville, Arkansas, a group supporting military policy was confronted by the Northwest Arkansas Citizens Against War, who marched carrying a flag-draped coffin and a banner that read \"Bring Them Home Alive.\"\n\nAnother disabled Vietnam veteran, a professor of history and political science at York College in Pennsylvania named Philip Avillo, wrote in a local newspaper: \"Yes, we need to support our men and women under arms. But let's support them by bringing them home; not by condoning this barbarous, violent policy.\" In Salt Lake City, hundreds of demonstrators, many with children, marched through the city's main streets chanting antiwar slogans\n\nIn Vermont, which had just elected Socialist Bernie Sanders to Congress, over 2000 demonstrators disrupted a speech by the governor at the state house, and in Burlington, Vermont's largest city, 300 protesters walked through the downtown area, asking shop owners to close their doors in solidarity\n\nOn January 26, nine days after the beginning of the war, over 150,000 people marched through the streets of Washington, D.C., and listened to speakers denounce the war, including the movie stars Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. A woman from Oakland, California, held up the folded American flag that was given to her when her husband was killed in Vietnam, saying, \"I learned the hard way there is no glory in a folded flag.\"\n\nLabor unions had supported the war in Vietnam for the most part, but after the bombing started in the Gulf, eleven affiliates of the AFL-CIO, including some of its more powerful unions\u2014like steel, auto, communications, chemical workers\u2014spoke out against the war\n\nThe black community was far less enthusiastic than the rest of the country about what the U.S. Air Force was doing to Iraq. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in early February, 1991, found that support for the war was 84 percent among whites, but only 48 percent among African-Americans\n\nWhen the war had been going on for a month, with Iraq devastated by the incessant bombing, there were feelers from Saddam Hussein that Iraq would withdraw from Kuwait if the United States would stop its attacks. Bush rejected the idea, and a meeting of black leaders in New York sharply criticized him, calling the war \"an immoral and unspiritual diversion ... a blatant evasion of our domestic responsibilities.\"\n\nIn Selma, Alabama, which had been the scene of bloody police violence against civil rights marchers twenty-six years before, a meeting to observe the anniversary of that \"bloody Sunday\" demanded that \"our troops be brought home alive to fight for justice at home.\"\n\nThe father of a twenty-one-year-old Marine in the Persian Gulf, Alex Molnar, wrote an angry open letter, published in the New York Time, to President Bush:\n\nWhere were you, Mr. President, when Iraq was killing its own people with poison gas? Why, until the recent crisis, was it business as usual with Saddam Hussein, the man you now call a Hitler? Is the American \"way of life\" that you say my son is risking his life for the continued \"right\" of Americans to consume 25 to 30 percent of the world's oil? ... I intend to support my son and his fellow soldiers by doing everything I can to oppose any offensive American military action in the Persian Gulf\n\nThere were courageous individual acts by citizens, speaking out in spite of threats\n\nPeg Mullen, of Brownsville, Texas, whose son had been killed by \"friendly fire\" in Vietnam, organized a busload of mothers to protest in Washington, in spite of a warning that her house would be burned down if she persisted\n\nThe actress Margot Kidder (\"Lois Lane\" in the Superman films), despite the risk to her career, spoke out eloquently against the war\n\nA basketball player for Seton Hall University in New Jersey refused to wear the American flag on his uniform, and when he became the object of derision for this, he left the team and the university, and returned to his native Italy\n\nMore tragically, a Vietnam veteran in Los Angeles set fire to himself and died, to protest the war\n\nIn Amherst, Massachusetts, a young man carrying a cardboard peace sign knelt on the town common, poured two cans of flammable fluid on himself, struck two matches, and died in the flames. Two hours later, students from nearby universities gathered on the common for a candlelight vigil, and placed peace signs at the site of death. One of the signs read, \"Stop this crazy war.\"\n\nThere was no time, as there had been during the Vietnam conflict, for a large antiwar movement to develop in the military. But there were men and women who defied their commanders and refused to participate in the war\n\nWhen the first contingents of U.S. troops were being sent to Saudi Arabia, in August of 1990, Corporal Jeff Patterson, a twenty-two-year-old Marine stationed in Hawaii, sat down on the runway of the airfield and refused to board a plane bound for Saudi Arabia. He asked to be discharged from the Marine Corps:\n\nI have come to believe that there are no justified wars.... I began to question exactly what I was doing in the Marine Corps about the time I began to read about history. I began to read up on America's support for the murderous regimes of Guatemala, Iran under the Shah, and El Salvador.... I object to the military use of force against any people, anywhere, any time\n\nFourteen Marine Corps reservists at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, filed for conscientious objector status, despite the prospect of a court-martial for desertion. A lance corporal in the Marines, Erik Larsen, issued a statement:\n\nI declare myself a conscientious objector. Here is my sea bag full of personal gear. Here is my gas mask. I no longer need them. I am no longer a Marine. ... It, to me, is embarrassing to fight for a way of life in which basic human needs, like a place to sleep, one hot meal a day and some medical attention, cannot even be met in our nation's capital\n\nCorporal Yolanda Huet-Vaughn, a physician who was a captain in the Army Reserve Medical Corps, a mother of three young children, and a member of the Physicians for Social Responsibility, was called to active duty in December 1990, a month before the start of the war. She replied: \"I am refusing orders to be an accomplice in what I consider an immoral, inhumane and unconstitutional act, namely an offensive military mobilization in the Middle East.\" She was court-martialed, convicted of desertion, and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison\n\nAnother soldier, Stephanie Atkinson of Murphysboro, Illinois, refused to report for active duty, saying she thought the U.S. military was in the Persian Gulf solely for economic reasons. She was first placed under house arrest, then given a discharge under \"other than honorable conditions.\"\n\nAn Army physician named Harlow Ballard, stationed at Fort Devens in Massachusetts, refused to follow an order to go to Saudi Arabia. \"I would rather go to jail than support this war,\" he said. \"I don't believe there is any such thing as a just war.\"\n\nOver a thousand reservists declared themselves conscientious objectors. A twenty-three-year-old Marine Corps reservist named Rob Calabro was one of them. \"My father tells me that he's ashamed of me, he screams at me that he's embarrassed by me. But I believe that killing people is morally wrong. I believe I'm serving my country more by being true to my conscience than by living a lie.\"\n\nAn information network sprang up during the Gulf War to tell what was not being told in the major media. There were alternative newspapers in many cities. There were over a hundred community radio stations, able to reach only a fraction of those tuned in to the major networks but the only sources, during the Gulf War, of critical analyses of the war. An ingenious radio person in Boulder, Colorado, named David Barsamian recorded a speech by Noam Chomsky made at Harvard-a devastating critique of the war. He then sent the cassette out to his network of community stations, which were eager for a point of view different from the official one. Two young men in New Jersey then transcribed the talk, put it in pamphlet form, in a shape easily photocopied, and placed the pamphlets in bookstores all over the country\n\nAfter \"victorious\" wars there is almost always a sobering effect, as the war fervor wears off, and citizens assess the costs and wonder what was gained. War fever was at its height in February 1991. In that month, when people being polled were reminded of the huge costs of the war, only 17 percent said the war was not worth it. Four months later, in June, the figure was 30 percent. In the months that followed, Bush's support in the nation dropped steeply, as economic conditions deteriorated. (And in 1992, with the war spirit evaporated, Bush went down to defeat.)\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Soviet bloc began in 1989, there had been talk in the United States of a \"peace dividend,\" the opportunity to take billions of dollars from the military budget and use it for human needs. The war in the Gulf became a convenient excuse for the government determined to stop such talk. A member of the Bush administration said: \"We owe Saddam a favor. He saved us from the peace dividend\" (New York Time, March 2, 1991)\n\nBut the idea of a peace dividend could not be stifled so long as Americans were in need. Shortly after the war, historian Marilyn Young warned:\n\nThe U.S. can destroy Iraq's highways, but not build its own; create the conditions for epidemic in Iraq, but not offer health care to millions of Americans. It can excoriate Iraqi treatment of the Kurdish minority, but not deal with domestic race relations; create homelessness abroad but not solve it here; keep a half million troops drug free as part of a war, but refuse to fund the treatment of millions of drug addicts at home. ... We shall lose the war after we have won it\n\nIn 1992, the limits of military victory became apparent during the quincentennial celebrations of Columbus's arrival in the Western Hemisphere. Five hundred years ago Columbus and his fellow conquerors had wiped out the native population of Hispaniola. This was followed during the next four centuries by the methodical destruction of Indian tribes by the United States government as it marched across the continent. But now, there was a dramatic reaction\n\nThe Indians\u2014the Native Americans\u2014had become a visible force since the sixties and seventies, and in 1992 were joined by other Americans to denounce the quincentennial celebrations. For the first time in all the years that the country had celebrated Columbus Day, there were nationwide protests against honoring a man who had kidnapped, enslaved, mutilated, murdered the natives who greeted his arrival with gifts and friendship\n\nPreparations for the quincentennial began on both sides of the controversy. Official commissions, nationally and in the states, were set up long before the year of the quincentennial\n\nThis spurred action by Native Americans. In the summer of 1990 350 Indians, representatives from all over the hemisphere, met in Quito, Ecuador, at the first intercontinental gathering of indigenous people in the Americas, to mobilize against the glorification of the Columbus conquest\n\nThe following summer, in Davis, California, over a hundred Native Americans gathered for a follow-up meeting to the Quito conference. They declared October 12, 1992, International Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People, and resolved to inform the king of Spain that the replicas of Columbus's three ships, the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria, \"will not receive permission from the Native Nations to land in the western hemisphere unless he apologizes for the original incursion 500 years ago. . ..\"\n\nThe movement grew. The largest ecumenical body in the United States, the National Council of Churches, called on Christians to refrain from celebrating the Columbus quincentennial, saying, \"What represented newness of freedom, hope and opportunity for some was the occasion for oppression, degradation and genocide for others.\"\n\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities funded a traveling exhibition called \"First Encounter,\" which romanticized the Columbus conquest. When the exhibition opened at the Florida Museum of National History, Michelle Diamond, a freshman at the University of Florida, climbed aboard a replica of one of Columbus's ships with a sign reading \"Exhibit Teaches Racism.\" She said: \"It's a human issue\u2014not just a Red [Indian] issue.\" She was arrested and charged with trespassing, but demonstrations continued for sixteen days against the exhibit\n\nA newspaper called Indigenous Thought began publication in early 1991 to create a link among all the counter-Columbus quincentenary activities. It carried articles by Native Americans about current struggles over land stolen by treaty\n\nIn Corpus Christi, Texas, Indians and Chicanos joined to protest the city's celebrations of the quincentennial. A woman named Angelina Mendez spoke for the Chicanos: \"The Chicano nation, in solidarity with our Indian brothers and sisters to the north, come together with them on this day to denounce the atrocity the U.S. government proposes in reenacting the arrival of the Spanish, more specifically the arrival of Cristobal Colon, to the shores of this land.\"\n\nThe Columbus controversy brought an extraordinary burst of educational and cultural activity. A professor at the University of California at San Diego, Deborah Small, put together an exhibit of over 200 paintings on wood panels called \"1492.\" She juxtaposed words from Columbus's diary with blown-up fragments from sixteenth-century engravings to dramatize the horrors that accompanied Columbus's arrival in the hemisphere. A reviewer wrote that \"it does remind us, in the most vivid way, of how the coming of Western-style civilization to the New World doesn't provide us with a sunny tale.\"\n\nWhen President Bush attacked Iraq in 1991, claiming that he was acting to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, a group of Native Americans in Oregon distributed a biting and ironic \"open letter\":\n\nDear President Bush. Please send your assistance in freeing our small nation from occupation. This foreign force occupied our lands to steal our rich resources. They used biological warfare and deceit, killing thousands of elders, children and women in the process. As they overwhelmed our land, they deposed our leaders and people of our own government, and in its place, they installed their own government systems that yet today control our daily lives in many ways. As in your own words, the occupation and overthrow of one small nation ... is one too many. Sincerely, An American Indian\n\nThe publication Rethinking Schools, which represented socially conscious schoolteachers all over the country, printed a 100-page book called Rethinking Columbus, featuring articles by Native Americans and others, a critical review of children's books on Columbus, a listing of resources for people wanting more information on Columbus, and more reading material on counter- quincentenary activities. In a few months, 200,000 copies of the book were sold\n\nA Portland, Oregon, teacher named Bill Bigelow, who helped put together Rethinking Schools, took a year off from his regular job to tour the country in 1992, giving workshops to other teachers, so that they could begin to tell those truths about the Columbus experience that were omitted from the traditional books and class curricula\n\nOne of Bigelow's own students wrote to the publisher Allyn and Bacon with a critique of their history text The American Spirit:\n\nI'll just pick one topic to keep it simple. How about Columbus. No, you didn't lie, but saying, \"Though they had a keen interest in the peoples of the Caribbean, Columbus and his crews were never able to live peacefully among them,\" makes it seem as if Columbus did no wrong. The reason for not being able to live peacefully is that he and crew took slaves and killed thousands of Indians for not bringing enough gold\n\nAnother student wrote: \"It seemed to me as if the publishers had just printed up some 'glory story' that was supposed to make us feel more patriotic about our country. . .. They want us to look at our country as great and powerful and forever right. . . .\"\n\nA student named Rebecca wrote: \"Of course, the writers of the books probably think it's harmless enough-what does it matter who discovered America, really.... But the thought that I have been lied to all my life about this, and who knows what else, really makes me angry.\"\n\nA group was formed on the West Coast called Italian-Americans Against Christopher Columbus, saying: \"When Italian-Americans identify with Native people ... we are bringing ourselves, each of us, closer to possible change in the world.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles, a high school student named Blake Lindsey went before the city council to argue against celebrating the quincentennial. She spoke to the council about the genocide of the Arawaks, but she got no official response. However, when she told her story on a talk show, a woman phoned in who said she was from Haiti: \"The girl is right. We have no Indians left. At our last uprising in Haiti people destroyed the statue of Columbus. Let's have statues for the aborigines.\"\n\nThere were counter-Columbus activities all over the country, unmentioned in the press or on television. In Minnesota alone, a listing of such activities for 1992 reported dozens of workshops, meetings, films, art shows. At Lincoln Center in New York City, on October 12, there was a performance of Leonard Lehrmann's New World: An Opera About What Columbus Did to the Indians. In Baltimore, there was a multimedia show about Columbus. In Boston and then in a national tour, the Underground Railway Theater performed The Christopher Columbus Follies to packed audiences\n\nThe protests, the dozens of new books that were appearing about Indian history, the discussions taking place all over the country, were bringing about an extraordinary transformation in the educational world. For generations, exactly the same story had been told all American schoolchildren about Columbus, a romantic, admiring story. Now, thousands of teachers around the country were beginning to tell that story differently\n\nThis aroused anger among defenders of the old history, who derided what they called a movement for \"political correctness\" and \"multicultural-ism.\" They resented the critical treatment of Western expansion and imperialism, which they considered an attack on Western civilization. Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett, had called Western civilization \"our common culture ... its highest ideas and aspirations.\"\n\nA much-publicized book by a philosopher named Allan Bloom, The Closing of the American Mind, expressed horror at what the social movements of the sixties had done to change the educational atmosphere of American universities. To him Western civilization was the high point of human progress, and the United States its best representative: \"America tells one story: the unbroken, ineluctable progress of freedom and equality. From its first settlers and its political foundings on, there has been no dispute that freedom and equality are the essence of justice for us.\"\n\nIn the seventies and eighties, disabled people organized and created a movement powerful enough to bring about the passage by Congress of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an unprecedented piece of legislation, setting standards which would enable persons with disabilities to contest discrimination against them, and ensuring they would have access to places where their disabilities would otherwise bar them\n\nIn the civil rights movement, black people disputed that claim of America's standing for \"freedom and equality.\" The women's movement had disputed that claim, too. And now, in 1992, Native Americans were pointing to the crimes of Western civilization against their ancestors. They were recalling the communitarian spirit of the Indians Columbus met and conquered, trying to tell the history of those millions of people who were here before Columbus, giving the lie to what a Harvard historian (Perry Miller) had called \"the movement of European culture into the vacant wilderness of America.\"\n\nAs the United States entered the nineties, the political system, whether Democrats or Republicans were in power, remained in the control of those who had great wealth. The main instruments of information were also dominated by corporate wealth. The country was divided, though no mainstream political leader would speak of it, into classes of extreme wealth and extreme poverty, separated by an insecure and jeopardized middle class\n\nYet, there was, unquestionably, though largely unreported, what a worried mainstream journalist had called \"a permanent adversarial culture\" which refused to surrender the possibility of a more equal, more humane society.

Circe) LyricsThe Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.\n\n(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece.

Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)\n\n(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)\n\nLONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.)

Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all!

Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence.

Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.\n\nO'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.\n\nDAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!\n\nBLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.\n\nLENEHAN What about mixed bathing?\n\n(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)\n\nFATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.\n\nMRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!\n\nMOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!\n\nNOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom.

Down with Bloom!\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat.

Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut.

Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill.

He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve.

Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!\n\nBLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!\n\nBELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.\n\nBELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.\n\nLYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.\n\nZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!\n\n(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)\n\nTHE CROWD\n\nCard of the races.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.)

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!\n\n(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements.

Remerciez!\n\nTHE PIANOLA\n\nBest, best of all,\nBaraabum!\n\n\nKITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!\n\n(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.\n\nZOE Yorkshire through and through.

Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding.

She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.)

My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1093325", "artist_names": "Drupi", "full_title": "Vado Via by\u00a0Drupi",

I Were Only a Child Again Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIf I were only a child again\nNo one's ever been, oh, good to me since then\nEverywhere I looked it seemed so color bright\nThere were never such things to me as black and white\nThe idea of just going, letting all come what may\nYesterday to the latest, everything seems quite okay\nRemember when we were part of that precious few\nEverything it seemed was so pure and true\nI guess we were just too young to understand\nThe unselfish cause of death and war and roles of man\n[Chorus]\nOnly, only, only a child\nOnly, only, only a child\nOnly, only, only a child\nOnly a child again, hey, hey\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf I were only a child again\nI would never want to venture life like this again\nPeople of the world hurling sticks and stones\nLike the sore fates of one come up and break my bones\n\n[Chorus]\nOnly, only, only a child\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf I were only a child again\nAnd have the ability to understand\nI'd speak for little people from the date of birth\nAnd ask the grown ups, when will there be peace on earth?\nGrown ups, when will there be peace on earth?\nBrother, when will there be peace on earth?\n\n[Outro]\nOnly, only, only a child\nOnly, only, only a child\nOnly, only, only a child\nOnly a child again, hey, hey\nOnly, only, only a child\nOnly, only, only a childYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

want to run out after you\nBut I don't know what's best\n\nCHORUS\nYou will take good care of me\nI'll be your caretaker\nYou'll be the maker of the peace\nI'll be the peacemaker\nYou will take good care of me\nAnd I'll be your caretaker\nYou'll be the maker of the peace\nI'll be the peacemaker\nVERSE 2\nHours later\nI hear the key in the front door\nWe look each other in the eye\nA timid, sorry

the Roadie and Gertrude the Groupie LyricsNow Roland the roadie was only a toadie who set up the lights and the mikes for the shows\nAnd Gertrude the groupie was a rock and roll fan, who stood by the stage door in the rains and the snows\n\nRoland the roadie met Gertrude the groupie at a rock concert back in Bayonne\nHe tried to seduce, said he'd introduce her to all of the Beatles and Stones\n\nSo Roland the roadie got Gertrude the groupie a seat in the balcony above\nAnd Gertrude the groupie felt grateful and groovy but Roland the roadie felt love\n\nAnd some folks loves ham hocks and some folks loves pork chops and some folks love vegetable soup\nBut Roland the roadie loves Gertrude the groupie, but Gertrude the groupie loves groups\nShe stood up and screamed as the amber spot gleamed on her heroes so skinny and tall\nWith their eyelids so droopy, and Gertrude the groupie and she was in love with them all\n\nRoland the roadie told Gertrude the groupie to wait and he'd be her man\nBut while he dreamed of a rose covered home she was out with the group in the van\n\nHey Gertie, get out here, come on babe, come on out of there....I know you're in there...\nThe whole trailer's moving baby....What about me....Gertie... Oh Gertie\n\nNow Roland the roadie is back on the road, his heart has been broken again\nAnd Gertrude the groupie waits out in the cold for the very next group to come in\n\nAnd some folks loves ham hocks and some folks loves pork chops and some folks loves vegetable soup\nAnd Roland the roadie loves Gertrude the groupie, but Gertrude the groupie loves

believe I get my kicks from being hurt\nInstead of making love feel better, you just make it worse\nYou tell me go, then call me back, and then you set me free\nYou always come back to hurtin' me\n\n[Chorus]\nYou always come back to hurtin' me\nAs sweet and stinging as a honey bee\nI'm never really sorry when you leave\nYou always come back to hurting me\n[Verse 2]\nWanting you, I know I'm throwing good love after bad\nBut I'll admit the worst of you is still the best I've had\nI'm that way, you're that way, and it's maybe meant to be\nYou always come back to hurting me\nYou always come

that?\n[Chorus]\nKids say the darndest things\nHave you ever listened close to the games they play\nOr the little songs they sing?\n\n[Verse 2]\nLast night, as I watched TV\nOne rushed through the door\n\"Mommy, Daddy's telling someone on the phone\n'Don't you call me here no more'\"\n\n[Chorus]\nKids say the darndest things\nHave you ever listened close to the games they play\nOr the little songs they sing?\n\n[Verse 3]\nBet my daddy can whip your daddy\nBut Daddy's never home\nAnd I think Mommy's worried 'bout him\n'Cause she cried all night long\n\n[Chorus]\nKids say the darndest things\nHave you ever listened close to the games they play\nOr the little songs they sing?\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nYou never know what they learn at school\nOr what they're thinking of\nMy

name?\n\n[Verse 1]\nThirty some-odd years ago, a young man came to Memphis\nAskin' 'bout a rose that used to blossom in his world\nPeople never took the time to mind the young man's questions\nUntil one day they heard him ask a little green-eyed girl\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's your mama's name, child? What's your mama's name?\nDoes she ever talk about a place called New Orleans?\nHas she ever mentioned a man named Buford Wilson?\nWhat's your mama's name, child? What's your mama's name?\n[Verse 2]\nTwenty some-odd years ago, a drunk down in Memphis\nLost a month of life and labor to the county jail\nJust because he asked a little green-eyed girl a question\nAnd offered her a nickel's worth of candy if she'd tell\n\n[Verse 3]\nA year and some-odd days ago, an old man died in Memphis\nJust another wayward soul the county had to claim\nInside the old man's ragged coat, they found a faded letter\nIt said, \"You have a daughter and her eyes are Wilson green\"\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's your mama's name, child? What's your mama's name?\nDoes she ever talk about a place called New Orleans?\nHas she ever mentioned a man named Buford Wilson?\nWhat's your mama's name, child? What's your mama's name?\n\n[Outro]\nWhat's your mama's name, child?\nWhat's your mama's name?See Tanya Tucker LiveGet tickets as low as $136You might also likeEmbed"}]
