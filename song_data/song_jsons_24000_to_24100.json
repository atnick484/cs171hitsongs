serious you take it\nCan't offer much more, you've heard it before\nThat narrative for me isn't changin'\nI wanna make you a priority\nI wanna let you know there's more to me\nI wanna have your faith restored in me\nI'll be on my way (After dark)\n\n[Chorus: Drake, Static Major, Ty Dolla $ign, Drake & Static]\nIn the whip solo, no one's gotta know\n(No one's gotta know) after dark\nKnockin' at

get your mind right\nIt's gon' be a long night (Ooh yeah)\nPut your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet\nWe've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet\nYou broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else\nYou like, \"Fuck these niggas,\" rather keep it to yourself\nHe did you wrong, he left you down bad\nNow you can't trust nobody\nYou said, \"Do anything, but just don't lie to me\"\nI said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me\nUmm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost\nAnd when it's after dark anything goes\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as

bandanas\nWhips so nasty, no manners\nI just got head in a Phantom\n[Verse 7: Gucci Mane]\nShe say she don't want a chump, baby want a champ\nShe say money make her cum, Gucci make her damp

women that force me to pick up the pieces?\nWhy do I want an independent woman\nTo feel like she needs me?\u2014I lost my way\n[Chorus]\nI'm searchin' for these words to say to you\nPlease give me time\nCause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you\nOh, please give me time\nCause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now\nRedemption's on your mind when you think about me,

loves you\nAnd I don't want you to see no one else\nI don't want you here with no one else\nI don't wanna do this with no one else\nI used to know you back when you was young\nYour brother brought me through, you saw me\nThat made me think of you so differently\nI miss the feeling of you missing me\nBut you say you're over and done with me\nAw, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAw, yeah, yeah,

let's just forget it\nRelationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision\nGuess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment\nCertain people need to tell me they're proud of me\nThat mean a lot to me\nNot havin' closure, it take a lot out of me\nThis year for Christmas I just want apologies\nSydney gave up on me when I went missin'\nSyn had a baby and treated me different\nErika sued me and opened a business\nWonder if they wish it could've been different\nWonder what they'd do put in my position\nI wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?\nWonder if they're second guessin' their decisions\nI hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving\nTryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough\nUntil enough is enough, and then it's too much\nYou tip the scale when I weigh my options\nWest Palm girls are spoiled rotten\nTiffany on you, you know you poppin'\nI'll kill somebody if they give you problems\nMaster bedroom's where we get it poppin'\nJust ignore all the skeletons in my closet\nI'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit\nSell my secrets and get top dollar\nSell my secrets for a Range Rover\nOpportunity and temptation\nThey would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation\nSell my secrets back to me if I was payin'\nWho's gonna save me when I need savin'?\nSince Take Care, I've been caretakin'\nBut second chances, that ain't how you livin'\nRedemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven\n[Outro]\nYeah\nI know56Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/2461229", "artist_names": "Beyonc\u00e9 (Ft.

some, too\nCrashed my car, I was seventeen\nMy mother in the seat riding next to me\nThe things I\u2019ve learned from a broken mirror\nHow a face can change when a heart knows fear\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFor all the things my eyes have seen\nThe best by far is you\n[Chorus]\nIf I could fly, then I would know\nWhat life looks like from up above and down below\nI\u2019d keep you

punk rock band\nAnd I\u2019ve seen London, and I\u2019ve played Japan\nI\u2019ve been knocked down; I got up again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFor all the places I have been\nI\u2019m no place without you\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I could fly, then I would know\nWhat life looks like from up above and down below\nI\u2019d keep you safe, I\u2019d keep you dry\nDon\u2019t be afraid, Cecilia, I\u2019m the

1]\nWe are not the same, I am too reckless\nI'm not tryna go in that direction\nThese niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'\nAnd they about to call the wrong attention\nAnd I don't got no patience, no more testin'\nI do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'\nXO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with\nNobody stoppin' us, oh, no, we destined\nAnd everybody 'round you is so basic\nI'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist\nI don't drink my liquor wit' a chase in\nThat money is the only thing I'm chasin'\nAnd some dope dimes on some coke lines\nGimme head all night, cum four times\nBaby girl just wanna smoke a pound\nDo an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it\n[Chorus]\nGo tell your friends about it (About it)\nGo tell your friends about it (About it)\nGo tell 'em what you know, what you seen\nHow I roll, how I get it on the low\nGo tell your friends about it (About it)\nGo tell your friends about it\nI'm that nigga with the hair\nSingin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill\n\n[Verse 2]\nLast year I did all the politickin'\nThis year I'ma focus on the vision (The vision)\nI think these hoes deserve another fixin' (Fixin')\nI'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin' (Oh, oh, oh)\nDon't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user\nI'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters\nI'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'\nI'ma spend it all on bitches (On bitches)\nAnd everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'\nPussy on the house, everybody fuckin'\nMan, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute (Been a minute)\nMIA a habit, Cali was the mission\nCruise through the west-end in my new Benz (Ooh, woah)\nI'm just tryna live life through a new lens\nDrivin' by the streets I used to walk through\nWhen I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle\nSee The Weeknd LiveGet tickets as low as $106You might also like[Chorus]\nGo tell your friends about it (About it)\nGo tell your friends about it (About it)\nGo

"\u200bcoffee Lyrics[Intro]\nI wish I could paint our love\nThese moments in vibrant hues\nWordplay, turns into gun play\nAnd gun play turns into pillow talk\nAnd pillow talk turns into sweet dreams\nSweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning\n\n[Verse 1]\nWe talk street art and sarcasm\nCrass humor and high fashion\nPeach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens\nAs we laugh over shotguns and tongue kisses\nBubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather\nA cold flame, the thrill of no shame\nDrugs, sex, and polaroids\nPick a star in the sky\nWe could both say goodbye all night\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI wish I could paint our love\nThese moments and vibrant hues\nWordplay, turns into gun play\nAnd gun play turns into pillow talk\nAnd pillow talk turns into sweet dreams\nSweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning\n\n[Chorus]\nCoffee in the morning\nI don't wanna wake you\nI just wanna watch you sleep\nIt's the smell of your hair\nAnd it's the way that we feel\nI've never felt comfortable like this\n\n[Verse 2: Miguel]\nOld souls we found a new religion\nNow I'm swimming in that sin, baptism\nPeach colored skies we feel the sunrise\nTwo lost angels discover salvation\nDon't you wish we could run away now?\nYes, let's\nDrugs, sex, and polaroids\nPick a star in the sky\nWe could both say goodbye all night\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI wish I could paint our love\nThese moments and vibrant hues\nWordplay, turns into gun play\nAnd gun play turns into pillow talk\nAnd pillow talk turns into sweet dreams\nSweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning\n\n[Chorus]\nCoffee in the morning\nI don't wanna wake you\nI just wanna watch you sleep\nIt's the smell of your hair\nAnd it's the way that we feel\nI've never felt comfortable like this\n\n[Partial Pre-Chorus]\nWordplay, turns into gun play (Yeah baby, when we face the sun)\nAnd gun play turns into pillow talk (You'll know for sure)\nAnd pillow talk turns into sweet dreams (That I'm all yours)\nSweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning (All yours darling)\n\n[Chorus]\nCoffee in the morning (Woman, do you know what you've done to me baby?)\nI don't wanna wake you (Stay darling)\nI just wanna watch you sleep (Stay darling, yeah)\nIt's the smell of your hair (No, babe)\nAnd it's the way that we feel (Never know how it feels)\nI've never felt comfortable (Feel like this, woman)\n[Chorus]\nTurns into coffee in the morning (You'll never be the end)\nCoffee in the morning (You'll never be the end of me)\nI don't wanna wake you (You'll never be the end of me, darling)\nI just wanna watch you sleep (Yeah baby, be the end of me, baby)\nIt's the smell of your hair (No, babe)\nAnd it's the way that we feel (Never felt like this, woman)\nI've never felt comfortable like this (Feel like this, darling, no)\n\n[Outro: Miguel]\nAll right, old souls we found a new religion\nNow I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism\nPick a star in the sky\nWe could both say goodbye\nOld souls we found a new religion\nNow I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism\nTwo lost angels discover salvation\nUnder glass pink skies watching the sunlight\n(Fucking in the morning)\nPick a star in the sky\nWe could both say goodbye\n(Fucking in the morning)\nPick a star in the sky\nWe could both say goodbye\n(Fucking in the morning)\nOld souls we found a new

alone\nAnd we gon' ride on forever\nWe ride out together\nPull up right in your zone\nTake over the street, that's how we roll\nAnd we gon' ride on forever (Yeah)\nWe ride out together\n[Verse 1: Tyga]\nFancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway\nCash in the driver door, spend it, do it my way\nI fight you like a matador, fresh out the catalog\nOne fall we all fall, crew like dominoes\nPaper chase, vamanos, all my dogs riding smoke\nMob heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold\nWe are not alone, bo-boy, better check your tone\nYou gone need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans\nSit with us, table last supper\nToast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers\nYeah, ain't nothin' but pure luxury\nYou lookin' left to me, should be looking up to me\nPreferably one of the best\nShe ridin' cause we next now and forever to death\nBe loyal, real, and respect, stay ahead of the rest\nWe just sit back, relax, doin' things to impress\n\n[Chorus: Kid Ink]\nIt's the only way we know to go\nSquad up, never roll alone\nAnd we gon' ride on forever\nWe ride out together\nPull up right in your zone\nTake over the street, that's how we roll\nAnd we gon' ride on forever\nWe ride out

can do this with my eyes closed\nBlindfold two times over\nRide solo, I got women and got soldiers\nI ain't trippin', you try to get it your night's over\nTalkin' on Melatonin, get it and fight coma\nWhat's a flea to a giant, niggas feedin' the fire\nHistory, niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'\nYou don't believe it? Then try it\nWe don't believe in just tryin'\nI call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided\nThat's cold-blooded\nAnd I've been this dope for like four summers\nAnd I ain't really going for the he say, or she say\nKeep it G for Pete's sake\nI know this shit that bone you pick\nMight leave you niggas fillets\n\n[Chorus: Kid Ink]\nIt's the only way we know to go\nSquad up, never roll alone\nAnd we gon' ride on forever\nWe ride out together\nPull up right in your zone\nTake over the street, that's how we roll\nAnd we gon' ride on forever\nWe ride out together\n[Verse 3: YG]\nIt's YG 4hunnid!\nIs you ridin'?\nIs you with all the burglarizing and the violence\nIf Jimmy got caught up, but you was right there with him\nSo the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet?\nIs you loyal, is you real, is you fake?\nWhen I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate (That I hate)\nYou got that fake-friend syndrome\nAnd there's no cure so your symptoms is gon' show\nYou know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold\nLike it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns\nHold up (Hold up), each one teach one\nMotivate each one to be something\nCause I ain't just another statistic\nI do this, this, and that if you wanna get specific\nI'm just tryna make payday come quicker\nFor me and my day one hittas\n\n[Outro: Kid Ink]\nRide out!

won\nWe will be sure, we will be sure\nOh glory\n(Glory, glory) Ohh (Glory, glory)\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nHands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon\nFormed against, yes glory is destined\nEveryday women and men become legends\nSins that go against our skin become blessings\nThe movement is a rhythm to us\nFreedom is like religion to us\nJustice is juxtapositionin' us\nJustice for all just ain't specific enough\nOne son died, his spirit is revisitin' us\nTrue and livin' livin' in us, resistance is us\nThat's why Rosa sat on the bus\nThat's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up\nWhen it go down we woman and man up\nThey say, \"Stay down\", and we stand up\nShots, we on the ground, the camera panned up\nKing pointed to the mountain top and we ran up\n[Chorus]\nOne day when the glory comes\nIt will be ours, it will be ours\nOne day when the war is won\nWe will be sure, we will be sure\nOh glory (glory, glory)\nOhh (glory, glory)\n\n\n[Bridge: John Legend]\nNow the war is not over, victory isn't won\nBut we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done\nWe'll cry glory (glory), oh glory (glory), oh (glory, glory)\nWe'll cry glory, oh glory, oh (glory, glory)\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nSelma is now for every man, woman, and child\nEven Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd\nThey marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now\nNever look back, we done gone hundreds of miles\nFrom dark roads he rose, to become a hero\nFacin' the league of justice, his power was the people\nEnemy is lethal, a king became regal\nSaw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle\nThe biggest weapon is to stay peaceful\nWe sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through\nSomewhere in the dream we had an epiphany\nNow we right the wrongs in history\nNo one can win the war individually\nIt takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy\nWelcome to the story we call victory\nThe comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nOne day when the glory comes\nIt will be ours, it will be ours\nOne day when the war is won\nWe will be sure, we will be sure\nOh glory\n(Glory, glory)\nOh (glory, glory)\nOh glory\n(Glory, glory)\nYeah (glory, glory)\n\n[Outro: John Legend]\nWhen the war is won, when it's all said and done\nWe'll cry glory, oh glory (glory, glory)121Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 12, "api_path":

My Name Is\u201d dropped\nStarted thinking my name was Fault\n\u2018Cause any time things went wrong\nI was the one who they would blame it on\nThe media made me the equivalent\nOf a modern-day Genghis Khan\nTried to argue it was only entertainment, dog\nGangster? Nah, courageous balls\nHad to change my style, they said I'm way too soft\nAnd I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws\nAnd the fangs been out since then\nBut up until the instant that I went against it\nIt was ingrained in me\nThat I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought\nNo wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught\n\"Do I really belong in this game?\", I pondered\nI just wanna play my part\nShould I make waves or not?\nSo back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on\nAnd I don't wanna seem ungrateful\nOr disrespect the art form I was raised upon\nBut sometimes you gotta take a loss\nAnd have people rub it in your face\nBefore you get made pissed off\nAnd keep plugging, it's your only outlet\nAnd your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it\nBetter find a way to counter it quick and make it\u2026 ah\nFeel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times\nHow many times can I say the same thing\nDifferent ways that rhyme?\nWhat I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt\nWhen I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to\u2014\n[Pre-Chorus: Sia, Eminem]\nI was a, afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found (My dreams)\nI didn't wanna go another round (Yeah)\nAn angry man's power will shut you up (Agh!)\nTrip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Sia]\nGuts over fear (The time is near)\nGuts over fear (Might shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me round\nI let you keep me down (Now I got)\nGuts over fear, guts over fear\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nFeels like a close, it's coming to\nFuck am I gonna do?\nIt's too late to start over\nThis is the only thing I, thing I know\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI know what it was like, I was there once\nSingle parents, hate your appearance\nAs you struggle to find your place in this world\nAnd the pain spawns all the anger on\nBut it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song\nLearned who to aim it on that I made a spark\nStarted to spit harder shit\nLearned how to harness it while the reins were off\nAnd there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part\nWas soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck\nHaters started to appreciate my art\nAnd it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused\nBut what am I gonna do when the rage is gone\nAnd the lights go out in that trailer park? Oh\nAnd the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen\n\u2018Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from\nJust a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun\nSo, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song\nBut I'd rather make \u201cNot Afraid 2\u201d\nThan make another motherfucking \u201cWe Made You,\u201d ah\nNow, I don't wanna seem indulgent\nWhen I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just open enough eyes later on\nAnd gave you the supplies and the tools\nTo hopefully use that'll make you strong\nEnough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt\n\u2018Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt\nJust having to balance my dang self\nWhen on eggshells, I was made to walk\nBut thank you, Ma, \u2018cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium\nLeast I made it out of that house\nAnd found a place in this world when the day was done\nSo this is for every kid who all's they ever did\nWas dreamt of one day just getting accepted\nI represent him or her, anyone similar\nYou are the reason that I made this song\nAnd everything you're scared to say\nDon't be afraid to say no more\nFrom this day forward, just let them a-holes talk\nTake it with a grain of salt\u2014and eat their fucking faces off!\nThe legend of the angry blonde\nLives on through you when I\u2019m gone, and to think I was a\u2014\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Sia, Eminem]\nI was a, afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found (My dreams)\nI didn't wanna go another round (Yeah)\nAn angry man's power will shut you up (Agh!)\nTrip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Sia]\nGuts over fear (The time is near)\nGuts over fear (Might shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me round\nI let you keep me down (Now I got)\nGuts over fear, guts over fear1KEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 16, "api_path": "/songs/526923", "artist_names": "Bobby Shmurda", "full_title": "Bobby Bitch by\u00a0Bobby\u00a0Shmurda", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/0dcba7983d9b0d34af196e8a897b141e.300x169x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0dcba7983d9b0d34af196e8a897b141e.1000x563x1.jpg", "id": 526923, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1202741, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1616872056, "path": "/Bobby-shmurda-bobby-bitch-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 268, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Bobby-shmurda-bobby-bitch-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2014, "month": 10, "day": 11}, "release_date_for_display": "October 11, 2014", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Oct. 11, 2014", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3f8f6015c3979952b3f8481a5071347a.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3f8f6015c3979952b3f8481a5071347a.770x770x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 493495}, "title": "Bobby Bitch", "title_with_featured": "Bobby Bitch", "updated_by_human_at": 1661285500, "url": "https://genius.com/Bobby-shmurda-bobby-bitch-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/197731", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1c169dfc68c674225be03816a7caef2f.400x225x50.gif", "id": 197731, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/05630ee64fd0674c24cdd712f5808810.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Bobby Shmurda", "slug": "Bobby-shmurda", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Bobby-shmurda"}, "artist": "Bobby Shmurda", "lyrics": "TranslationsEnglishBobby Bitch Lyrics[Produced By DONDRE]\n\n[Intro]\nBobby, bitch, oh, you ain't know?\nBobby, bitch, Bobby, bitch\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBodies bitch, make that body flip\nYou know I don't know karate, bitch\nWe choppin' bodies, bitch\nThey say shootin' is my hobby, bitch\nAnd I'm a problem, kid\nWalk up on him with revolvers\nI ain't with that talkin' shit, shhh...\n[Chorus]\nBobby, bitch, oh, yeah, I'm Bobby, bitch\nOh, you ain't know?

we're slipping off the course that we prepared\nBut in all chaos, there is calculation\n(Drop-drop-drop-drop) Dropping glasses just to hear them break\nYou've been drinking like the world was gonna end (It didn't)\nTook a shiner from the fist of your best friend (Go figure)\nIt's clear that someone's gotta go\nWe mean it, but I promise we're not mean\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd the cry goes out (Oh)\nThey lose their minds for us\nAnd how it plays out (Oh)\nNow we're in the ring and we're coming for blood\n[Chorus]\n(Oh, oh) You could try and take us\n(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators\n(Oh,

from your head\nSave your life by keeping whispers unsaid\nChildren roam the streets now orphans of war\nBodies hanging in the streets to adore\nRoyal flames will carve the path in chaos\nBringing daylight to the night (Night)\nDeath is riding into town with armor\nThey come to take all your rights\n\n[Chorus]\nHail to the king, hail to the one\nKneel to the crown, stand in the sun\nHail to the king (Hail, hail, hail)\nThe King\n[Verse 2]\nBlood is spilled while holding keys to the throne\nBorn again but it\u2019s too late to atone\nNo mercy from the edge of the blade\nDare escape and learn the price to be paid\nLet the water flow with shades of red now\nArrows black out all the light (Light)\nDeath is riding into town with armor\nThey come to grant you your rights\n\n[Chorus]\nHail to the king, hail to the one\nKneel to the crown, stand in the sun\nHail to the king (Hail, hail, hail)\nThe King\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nThere's a taste of fear (Hail, hail, hail)\nWhen the henchmen call (Hail, hail, hail)\nIron fist to tame them (Hail, hail, hail)\nIron fist to claim it all\n\n[Chorus]\nHail to the king, hail to the one\nKneel to the crown, stand in the sun\nHail to the king,

"Wildfire Lyrics[Verse 1]\nRiver's strong, you can't swim inside it\nWe could string some lights up the hill beside it\nTonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out\nBecause a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about\n\n[Chorus]\nYou look fine, fine, fine\nPut your feet up next to mine\nWe can watch that water line get higher and higher\nSay, say, say\nHasn't it been some kind of day?\nYou and me been catching on like a wildfire\n[Verse 2]\nDon't get up, just to\nGet another, you can\nDrink from mine, we can't\nLeave each other\nWe can dance with the dead\nYou can rest your head on my shoulder\nIf you want to get older with me\nBecause a little bit of summer makes a lot of history\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI got a rock from the river\nIn my medicine bag\nMagpie feather\nIn his medicine bag\n\n[Chorus]See John Mayer LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also like8Embed"}]
