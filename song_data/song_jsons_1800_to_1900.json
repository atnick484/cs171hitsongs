Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams \"The Battlefield\"\"The Battlefield\" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience \"H20\"98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean \"Don't Play\"97. Mac Miller ft. Vince Staples \"Rain\"96. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA \"West Savannah\"95. Vic Mensa\t\"Feel That\"Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year\u2019s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger \"Feel That\". The song breaks away from Vic\u2019s reputation as a \u201clyrical\u201d rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic\u2019s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins\tft Joey Bada$$ \"Jerome\"93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q \"2 On\"92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens \"Better In Tune With The Infinite\"91. Big K.R.I.T. \"King Of The South\"90. PRyhme \"Courtesy\" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino \"Sober\"88. NehruvianDOOM \"OM\"87. Drake\t\"How About Now\"86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought \"The Imperial\"85. O.T Genasis\t\"CoCo\"BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy \"Nate\"83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign \"Deliver\"82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West \"Can't Stop\"81. Future ft. Andre 3000 \"Benz Friends (Whatchutola)\"80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z \"We Made It Freestyle\" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy\u2019s 2013 New Year anthem \u201cWe Made It\u201d. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: \u201cSorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought\u201d79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj \"***Flawless Remix\"78. ScHoolboy Q \"Prescription/Oxymoron\"77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Mamacita\"76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q \"I Just Wanna Party\"75. Dej Loaf\t\"Try Me\"From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS\u2019 \u201cTry Me\u201d beat creeps in, Dej commands the year\u2019s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam\u2019ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf\u2019s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs \"Old English\"73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX \"Gotti\"72. Mick Jenkins \"The Waters\"71. Game \"Bigger Than Me\"70. Childish Gambino \"Candler Road\"Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song \u201cTelegraph Ave.\u201d The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan \"Ruckus In B Minor\"68. Kendrick Lamar \"Untitled\"67. OG Maco \"U Guessed It\"66. Drake \"Draft Day\"65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods\t\"Sunday Candy\"The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago \u201csymphony\u201d, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it\u2019s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper\u2019s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q \"Hoover Street\"63. Common ft. Vince Staples \"Kingdom\"62. Jay Rock \"Parental Advisory\"61. Freddie Gibbs \"Shitsville\"60. Action Bronson \"Easy Rider\"The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like \u201cI had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin\u201d are classic Bam Bam. \"Easy Rider\" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem\t\"Shady XV\"58. Nicki Minaj \"Anaconda\"57. J.Cole \"January 28th\"56. Run The Jewels ft. boots \"Early\"55. Mac Miller \"Diablo\"Mac hit us with \u201cDiablo\u201d  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like \u201cContemplating suicide like it\u2019s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it\u2019s a prison homie leave me be\u201d. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs \"Harold's\"53. Slaughterhouse \"Y'all Ready Know\"52. Logic \"Nikki\"51. Yelawolf \"Till It's Gone\"50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought \"Rapid Eye Movement\"From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. \"My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga\" starts us off with a bang. \"Rapid Eye Movement\" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake \"Recognize\"48. Vic Mensa \"Down On My Luck\"47. PRyhme\t\"PRyhme\"46. Vince Staples \"Blue Suede\"45. Rae Sremmurd\t\"No Flex Zone\"Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne \"Only\" 43. Joey Bada$$\t\"Big Dusty\"42. Run The Jewels \"Blockbuster Night Pt. 1\"41. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Cadillactica\"40. Pusha T \"Lunch Money\"What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push\u2019s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like \u201cWhat's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef\u201d. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013\u2019s MNIMN, he won\u2019t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake \"Who Do You Love\"38. Freddie Gibbs \"Deeper\"37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt \"New Faces V2\"36. Rae Sremmurd \"No Type\"35. Isaiah Rashad \"Heavenly Father\"Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa \"We Dem Boyz\"33. J.Cole \"No Role Modelz\"32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T \"Move That Dope\"31. Logic \"Soul Food\"30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick \"Detroit Vs Everybody\" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em\u2019s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar \"Pay For It\"28. Nas \"The Season\"27. Bad Meets Evil \"Vegas\"26. Logic \"Gang Related\"25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown \"High\"Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug \"About The Money\"23. Drake \"6 God\"22. Eminem ft. Sia \"Guts Over Fear\"21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  \"Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)\"20. Mick Jenkins \"Jazz\" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z \"Seen It All\"Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West \"Sanctified\"Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, \"Sanctified\" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.\n\nNot only did \"Sanctified\" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake \"Tuesday (Remix)\"I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto \u201cTuesday\u201d and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole \t\"Wet Dreamz\"Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake \"Believe Me\" The release of \"Believe Me\"  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion\n\nOne of the more underrated aspects of \"Believe Me\"  is its versatility. You can bump it while you\u2019re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q \"Break tHe Bank\"Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J \"Multiply\"After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in \"Multiply.\" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn\u2019t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP\u2019s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year\u2019s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar \"Never Catch Me\"Like a psychedelic rat race, \u201cNever Catch Me\u201d  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick\u2019s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - \u201cbitch, you\u2019re dead!\u201d11. Joey Bada$$ \"Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)\"With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey\u2019s ability and shows he ain\u2019t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won\u2019t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels \"Oh My Darling Don't Cry\" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to \u201crun backwards through a field of dicks\u201d as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Lifestyle\" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan\u2019s \u201cone-hit wonder status\u201d and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid \"Studio\"ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole \"Fire Squad\"If shock factor was what Cole was after with \"Fire Squad\" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda \"Hot Nigga\"The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn\u2019t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic \"Under Pressure\"The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic\u2019s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track\u2019s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 \"I Don't Fuck With You\"Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with \u201cParadise\u201d, \u201c4th Quarter\u201d, and \u201cJit/Juke\" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples \u201cSay You Love Me\u201d, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not \"down with\" and is reminiscent of \u201cI Don\u2019t Give A Fuck\u201d from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still\u2026.Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Mt. Olympus\"Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. \"Mt. Olympus\" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, \"Is he rap, is he snap?\". \"Is he bass, is he drank?\" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake \"0-100/The Catch Up\"If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. \"Started from the bottom, now we here\" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but \"0 to 100 nigga, real quick\" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release\n\nThe two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes \"0 to 100/The Catch Up\" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar \"i\"Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple \"I love myself\"\n\nSimilar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's \"New Slaves\", every facet of the song\u2019s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move.

got the Pac foundation\nSo much weight on being real\nI won't even say rass clart cause I don't want to sound Ja-faking\nRides I'm taking\nUnaware of my trajectory\nI be susceptible to the pain I'm heavily affected\nBy the thoughts of if I'll make it\nWhere I'm gonna fit in\nMay end up a dead end but fuck it I'll live in\nThe moment\nNow I got Richard Pryor's booster\nRapping till I got more millions than Brewster\nGems like Obey Your Thirst\nLike I'm chop and screwed up\nWith the dirty Sprite\nWay I'm 'repping the South like dirty Nikes\nCause even when you can't see the logo\nYou know where I roam though\n\n[Hook]\nI'm L T T H E\nWasn't proud to say I was from BR3\nAlways thought it wasn't where you from\nBut where you at\nBut where you find the Monk?\nIn the Temple with the

cocky\nTelling me the infamous date rape is her hobby\nSo I got to be\nLTtheWiseOne\nSeeing niggas die some\nWay across the water\nBut that shit be feeling like it happened round the corner\nAs a

100 or nothing\n\n[Hook 2]\nYou got Redman, Method Man and Duffman\nNo I'm the Monk man\nBringing the funk man\nAh shit, I should have just flipped the 1st hook\nMan, it's the Monk man\nIt's the Monk

McCoy]\nWe both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)\nSo I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing\nAnd sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact\nWhen you call and I don't even know what city I'm at\nOr what day of the week in the middle of the month\nIn a year I don't recall\nIt's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long\nThat was last November, now December's almost gone\nI'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong\nI never know\n\n[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]\nI don't know where you're going\nOr when you're coming home\nI left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)\nFor one more chance to hold you close\nI don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, okay, what's that?)\nJust get your ass back home\n\n[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]\nAnd you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted\nHalf of these birds would've flew the coop but you, you truly understand it\nAnd the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)\nYou deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it\nLet 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk\nLike we don't hear what they saying\nLet 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk\nWe'll just drive by and keep waving\n'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it\nAnd now they all choked up, yuck, 'cause they be swallowin' it\nYou might also like[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]\nI don't know where you're going (Yeah)\nOr when you're coming home

in the eye of the storm\nAnd trying to figure out what it's like moving on\nAnd I don't even know what kind of things I said\nMy mouth kept moving and my mind went dead\nSo, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin\nThe hardest part of ending is starting again\n\n[Outro: (Chester Bennington) Mike Shinoda]\n(All I want to do is trade this life for something new\nHolding on to what I haven't got)\nThis is not the end, this is not the beginning\nJust a voice like a riot, rocking every revision\n(I'm holding on to what I haven't got)\nBut you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm\nThough the words sound steady\nSomething empty's within them\nWe say yeah, with fists flying up in the air\nLike we're holding onto something that's invisible there\n(Holding on to what I haven't got)\n'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear\nUntil we get it, forget it, let it all disappear35Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 13, "api_path": "/songs/2520",

with a fear of falling\nWonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI say, \"Can you believe it?\"\nAs we're lyin' on the couch\nThe moment I could see it\nYes, yes, I can see it now\n[Chorus]\nDo you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\nYou made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter\nYou are the best thing that's ever been mine\n\n[Verse 2]\nFlash forward and we're takin' on the world together\nAnd there's a drawer of my things at your place\nYou learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded\nYou say we'll never make my parents' mistakes\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut we got bills to pay\nWe got nothing figured out\nWhen it was hard to take\nYes, yes, this is what I thought about\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\nYou made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter\nYou are the best thing that's ever been mine\nDo you remember all the city lights on the water?\nYou saw me start to believe for the first time\nYou made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter\nYou are the best thing that's ever been mine\nSee

crying and you followed me out into the street\nBraced myself for the goodbye\n'Cause that's all I've ever known\nThen you took me by surprise\nYou said, \"I'll never leave you alone\"\n\n[Chorus]\nYou said, \"I remember how we felt sitting by the water\nAnd every time I look at you, it's like the first time\nI fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter\nShe is the best thing that's ever been mine\"\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nHold on, make it last\nHold on, never turn back\n(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Make it last)\n(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine (Hold on)\n\n[Outro]\nYes, yes, do you believe it?

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nWhat I had to do, had to run from you\nI'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong\nAnd that haunted me, all the way home\nSo you never know, never, never know\nNever know enough, 'til it's over love\n'Til we lose control, system overload\nScreaming, \"No, no, no, n-nooo!\"\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nSee, I wanna move, but can't escape from you\nSo I keep it low, keep a secret code\nSo everybody else don't have to know\n[Chorus]\nSo keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown\nKeeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown\nNow keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown\nNow keep your love lockdown, you lose\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nI can't keep my cool, so I keep it true\nI got something to lose, so I gotta move\nI can't keep myself and still keep you too\nSo I keep in mind, when I'm on my own\nSomewhere far from home, in the danger zone\nHow many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?\nYou lose, you lose\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nSee I had to go, see I had to move\nNo more wasting time, you can't wait for life\nWe're just racin' time, where's the finish line?\n\n[Chorus]\nSo keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown\nKeeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown\nNow keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown\nNow keep your love lockdown, you lose\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nI bet no one knew, I got no one new\nKnow I said I'm through, but got love for you\nBut I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to\nGotta keep it goin', keep the loving goin'\nKeep it on the roll, only God knows\nIf I be with you, baby, I'm confused\nYou choose, you choose\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\nWhere I wanna go, I don't need you\nI've been down this road too many times before\nI'm not loving you, way I wanted to\n\n[Chorus]\nSo keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown\nKeeping your love lockdown,

bottle is gone\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nI'll let you lick the lollipop\nGo 'head, girl, don't you stop\nKeep goin' until you hit the spot, woah\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nWant one taste of what I got?\nI'll have you spendin' all you got\nKeep goin' until you hit the spot, woah\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nI'll let you lick the lollipop\nGo 'head,

the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you?\nYou're movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue\nDidn't mama teach you to give affection?\nI know the difference from a man and a adolescent\nIt ain't

Nate Dogg LyricsHi, I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Ja Rule. Now, as previously stated in another episode, Ja Rule was the biggest rapper out for a while in the early 2000's. Platinum records, features, number one singles, babes, bucks, Ja Rule had it all. But, as time went on, people noticed a pattern with him, which was the constant usage of the \"thugs need love too\" formula to make hit songs, and for a long time, he was on top with it. Hit song after hit song, his \"pop gangster\" persona was blowing up, but then, there came a man who saw fit to call out this \"pop rapper\" for what he felt that he was: \"a studio thug\" who purely used his hardcore image to appeal to a female audience. That man was Mr. Curtis Jackson, a.k.a. 50 Cent. He'd call out Ja for not being a heartless thug, and instead being a punk, a softie! *footage of 50 calling out Ja* Sure, there's some origin about 50's friend stealing his chain and Ja Rule seeing that dude and 50 hanging out, but the main thing that people heard about was 50 calling him out for being a fake gangster, and sure enough, when 50 cent came into prominence, he would stamp out all of Ja Rule's club songs and love song, and replace them with\u2026 *\"In Da Club\" and \"21 Questions\"*\u2026 with club songs and love songs\u2026 Well, to 50's credit though, he did explain himself when releasing \"21 Questions\", the love song I wanted to look at today\n\nWhen asked by Dr. Dre: \"How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?\"\n\n50 Cent responded with: I\u2019m two people. I\u2019ve always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that\u2019s not diversity, it\u2019s necessity\n\nAnd you know what, I can get behind that, that's the dichotomy of man. you DO have your moments of anger, and you do have your softer sides. You can talk about wanting to kill at one point, and talk about wanting to be loved the next\u2026 well, wait a minute, if that's true, Mr. I'm so enlightened to the different aspects of humanity, why did you rag on Ja Rule so much when HE made love songs? What is HE not allowed to have his own dichotomy? That seems a little unfair. Reminds me of when he was in that whole thing with Kanye West, where he was a total sore loser about not selling as many records as Kanye, and decided to randomly taunt him for years, especially for using auto tune *audio clip of \"I Line Niggas', immediately followed by 50 performing \"Love Lockdown\"*, but then, wait, what was that song he did the next year with G-Unit?\n\n*\"Rider, Part 2\"*\n\nOh yeah, yeah\u2026\nSo you see, my thing about 50 Cent is that he's always come off as a bit of a hypocritical bully, and with other rappers that I might like, yeah, they may be jackasses, but they do something that makes me look past it, like, yeah, Eminem's an ass, but dammit, he sure knows how to combine lyrics and flow to create masterful verses, and yeah, Kanye's an ass, but dammit, he sure does know how to make good beats and throw in a little socially conscious messages every now and then. But 50 Cent? Yeah, he's an ass, but he sure does, uh\u2026 spit typical gangsta rap lyrics over dark beats, because\u2026 THAT'S what everyone was waiting for!\n\nBut i dunno, if one of my favorite rappers of all time signed him, maybe I should give him a chance. After all, it's not just making a \"thugs need love too\" song that makes me not like a song, it's making a BAD song that makes me not like one, so let's check out \"21 Questions\" by 50 cent, and see how it fares\n\n*intro*\n\nOh yes, but first we must have awkwardly rushed character establishment. Okay, so how do we establish a rapport between two people in in love in only 20 seconds?\n\n*50 kisses money, laughs, girl in the back laughs*\n\n*Laugh* Yes, I echo your thoughts concerning the hilarity of money\n\n*police arrive*\n\nOh no, the cops! Maybe making all those songs in which I publicly admit to selling crack wasn't such a good idea!\n\n*cops come in, song starts*\n\n*video shows 50 riding in the back of an cop van*\n\n\"New York City! You are now riding\u2026 with 50 Cent!\n\nWell, according to this video, you're riding in the back of a cop van. I wouldn't exactly call that your finest hour\n\nYou gotta love it!\nYou might also likePersonally, I think riding in the back of a police vehicle kind of sucks, but whatever\n\nI just want to chill and twist the lye\nCatch stunts in my 745\n\nI just wanna let you know before this love song starts that I'm still totally a gangsta by smoking weed and showing off my expensive cars!\n\nGirl, it's easy to love me now\n\nAnd, of course, 10 points for including the closest thing the new millennium will ever get to Isaac Hayes, Mr. Nate Dogg on the hook\n\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\n\nAnd I gotta give this song a few more points for actually being about something other than the general theme of \"i'm a thug, and you're my main bitch\". Instead of just that, it centers around a sense of doubt about his girlfriend's faithfulness that understandably stems from being really famous and having people around you that only care about you because of your money. He wants someone who's interested in more than money\u2026 despite what the intro may lead you to believe\n\nIf I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?\n\nAnd he starts off by asking directly: if all of his fame was over tomorrow, would you still care about him? It's straight up and to the point. And I wish he would have started with this instead of the \"riding in my car, smoking weed\" nonsense\n\nIf I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century\nCould I count on you to be there to support me mentally?\n\nYou know, for most \"thugs need love too\" songs, they only dwell on a surface level depiction of a relationship, but to ask someone if they'd be willing to be emotional support if they were in jail for 25 years, that requires some reflection. And the delivery makes me feel like it really means something when he says it\n\nIf I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?\nAlso, factoring in the realization that this man has actually been shot at 9 times, this is an alarmingly real possibility he's giving this girl to think about\n\nIf it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?\n\nOkay, that's kinda vague. You might want to elaborate what you mean, because, you know, one might confuse...\n\nI get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive\n\nOkay, no confusion here, you're asking her to help you kill somebody. Got it\n\nI'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside\n\nYeah, he's asking questions about how you feel INSIDE, specifically about being an accomplice to murder\n\nNow would you leave me if your father found out I was thugging?\n\nWould that be before or AFTER you convinced his daughter to be an accomplice to murder?\n\nAre you mad cause I'm asking you 21 questions?\n\nUh\u2026 does that count as one of the questions? Because now it sounds like you're trolling her. You mad I'm asking' you 21 questions? Yo mad, bruh?\n\nDo you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?\n\nNow THIS is a deep question, and the wording is important. Do you TRUST me enough to reveal your inner aspirations, the silly pipe dreams that fuel your motivations, or maybe he's talking about the actual dreams that she has every night, the ones that reoccur and haunt her, the ones that subconsciously unpack everything about her fears, joys, and---\n\nI'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans\n\n\u2026and\u2026 and that was a bad transition. I don't even think that was a question, you just said, \"Baby, tell me about the intricate inner workings of THAT apple bottom ASS\u2026 also, ya dreams, and shit...\n\nIf I was with some other chick and someone happened to see\n\nOkay, this couplet always throws me off, no matter how much credit I try to give this song. Listen to the whole thing\n\nIf I was with some other chick and someone happened to see\nAnd when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me\nWould you believe me or up and leave me?\nHow deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?\n\nYeah, this always got to me. He says, \"If someone saw me with another girl, NOT if someone just told her he was with another girl, and it was ambiguous as to whether or not it actually happened, no, IF IT WAS TRUE that he was with another women and someone told you about it, will you believe him when he says it wasn't him.\" To be clear, part of this song's in-depth compatibility quiz about your integrity as a human being in a relationship fundamentally involves you just kind of accepting the fact that he's eventually going to lie to you.. And what's oddly worse is that, after admitting to being the one who would lie and cheat on her in this example, he shifts the problems of the relationship back on HER\n\nWould you believe me or up and leave me?\nHow deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?\n\nYes, 50 Cent's girlfriend: after lying and cheating on you, it's clearly YOU who needs to evaluate how seriously you're taking the relationship!\n\nYeah, these are the lyrics that almost ruin everything this song had going for it. Not the gangsterism's, not the singing intro by 50 cent, not even the line about cake and fat kids\n\nI love you like a fat kid loves cake\nYou know my style, I'll say anything to make you smile\n\nYeah, it's corny, but by itself, it's kinda endearing, because in relationships, you're gonna have stupid little things you say to each other, and in the context of a song, if you don't overdo it, it can be fitting, but what ruins this for me is that this lyric comes immediately after the aforementioned lyrics, and sure these questions are mostly hypotheticals, and these scenarios may not have actually happened yet, but in this specific hypothetical situation, he has shown a blatant willingness to shift the blame on her despite him being the one that screwed up, succeeding these lyrics with limp backpedalling\n\nWe're only humans, girl, we make mistakes\nTo make it up, I'll do whatever it takes\nI love you lil a fat kid loves cake\n\nAnd THAT'S what makes this line bad to me: in this instance, after accidentally showcasing a possible warning sign of things to come in their relationship, he acts like a corny joke will be the thing to make her let it go, and that just doesn't gel well with me\n\nOverall, though, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. Never underestimate the power of Nate Dogg's vocals, my friends. And in addition, 50 Cent does actually give a realistic and tangible depiction of his aspirations on relationships, and for about 80% of it, it's relatable and understandable. Yes, it has parts that turn me off of it, but I say in the end, this songs gets a pass from me. And to his credit, at least he didn't pull a Ja Rule, *play \"Always On Time\"* and make a quote unquote \"love song\" that, in a sickening revelation, was ultimately just about a pimp-ho relationship. No, 50 Cent was pretty upfront when he made THAT song\n\n*\"Cause I' m a mothefuckin' P.I.M.P.!\"*\n\nWell, I'm the Rap Critic: You don't have to like my opinion, but I don't have to like your songEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/5951", "artist_names": "Fabolous (Ft.

quickly\nThere's no hope in you, for me\nNo corner you could squeeze me?\nBut I got all the time for you, love\n\n[Hook]\nThe space between\nThe tears we cry\nIs the laughter - keeps us coming back for more\nThe space between\nThe wicked lies we tell\nIn hope to keep safe from the pain\n[Verse 2]\nBut will I hold you again?\nThese fickle, fuddled words confuse me\nLike 'Will it rain today?'\nWaste the hours with talking, talking\nThese twisted games we're playing\n\n[Hook 2]\nWe're strange allies\nWith warring hearts\nWhat a wild-eyed beast you be\nThe space between\nThe wicked lies we tell\nIn hope to keep safe from the pain\n\n[Breakdown]\nWill I hold you again?\nWill I hold...\nLook at us spinning out in\nThe madness of a roller coaster\nYou know you went off like\nA devil in a church\nIn the middle of a crowded room\nAll we can do, my love\nIs hope we don't take this ship down\nSee Dave Matthews Band LiveGet tickets as low as $169You might also like[Hook 3]\nThe space between\nWhere you smile and hide\nIs where you'll find me if I get to go\nThe space between\nThe bullets in our firefight\nIs where I'll be hiding, waiting for you\nThe rain that falls\nSplashed in your heart\nRan like sadness down the window into your room\nThe space between\nOur wicked lies\nIs where we hope to keep safe from pain\nTake my hand\nCause we're walking out of here\nOh, right out of here\nIs all we need dear\nThe space between\nWhat's wrong and right\nIs where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you\nThe space between\nYour heart and mind\nIs a space we'll fill with time\nThe space between\nThe tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more\nThe space between\nOur wicked lies where we hope to keep safe from pain\nThe space between\nThe space

little thing\nFierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring\nAnd I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high\nSo to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try\nButterflies in her eyes and looks to kill\nTime is passin', I'm askin', \"Could this be real?\"\n'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still\nThe only thing I really know is she got sex appeal\nI can feel, too much is never enough\nYou're always there to lift me up when these times get rough\nI was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around\nYou're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down\n[Chorus]\nCome my lady, come-come my lady\nYou're my butterfly, sugar baby\nCome my lady, you're my pretty baby\nI'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy\nCome my lady, come-come my lady\nYou're my butterfly, sugar baby\nCome my lady, you're my pretty baby\nI'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message\nTo show me life is precious, then I guess it's true\nBut to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you\nSee I was lost and confused, twisted and used up\nKnew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it\nMy lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child\nTrapped on a short leash paroled the police files\nSo yo, what's happenin' now?\nI see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds\nAnd a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so\n\n[Chorus]\nCome my lady, come-come my lady\nYou're my butterfly, sugar baby\nCome my lady, you're my pretty baby\nI'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy\nCome my lady, come-come my lady\nYou're my butterfly, sugar baby\nCome my lady, you're my pretty baby\nI'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy\nYou might also

1: Big Boi]\nMy baby's drama mama don't like me\nShe be doin' things like havin' them boys\nCome from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me\nShe needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out\nThat's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out\nAnd let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check\nPrivate school, daycare, shit, medical bills\u2014I pay that\nI love your mom and everything\nBut see, I ain't the only one who laid down\nShe wanna rib you up to start a custody war\nMy lawyers stay down\nShe never got a chance to hear my side of the story\nWe was divided\nShe had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited\nDespite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through\nAll you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for

oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever\nForever, forever ever? Forever, ever?\nForever never seems that long until you're grown\nAnd notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong\nMs. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could\nBecome a magician to abracadabra all the sadder\nThoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he\nAsking what happened to the feeling that her and me had\nI pray so much about it, need some knee pads\nIt happened for a reason, one can't be mad\nSo know this, know that everything's cool\nAnd yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am

straddle and ride this thing on out\nNow you and your girl ain't speakin' no more\n'Cause my dick all in her mouth\nKnow what I'm talkin' about?\nJealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating\nIn the

earth is just a dead thing you can claim\nBut I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature\nHas a life, has a spirit, has a name\nYou think the only people who are people\nAre the people who look and think like you\nBut if you walk the footsteps of a stranger\nYou'll learn things you never knew you never knew\n\n[Chorus]\nHave you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon\nOr asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?\nCan you sing with all the voices of the mountain?\nCan you paint with all the colors of the wind?\nCan you paint with all the colors of the wind?\n[Verse 2]\nCome run the hidden pine trails of the forest\nCome taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth\nCome roll in all the riches all around you\nAnd for once, never wonder what they're worth\nThe rainstorm and the river are my brothers\nThe heron and the otter are my friends\nAnd we're all connected to each other\nIn a circle, in a hoop that never ends\n\n[Chorus]\nHave you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon\nOr let the eagle tell you there he's been\nCan you sing with all the voices of the mountain?\nCan you paint with all the colors of the wind?\nCan you paint with all the colors of the wind?\n\n[Bridge]\nHow high does the sycamore grow?\nIf you cut it down\nThen you'll never know\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon\nFor whether we are white or copper-skinned\nWe need to sing with all the voices of the mountain\nNeed to paint with all the colors of the wind\nYou might also like[Outro]\nYou can own the earth and still\nAll you'll own is earth until\nYou can paint with all colors of the wind1Embed"}]
