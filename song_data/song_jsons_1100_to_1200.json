wind\nAnd she wonders without knowing where did we begin\n\n[Chorus]\nMary Moon, she's a vegetarian\n(Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)\nMary Moon will outlive all the septuagenarians\n(Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)\nOh she loves me so, she hates to be alone\nShe don't eat meat but she sure like the bone\n[Verse 2]\nYou know she drives wind car (How does she like it?)\nIt doesn't get her far (Why she doesn't bike it?)\nBut it gets her to where she's going\nI don't know, I don't know, I don't know\nWhere that is wish I knew\nI don't know where she's going\nAnd I don't know where she's been\nAll I know that lovin' her has gotta be a sin\n\n[Chorus]\nMary Moon, she's a vegetarian\n(Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)\nMary Moon will outlive all the septuagenarians\n(Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary

know we're 'bout to rip shit up\nGive me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble\nCompton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble\nAin't nuthin' but a G thang, baby\nTwo loced out niggas going crazy\nDeath Row is the label that pays me\nUnfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)\nBut, um, back to the lecture at hand\nPerfection is perfected so I'ma let 'em understand\nFrom a young G's perspective\nAnd before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive\nYou never know, she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man\nAnd at the same time burnin' her man\nNow, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant\nAin't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)\nAnd that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield\nAnd now you hookers and hoes know how I feel\nWell, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk\nI'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff\n[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg]\nIt's like this and like

Dre]\nWell, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'\nBut I damn near got caught 'cause my beeper kept beepin'\nNow it's time for me to make my impression felt\nSo sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt\nYou never been on a ride like this befo'\nWith a producer who can rap and control the micstro\nAt the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick\nYou know and I know, I flow some old funky shit\nTo add to my collection, the selection\nSymbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke\nIf you do, you'll have no clue\nOf what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do\n\n[Chorus: Both & Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]\nIt's like this and like that and like this and a\u2014\nIt's like that and like this and like that and a\u2014\nIt's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?\nSo just chill 'til

mumble\nWhen I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble\nTry to get close and your ass'll get smacked\nMy motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back\nNever let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'\nBut if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'\nAnd I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mac down\nAnd if you bitches talk shit, I have to put the smack down\nYeah,

about your\nWhat about your\n\n[Verse 1: T-Boz]\nEvery now and then, I get a little crazy\nThat's not the way it's supposed to be\nSometimes my vision is a little hazy\nI can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah\nPeople try to say I act a little funny\nBut that's just a figure of speech to me\nThey tell me I changed because I got money\nBut if you were there before, then you're still down with me, yeah\n[Chorus: All]\nWhat about your friends?\nWill they stand their ground?\nWill they let you down again?\nWhat about your friends?\nAre they gonna be low down?\nWill they ever be around?\nOr will they turn their backs on you?\n\n[Refrain: Left Eye]\nWell, is it me, or can it be I'm a little too\nFriendly so to speak hypothetically say?\nI supply creativity to what others\nMust take as a form of self-hate\nOnly to make an enemy\nWhich results in unfortunate destiny\nThey dog me out then be next to me\nJust 'cause I am what some choose to envy\n\n[Verse 2: T-Boz, with Chilli]\nEvery now and then, I get a little easy\nI let a lot of people depend on me\nI never thought they would ever deceive me\nDon't you know when times got rough\nI was standing on my own\nI'll never let another get that close to me\nYou see, I've grown a lot smarter now\nSometimes you have to choose and then you'll see\nIf your friend is true, they'll be there with you\nThrough the thick and thin\nYou might also like[Chorus: All]\nWhat about your friends? (What about your friends?)\nWill they stand their ground?\nWill they let you down again? (Woah)\nWhat about your friends?

Here we go\nOr can it be I am a little too friendly?\nSo to speak hypothetically say?\nI supply creativity to what others must take as a form of self-hate\nOnly to make an enemy, which results in unfortunate destiny\nThey dog me out then be next to me\nJust cause I am what some choose to envy\n\n[Chorus: All]\nWhat about your friends?\nWill they stand their ground?\nWill they let you down again?\nWhat about your friends?

hearts that never mend\n'Cause some guys like you do the same\nLove\nWas just a four letter word\nNever heard\nHow absurd\nHow it could be\n\nBut now\nI can't believe this is real\nHow I feel now you steal\nMy heart away from me\n\nUsed to be so good and so bad\nSex was just something I had\nUsed to always know what to do\nNow you've got me confused\n\n[Chorus:]\nBaby, don't let me be

2:]\nYes, it's true\nI'm in love with you\nAnd believe it, baby\nThis time your love won't get away\n\nStay here in the place to be\nWe can get busy my way\nFor six forevers and a day\n\nOoh, it's only you I adore\nSo much more\nThan my body was asking for\n\nYes\nYour love is breaking my chill\nEven still there's a thrill in my heart\n\n[Full Force:]\nSamantha Fox was such a wild

Soul Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSomething in the moonlight catches my eye\nThe shadow of a lover goes dancing by\nLooking for a little bit of love to grow, so\nGive me love, give me heart and soul\nYou never let me cross to the other side now\nI'm tied to the hope that you will somehow\nHard on the heels of something more\nBut I lost your love, heart and soul\nThe tear in my heart as you walk on by (more than an ocean)\nI feel so low and your head is high\nEverything you do convinces me more, please (keeps us apart)\nGive me love, give me heart and soul\nLooking to the day when I saw your face (I feel a tearing)\nI wasn't in the running, I wasn't in the race\nYou move in a way that I've known before (In half of my heart)\nNow I want your love, heart and soul\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLeaving you ain't easy now (Tired eyes, tears that dried)\nLoving you's the harder part (On the bed, on the pillow, where the love has died)\nYou never want me for myself (A turn of the key, through the door you go)\nNow I've needed you right from the very start (Don't look back, to hurt me more )\n(Everything you said was to the point)\nOh won't you even try to (Can't you try to)\n\n[Chorus]\nGive a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)\nGive a little bit of love to grow\nGive a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)\nAnd don't you make me beg for more (must I beg you)\nGive a sign, I need to know\nA little bit of heart and soul\n\n[Verse 2]\nWalking on the water, walking on the air (a walk on the water)\nThat was the heart of the love we shared\nDo you keep secret left untold (is all that I need)\nCan't give love, heart or soul\nI used to have a lover with a Midas touch (but miracles are not happening)\nI turned to gold but he turned to dust\nLeft me for another, I turned to stone\nNow give me love, heart and soul\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nLiving in a fantasy (Tired eyes, tears that dried)\nThere's never any room to breathe (On the bed, on the pillow, where you told your lies)\nHoping every waking hour (A turn of the key, my blood runs cold)\nYou'll turn around and say that we can start (Don't look back to hurt me more)\n(Everything you did just said it all)\nOh won't you even try to (Can't you try to)\n\n[Chorus]\nGive a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)\nGive a little bit of love to grow\nGive a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)\nAnd don't you make me beg for more (must I beg you)\nGive a sign, I need to know\nA little bit of heart and soul\n\n[Bridge]\nSomehow, I lost my way\nLooking to see something in your eyes\nBut love will never compromise\nNow this is the politics of life, yeah!\n\n[Chorus]\nGive a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)\nGive a little bit of love to grow\nGive a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)\nAnd don't you make me beg for more (must I beg

Lyrics[Verse 1: Mark King]\nHow, how can it be that a love\nCarved out of caring, fashioned by fate\nCould suffer so hard\nFrom the games played once too often?\nBut making mistakes\nIs a part of life's imperfections\nBorn of the years\nIs it so wrong to be human after all?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Mike Lindup]\nDrawn into the stream\nOf undefined illusion\nThose diamond dreams\nThey can't disguise the truth\n[Chorus: Mark King]\nThat there is something about you\nBaby, so right\nI wouldn't be without you, baby, tonight\n\n[Verse 2: Mark King]\nIf ever our love was concealed\nNo one can say that we didn't feel\nA million things\nAnd a perfect dream of life\nGone, fragile but free\nWe remain tender together\nIf not so in love\nIt's not so wrong\nWe're only human after all\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Mike Lindup]\nThese changing years\nThey add to your confusion\nOh, and you need to hear\nThe time that told the truth\n\n[Chorus: Mark King]\nThat there is something about you\nBaby, so right\nDon't want to be without you\nBaby, tonight\nBecause there's something about you\nBaby, so right\nI couldn't live without you\nBaby, tonight\nI know there's something about you\nAnd I couldn't live without you

you're hurt too, but\nWhat else can we do\nTormented and torn apart\nI wish I could carry your smile in my heart\nFor times when my life seems so low\nIt would make me believe what tomorrow could bring\nWhen today doesn't really know\nDoesn't really know\n[Chorus]\nI'm all out of love\nI'm so lost without you\nI know you were right\nBelieving for so long\nI'm all out of love\nWhat am I without you?\nI can't be too late\nTo say that I was so wrong\n\n[Verse 2]\nI want you to come back and carry me home\nAway from these long, lonely nights\nI'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too\nDoes the feeling seem oh so right\nAnd what would you say if I called on you now\nAnd said that I can't hold on\nThere's no easy way, it gets harder each day\nPlease love me or I'll be gone\nI'll be gone\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm all out of love\nI'm so lost without you\nI know you were right\nBelieving for so long\nI'm all out of love\nWhat am I without you?\nI can't be too late\nTo say that I was so

walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face\nI should have changed that stupid lock\nI should have made you leave your key\nIf I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me\n[Pre-Chorus]\nGo on now, go, walk out the door\nJust turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore\nWeren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?\nDid you think I'd crumble?

love you\nOh, my sweet dream baby, you're in my dreams every night\nOh sweet dreams, I like feelin you\nOh sweet dreams baby, Don't keep me waiting all my lifeYou might also like1Embed"}, {"_type":

free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards\nJoe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge\nWhy she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?\nI can't play

perform, so I fuck her with my chains on\nAnd she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role\nAin't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks\nAnd I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat\nI'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go\nTennis chain bustin', look like rainbows\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm like, \"Come and put that pussy on me, don't

hot\n\n[Chorus: Gunna]\nEverything litty, I love when it's hot\nTurned up the city, I broke off the notch\nGot some more millis, I keep me a knot\nI created history and made me a lot\nHe tried to diss me and ended on Fox\nWe call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop\nTook her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop\nI run it like Nike, we got it on lock\n[Verse 1: Gunna]\nCartier eye\nI'm the bossman in a suit but no tie\nI can't be sober, I gotta stay high\nPour me some syrup in a Canada Dry\nRidin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde\nDon't worry, baby, I keep me some fire\nShenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide\nThe latest Mercedes her go-to surprise\nDon't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize\nDick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides\nBigger Maybach, this ain't regular size\nWe really fly, we like pelican glide\nBitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise\nUpgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky\nShe sing, I might sign her and change her whole life\nI told her to gargle and work on her highs\n\n[Chorus: Gunna]\nEverything litty, I love when it's hot\nTurned up the city, I broke off the notch\nGot some more millis, I keep me a knot\nI created history and made me a lot\nHe tried to diss me and ended on Fox\nWe call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop\nTook her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop\nI run it like Nike, we got it on lock\nYou might also like[Interlude: Young Thug]\nCash, money, checks, cash\nAddy, Birkin, brand new extendos\nI just wanna fuck the bitch by myself\nI just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite\n\n[Verse 2: Young Thug]\nI took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)\nI put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)\nAyy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)\nI'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)\nI'm in the coupe by myself\nI had to kick a door when I was 5\nKeep the awards on the shelf\nWhole sixteen round in the fire\nI'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies\nActin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys\nYeah, Cartier eyes\nCartier coat, Cartiers the watch\nCartier love, Cartier the thot\nCartier specs, buffalo on the side\nPrincess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah\nCartier bag for the Cartier thot\nSky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash\nCartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag\nAin't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad\nI can't go out, no way I'ma go out\nI just grip on her ass and I show out\nI sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out\nI just whip up a new Chanel Patek\nI whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out\nTurn the whole top floor to a whorehouse\nHundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out\n[Outro: Gunna]\nHot, hot, hot, hot\nHot, hot, hot, hot\nHot, hot, hot, hot, damn\nHot, hot, hot37Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

moment\nAnd I gotta convince myself I don\u2019t want it\nEven though I do (Even though I do)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou could break my heart in two\nBut when it heals, it beats for you\nI know it's forward, but it's true\n[Chorus]\nI wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to\nWhen I'm lyin' close to someone else\nYou're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it\nIf I could do it all again, I know I\u2019d go back to you\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI know I\u2019d go back to you, oh\nI know I'd go back to you\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe never got it right\nPlayin\u2019 and replayin' old conversations\nOverthinkin' every word and I hate it\n'Cause it\u2019s not me ('Cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)\nAnd what's the point in hidin'?\nEverybody knows, we got unfinished business\nAnd I'll regret it if I didn't say\nThis isn't what it could be (Isn't what it could be)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou could break my heart in two\nBut when it heals, it beats for you\nI know it's

treat her regular\nNot being seen, we not making no spectacle\nGates had her first then he gave her to Kevin\nAll the above, we do all the et cetera\nScared of the feds, had to switch up my

don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore\n\n[Verse 2]\nHello, how are you?\nIt's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry\nI hope that you're well\nDid you ever make it out of

tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nSo rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel\nRock me, mama, any way you feel\nHey, mama, rock me\nRock me, mama, like the wind and the rain\nRock me, mama, like a southbound train\nHey,

a-getting me down\nLost my money playing poker so I had to leave town\nBut I ain't turning back to living that old life no more\n\n[Chorus]\nSo rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel\nRock me, mama, any

trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke\nBut he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap\nTo Johnson City, Tennessee\nAnd I got to get a move on before the sun\nI hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one\nAnd if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free\n\n[Chorus]\nSo rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel\nRock me, mama, any way you feel\nHey, mama, rock me\nRock me, mama,
