flashing lights\nI love the way that you like candle light\nStay close by my side\nI just want a chance to show that\n[Pre-Chorus: Keaton Stromberg]\nIf only you could believe in yourself in the way I

guarantees\nBut if you're with me, you know that I can guarantee that\n'Cause I'm attracted to your passion\nBe yourself, forget the fashion\nJust keep that smile you're flashing\n'Cause you and I deserve to be forever ever lasting\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Keaton Stromberg]\nIf only you could believe in yourself in the way I believe in you\nI-I do (you're the one I want)\nIf only you could see all of

building she know that I kill 'em\nI know that I hit it the best\nCandles lit with that wine, money still on my mind\nAnd I gave her that really bomb sex\nNo matter where she goes or who she knows\nShe still belongs in my bed\nGoing hard in the streets, mobbin with my homies\nSippin' on good, blowin' on OG\nMe and ghost sittin' clean with the matching rollie\nI did that first so everybody

with the Hennessy\nGive her no dough to come, but I gave her 10 to leave\nI bet I hit it first, unless you took that girl virginity\nFirst come, first served is all a player know\nBut I don't wanna be a player no more\nThat's a lie, I'm way too fly\nI love anything with ass that walk by\nYeah you love her, yeah you hug her and you kiss her\nShe dome me up, she give me face like some whiskers\nTia\u2019s and Tamera\u2019s, I be knockin' sisters\nAnd I still hit, while you lonely and you miss her\n\n[Bridge: Ray J]\nWhen I walk in the function\nYou already know I'm leaving with

champagne\nThere\u2019s nothing nobody can say\n[Hook]\nCause today is the day\nIs the day that I have always dreamed of forever\nWhen you call me\nYou call me the champ of the world\nI can raise my hands\nI can scream I\u2019m the best in the world\nWhole world\nAll my blood, sweat and grind\nWas all for this time\n\n[Verse 2]\nLap after lap, mile after mile\nPush up after push up\nEverybody count it out\nEverybody up, now we back down\nAll my pain and sweat was for this moment right now\nAll from different places well we came with each other\nWe came together as a team\nBut we\u2019re leaving as brothers\nStanding next to one another while we hold up our colors\nI\u2019m gon\u2019 look in to the camera and tell my mama I love her\n\n[Hook x3]See Nelly LiveGet tickets as low as

more week 'til were together\nThen I'll finally see your face\nThis whole month felt like forever and a day\nBabe I'm feeling kind of lonely\nThose three words just ain't enough\nYou can tell me that you love me\nBut that ain't what your boyfriend said\nHe's got a sports car and some money\nAnd I think it's kind of funny\nThis shouldn't have been such a surprise\nAnd there's no use getting angry\n'Cause I see it now so plainly\nThru the subtle hint of red in my eyes\n\nOh, you never seem to answer\n\nOh, are you with him instead\n\nOne more week 'til were together\nThen I'll finally see your face\nThis whole month felt like forever and a day\nBabe I'm feeling kind of lonely\nThose three words just ain't enough\nYou can tell me that you love me\nBut that ain't what your boyfriend said\n\nSo tell me, did you lie when you said you loved me\nTell me, did you lie when you said you cared\n'Cause that ain't what your boyfriend\nThat ain't what your boyfriend\nNo that ain't what your

she is yelling at a bridesmaid\nSomewhere back inside a room\nWearin' a gown shaped like a pastry\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThis is surely not what you thought it would be\nI lose myself in a daydream\nWhere I stand and say\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't say yes, run away now\nI'll meet you when you're out\nOf the church, at the back door\nDon't wait or say a single vow\nYou need to hear me out\nAnd they said, \"Speak now\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nFond gestures are exchanged\nAnd the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march\nAnd I am hiding in the curtains\nIt seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe floats down the aisle like a pageant queen\nBut I know you wish it was me\nYou wish it was me, don't you?\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't say yes, run away now\nI'll meet you when you're out\nOf the church, at the back door\nDon't wait or say a single vow\nYou need to hear me out\nAnd they said, \"Speak now\"\nDon't say yes, run away now (Run away now)\nI'll meet you when

hit the wall (Wall!), watch you crawl (Crawl!)\nSuch a replaceable liar\n\nAnd I know you hear their voices (Calling from above)\nAnd I know they may seem real (These signals of love)\nBut our life's

to stand on the edge\nWhat if today is as good as it gets?\nDon't know where the future's heading\nBut nothing's gonna bring me down\nI've jumped every bridge and I've heard every lie\nI've risked

always there when I looked back\nYou had to do it all alone\nMake a living, make a home\nMust have been as hard as it could be\nAnd when I couldn't sleep at night\nScared things wouldn't turn out right\nYou would hold my hand and sing to me\n[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Billy Ray Cyrus]\nCaterpillar in the tree\nHow you wonder who you'll be\nCan't go far, but you can always dream\nWish you may and wish you might\nDon't you worry, hold on tight\nI promise you there will come a day\nButterfly fly away\n\n[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus, Billy Ray Cyrus & Both]\nButterfly fly away (Butterfly fly away)\nGot your wings, now you can't stay\nTake those dreams and make them all come true\nButterfly fly away (Butterfly fly away)\nYou've been waiting for this day\nAll along you've known just what to

DARBUS: Well that was just... very disturbing. Go see a counselor. Next!\n\nThe pair walks offstage.\n\nGabriella walks up to Troy, who is still hiding behind the janitor's cart.\n\nGABRIELLA: Hey!\n\nTroy is startled.\n\nGABRIELLA: So you decided to sign up for something?\n\nTROY: Uh... No! You?\n\nGABRIELLA: No. Why are you hiding behind a mop?\n\nTroy gives a chuckle and moves the cart away.\n\nGABRIELLA: Your friends don't know you're here, right?\n\nTROY: Right.\n\nBoth nod.\nOnstage a student opens her mouth to sing, but hesitates, standing still.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Thank you, next.\n\nThe student runs off.\n\nTROY: Uh, Ms. Darbus is a little... harsh.\n\nGABRIELLA: The wildcat superstar is afraid?\n\nTROY: No, no. I'm not afraid. I'm just, scared.\n\nGABRIELLA: Me too... usually.\n\nMS. DARBUS: And for the lead roles of Minnie and Arnold, we only have one couple signed up, Sharpay and Ryan. I think it might be useful for you to give us a sense of why we gather in this hallowed hall.\n\nThe twins stand. Sharpay flings her sequin jacket over her shoulder and stops Ryan to walk in front. Ryan rolls his eyes. Gabriella and Troy take seats in the back. Shrapay and Ryan walk onstage. Kelsi puts a hand up.\n\nKELSI: What key?\n\nRYAN: Oh, we had our rehearsal pianist do an arrangement.\n\nKELSI: Oh.\n\nRyan walks into place and puts on his hat. Students holds up their microphones. Sharpay snaps and the curtain closes. Behind the curtain, Sharpay and Ryan perform vocal excercises and hand movements.What I've Been Looking For(As the song begins, Sharpay and Ryan stick their hands out the curtain and snap. The curtain rises and they take the microphones to sing. They casually walk on stage and break into poses. They snap side to side and point to one another. Sharpay does a step-touch while Ryan does jazz squares. Ryan passes behind Sharpay. They point to one another. They turn, pretending to be lost, then sing back to back.\nSharpay hands Ryan the microphone and tap dances. Ryan hands Sharpay back her microphone and she continues to sing. Ryan does a one-handed cartwheel. Sharpay and Ryan lean on their knees and pretend to zip their mouths closed. Sharpay covers Ryan's eyes and taps his shoulder. Sharpay spins away from Ryan. Ryan sings directly into the microphone, lifting it up as he moves his head. Sharpay flips her hair back and points to the audience. Ryan and Sharpay walk and snap rythmically across stage. They stop and change directions. Sharpay bumps into Ryan and gives him annoyed look, quickly returning to a smile. They hug themselves and slide in front of/behind each other. They hold each other's microphones and dance. Ryan twirls Sharpay and does a jazzhand. They skip back and forth. Ryan and Sharpay strike poses then freeze in place.)\n\nSHARPAY: (in a hushed tone) I told you not to do the jazz squares.\n\nRYAN: It's a crowd favorite. Everybody loves a good jazz square.\nSharpay glares at Kelsi, who begins to clap, as do the stagehands. They bow and curtsey.\n\nMS. DARBUS: (standing up) Well, are there any last-minute sign-ups?\n\nRYAN: (speaking to a girl) Don't be discouraged. The theater needs more than just singers. It needs fans too. buy tickets.\n\nKelsi runs up to Sharpay.\n\nKELSI: Actually, if you do that part with that particular song, I imagined it much slower.\n\nSHARPAY: If we do the part?\n\nSharpay smirks and looks around.\n\nSHARPAY: Kelsi, my sawed-off Sondheim, I've been in seventeen school productions and how many times have your compositions been selected?\n\nKELSI: This would be the first?\n\nSHARPAY: Which tells us what?\n\nKELSI: Uh, I need to write you more solos?\n\nSHARPAY: No, it tells us that you do not offer direction, suggestion, or commentary. And you should be thankful that me and Ryan are here to lift your music out of it's current obscurity. Are we clear?\n\nKELSI: Yes ma'am. I mean, Sharpay.\n\nSharpay smiles and holds the microphone close.\n\nSHARPAY: (waving) Nice talking to you.\n\nSharpay saunters away.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Any last minute sign-ups?\n\nGabriella looks at Troy.\n\nTROY: (whispering) We should go.\n\nMS. DARBUS: No? Good. Done.\n\nMs. Darbus starts to leave. Gabriella steps out.\n\nGABRIELLA: I'd like to audition, Ms. Darbus.\n\nTROY: (whispering) What!\n\nTroy looks shocked and motions that his mind is blown. He spins and covers his eyes.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Timeliness means something in the world of theater, young lady. The individual auditions are long over and there are simmply no other pairs.\n\nTROY: I'll sing with her!\n\nTroy steps out and puts his hand up.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Troy Bolton, where is your sports possee or whatever it's called?\n\nTROY: Team.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Ahh. (walking towards the pair)\n\nTROY: But I'm here alone. Actually I'm here to sing with her.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Yes, well, we take these shows very seriously here at East High. I called for the pairs audition and you didn't respond. Free period is now over.\n\nMs. Darbus begins walking away.\n\nTROY: She has an amazing voice.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Perhaps the next musical.\n\nKelsi gets up from the piano bench and picks up a stack of music sheets. She trips and they go flying. Gabriella and Troy run over to her to help pick them up.\n\nTROY: You're a composer. You wrote the song Ryan and Sharpay just sang?\n\nKelsi stares.\n\nTROY: And the entire show?\n\nKelsi nods.\n\nTROY: Well that's really cool. I, uh, (Troy holds out his hand) can't wait to hear the rest of the show.\n\nKelsi takes his hand and he helps her up.\n\nTROY: So, why are you so afriad of Ryan and Sharpay. I mean, it is your show.\n\nKELSI: It is?\n\nTROY: Isn't the composer of the show kind of like the playmaker in basketball?\n\nKELSI: Playmaker?\n\nTROY: You know the one that makes everyone else look good. I mean, without you there is no show. You're the playmaker, Kelsi.\n\nKELSI: I am?\n\nTroy nods.\n\nKELSI: Do you want to hear how the duet is supposed to sound?\n\nKelsi sits at the piano. Gabriella and Troy step over as Kelsi sets up sheet music and plays. Kelsi looks pointedly at the music then Troy.What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)(Troy and Gabriella sing the duet as Kelsi plays the piano.)\n\nTROY: Woah, it's nice.\n\nMS. DARBUS: (standing out) Bolton, Montez - you have a callback. Kelsi give them the duet from the second act. Work on it with them.\n\nKELSi: All right. If you guys want to rehearse I'm usually here free period and after school, and even sometimes during biology class. You can come and rehearse anytime. Or you can come to my house for breakfast. I have a piano, we can rehearse there. After school, before school - whatever works. After basketball class...\n\nTroy flips through the sheets.\n\nTROY: What?\n\nCUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH ENTRANCE, DAY\n\nSHARPAY: (V.O.) Callback!\n\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAY, DAY\n\nSHARPAY: Ahh!\n\nSharpay fans herself as she and her brother stare at the callback sheet.\n\nRYAN: (reading from the Call Back sheet) Callback for roles Arnold and Minnie next Thursday, 3:30 PM. Ryan and Sharpay Evans. Gabriella Montez and Troy Bolton.\n\nSHARPAY: Is this some kind of joke? They didn't even audition!\n\nRYAN: Maybe we're being punked.\n\nSHARPAY: What?\n\nRYAN: Maybe we're being filmed right now. Maybe we'll get to meet Ashton.\n\nSHARPAY: Oh shut up Ryan!\n\nZeke, Chad, and Jason walk up beside them and laugh.\n\nCHAD: What's wrong?\n\nThe basketball players read the list. Chad's face falls and the boys looks confused.\n\nCHAD: What?\n\nChad glances at Ryan and Sharpay in disbelief before walking away. Sharpay storms off and the others step up for a closer look.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH CAFETERIA\n(On the middle level of the cafeteria, Sharpay paces back and forth in front of the railing. Behind her is the thespian posse including Ryan and Kelsi.)\n\nSHARPAY: How dare she sign up? I've already chosen colors for my dressing room!\n\nRYAN: And she hasn't even asked our permission to join the drama club.\nSharpay slams the table.\n\nSHARPAY: Someone's gotta tell her the rules.\n\nRYAN: Exactly. (Ryan pauses) And what are the rules?\n\nSharpay scoffs and walks back to the railing. The camera pans to Chad at a table with jocks and cheerleaders. Behind them, Zeke paces on the platform.\nStick to the Status Quo(Zeke begins to sing and gets his group's attention. He throws a ball to another guy. He steps up and puts his arms around Chad and another jock. The group encourages everyone to move closer. The group looks confused when Zeke tells them he loves to bake. The group dances and pushes down Zeke into his seat.\n\nAt the braniacs table, Martha reads a book and begins to sing. Her friends put their hands towards her and encourage her to share. Martha stands and strikes some hip-hop poses. The braniacs shake their hands no and motion to be quiet. The braniacs take their books and dance. They point to the books and wag their fingers at Martha.At the skater table, another guy begins to share his secret. He plays a cello and motions playing it with his hands. The skaters shake their hands and heads dramatically. They motion skateboarding and shake their arms.\n\nSharpay and Ryan watch the students at the lunch tables below in synchronized dance. The skater plays cello. A cheerleader plays with a basketball. A student break dances on the floor. Martha dances on a table with a jock. A cheerleader ruffles Chad's hair. He tosses a basketball behind him and rolls on the floor before leaping to his feet. The scene becomes more and more chatoic as the different groups begin to intermingle.\n\nSharpay sing in protest as she paces behind the rail. The students begin to become self-conscious and retreating back to their circles. Ryan joins Sharpay at the rail. Sharpay puts a hand up to stop  Ryan and sing. They sing together.\n\nThe students are all seated. The skater pops up from the table and is pulled down by his posse. Martha stands and her posse shakes their hands. Zeke puts a knee up on the table seat, holding cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The jocks put their fingers to their hands and Zeke's cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e flips over.\n\nSharpay yells. Taylor and Gabriella walk in.)\n\nGABRIELLA: Why is everybody staring at you?\n\nTAYLOR: Not me, you.\n\nGABRIELLA: (distressed) Because of the callbacks? I can't have people staring at me! I really can't!(Cont.) Stick to the Status Quo(The students perform a synchronized dance at the lunch tables. Sharpay and Ryan walk down the stairs as the other students continue dancing. Taylor and Gabriella walk through the crowd. Gabriella slips in milk and her cheese fries land on Sharpay.)\n\nSHARPAY: Ahhh!\n\nGabriella tries to wipe Sharpay's jacket. The jocks stare.\n\nGABRIELLA: I am so sorry.\n\nTaylor steers her away. Chad grabs hold of Troy.\n\nCHAD: You do not want to get into that man. (pointing to Sharpay) Too much drama.\n\nTROY: Yeah.\n\nMS. DARBUS: What is going on here?\n\nThe cafeteria stares at Sharpay. She takes a deep breath.\n\nSHARPAY: Look at this! That Gabriella girl just dumped her lunch on me, on purpose. It's all part of their plan to ruin our musical. And Troy and his baskeball robots are obviously behind it. Why do you think he auditioned? After all the hard work you've put into the show, it just doesn't seem right!\n\nStudents move aside as Sharpay runs upstairs. Ms. Darbus walks off. Ryan looks down at the cheese fries.\n\nTROY: (to Chad) What's up?\n\nCHAD: What's up? Oh, let's see... um. You missed free period workout yesterday to audition for some heinous musical And now suddenly people are... confessing.\n\nChad pulls Zeke towards them. Zeke still hold the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nCHAD: Yeah, and Zeke. Zeke is baking. Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e!\n\nTROY: Oh what's that?\n\nZEKE: Oh, it's a creamy custard-like filling with a caramelized surface. It's really satisfying.\nTroy and Zeke nod their heads excitedly.\n\nCHAD: Shut up Zeke!\n\nZeke's face falls and he walks up to the skater. The fist bump. CHad and Troy go to the table.\n\nCHAD: Look, you see what's happening here man? Our team is coming apart because of your singing thing. Even the drama geeks and the braniacs suddenly think they can... talk to us. Look the skater dudes are mingling. (Chad points to the skaters talking with Zeke) Suddenly people think that they can do other stuff. Stuff that is not their stuff. They've got you thinking about show tunes when we've got a playoff game next week.\n\nCUT TO: INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, DAY\nCoach Bolton sits at his desk. He has a pencil behind his ear and eats a sandwich. He reads a newspaper showing Troy shooting a layup. The headline reads, \"Knights to battle Wildcats for District Playoffs\". Ms. Darbus walks in. Teen boys in towels see her as they emerge from the showers and she averts her eyes. Someone throws a towel which nearly hits her. Ms. Darbus enters Coach Bolton's office, shakes her scarf, and removes her glasses. He looks up.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Alright Bolton. Cards on the table right now.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Huh?\n\nMS. DARBUS: You're tweaked because I put your stars in detention and now you're getting even.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: What are you talking about Darbus? (putting down his newspaer)\n\nMS. DARBUS: Your all-star son turned up at my audition. Now I give every student an even chance, which is a long and honorable tradition in the theater. Something you wouldn't understand, but if her is planning any sort of practical joke in my chapel of the arts-\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Troy doesn't even sing.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Oh, well, you're wrong about that, but I will not allow my \"Twinkle Towne\" musicale to be made into farce.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: \"Twinkle Towne\"?\n\nMS. DARBUS: See, I knew it. (wagging a finger)\n\nCOACH BOLTON: (smiling) Hey...\n\nMS. DARBUS: I knew it. (putting on her glasses)\nMs. Darbus storms out.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Sounds like a winner. Good luck on Broadway.\n\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH CAFETERIA, DAY\n\nGABRIELLA: Is Sharpay really really mad at me? I said I was sorry.\n\nTAYLOR: Look, no one has beaten Sharpay out for a musical since kindergarten.\n\nGABRIELLA: I wasn't trying to beat anyone out. We didn't even audition, we were just singing.\n\nTAYLOR: You won't convince Sharpay of that. I'm telling you, if that girl could figure out a way to play both Romeo and Juliet, her own brother would be aced out of a job.\n\nGABRIELLA: I told you, it just happened, but I liked it. A lot. Did you ever feel like there's this whole other person inside of you just looking for a way to come out?\n\nTAYLOR: Not really, no.\n\nThey look at each other, smile, and chuckle. The school bell rings.\n\nTAYLOR: Let's go.\n\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY\nZeke walks up to Sharpay's locker.\n\nZEKE: Hey Sharpay. Um, I just thought since Troy Bolton's gonna be in your show...\n\nSHARPAY: (puts a finger up to silence him) Troy Bolton is not in my show.\n\nSharpay pulls a shirt on a hanger from her locker.\n\nZEKE: OK, um. Well I just thought maybe, uh, you could watch me play ball sometime.\n\nSHARPAY: I'd rather stick pins in my eyes.\n\nZEKE: Wouldn't that be awfully uncomfortable?\n\nSHARPAY: Evaporate tall person!\n\nSharpay slams the locker and walks away. Zeke watches.\n\nZEKE: I bake! If that helps...\n\nLooking dejected, he leans against the wall.The camera cuts to Gabriella at her locker. As she opens it, a piece of paper falls. She opens it and smiles. She puts it back in her locker.\nCUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH ROOFTOP, DAY\nTroy waits at the garden rooftop as Gabriella climbs up the stairs, smiling widely.\n\nGABRIELLA: (looking around) Wow, it's like a jungle out here.\n\nTROY: Yeah, just like that cafeteria.\n\nGABRIELLA: Well, I just humiliated myself into the next century.\n\nTROY: No, come on.\n\nGABRIELLA: So this is your private hideout?\n\nTROY: Yeah, thanks to the science club. Which means my buddies don't even know it exisits.\n\nGABRIELLA: You pretty much have the school wired, don't you Troy? Seems to me like everyone on campus wants to be your friend.\n\nTROY: (laughs) Unless we lose.\n\nGABRIELLA: Well I'm sure it's tricky being the coach's son.\n\nTROY: Makes me practice a little harder, I guess.\nI don't know what he's gonna say when he finds out about the singing.\n\nGABRIELLA: You worried?\n\nTROY: My parent's friends are always saying, \"Your son's the basketball guy. You must be so proud.\"\n\nTroy stares off solemly.\n\nTROY: Sometimes I don't wanna be the basketball guy. I wanna be a guy. You know?\n\nGABRIELLA: I saw the way you treated Kelsi at the audition yesterday. Do your friends know that guy?\n\nTroy sighs.\n\nTROY: To them, I'm the playmaker dude.\n\nGABRIELLA: They don't know enough about you Troy. At my other schools I was the freaky math girl. It's cool coming here and being anyone I wanna be. When I was singing with you, I just felt like a girl.\n\nTROY: (pointing) You even looked like one too.\n\nGabriela laughs. Troy sits beside her on a bench.\n\nGABRIELLA: Remember in kindergarten how you'd meet a kid and know nothing about them. Than ten seconds later you play like you're best friends because you didn't have to be anything but yourself?\n\nTROY: Yeah.\n\nGABRIELLA: Singing with you felt like that.\n\nTROY: Well, uh... I never thought about singing, that's for sure. Till you.\n\nGABRIELLA: So you really wanna do the callbacks?\n\nTROY: Hey, just call me freaky callback boy.\n\nGABRIELLA: You're a cool guy Troy. But not for the reasons your friends think. And thanks for showing me your top secret hiding place. Like kindergarten.\n\nThey smile at each other and look away. The bell rings. Troy grabs Gabriella's hand and they hurry down the stairs.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH MUSIC ROOM, DAY\nKelsi plays the piano.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY\nTroy leans on the stair railway reading sheet music.\nTROY: (singing) We're soaring, flying. There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach...\nRyan heads upstairs and hears Troy singing. He presses his ear up to the door. He jiggles the door handle, but it's locked.\nTROY: ...If we're trying, then we're breaking...\nTroy notices the handle jiggling. Ryan drops to the floor and peeks through the gap in the door. He stands, looking puzzled.\nCUT TO: INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM, DAY\nGabriella stands reading sheet music.\nGABRIELLA: (singing) creating space between us til we're separate hearts\nIn the hall, Sharpay hears Gabriella and perks up. She enters the bathroom and Gabriella panics.\n\nSharpay glances towards the sink and sees no one. Sharpay eyes the stalls and kicks one open, giving a yell. She turns and looks at the mirrors, checking herself out. She leaves the bathroom and Gabriella emerges from behind a wall and watches her go, breathing a sigh of relief.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH MUSIC ROOM, DAY\nGabriella sits beside Kelsi, who plays the piano.\nGABRIELLA: (singing) There's not a star in heaven that we...\nThe scene changes and it is now Troy practicing with Kelsi. He circles the piano while holding a mallet as a microphone.\nTROY: (singing) ...flying. There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach...\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH GYM, DAY\n\nCOACH BOLTON: (walking down the line as the basketball players practice passing the ball) Let's go guys! Make it sharp! To the chest, come one! Pop it! Come on guys, step with it! Let's go!(pointing) Come on, move it! Let's go! Come on, guys focus! Focus! Get your head in the game! Move it!\n\nCoach Bolton turns to Jason.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: You seen Troy?\n\nJASON: No, coach.\n\nCoach Bolton gives him ball, whistles, and walks away.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Again, let's go.\n\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH THEATER, DAY\nGabriella bobs her head and taps her foot as she sews a costume. She smiles and looks at Troy, who also bobs his head and taps his foot as he paints prop boxes. Troy stiffens when he notices Ms. Darbus looking. Troy and Gabriella look at each other again and resume.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH GYM, DAY\n\nCOACH BOLTON: That's it guys. Hit the showers. Good hustle. Let's see that in the game.\n\nTroy arrives as the team leaves. Chad hands him a basketball.\n\nTROY: I, uh, think I'm gonna stay awhile. Work on some free throws.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Well since you missed practice, I think your team deserves a little effort from you today.\n\nCoach Bolton stalks away. Troy wears a guilty expression.\n\nGabriella appraoches Troy as he takes a shot.\n\nGABRIELLA: Wow, so this is your real stage.\n\nTROY: Yeah, I guess you could call it that. Or just a smelly gym.\n\nTroy hands Gabriella the ball. She takes a shot and makes it.\n\nTROY: Woah! Don't tell me you're good at hoops too.\n\nGABRIELLA: You know, I once scored 41 points at a league championship game.\n\nTROY: No way.\n\nGABRIELLA: Mmmhmm. And the same day I invented the space shuttle and microwave popcorn.\n\nTROY: Microwave popcorn. Haha funny.\n\nTroy takes a shot and makes it.\n\nGABRIELLA: I've been rehearsing with Kelsi\n\nTROY: Me too. And, uh, by the way, uh. I missed practice. So if I get kicked off the team it should be on your conscience.\n\nGABRIELLA: Hey I wasn't the one who told you-\n\nTROY: Gabriella, chill.\n\nShe takes the ball and runs.\n\nTROY: Hey that's traveling. No, that's really bad traveling.\n\nTroy catches up to her. He picks her up from behind and spins her. They laugh. Coach Bolton walks in.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Miss, I'm sorry. This is a closed practice.\n\nTroy smiles awkwardly.\n\nTROY: Dad come on, practice is over.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Not till the last player leaves the gym. Team rule.\n\nGABRIELLA: Oh, sorry, sir.\n\nTROY: Um, dad, this is Gabriella Montez.\n\nGabriella holds out a hand.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Ah your detention buddy.\n\nGabriella's smile fades and she retracts her hand awkwardly.\n\nGABRIELLA: I'll see you later Troy. (handing Troy the ball) Nice meeting you Coach Bolton.\n\nCoach Bolton nods. Gabriella jogs away.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: You as well, Miss Montez.\n\nTROY: Dad, detention was my fault, not hers.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: You haven't missed practice in three years. That girl shows up (pointing)\n\nTROY: That girl is named Gabriella. She's very nice.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Helping you miss practice doesn't make her very nice. Not in my book or your team's.\n\nTROY: Dad, she's not a problem. She's just a girl.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: But you're not just a guy, Troy.\nYou're the team leader.\nWhat you do affects not only this team, but the entire school. And withut you completely focused, we're not gonna win next week. The championship games, they don't come along all the time. They're something special.\n\nTROY: Yeah, well, a lot of things are special Dad.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: But you're a playmaker, not a singer, right?\n\nTROY: Did you ever think that maybe I could be both?\nCoach Bolton looks taken aback. Troy drops the ball and walks off, revealing his teammates hiding by the gym door.\n\nCHAD: Let's go.\n\nThe team follows Troy.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH LIBRARY, DAY\nTroy looks for a book as Chad follows him.\n\nCHAD: What spell has this elevated-IQ temptress girl cast that suddenly makes you (pointing) want to be in a musical?\n\nTROY: (putting hands up) Look, I just did it. Who cares?\n\nCHAD: Who cares? (grabbing Troy's shoulder) How about your most loyal best friend?\n\nMISS FALSAFF: (emerging from between the bookshelves) Quiet in here Mr. Danforth\n\nMISS FALSAFF: It's him, Miss Falsaff, not me. (to Troy) Look, you're a hoops dude (handing Troy a basketball) not a musical singer person.\n\nTroy walks forward and tosses the basketball back to Chad. Chad runs up.\n\nCHAD: Have you ever seen Michael Crawford on a cereal box?\n\nTROY: (taking a book form a shelf) Who's Michael Crawford?\n\nCHAD: Exactly my point!\n\nTroy fips a page in the dictionary on a pedestal. Chad places his ball on top to stop him.\n\nCHAD: He was the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. Now my mom, she's seen that musical 27 times and she put Michael Crawford's picture in our refrigerator. Yeah, not on it. In it. So my point is if you play basketball you're gonna end up on a cereal box. If you sing in musicals, you're gonna end up in my mom's refrigerator.\n\nTROY: Why would she put his picture in her refrigerator?\n\nCHAD: One of her crazy diet ideas. Look I don't attempt to understand the female mind Troy.\n\nMiss Falsaff pokes her head out and looks at them. Both boys looks away.\n\nCHAD: It's frightening territory. (as the boys walk away)\nTroy sits down with the book at a table. Chad puts one foot up on the seat beside him and places his basketball on the table.\n\nCHAD: How can you expect the rest of us to be focused on a game if you're off somewhere in leotards singing (Chad motions jazz hands) \"Twinkle Towne\"?\n\nTROY: No one said anything about leotards.\n\nCHAD: Not yet my friend, but just you wait. We need you captain, big time.\n\nMISS FALSAFF: Mr. Danforth\n\nChad puts his hands up, feigning innocence.\n\nCHAD: I tried to tell him Miss Falsaff. (to Try) Really tried.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY\nZeke, Chad, and Jason enter the classroom as Sharpay sees from the hallway. She pulls Ryan towards her.\n\nSHARPAY: Something isn't right.\n\nThey walk up to the door and watch the basketball players approach Taylor.\n\nCHAD: Hey look, we need to talk.\n\nTAYLOR: Go.\n\nRYAN: (whispering) They must be trying to figure out a way to make sure Troy and Gabriella actually beat us out. (Sharpay grimaces) The jocks run most of the school, but if they get Troy into the musical then they've conquered the entire student body.\n\nSHARPAY: And if those science girls get Gabriella hooked up with Troy Bolton, the scholastic club goes from drool to cool. Ryan, we need to save our show from people who don't know the difference between a Tony Award and Tony Hawk.\n\nThey saunter away.\n\nTAYLOR: Do you really think that's gonna work?\n\nCHAD: It's the only way to save Troy and Gabriella from themselves. So we on?\n\nTAYLOR: Yeah.\n\nCHAD: Good, so we start tomorrow then.\n\nTAYLOR: OKay, the first thing.\n\nCHAD: Nice. (to Jason and Zeke) Let's gp.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH ENTRANCE, DAY\nA skater rides past a few students. Chad peers out from behind a stone post, then beckons Taylor. She rolls her bag over.

We synched?\n\nTAYLOR: Whatever.\n\nCHAD: Alright then we're on go mode for lunch exactly at 12:05\n\nTAYLOR: Yes Chad, we're a go. (waving her hand in his face) But we're not Charlie's Angels, okay?\n\nTaylor hands Chad her laptop.\n\nCHAD: I can dream, can't I?\n\nTaylor rolls her eyes and walks away. Chad heads off, in a creeping motion.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY\nStudents filter down the stairs. The school bell rings.\nCUT TO: INT.

A legend.\n\nCHAD: Yes, legends, one and all. But do you think that any of these Wildcat legeds became legends by getting involved in musical auditions just days before their league championships?\n\nBASKETBALL TEAM: Get your head in the game!\n\nCHAD: No. These Wildcat legends became legends because they never took their eye off the prize.\n\nBASKETBALL TEAM: Get your head in the game!\n\nCHAD: Now, who was the first sophmore ever to make starting varsity?\n\nBASKETBALL TEAM: Troy!\n\nCHAD: Who voted him our team captain this year?\n\nBASKETBALL TEAM: Us!\n\nCHAD: And who is gonna get their sorry butts kicked in Friday's championship game if Troy's worried about an audition?\n\nBASKETBALL TEAM: We are.\n\nTROY: Guys, come on.

Yes, our culture worshipped the aggressor throughout the ages and we end up with spoiled, overpaid, bonehead athletes who contribute little to civilization other than (gesturing to the poster) slam dunks and touchdowns. That is the inevitable world of Troy Bolton.\n\nGabriella looks amused. A student puts up the poster.\n\nTAYLOR: But the path of the mind, the path we're on, ours is the path that has brought us to these people: (each person mentioned appears on the slideshow) Eleanor Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo, Sandra Day O'Connor, Madame Curie, Jane Goodall, Oprah Winfrey, and so many others who the world reveres.\n\nGABRIELLA: Ah, but what is... I've got Kelsi waiting for me to rehearse.\n\nTAYLOR: Gabriella! Troy Bolton represents one side of evolution.

I thought that you're my friends. Win together, lose together, teammates.\n\nCHAD: (propping up the laptop) But suddenly the girl, and the singing.\n\nTROY: Man, I'm for the team! (a teammate discreetly records Troy) I've always been for the team. She's just someone I met.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY\nGabriella waches a livestream of Troy talking and furrows her brow.\n\nTROY: All right, the singing thing is nothing. Just a way to keep my nerves down. It all means nothing to me. You're my guys and this is our team. Gabriella is not important. I'll forget about her. I'll forget the audition and we'll go out and get that championship. Everyone happy now?\n\nTAYLOR: Behold, lunkhead basketball man.\n\nA tear rolls down Gabriella's face. The braniacs walk away, except Taylor.\n\nTAYLOR: So Gabriella, we would love to have you for the scholastic decathalon.

She continues on and walks along an empty hallway.)\nGabriella turns the corner to her locker. Troy walks up and puts a hand on her locker..\n\nTROY: Hey, how you doing?\n\nGabriella ignores him.\n\nTROY: Listen, there's something I wanna talk to you about.\n\nGABRIELLA: And here it is. I know what it's like to carry a load with your friends. I get it. You've got your boys Troy. It's okay. So we're good.\n\nTROY: (looking slightly puzzled) Good about what? I was gonna talk to you about the final callbacks.\n\nGABRIELLA: I don't wanna do the callbacks either. Who are we trynig to kid? You've got your team and I've got mine. I'll do the scholastic decathalon and you'll win the championships. It's where we belong. (pulling out sheet music and handing it to Troy) Go wildcats.\n\nTROY: But I-\n\nGABRIELLA: Me neither.\n\nGabriella leaves.

BOLTON HOME, DAY\nCoach Bolton stands at the door frame and watches Troy shoot a basket and miss. Troy dribbles betweens his legs, takes a shot and misses again. He grabs another ball and dribble. Spinning towards the hoop, he shoots and misses. He grunts in anger and hurls the ball at the fence. Coach Bolton looks on concernedly Troy lays down on the grass and puts his arms over his face, frustrated. Coach Bolton goes back inside.\nCUT TO: EXT. MONTEZ HOME, DAY\nGabriella steps out onto the balcony and stares off. She heaves a sigh.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH CAFETERIA, DAY\nTroy enters the cafeteria with a bagged lunch and milk carton.

Troy starts to go.\n\nCHAD: (lifting a hand up) Troy, hey\n\nTroy shakes his head faintly and leaves. Gabriella wears a miserable look. Chad and Taylor step away from their tables with guilty expressions.\nCUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH ROOFTOP, DAY\nTroy sits alone among the plants.

Look, about the singing thing, we-\n\nTROY: Look, dude I don't even wanna talk about it.\n\nCHAD: We just want you to know we're gonna be there. OKay, cheering for you.\n\nTROY: Huh?\n\nZEKE: Yeah, if singing is something you wanna do, we should be boosting you up, not tearing you down.\n\nCHAD: Yeah, win or lose, we're teammates. That's what we're about. Even if you turn out to be the worst singer in the world.\n\nChad punches Troy on the shoulder.\n\nJASON: (stepping forward) Which, you know, we don't you because we haven't actually hears you sing.\n\nThe boys agree.\n\nTROY: And you're not gonna hear me sing, guys. (nodding) 'Cause Gabriella won't even talk to me... and I don't know why.\n\nTroy's teammmates wear guilty expressions. Chad sighs.\n\nCHAD: We do.\n\nZEKE: (pulling out baked good from his lunch bag and handnig them to Troy) I baked these fresh today. You probably want to try one before we tell you the rest.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY\nGabriella looks at a textbook and does a chemistry equation on the chalkboard. Taylor and the braniacs walk up.\n\nTAYLOR: Gabriella, we were jerks. No, we were worse than jerks because we were mean jerks. We thought that Troy and the whole singing thing were killing our chances of having you on the scholastic decathalon team.\n\nGABRIELLA: I heard what he had to say. I'm on your team now. Done.\n\nTAYLOR: No, not done. We knew that Chad could get Troy to make him say things to make you want to forget about the callbacks. We planned it, and we're embarassed and sorry.\n\nGABRIELLA: No one forced Troy to say anything. And you know what, it's okay. We should be preparing for the decathalon now, so it's time to move on.\n\nTAYLOR: No, it's not okay. The decathalon is whatever, but how you feel about us and even more, Troy, that's what really matters.\n\nGabriella stares at Taylor, then turns back to her work. As she writes on the chalkboard, Taylor faces the braniacs.\n\nTAYLOR: (in a low voice) We tried.\n\nThe braniacs leave. Gabriella wears an uncertain look.\nCUT TO: EXT.

MONTEZ: Oh, Troy!\n\nGabriella stands at the stairs and mouths \"No\".\n\nMS. MONTEZ: Um... Gabriella is kind of busy with homework and such, so now's not really a good time.\n\nTROY: I made a mistake, Ms. Montez, and I would really like to let Gabriella know that. Could you tell her that I came by to see her?\n\nMS. MONTEZ: (nodding) I will, Troy. Goodnight.\n\nTROY: Goodnight, thank you.\n\nTroy walks away and Gabriella's mom shuts the door. Handsin his pocket, Troy steps on the lawn and pauses. He glances at the house and wears a thoughtful expression as he walks off. He sneaks into the backyard and makes a call on his cellphone.\nCUT TO: INT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT\nIn her room, Gabriella reads as her phone starts ringing. She picks it up and answers it.\n\nGABRIELLA: Hello?\n\nTROY: What you heard...\n\nCUT TO: EXT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT\n\nTROY: ...the other day, none of that is true.

MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT\n\nGABRIELLA:...treating you differently because of it\n\nTROY: Maybe that's because I don't only want to be the basketball guy. They can't handle it. That's not my problem, it's theirs.\n\nGABRIELLA: But your dad?\n\nTROY: And it's not about my dad. This is about how I feel and I'm not letting the team down. (Gabriella walks to her bedpost and leans) They let me down. So I'm gonna sing. What about you?\n\nGABRIELLA: I don't know Troy.\n\nTROY: Well you need to say yes because I brought you something.\n\nGABRIELLA: What do you mean?\n\nTROY: Turn around.\n\nTurning, Gabriella finds Troy stading outside on her balcony. She sets the phone aside and opens her door.\n\nTROY: (singing) This could be the start of something new. It feels so right to be here with you, oh. And now looking in your eyes, I feel in my heart, the start of something (spoken) new.\nGabriella smiles tearfully. Troy holds up the sheet music.\n\nTROY:  It's a pairs audition.\n\nNodding, Gabriella steps outside and takes the music. As she walks past him, he cracks a grin.

Go ahead and put five grams of this in. (as a student pours in a purple powder and the mixture fizzez) And that causes it to change from an acidic state causing the color to change from pink to blue. Just like those pH test strips. (looking at the clock) Oh, gotta go. See you guys later.\n\nRushing out, Gabriella removes her apron and sets it on a hook.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY\nTroy slows his run and leans casually against the lockers. He peers at his wrist, which has no watch.

Not with all these people staring at me.\n\nTROY: (grabbing Gariella's arm as she begins to walk away) Hey, hey, hey look at me, right at me. Right at me. It'll be like the first time we sang together. Do you remember? (Gabriella nods) Like kindergarten.\n\nTroy points to Kelsi, who starts playing. The background of a city skyline at night lowers from the rafters. Troy and Gabriela gaze at each other. Troy lifts his microphone to sing.Breaking Free(Troy sings. He motions upward towards the sky. He and Gabriella hold hands and step forward. They pull away and face each other. Troy slides to Gabriella and they step forward again. The audience begins to clap in rythm. Gabriella begins to gain confidence and dance a little with Troy. Gabriella steps to the side to take off her labcoat, revealing a pink top and floral skirt underneath, as Troy raises an arm and walks cross stage. He does some footwork and points to Gabriella. On the other side of the stage, she sings and motions. They walk towards each other and spin around. Gabriella motions for Troy to follow her to the piano and they sing next to Kelsi.  Chad stands up and claps in rythm, encouraging others to get up and clap too. Coach Bolton and Ms. Montez enter and watch their children sing. Gabriella pulls Troy towards center stage as a giant prop moon lowers from the rafters. Troy spins Gabriella. Ms. Darbus claps. Troy and Gabriella dance around the prop and walk to the front of the stage. As the song slows down, they gaze into each other's eyes.)\nGabriella smiles at Troy. The crowd cheers and they turn to look. Chad and Taylor applaud with their teams. Coach BOlton smiles faintly and glances around. Troy and Gabriella gesture to Kelsi, who stands and takes a bow. Troy kisses Gabriela's cheek. Kelsi points to a stagehand, who pulls a rope.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH GYM, DAY\nThe championship game is in proress and the Wildcats are down by one point. Troy dribbles. Eight seconds remain. Troy passes to a teammate. He darts across the court and the teammate passes the ball back. Troy shoots and scors. The Wildcats basketball team and cheerleaders gather round him to celebrate as a Knights basketball player puts his hands on his head in defeat.\n\nCoach Bolton shakes a man's hand and carries the trophy over to the team.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: (As he runs to the team) Coming through, coming through!\n\nCoach Bolton hands the trophy to Troy and they lift him up.\n\nCHAD: Hey, what team?\n\nBASKETBALL PLAYERS: Wildcats!\n\nCHAD: What team?\n\nBASKETBALL PLAYERS: Wildcats!\n\nCHAD: What team?\n\nBASKETBALL PLAYERS: Wildcats!\n\nCHAD: Wildcats!\n\nBASKETBALL PLAYERS: Get your head in the game!\n\nThe crowd cheers and there is a big commotion all around.\n\nCoach Bolton hugs Troy and Ms. Darbus steps up.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: I'm proud of you, son.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Bravo!\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Brava!\n\nMS. DARBUS: Ah!\n\nCoach Bolton and Ms. Darbus step away as Gabriella runs up to Troy.\n\nWILDCAT: (offscreen) Hey, hey! Troy you're the man!\n\nTROY: (pointing) No, you!\n\nGABRIELLA: (wrapping her arms around Troy) Congratulations Wildcat!\n\nTROY: What about your team?\n\nGABRIELLA: We won too!\n\nTroy and Gabriella move to kiss.\n\nCHAD: (coming between them to shove a ball to Troy) Yo! Team voted you the game ball, captain.\n\nTROY: (slightly miffed) Yeah thank you, thanks a lot.\n\nTroy walks off and Chad grabs hold of Taylor in his arms as she runs past.\nCHAD: So.. you're going with me to the after party, right?\n\nTAYLOR: (happily surprised) Like on a date?\n\nCHAD: Must be your lucky day.\n\nTaylor turns to join Gabriella and Troy breaks away from her.\n\nTAYLOR: Chad just asked me out.\nThey spin and laugh happily. Sharpay and Ryan step up to Gabriella.\n\nSHARPAY: Well, congratulations. I guess I'm going to be the understudy in case you can't make one of the shows, so break a leg.\n\nGabriella looks startled. Sharpay laughs.\n\nSHARPAY: (touching Gabriella's arm) In theater that means good luck.\n\nSharpay laughs and walks away, with Ryan behind her. Zeke runs up to her with a gym bag in hand.\n\nZEKE: Hey Sharpay, I'm sorry you didn't get the lead, but I think you're really good. (touching Sharpay's shoulder) I admire you so much.\n\nSHARPAY: And why wouldn't you? Now, buh-bye.\n\nSharpay and Ryan begin to walk away.\n\nZEKE: Uh, wait, (reaching into his bag and pulling out a bag with cookies) I baked you some cookies.\n\nSHARPAY: Ew!\n\nRyan takes the cookies with a smile.\n\nRYAN: Nice game!\n\nZEKE: Thanks\n\nZeke runs off. A boy shakes the trophy beside Kelsi. Troy hands her a basketball.\n\nTROY: Composer, here's your game ball. You deserve it playmaker.\n\nThey cheer. Smiling, Kelsi steps away from the group. Jason is about to run to the group, but he stops and turns to Kelsi. He pulls her hat off, and her hair cascades down. He helps her shoot the game ball, which goes in.We're All in This Together(The school marhcing band plays in the bleachers and students dance. The cheerleaders dance at center court while the others dance near the stands. Chad does a split jump. Troy sings and dances with members of various cliques. Gabriella steps out and dances, passing by Kelsi and Taylor, ending up in Troy's arms. The whole group does a synchronized dance. They clap and rock out. Ryan joins in from the stands. Ryan jumps into the crowd and is caughtand lifted by basketball players and Sharpay struts underneath, taking Zeke's hand. The group repeats the synchronized dance. Pairs of basketball players and cheerleaders dance at center court. Chad dances with Taylor. They take large steps and kick to the side. Then, all the pairs dance at the same time. The girls kick and roll over the guys' backs. Troy and Gabriella dance in front of the marching band. Ryan, Sharpay, Chad, and Taylor join in. Jason, Kelsi, and Zeke join in too and more students follow soon after. Troy puts an arm around Gabriella. They link arms with Sharpay and Ryan. Chad, Taylor, zeke, and Kelsi join the group. Troy and Gabriella dance back into the students. Sharpay and Ryan follow them. Chad and Taylor dance back through the crowd. Jason and Kelsi follow, along with Zeke and Martha. The students continue dancing as credits roll. Ms. Darbus dances with the Wildcats mascot. The young assitant bows and dances with her. Ms. Darbus leads a conga line.)\nAfter all the commotion has subsided, Zeke is alone surrounded by balloons in the gym. Sharpay rushes in.\n\nSHARPAY: (holding up a cookie) These cookies are genius! The best things I've ever tasted!\n\nShe tosses the cookie behind her.\n\nSHARPAY: Will you make some more for me Zeke?\n\nZeke backs away as she charges to him, kicking balloons out of the way. She catches him and wraps her arms around him, panting.\n\nZEKE: I might even make you a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e!\n\nZeke smiles.Credits2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/33328", "artist_names": "Mike Jones (Ft.

now?\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\nThis revolution, the time will come\nFor us to finally win\nAnd we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah\nOh, oh\n[Verse 2]\nSo, we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered\nIt's hard to fight when the fight ain\u2019t fair\nWe're getting stronger now, find things they never found\nThey might be bigger but we're faster and never scared\nYou can walk away, say we don't need this\nBut there's something in your eyes says we can beat this\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause these things will change\nCan you feel it now?\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\nThis revolution, the time will come\nFor us to finally win\nAnd we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah\nOh, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nTonight, we stand, get off our knees\nFight for what we've worked for all these years\nAnd the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives\nBut we'll stand up champions tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nIt was the night things changed\nCan

just had a slight lack of common sense\nI was the good guy, she was the bad girl\nI'm thinking one girl\nShe thinking me, Earl James and Jimmy\nYep, she had plenty\nBut love for me, she didn't have any\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI was inviting, her into my heart\nBut she was out riding in some other man's car\nShe was my night time, thought I was her star\nGuess I was wrong, but see I'm strong\nWon't take long for me to move on\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease don't worry 'bout me I'm fine\n(Please don't worry 'bout me I'm fine)\nOnly gonna play the fool one time\n(Only gonna play the fool one time)\nTrust me when I say that I'll be okay\nGo on girl (Go on girl)\nGo on girl (Go on girl)\nGo on girl\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can't get it back but I don't want it back\nI realized that she don't know how to act\nTried to settle down and look what I get\nThought it was my time, but I guess not yet\nShe at the bar getting drinks from many men\nI'm in the house, thinking she's with her girlfriends\nJust not knowing, truly not knowing\nI look back now like, \"Man, I was open\"\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI was inviting, her into my heart\nBut she was out riding in some other man's car\nShe was my night time,

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSimona\nYou're getting older\nYour journey's been\nEtched on your skin\nSimona\nWish I had known that\nWhat seemed so strong\nHas been and gone\n\n[Chrous]\nI would call you up every Saturday night\nAnd we'd both stay out 'til the morning light\nAnd we sang \"Here we go again.\"\nAnd though time goes by\nI will always be in a club with you in 1973\nSinging \"Here we go again.\"\n[Verse 2]\nSimona\nWish I was sober\nSo I could see clearly now\nThe rain has gone\nSimona\nI guess it's over\nMy memory plays our tune\nThe same old song\n\n[Chorus]\nI would call you up every Saturday night\nAnd we'd both stay out 'til the morning light\nAnd we sang \"Here we go again.\"\nAnd though time goes by\nI will always be in a club with you in 1973\nSinging \"Here we go

need to count on myself instead\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDid you ever?\nLoose yourself to get what you want\nDid you ever?\nGet on a ride and wanna get off\nDid you ever?\nPush away the ones you should've held close\nDid you ever let go?\nDid you ever not know?\n[Chorus]\nI'm not gonna stop, that's who I am\nI'll give it all I got, that is my plan\nWill I find what I lost?\nYou know you can\nBet on it, bet on it\nBet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)\nI wanna make it right, that is the way\nTo turn my life around, today is the day\nAm I the type of guy who means what I say?\nBet on it, bet on it\nBet on it, bet on it\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow will I know if there's a path worth taking?\nShould I question every move I make?\nWith all I've lost my heart is breaking\nI don't wanna make the same mistake\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDid you ever?\nDoubt your dream will ever come true\nDid you ever?\nBlame the world and never blame you\nI will never\nTry to live a lie again\nI don't wanna win this game if I can't play it my way\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'm not gonna stop, that's who I am\n(Who I am)\nI'll give it all I got, that is my plan (That's my plan)\nWill I find what I lost?\nYou know you

say\nBet on it, bet on it\nBet on it, bet on it\n\n[Bridge]\nOh,Hold up\nGive me room to think\nBring it on down\nGotta work on my swing\nGotta do my own thing\nHold up\n\nIt's no good at all\nTo see yourself and not recognize your face\nOut on my own, it's such a scary place\nThe answers are all inside of me\nAll I gotta do is believe\n[Chorus]\nI'm not gonna stop\nNot gonna stop 'til I get my shot\nThat's who I am, that is my plan\nWill I end up on top?\nYou can bet on it, bet on it\nBet on it, bet on it\nYou can bet on it, bet on it\nBet on it, bet on it\nI wanna make it right, that is

to this\nNow throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm in my Lambo, maggot, my fo' fo' faggot\nDoors lift up, I'm like Go Go Gadget\nSee the shit I got on, homie, I'd hate too\nMy Teflon on, boy, my government issue\nI'll hit your vertebrae, bullets rip through tissues\nYour wife on the futon hugging that Shih Tzu\nHomie, you a bitch, you got feminine ways\nHeard you got four lips and bleed for seven days\nI got fo' fifths and bananas on the K's\nAnd got more whips than a runaway slave\nMe and Yayo go back like some high top fades\nWhen I made fifty mill, Em got paid\nWhen I made sixty mill, Dre got paid\nWhen I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid\nI ain't even gotta rap now, life is made\nSaid I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy, mane\n[Chorus]\nI'm laughing straight to the bank with this\n(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll\nI got the kind of money that the bank can't hold\nGot it off the street movin bundles and O's\nSeventy Three Caprice old school when I roll\nBreeze pass with the E-Pass, fuck the toll\nNo more platinum, I'm wearing gold\nI'm internationally known as the kid with the flow\nThat brings enough dough, it's never enough though\nShit I need mo', new shit out the sto'\nBaby blue was old, fresh off the flo'\nStashbox by the dashbox in case they want war\nMake the purple bring the green in, fuck the law\nI'm oh so raw, I'm hot, I'm sure\nI'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe, boy\nI set the club on fire I told ya\nI'm the general; salute me soldier\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm laughing straight to the bank with this\n(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)\nYou might also like[Outro]\nNow work it out now, shorty work it out\nI wanna see
