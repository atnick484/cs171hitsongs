There won't be no next time!\nI apologize, even though I know it's lies\nI'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar\nIf she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her\nTo the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna\u2014\n[Chorus: Rihanna & Eminem]\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn?\nWell, that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry?\nWell, that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie303Embed"

Nobody's supposed to be here\nI tried that love thing for the last time\nMy heart says \"No, no.\" Nobody's supposed to be here\nBut you came along and changed my mind\n\n[Verse 1]\nI've spent all my life on a search to find\nThe love who'll stay for eternity\nThe heaven sent to fulfill my needs\nBut when I turn around, again, love has knocked me down\nMy heart got broken, oh it hurts so bad\nI'm sad to say love wins again\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo I placed my heart under lock and key\nTo take some time to take care of me\nBut I turn around and you're standing here\n\n[Chorus]\nHow did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here\nI tried that love thing for the last time\nMy heart says \"No, no.\" Nobody's supposed to be here\nBut you came along and changed my mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis time I swear I'm through\nBut, if only you knew how many times I've said those words\nThen fall again, when will I ever learn?\nKnowing these tears I cry, this lovely black butterfly\nMust take a chance, and spread my wings\nLove can make you do some crazy things\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo I placed my heart under lock and key\nTo take some time to take care of me\nBut I turn around and you're standing here\n\n[Bridge]\nYou might also like[Chorus 2]\nHow did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here\nI tried that love thing for the last time\nMy heart says \"No, no.\" Nobody's supposed to be here\nBut you came along and changed my mind\nHow did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here\nI tried that love thing for the last time\nMy heart says \"No, no.\" Nobody's supposed to be here3Embed"

We played all the parts\nThat sweet scene of surrender, when you gave me your heart\nPlease say you will, play it again\n'Cause I love you still, baby this can't be the end\n\n[Chorus]\nWe had it all (we had it all)\nJust like Bogie and Bacall\nStarring in our old late, late show\nSailing away to Key Largo\nHere's lookin' at you, kid (here's lookin' at you, kid)\nMissing all the things we did\nWe can find it once again, I know\nJust like they did in Key Largo\n\n[Chorus]\nWe had it all (we had it all)\nJust like Bogie and Bacall\nStarring in our old late, late show\nSailing away to Key Largo\nHere's lookin' at you, kid (here's lookin' at you, kid)\nMissing all the things we did [fade]You might also like2Embed"
