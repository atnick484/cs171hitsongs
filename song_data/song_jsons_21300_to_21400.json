Lyrics\"We, the governments of Great Britain and the United States, in the name of India, Burma, Malaya, Australia, British East Africa, British Guiana, Hong Kong, Siam, Singapore, Egypt, Palestine, Canada, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines, Hawaii, Alaska, and the Virgin Islands, hereby declare most emphatically, that this is not an imperialist war.\" Thus went a skit put on in the United States in the year 1939 by the Communist party.\n\nTwo years later, Germany invaded Soviet Russia, and the American Communist party, which had repeatedly described the war between the Axis Powers and the Allied Powers as an imperialist war, now called it a \"people's war\" against Fascism. Indeed almost all Americans were now in agreement-capitalists, Communists, Democrats, Republicans, poor, rich, and middle class-that this was indeed a people's war.\n\nWas it?\n\nBy certain evidence, it was the most popular war the United States had ever fought. Never had a greater proportion of the country participated in a war: 18 million served in the armed forces, 10 million overseas; 25 million workers gave of their pay envelope regularly for war bonds. But could this be considered a manufactured support, since all the power of the nation-not only of the government, but the press, the church, and even the chief radical organizations-was behind the calls for all-out war? Was there an undercurrent of reluctance; were there unpublicized signs of resistance?\n\nIt was a war against an enemy of unspeakable evil. Hitler's Germany was extending totalitarianism, racism, militarism, and overt aggressive warfare beyond what an already cynical world had experienced. And yet, did the governments conducting this war-England, the United States, the Soviet Union-represent something significantly different, so that their victory would be a blow to imperialism, racism, totalitarianism, militarism, in the world?\n\nWould the behavior of the United States during the war-in military action abroad, in treatment of minorities at home-be in keeping with a \"people's war\"? Would the country's wartime policies respect the rights of ordinary people everywhere to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? And would postwar America, in its policies at home and overseas, exemplify the values for which the war was supposed to have been fought?\nThese questions deserve thought. At the time of World War II, the atmosphere was too dense with war fervor to permit them to be aired.\n\nFor the United States to step forward as a defender of helpless countries matched its image in American high school history textbooks, but not its record in world affairs. It had opposed the Haitian revolution for independence from France at the start of the nineteenth century. It had instigated a war with Mexico and taken half of that country. It had pretended to help Cuba win freedom from Spain, and then planted itself in Cuba with a military base, investments, and rights of intervention. It had seized Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and fought a brutal war to subjugate the Filipinos. It had \"opened\" Japan to its trade with gunboats and threats. It had declared an Open Door Policy in China as a means of assuring that the United States would have opportunities equal to other imperial powers in exploiting China. It had sent troops to Peking with other nations, to assert Western supremacy in China, and kept them there for over thirty years.\nWhile demanding an Open Door in China, it had insisted (with the Monroe Doctrine and many military interventions) on a Closed Door in Latin America-that is, closed to everyone but the United States. It had engineered a revolution against Colombia and created the \"independent\" state of Panama in order to build and control the Canal. It sent five thousand marines to Nicaragua in 1926 to counter a revolution, and kept a force there for seven years. It intervened in the Dominican Republic for the fourth time in 1916 and kept troops there for eight years. It intervened for the second time in Haiti in 1915 and kept troops there for nineteen years. Between 1900 and 1933, the United States intervened in Cuba four times, in Nicaragua twice, in Panama six times, in Guatemala once, in Honduras seven times. By 1924 the finances of half of the twenty Latin American states were being directed to some extent by the United States. By 1935, over half of U.S. steel and cotton exports were being sold in Latin America.\n\nJust before World War I ended, in 1918, an American force of seven thousand landed at Vladivostok as part of an Allied intervention in Russia, and remained until early 1920. Five thousand more troops were landed at Archangel, another Russian port, also as part of an Allied expeditionary force, and stayed for almost a year. The State Department told Congress: \"All these operations were to offset effects of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia.\"\n\nIn short, if the entrance of the United States into World War II was (as so many Americans believed at the time, observing the Nazi invasions) to defend the principle of nonintervention in the affairs of other countries, the nation's record cast doubt on its ability to uphold that principle.\n\nWhat seemed clear at the time was that the United States was a democracy with certain liberties, while Germany was a dictatorship persecuting its Jewish minority, imprisoning dissidents, whatever their religion, while proclaiming the supremacy of the Nordic \"race.\" However, blacks, looking at anti-Semitism in Germany, might not see their own situation in the U.S. as much different. And the United States had done little about Hitler's policies of persecution. Indeed, it had joined England and France in appeasing Hitler throughout the thirties. Roosevelt and his Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, were hesitant to criticize publicly Hitler's anti-Semitic policies; when a resolution was introduced in the Senate in January 1934 asking the Senate and the President to express \"surprise and pain\" at what the Germans were doing to the Jews, and to ask restoration of Jewish rights, the State Department \"caused this resolution to be buried in committee,\" according to Arnold Offner (American Appeasement).\n\nWhen Mussolini's Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, the U.S. declared an embargo on munitions but let American businesses send oil to Italy in huge quantities, which was essential to Italy's carrying on the war. When a Fascist rebellion took place in Spain in 1936 against the elected socialist-liberal government, the Roosevelt administration sponsored a neutrality act that had the effect of shutting off help to the Spanish government while Hitler and Mussolini gave critical aid to Franco. Offner says:\n\n... the United States went beyond even the legal requirements of its neutrality legislation. Had aid been forthcoming from the United States and from England and France, considering that Hitler's position on aid to France was not firm at least until November 1936, the Spanish Republicans could well have triumphed. Instead, Germany gained every advantage from the Spanish civil war.\n\nWas this simply poor judgment, an unfortunate error? Or was it the logical policy of a government whose main interest was not stopping Fascism but advancing the imperial interests of the United States? For those interests, in the thirties, an anti-Soviet policy seemed best. Later, when Japan and Germany threatened U.S. world interests, a pro-Soviet, anti-Nazi policy became preferable. Roosevelt was as much concerned to end the oppression of Jews as Lincoln was to end slavery during the Civil War; their priority in policy (whatever their personal compassion for victims of persecution) was not minority rights, but national power.\n\nIt was not Hitler's attacks on the Jews that brought the United States into World War II, any more than the enslavement of 4 million blacks brought Civil War in 1861. Italy's attack on Ethiopia, Hitler's invasion of Austria, his takeover of Czechoslovakia, his attack on Poland-none of those events caused the United States to enter the war, although Roosevelt did begin to give important aid to England. What brought the United States fully into the war was the Japanese attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. Surely it was not the humane concern for Japan's bombing of civilians that led to Roosevelt's outraged call for war-Japan's attack on China in 1937, her bombing of civilians at Nan king, had not provoked the United States to war. It was the Japanese attack on a link in the American Pacific Empire that did it.\n\nSo long as Japan remained a well-behaved member of that imperial club of Great Powers who-in keeping with the Open Door Policy- were sharing the exploitation of China, the United States did not object. It had exchanged notes with Japan in 1917 saving \"the Government of the United States recognizes that Japan has special interests in China.\" In 1928, according to Akira Iriye (After Imperialism,), American consuls in China supported the coming of Japanese troops. It was when Japan threatened potential U.S. markets by its attempted takeover of China, but especially as it moved toward the tin, rubber, and oil of Southeast Asia, that the United States became alarmed and took those measures which led to the Japanese attack: a total embargo on scrap iron, a total embargo on oil in the summer of 1941.\n\nAs Bruce Russet says (No Clear and Present Danger): \"Throughout the 1930s the United States government had done little to resist the Japanese advance on the Asian continent,\" But: \"The Southwest Pacific area was of undeniable economic importance to the United States-at the time most of America's tin and rubber came from there, as did substantial quantities of other raw materials.\"\n\nPearl Harbor was presented to the American public as a sudden, shocking, immoral act. Immoral it was, like any bombing-but not really sudden or shocking to the American government. Russett says: \"Japan's strike against the American naval base climaxed a long series of mutually antagonistic acts. In initiating economic sanctions against Japan the United States undertook actions that were widely recognized in Washington as carrying grave risks of war.\"\nPutting aside the wild accusations against Roosevelt (that he knew about Pearl Harbor and didn't tell, or that he deliberately provoked the Pearl Harbor raid\u2014these are without evidence), it does seem clear that he did as James Polk had done before him in the Mexican war and Lyndon Johnson after him in the Vietnam war-he lied to the public for what he thought was a right cause. In September and October 1941, he misstated the facts in two incidents involving German submarines and American destroyers. A historian sympathetic to Roosevelt, Thomas A. Bailey, has written:\n\nFranklin Roosevelt repeatedly deceived the American people during the period before Pearl Harbor. ... He was like the physician who must tell the patient lies for the patient's own good ... because the musses are notoriously shortsighted and generally cannot see danger until it is at their throats. .. .\n\nOne of the judges in the Tokyo War Crimes Trial after World War II, Radhabinod Pal, dissented from the general verdicts against Japanese officials and argued that the United States had clearly provoked the war with Japan and expected Japan to act. Richard Minear (Victors' Justice) sums up Pal's view of the embargoes on scrap iron and oil, that \"these measures were a clear and potent threat to Japan's very existence.\" The records show that a White House conference two weeks before Pearl Harbor anticipated a war and discussed how it should be justified.\n\nA State Department memorandum on Japanese expansion, a year before Pearl Harbor, did not talk of the independence of China or the principle of self-determination. It said:\n\n. . . our general diplomatic and strategic position would be considerably weakened-by our loss of Chinese, Indian and South Seas markets (and by our loss of much of the Japanese market for our goods, as Japan would become more and more self-sufficient) as well as by insurmountable restrictions upon our access to the rubber, tin, jute, and other vital materials of the Asian and Oceanic regions.\n\nOnce joined with England and Russia in the war (Germany and Italy declared war on the United States right after Pearl Harbor), did the behavior of the United States show that her war aims were humanitarian, or centered on power and profit? Was she fighting the war to end the control by some nations over others or to make sure the controlling nations were friends of the United States? In August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill met off the coast of Newfoundland and released to the world the Atlantic Charter, setting forth noble goals for the postwar world, saying their countries \"seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other,\" and that they respected \"the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live.\" The Charter was celebrated as declaring the right of nations to self-determination.\n\nTwo weeks before the Atlantic Charter, however, the U.S. Acting Secretary of State, Sumner Welles, had assured the French government that they could keep their empire intact after the end of the war: \"This Government, mindful of its traditional friendship for France, has deeply sympathized with the desire of the French people to maintain their territories and to preserve them intact.\" The Department of Defense history of Vietnam (The Pentagon Papers) itself pointed to what it called an \"ambivalent\" policy toward Indochina, noting that \"in the Atlantic Charter and other pronouncements, the U.S. proclaimed support for national self-determination and independence\" but also \"early in the war repeatedly expressed or implied to the French an intention to restore to France its overseas empire after the war.\"\n\nIn late 1942, Roosevelt's personal representative assured French General Henri Giraud: \"It is thoroughly understood that French sovereignty will be re-established as soon as possible throughout all the territory, metropolitan or colonial, over which flew the French flag in 1939.\" (These pages, like the others in the Pentagon Papers, are marked \"TOP SECRET-Sensitive.\") By 1945 the \"ambivalent\" attitude was gone. In May, Truman assured the French he did not question her \"sovereignty over Indochina.\" That fall, the United States urged Nationalist China, put temporarily in charge of the northern part of Indochina by the Potsdam Conference, to turn it over to the French, despite the obvious desire of the Vietnamese for independence.\n\nThat was a favor for the French government. But what about the United States' own imperial ambitions during the war? What about the \"aggrandizement, territorial or other\" that Roosevelt had renounced in the Atlantic Charter?\n\nIn the headlines were the battles and troop movements: the invasion of North Africa in 1942, Italy in 1943, the massive, dramatic cross-Channel invasion of German -occupied France in 1944, the bitter battles as Germany was pushed back toward and over her frontiers, the increasing bombardment by the British and American air forces. And, at the same time, the Russian victories over the Nazi armies (the Russians, by the time of the cross-Channel invasion, had driven the Germans out of Russia, and were engaging 80 percent of the German troops). In the Pacific, in 1943 and 1944, there was the island-by-island move of American forces toward Japan, finding closer and closer bases for the thunderous bombardment of Japanese cities.\n\nQuietly, behind the headlines in battles and bombings, American diplomats and businessmen worked hard to make sure that when the war ended, American economic power would be second to none in the world. United States business would penetrate areas that up to this time had been dominated by England. The Open Door Policy of equal access would be extended from Asia to Europe, meaning that the United States intended to push England aside and move in.\n\nThat is what happened to the Middle East and its oil. In August 1945 a State Department officer said that \"a review of the diplomatic history of the past 35 years will show that petroleum has historically played a larger part in the external relations of the United States than any other commodity.\" Saudi Arabia was the largest oil pool in the Middle East. The ARAMCO oil corporation, through Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, got Roosevelt to agree to Lend Lease aid to Saudi Arabia, which would involve the U.S. government there and create a shield for the interests of ARAMCO. In 1944 Britain and the U.S. signed a pact on oil agreeing on \"the principle of equal opportunity,\" and Lloyd Gardner concludes (Economic Aspects of New Deal Diplomacy) that \"the Open Door Policy was triumphant throughout the Middle East.\"\n\nHistorian Gabriel Kolko, after a close study of American wartime policy (The Politics of War), concludes that \"the American economic war aim was to save capitalism at home and abroad.\" In April 1944 a State Department official said: \"As you know, we've got to plan on enormously increased production in this country after the war, and the American domestic market can't absorb all that production indefinitely. There won't be any question about our needing greatly increased foreign markets.\"\nAnthony Sampson, in his study of the international oil business (The Seven Sisters), says:\n\nBy the end of the war the dominant influence in Saudi Arabia was unquestionably the United States. King Ibn Sand was regarded no longer as a wild desert warrior, but as a key piece in the power-game, to be wooed by the West. Roosevelt, on his way back from Yalta in February 1945, entertained the King on the cruiser Quincy, together with his entourage of fifty, including two sons, a prime minister, an astrologer and flocks of sheep for slaughter.\n\nRoosevelt then wrote to Ibn Sand, promising the United States would not change its Palestine policy without consulting the Arabs. In later years, the concern for oil would constantly compete with political concern for the Jewish state in the Middle East, but at this point, oil seemed more important.\n\nWith British imperial power collapsing during World War II, the United States was ready to move in. Hull said early in the war:\n\nLeadership toward a new system of international relationships in trade and other economic affairs will devolve very largely upon the United States because of our great economic strength. We should assume this leadership, and the responsibility that goes with it, primarily for reasons of pure national self-interest.\n\nBefore the war was over, the administration was planning the outlines of the new international economic order, based on partnership between government and big business. Lloyd Gardner says of Roosevelt's chief adviser, Harry Hopkins, who had organized the relief programs of the New Deal: \"No conservative outdid Hopkins in championing foreign investment, and its protection.\"\n\nThe poet Archibald MacLeish, then an Assistant Secretary of State, spoke critically of what he saw in the postwar world: \"As things are now going, the peace we will make, the peace we seem to be making, will be a peace of oil, a peace of gold, a peace of shipping, a peace, in brief . . . without moral purpose or human interest . . .\"\n\nDuring the war, England and the United States set up the International Monetary Fund to regulate international exchanges of currency; voting would be proportional to capital contributed, so American dominance would be assured. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development was set up, supposedly to help reconstruct war-destroyed areas, but one of its first objectives was, in its own words, \"to promote foreign investment.\"\n\nThe economic aid countries would need after the war was already seen in political terms: Averell Harriman, ambassador to Russia, said in early 1944: \"Economic assistance is one of the most effective weapons at our disposal to influence European political events in the direction we desire,.. .\"\n\nThe creation of the United Nations during the war was presented to the world as international cooperation to prevent future wars. But the U.N. was dominated by the Western imperial countries- the United States, England, and France-and a new imperial power, with military bases and powerful influence in Eastern Europe-the Soviet Union. An important conservative Republican Senator, Arthur Vandenburg, wrote in his diary about the United Nations Charter:\n\nThe striking thing about it is that it is so conservative from a nationalist standpoint. It is based virtually on a four-power alliance. . . . This is anything but a wild-eyed internationalist dream of a world State.... I am deeply impressed (and surprised) to find Hull so carefully guarding our American veto in his scheme of things.\n\nThe plight of Jews in German-occupied Europe, which many people thought was at the heart of the war against the Axis, was not a chief concern of Roosevelt. Henry Feingold's research (The Politics of Rescue) shows that, while the Jews were being put in camps and the process of annihilation was beginning that would end in the horrifying extermination of 6 million Jews and millions of non- Jews, Roosevelt failed to take steps that might have saved thousands of lives. He did not see it as a high priority; he left it to the State Department, and in the State Department anti-Semitism and a cold bureaucracy became obstacles to action.\n\nWas the war being fought to establish that Hitler was wrong in his ideas of white Nordic supremacy over \"inferior\" races? The United States' armed forces were segregated by race. When troops were jammed onto the Queen Mary in early 1945 to go to combat duty in the European theater, the blacks were stowed down in the depths of the ship near the engine room, as far as possible from the fresh air of the deck, in a bizarre reminder of the slave voyages of old.\n\nThe Red Cross, with government approval, separated the blood donations of black and white. It was, ironically, a black physician named Charles Drew who developed the blood bank system. He was put in charge of the wartime donations, and then fired when he tried to end blood segregation. Despite the urgent need for wartime labor, blacks were still being discriminated against for jobs. A spokesman for a West Coast aviation plant said: \"The Negro will be considered only as janitors and in other similar capacities. . .. Regardless of their training as aircraft workers, we will not employ them.\" Roosevelt never did anything to enforce the orders of the Eair Employment Practices Commission he had set up.\n\nThe Fascist nations were notorious in their insistence that the woman's place was in the home. Yet, the war against Fascism, although it utilized women in defense industries where they were desperately needed, took no special steps to change the subordinate role of women. The War Manpower Commission, despite the large numbers of women in war work, kept women off its policymaking bodies. A report of the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor, by its director, Mary Anderson, said the War Manpower Commission had \"doubts and uneasiness\" about \"what was then regarded as a developing attitude of militancy or a crusading spirit on the part of women leaders.. ..\"\n\nIn one of its policies, the United States came close to direct duplication of Fascism. This was in its treatment of the Japanese-Americans living on the West Coast. After the Pearl Harbor attack, anti- Japanese hysteria spread in the government. One Congressman said: \"I'm for catching every Japanese in America, Alaska and Hawaii now and putting them in concentration camps. ... Damn them! Let's get rid of them!\"\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt did not share this frenzy, but he calmly signed Executive Order 9066, in February 1942, giving the army the power, without warrants or indictments or hearings, to arrest every Japanese-American on the West Coast-110,000 men, women, and children-to take them from their homes, transport them to camps far into the interior, and keep them there under prison conditions. Three-fourths of these were Nisei-children born in the United States of Japanese parents and therefore American citizens. The other fourth-the Issei, born in Japan-were barred by law from becoming citizens. In 1944 the Supreme Court upheld the forced evacuation on the grounds of military necessity. The Japanese remained in those camps for over three years.\n\nMichi Weglyn was a young girl when her family experienced evacuation and detention. She tells (Years of Infamy) of bungling in the evacuation, of misery, confusion, anger, but also of Japanese-American dignity and fighting back. There were strikes, petitions, mass meetings, refusal to sign loyalty oaths, riots against the camp authorities. The Japanese resisted to the end.\n\nNot until after the war did the story of the Japanese-Americans begin to be known to the general public. The month the war ended in Asia, September 1945, an article appeared in Harper's Magazine by Yale Law Professor Eugene V. Rostow, calling the Japanese evacuation \"our worst wartime mistake.\" Was it a \"mistake\"-or was it an action to be expected from a nation with a long history of racism and which was fighting a war, not to end racism, but to retain the fundamental elements of the American system?\n\nIt was a war waged by a government whose chief beneficiary- despite volumes of reforms-was a wealthy elite. The alliance between big business and the government went back to the very first proposals of Alexander Hamilton to Congress after the Revolutionary War. By World War II that partnership had developed and intensified. During the Depression, Roosevelt had once denounced the \"economic royalists,\" but he always had the support of certain important business leaders. During the war, as Bruce Catton saw it from his post in the War Production Board: \"The economic royalists, denounced and derided . . . had a part to play now. ...\"\n\nCatton (The War Lords of Washington) described the process of industrial mobilization to carry on the war, and how in this process wealth became more and more concentrated in fewer and fewer large corporations. In 1940 the United States had begun sending large amounts of war supplies to England and France. By 1941 three-fourths of the value of military contracts were handled by fifty- six large corporations. A Senate report, \"Economic Concentration and World War II,\" noted that the government contracted for scientific research in industry during the war, and although two thousand corporations were involved, of $1 billion spent, $400 million went to ten large corporations.\n\nManagement remained firmly in charge of decision making during the war, and although 12 million workers were organized in the CIO and AFL, labor was in a subordinate position. Labor- management committees were set up in five thousand factories, as a gesture toward industrial democracy, but they acted mostly as disciplinary groups for absentee workers, and devices for increasing production. Catton writes: \"The big operators who made the working decisions had decided that nothing very substantial was going to be changed.\"\n\nDespite the overwhelming atmosphere of patriotism and total dedication to winning the war, despite the no-strike pledges of the AFL and CIO, many of the nation's workers, frustrated by the freezing of wages while business profits rocketed skyward, went on strike. During the war, there were fourteen thousand strikes, involving 6,770,000 workers, more than in any comparable period in American history. In 1944 alone, a million workers were on strike, in the mines, in the steel mills, in the auto and transportation equipment industries.\n\nWhen the war ended, the strikes continued in record numbers- 3 million on strike in the first half of 1946. According to Jeremy Brecher (Strike!), if not for the disciplinary hand of the unions there might have been \"a general confrontation between the workers of a great many industries, and the government, supporting the employers.\"\n\nIn Lowell, Massachusetts, for example, according to an unpublished manuscript by Marc Miller (\"The Irony of Victory: Lowell During World War II\"), there were as many strikes in 1943 and 1944 as in 1937. It may have been a \"people's war,\" but here was dissatisfaction at the fact that the textile mill profits grew 600 percent from 1940 to 1946, while wage increases in cotton goods industries went up 36 percent. How little the war changed the difficult condition of women workers is shown by the fact that in Lowell, among women war workers with children, only 5 percent could have their children taken care of by nursery schools; the others had to make their own arrangements.\n\nBeneath the noise of enthusiastic patriotism, there were many people who thought war was wrong, even in the circumstances of Fascist aggression. Out of 10 million drafted for the armed forces during World War II, only 43,000 refused to fight. But this was three times the proportion of C.O.'s (conscientious objectors) in World War 1. Of these 43,000, about 6,000 went to prison, which was, proportionately, four times the number of C.O.'s who went to prison during World War I. Of every six men in federal prison, one was there as a C.O.\n\nMany more than 43,000 refusers did not show up for the draft at all. The government lists about 350,000 cases of draft evasion, including technical violations as well as actual desertion, so it is hard to tell the true number, but it may be that the number of men who either did not show up or claimed C.O. status was in the hundreds of thousands-not a small number. And this in the face of an American community almost unanimously for the war.\n\nAmong those soldiers who were not conscientious objectors, who seemed willing fighters, it is hard to know how much resentment there was against authority, against having to fight in a war whose aims were unclear, inside a military machine whose lack of democracy was very clear. No one recorded the bitterness of enlisted men against the special privileges of officers in the army of a country known as a democracy. To give just one instance: combat crews in the air force in the European theater, going to the base movies between bombing missions, found two lines-an officers' line (short), and an enlisted men's line (very long). There were two mess halls, even as they prepared to go into combat: the enlisted men's food was different-worse-than the officers1.\n\nThe literature that followed World War II, James Jones's From Here to Eternity, Joseph Heller's Catch-22, and Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead captured this GI anger against the army \"brass.\" In The Naked and the Dead, the soldiers talk in battle, and one of them says: \"The only thing wrong with this Army is it never lost a war.\"\n\nToglio was shocked. \"You think we ought to lose this one?\"\n\nRed found himself carried away. \"What have I against the goddam Japs? You think I care if they keep this fuggin jungle? What's it to me if Cummings gets another star?\"\n\n\"General Cummings, he's a good man,\" Martinez said.\n\n\"There ain't a good officer in the world,\" Red stated.\n\nThere seemed to be widespread indifference, even hostility, on the part of the Negro community to the war despite the attempts of Negro newspapers and Negro leaders to mobilize black sentiment. Lawrence Wittner (Rebels Against War) quotes a black journalist: \"The Negro . . . is angry, resentful, and utterly apathetic about the war. 'Fight for what?' he is asking. 'This war doesn't mean a thing to me. If we win I lose, so what?'\" A black army officer, home on furlough, told friends in Harlem he had been in hundreds of bull sessions with Negro soldiers and found no interest in the war.\n\nA student at a Negro college told his teacher: \"The Army jim-crows us. The Navy lets us serve only as messmen. The Red Cross refuses our blood. Employers and labor unions shut us out. Lynchings continue. We are disenfranchised, jim-crowed, spat upon. What more could Hitler do than that?\" NAACP leader Walter White repeated this to a black audience of several thousand people in the Midwest, thinking they would disapprove, but instead, as he recalled: \"To my surprise and dismay the audience burst into such applause that it took me some thirty or forty seconds to quiet it.\"\n\nIn January 1943, there appeared in a Negro newspaper this \"Draftee's Prayer\":\n\nDear Lord, today\n\nI go to war:\n\nTo fight, to die,\n\nTell me what for?\n\nDear Lord, I'll fight,\n\nI do not fear,\n\nGermans or Japs;\n\nMy fears are here.\n\nAmerica!\n\nBut there was no organized Negro opposition to the war. In fact, there was little organized opposition from any source. The Communist party was enthusiastically in support. The Socialist party was divided, unable to make a clear statement one way or the other.\n\nA few small anarchist and pacifist groups refused to back the war. The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom said: \".. . war between nations or classes or races cannot permanently settle conflicts or heal the wounds that brought them into being.\" The Catholic Worker wrote: \"We are still pacifists... .\"\n\nThe difficulty of merely calling for \"peace\" in a world of capitalism, Fascism, Communism- dynamic ideologies, aggressive actions-troubled some pacifists. They began to speak of \"revolutionary nonviolence.\" A. J. Muste of the Fellowship of Reconciliation said in later years: \"I was not impressed with the sentimental, easygoing pacifism of the earlier part of the century. People then felt that if they sat and talked pleasantly of peace and love, they would solve the problems of the world.\" The world was in the midst of a revolution, Muste realized, and those against violence must take revolutionary action, but without violence. A movement of revolutionary pacifism would have to \"make effective contacts with oppressed and minority groups such as Negroes, share-croppers, industrial workers.\"\n\nOnly one organized socialist group opposed the war unequivocally. This was the Socialist Workers Party. The Espionage Act of 1917 , still on the books, applied to wartime statements. But in 1940, with the United States not yet at war, Congress passed the Smith Act. This took Espionage Act prohibitions against talk or writing that would lead to refusal of duty in the armed forces and applied them to peacetime. The Smith Act also made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government by force and violence, or to join any group that advocated this, or to publish anything with such ideas. In Minneapolis in 1943, eighteen members of the Socialist Workers party were convicted for belonging to a party whose ideas, expressed in its Declaration of Principles, and in the Communist Manifesto, were said to violate the Smith Act. They were sentenced to prison terms, and the Supreme Court refused to review their case.\n\nA few voices continued to insist that the real war was inside each nation: Dwight Macdonald's wartime magazine Politics presented, in early 1945, an article by the French worker-philosopher Simone Weil:\n\nWhether the mask is labeled Fascism, Democracy, or Dictatorship of the Proletariat, our great adversary remains the Apparatus-the bureaucracy, the police, the military. Not the one facing us across the frontier or the battle lines, which is not so much our enemy as our brothers' enemy, but the one that calls itself our protector and makes us its slaves. No matter what the circumstances, the worst betrayal will always be to subordinate ourselves to this Apparatus, and to trample underfoot, in Its service, all human values in ourselves and in others.\n\nStill, the vast bulk of the American population was mobilized, in the army, and in civilian life, to fight the war, and the atmosphere of war enveloped more and more Americans. Public opinion polls show large majorities of soldiers favoring the draft for the postwar period. Hatred against the enemy, against the Japanese particularly, became widespread. Racism was clearly at work. Time magazine, reporting the battle of Iwo Jima, said: \"The ordinary unreasoning Jap is ignorant. Perhaps he is human. Nothing .. . indicates it.\"\n\nSo, there was a mass base of support for what became the heaviest bombardment of civilians ever undertaken in any war: the aerial attacks on German and Japanese cities. One might argue that this popular support made it a \"people's war.\" But if \"people's war\" means a war of people against attack, a defensive war-if it means a war fought for humane reasons instead of for the privileges of an elite, a war against the few, not the many-then the tactics of all-out aerial assault against the populations of Germany and Japan destroy that notion.\n\nItaly had bombed cities in the Ethiopian war; Italy and Germany had bombed civilians in the Spanish Civil War; at the start of World War II German planes dropped bombs on Rotterdam in Holland, Coventry in England, and elsewhere. Roosevelt had described these as \"inhuman barbarism that has profoundly shocked the conscience of humanity.\"\n\nThese German bombings were very small compared with the British and American bombings of German cities. In January 1943 the Allies met at Casablanca and agreed on large-scale air attacks to achieve \"the destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the German people to the point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.\" And so, the saturation bombing of German cities began-with thousand -plane raids on Cologne, Essen, Frankfurt, Hamburg. The English flew at night with no pretense of aiming at \"military\" targets; the Americans flew in the daytime and pretended precision, but bombing from high altitudes made that impossible. The climax of this terror bombing was the bombing of Dresden in early 1945, in which the tremendous heat generated by the bombs created a vacuum into which fire leaped swiftly in a great firestorm through the city. More than 100,000 died in Dresden. (Winston Churchill, in his wartime memoirs, confined himself to this account of the incident: \"We made a heavy raid in the latter month on Dresden, then a centre of communication of Germany's Eastern Front\")\n\nThe bombing of Japanese cities continued the strategy of saturation bombing to destroy civilian morale; one nighttime fire-bombing of Tokyo took 80,000 lives. And then, on August 6, 1945, came the lone American plane in the sky over Hiroshima, dropping the first atomic bomb, leaving perhaps 100,000 Japanese dead, and tens of thousands more slowly dying from radiation poisoning. Twelve U.S. navy fliers in the Hiroshima city jail were killed in the bombing, a fact that the U.S. government has never officially acknowledged, according to historian Martin Sherwin (A World Destroyed). Three days later, a second atomic bomb was dropped on the city of Nagasaki, with perhaps 50,000 killed.\n\nThe justification for these atrocities was that this would end the war quickly, making unnecessary an invasion of Japan. Such an invasion would cost a huge number of lives, the government said-a million, according to Secretary of State Byrnes; half a million, Truman claimed was the figure given him by General George Marshall. (When the papers of the Manhattan Project-the project to build the atom bomb- were released years later, they showed that Marshall urged a warning to the Japanese about the bomb, so people could be removed and only military targets hit.) These estimates of invasion losses were not realistic, and seem to have been pulled out of the air to justify bombings which, as their effects became known, horrified more and more people. Japan, by August 1945, was in desperate shape and ready to surrender. New York Times military analyst Hanson Baldwin wrote, shortly after the war:\n\nThe enemy, in a military sense, was in a hopeless strategic position by the time the Potsdam demand for unconditional surrender was made on July 26.\n\nSuch then, was the situation when we wiped out Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nNeed we have done it? No one can, of course, be positive, but the answer is almost certainly negative.\n\nThe United States Strategic Bombing Survey, set up by the War Department in 1944 to study the results of aerial attacks in the war, interviewed hundreds of Japanese civilian and military leaders after Japan surrendered, and reported just after the war:\n\nBased on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.\n\nBut could American leaders have known this in August 1945? The answer is, clearly, yes. The Japanese code had been broken, and Japan's messages were being intercepted. It was known the Japanese had instructed their ambassador in Moscow to work on peace negotiations with the Allies. Japanese leaders had begun talking of surrender a year before this, and the Emperor himself had begun to suggest, in June 1945, that alternatives to fighting to the end be considered. On July 13, Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo wired his ambassador in Moscow: \"Unconditional surrender is the only obstacle to peace.. ..\" Martin Sherwin, after an exhaustive study of the relevant historical documents, concludes: \"Having broken the Japanese code before the war, American Intelligence was able to-and did-relay this message to the President, but it had no effect whatever on efforts to bring the war to a conclusion.\"\n\nIf only the Americans had not insisted on unconditional surrender- that is, if they were willing to accept one condition to the surrender, that the Emperor, a holy figure to the Japanese, remain in place-the Japanese would have agreed to stop the war.\n\nWhy did the United States not take that small step to save both American and Japanese lives? Was it because too much money and effort had been invested in the atomic bomb not to drop it? General Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project, described Truman as a man on a toboggan, the momentum too great to stop it. Or was it, as British scientist P. M. S. Blackett suggested (Fear, War, and the Bomb), that the United States was anxious to drop the bomb before the Russians entered the war against Japan?\n\nThe Russians had secretly agreed (they were officially not at war with Japan) they would come into the war ninety days after the end of the European war. That turned out to be May 8, and so, on August 8, the Russians were due to declare war on Japan, But by then the big bomb had been dropped, and the next day a second one would be dropped on Nagasaki; the Japanese would surrender to the United States, not the Russians, and the United States would be the occupier of postwar Japan. In other words, Blackett says, the dropping of the bomb was \"the first major operation of the cold diplomatic war with Russia.. ..\" Blackett is supported by American historian Gar Alperovitz (Atomic Diplomacy), who notes a diary entry for July 28, 1945, by Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, describing Secretary of State James F. Byrnes as \"most anxious to get the Japanese affair over with before the Russians got in.\"\n\nTruman had said, \"The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base. That was because we wished in this first attack to avoid, insofar as possible, the killing of civilians.\" It was a preposterous statement. Those 100,000 killed in Hiroshima were almost all civilians. The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey said in its official report: \"Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen as targets because of their concentration of activities and population.\"\n\nThe dropping of the second bomb on Nagasaki seems to have been scheduled in advance, and no one has ever been able to explain why it was dropped. Was it because this was a plutonium bomb whereas the Hiroshima bomb was a uranium bomb? Were the dead and irradiated of Nagasaki victims of a scientific experiment? Martin Shenvin says that among the Nagasaki dead were probably American prisoners of war. He notes a message of July 31 from Headquarters, U.S. Army Strategic Air Forces, Guam, to the War Department:\n\nReports prisoner of war sources, not verified by photos, give location of Allied prisoner of war camp one mile north of center of city of Nagasaki. Does this influence the choice of this target for initial Centerboard operation? Request immediate reply.\n\nThe reply: \"Targets previously assigned for Centerboard remain unchanged.\"\n\nTrue, the war then ended quickly. Italy had been defeated a year earlier. Germany had recently surrendered, crushed primarily by the armies of the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front, aided by the Allied armies on the West. Now Japan surrendered. The Fascist powers were destroyed.\n\nBut what about fascism-as idea, as reality? Were its essential elements-militarism, racism, imperialism-now gone? Or were they absorbed into the already poisoned bones of the victors? A. J. Muste, the revolutionary pacifist, had predicted in 1941: \"The problem after a war is with the victor. He thinks he has just proved that war and violence pay. Who will now teach him a lesson?\"\n\nThe victors were the Soviet Union and the United States (also England, France and Nationalist China, but they were weak). Both these countries now went to work\u2014without swastikas, goose-stepping, or officially declared racism, but under the cover of \"socialism\" on one side, and \"democracy\" on the other, to carve out their own empires of influence. They proceeded to share and contest with one another the domination of the world, to build military machines far greater than the Fascist countries had built, to control the destinies of more countries than Hitler, Mussolini, and Japan had been able to do. They also acted to control their own populations, each country with its own techniques-crude in the Soviet Union, sophisticated in the United States\u2014to make their rule secure.\n\nThe war not only put the United States in a position to dominate much of the world; it created conditions for effective control at home. The unemployment, the economic distress, and the consequent turmoil that had marked the thirties, only partly relieved by New Deal measures, had been pacified, overcome by the greater turmoil of the war. The war brought higher prices for farmers, higher wages, enough prosperity for enough of the population to assure against the rebellions that so threatened the thirties. As Lawrence Wittner writes, \"The war rejuvenated American capitalism.\" The biggest gains were in corporate profits, which rose from $6.4 billion in 1940 to $10.8 billion in 1944. But enough went to workers and farmers to make them feel the system was doing well for them.\n\nIt was an old lesson learned by governments: that war solves problems of control. Charles E. Wilson, the president of General Electric Corporation, was so happy about the wartime situation that he suggested a continuing alliance between business and the military for \"a permanent war economy.\"\n\nThat is what happened. When, right after the war, the American public, war-weary, seemed to favor demobilization and disarmament, the Truman administration (Roosevelt had died in April 1945) worked to create an atmosphere of crisis and cold war. True, the rivalry with the Soviet Union was real\u2014that country had come out of the war with its economy wrecked and 20 million people dead, but was making an astounding comeback, rebuilding its industry, regaining military strength. The Truman administration, however, presented the Soviet Union as not just a rival but an immediate threat.\n\nIn a series of moves abroad and at home, it established a climate of fear\u2014a hysteria about Communism\u2014which would steeply escalate the military budget and stimulate the economy with war-related orders. This combination of policies would permit more aggressive actions abroad, more repressive actions at home.\n\nRevolutionary movements in Europe and Asia were described to the American public as examples of Soviet expansionism-thus recalling the indignation against Hitler's aggressions.\n\nIn Greece, which had been a right-wing monarchy and dictatorship before the war, a popular left-wing National Liberation Front (the EAM) was put down by a British army of intervention immediately after the war. A right-wing dictatorship was restored. When opponents of the regime were jailed, and trade union leaders removed, a left-wing guerrilla movement began to grow against the regime, soon consisting of 17,000 fighters, 50,000 active supporters, and perhaps 250,000 sympathizers, in a country of 7 million. Great Britain said it could not handle the rebellion, and asked the United States to come in. As a State Department officer said later: \"Great Britain had within the hour handed the job of world leadership . . . to the United States.\"\n\nThe United States responded with the Truman Doctrine, the name given to a speech Truman gave to Congress in the spring of 1947, in which he asked for $400 million in military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey. Truman said the U.S. must help \"free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\"\n\nIn fact, the biggest outside pressure was the United States. The Greek rebels were getting some aid from Yugoslavia, but no aid from the Soviet Union, which during the war had promised Churchill a free hand in Greece if he would give the Soviet Union its way in Rumania, Poland, Bulgaria. The Soviet Union, like the United States, did not seem to be willing to help revolutions it could not control.\n\nTruman said the world \"must choose between alternative ways of life.\" One was based on \"the will of the majority . . . distinguished by free institutions\"; the other was based on \"the will of a minority . . . terror and oppression . . . the suppression of personal freedoms.\" Truman's adviser Clark Clifford had suggested that in his message Truman connect the intervention in Greece to something less rhetorical, more practical\u2014\"the great natural resources of the Middle East\" (Clifford meant oil), but Truman didn't mention that.\n\nThe United States moved into the Greek civil war, not with soldiers, but with weapons and military advisers. In the last five months of 1947, 74,000 tons of military equipment were sent by the United States to the right-wing government in Athens, including artillery, dive bombers, and stocks of napalm. Two hundred and fifty army officers, headed by General James Van Fleet, advised the Greek army in the field. Van Fleet started a policy\u2014standard in dealing with popular insurrections of forcibly removing thousands of Greeks from their homes in the countryside, to try to isolate the guerrillas, to remove the source of their support\"\n\nWith that aid, the rebellion was defeated by 1949. United States economic and military aid continued to the Greek government. Investment capital from Fsso, Uow Chemical, Chrysler, and other U.S. corporations flowed into Greece. But illiteracy, poverty, and starvation remained widespread there, with the country in the hands of what Richard Barnet (Intervention and Revolution) called \"a particularly brutal and backward military dictatorship.\"\n\nIn China, a revolution was already under way when World War II ended, led by a Communist movement with enormous mass support. A Red Army, which had fought against the Japanese, now fought to oust the corrupt dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek, which was supported by the United States. The United States, by 1949, had given $2 billion in aid to Chiang Kai-shek's forces, but, according to the State Department's own White Paper on China, Chiang Kai-shek's government had lost the confidence of its own troops and its own people. In January 1949, Chinese Communist forces moved into Peking, the civil war was over, and China was in the hands of a revolutionary movement, the closest thing, in the long history of that ancient country, to a people's government, independent of outside control.\n\nThe United States was trying, in the postwar decade, to create a national consensus excluding the radicals, who could not support a foreign policy aimed at suppressing revolution-of conservatives and liberals, Republicans and Democrats, around the policies of cold war and anti- 949, had given $2 billion in aid to Chiang Kai-shek's forces, but, according to the State Department's own White Paper on China, Chiang Kai-shek's government had lost the confidence of its own troops and its own people. In January 1949, Chinese Communist forces moved into Peking, the civil war was over, and China was in the hands of a revolutionary movement, the closest thing, in the long history of that ancient country, to a people's government, independent of outside control.\n\nThe United States was trying, in the postwar decade, to create a national consensus excluding the radicals, who could not support a foreign policy aimed at suppressing revolution-of conservatives and liberals, Republicans and Democrats, around the policies of cold war and anti- Communism. Such a coalition could best be created by a liberal Democratic President, whose aggressive policy abroad would be supported by conservatives, and whose welfare programs at home (Truman's \"Fair Deal\") would be attractive to liberals. If, in addition, liberals and traditional Democrats could-the memory of the war was still fresh- support a foreign policy against \"aggression,\" the radical-liberal bloc created by World War II would be broken up. And perhaps, if the anti-Communist mood became strong enough, liberals could support repressive moves at home which in ordinary times would be seen as violating the liberal tradition of tolerance. In 1950, there came an event that speeded the formation of the liberal-conservative consensus\u2014Truman's undeclared war in Korea.\n\nKorea, occupied by Japan for thirty-five years, was liberated from Japan after World War II and divided into North Korea, a socialist dictatorship, part of the Soviet sphere of influence, and South Korea, a right-wing dictatorship, in the American sphere. There had been threats back and forth between the two Koreas, and when on June 25, 1950, North Korean armies moved southward across the 38th parallel in an invasion of South Korea, the United Nations, dominated by the United States, asked its members to help \"repel the armed attack.\" Truman ordered the American armed forces to help South Korea, and the American army became the U.N. army. Truman said: \"A return to the rule of force in international affairs would have far-reaching effects. The United States will continue to uphold the rule of law.\"\n\nThe United States' response to \"the rule of force\" was to reduce Korea, North and South, to a shambles, in three years of bombing and shelling. Napalm was dropped, and a BBC journalist described the result:\n\nIn front of us a curious figure was standing, a little crouched, legs straddled, arms held out from his sides. He had no eyes, and the whole of his body, nearly all of which was visible through tatters of burnt rags, was covered with a hard black crust speckled with yellow pus. . . . He had to stand because he was no longer covered with a skin, but with a crust-like crackling which broke easily. . . . I thought of the hundreds of villages reduced to ash which I personally had seen and realized the sort of casualty list which must be mounting up along the Korean front.\n\nPerhaps 2 million Koreans, North and South, were killed in the Korean war, all in the name of opposing \"the rule of force.\"\n\nAs for the rule of law Truman spoke about, the American military moves seemed to go beyond that. The U.N. resolution had called for action \"to repel the armed attack and to restore peace and security in the area.\" But the American, armies, after pushing the North Koreans back across the 38th parallel, advanced all the way up through North Korea to the Yalu River, on the border of China-which provoked the Chinese into entering the war. The Chinese then swept southward and the war was stalemated at the 38th parallel until peace negotiations restored, in 1953, the old boundary between North and South.\n\nThe Korean war mobilized liberal opinion behind the war and the President. It created the kind of coalition that was needed to sustain a policy of intervention abroad, militarization of the economy at home. This meant trouble for those who stayed outside the coalition as radical critics. Alonzo Hamby noted (Beyond the New Deal) that the Korean war was supported by The New Republic, by The Nation, and by Henry Wallace (who in 1948 had run against Truman on a left coalition Progressive party ticket). The liberals didn't like Senator Joseph McCarthy (who hunted for Communists everywhere, even among liberals), but the Korean war, as Hamby says, \"had given McCarthyism a new lease on life.\"\n\nThe left had become very influential in the hard times of the thirties, and during the war against Fascism. The actual membership of the Communist party was not large-fewer than 100,000 probably-but it was a potent force in trade unions numbering millions of members, in the arts, and among countless Americans who may have been led by the failure of the capitalist system in the thirties to look favorably on Communism and Socialism. Thus, if the Establishment, after World War II, was to make capitalism more secure in the country, and to build a consensus of support for the American Empire, it had to weaken and isolate the left.\n\nTwo weeks after presenting to the country the Truman Doctrine for Greece and Turkey, Truman issued, on March 22, 1947, Executive Order 9835, initiating a program to search out any \"infiltration of disloyal persons\" in the U.S. government. In their book The Fifties, Douglas Miller and Marion Nowack comment:\n\nThough Truman would later complain of the \"great wave of hysteria\" sweeping the nation, his commitment to victory over communism, to completely safeguarding the United States from external and internal threats, was in large measure responsible for creating that very hysteria. Between the launching of his security program in March 1947 and December 1952, some 6.6 million persons were investigated. Not a single case of espionage was uncovered, though about 500 persons were dismissed in dubious cases of \"questionable loyalty.\" All of this was conducted with secret evidence, secret and often paid informers, and neither judge nor jury. Despite the failure to find subversion, the broad scope of the official Red hunt gave popular credence to the notion that the government was riddled with spies. A conservative and fearful reaction coursed the country. Americans became convinced of the need for absolute security and the preservation of the established order.\n\nWorld events right after the war made it easier to build up public support for the anti-Communist crusade at home. In 1948, the Communist party in Czechoslovakia ousted non-Communists from the government and established their own rule. The Soviet Union that year blockaded Berlin, which was a jointly occupied city isolated inside the Soviet sphere of East Germany, forcing the United States to airlift supplies into Berlin. In 1949, there was the Communist victory in China, and in that year also, the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb. In 1950 the Korean war began. These were all portrayed to the public as signs of a world Communist conspiracy.\n\nNot as publicized as the Communist victories, but just as disturbing to the American government, was the upsurge all over the world of colonial peoples demanding independence. Revolutionary movements were growing\u2014in Indochina against the French; in Indonesia against the Dutch; in the Philippines, armed rebellion against the United States.\n\nIn Africa there were rumblings of discontent in the form of strikes. Basil Davidson (Let Freedom Come) tells of the longest recorded strike (160 days) in African history, of 19,000 railwaymen in French West Africa in 1947, whose message to the governor general showed the new mood of militancy: \"Open your prisons, make ready your machine guns and cannon. Nevertheless, at midnight on 10 October, if our demands are not met, we declare the general strike.\" The year before in South Africa, 100,000 gold mine workers stopped work, demanding ten shillings (about $2.50) a day in wages, the greatest strike in the history of South Africa, and it took a military attack to get them back to work. In 1950, in Kenya, there was a general strike against starvation wages.\n\nSo it was not just Soviet expansion that was threatening to the United States government and to American business interests. In fact, China, Korea, Indochina, the Philippines, represented local Communist movements, not Russian fomentation. It was a general wave of anti- imperialist insurrection in the world, which would require gigantic American effort to defeat: national unity for militarization of the budget, for the suppression of domestic opposition to such a foreign policy. Truman and the liberals in Congress proceeded to try to create a new national unity for the postwar years-with the executive order on loyalty oaths, Justice Department prosecutions, and anti-Communist legislation.\n\nIn this atmosphere, Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin could go even further than Truman. Speaking to a Women's Republican Club in Wheeling, West Virginia, in early 1950, he held up some papers and shouted: \"I have here in my hand a list of 205\u2014a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.\" The next day, speaking in Salt Lake City, McCarthy claimed he had a list of fifty-seven (the number kept changing) such Communists in the State Department. Shortly afterward, he appeared on the floor of the Senate with photostatic copies of about a hundred dossiers from State Department loyalty files. The dossiers were three years old, and most of the people were no longer with the State Department, but McCarthy read from them anyway, inventing, adding, and changing as he read. In one case, he changed the dossier's description of \"liberal\" to \"communistically inclined,\" in another form \"active fellow traveler\" to \"active Communist,\" and so on.\n\nMcCarthy kept on like this for the next few years. As chairman of the Permanent Investigations Sub-Committee of a Senate Committee on Government Operations, he investigated the State Department's information program, its Voice of America, and its overseas libraries, which included books by people McCarthy considered Communists. The State Department reacted in panic, issuing a stream of directives to its library centers across the world. Forty books were removed, including The Selected Works of Thomas Jefferson, edited by Philip Foner, and The Children's Hour by Lillian Hellman. Some books were burned.\n\nMcCarthy became bolder. In the spring of 1954 he began hearings to investigate supposed subversives in the military. When he began attacking generals for not being hard enough on suspected Communists, he antagonized Republicans as well as Democrats, and in December 1954, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to censure him for \"conduct . . .unbecoming a Member of the United States Senate.\" The censure resolution avoided criticizing McCarthy's anti-Communist lies and exaggerations; it concentrated on minor matters on his refusal to appear before a Senate Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections, and his abuse of an army general at his hearings.\n\nAt the very time the Senate was censuring McCarthy, Congress was putting through a whole series of anti-Communist bills. Liberal Hubert Humphrey introduced an amendment to one of them to make the Communist party illegal, saying: \"I do not intend to be a half patriot. . . . Either Senators are for recognizing the Communist Party for what it is, or they will continue to trip over the niceties of legal technicalities and details.\"\n\nThe liberals in the government were themselves acting to exclude, persecute, fire, and even imprison Communists. It was just that McCarthy had gone too far, attacking not only Communists but liberals, endangering that broad liberal-conservative coalition which was considered essential. For instance, Lyndon Johnson, as Senate minority leader, worked not only to pass the censure resolution on McCarthy but also to keep it within the narrow bounds of \"conduct . . . unbecoming a Member of the United States Senate\" rather than questioning McCarthy's anti-Communism.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was cautious on the issue, didn't speak out against McCarthy (he was absent when the censure vote was taken and never said how he would have voted). McCarthy's insistence that Communism had won in China because of softness on Communism in the American government was close to Kennedy's own view, expressed in the House of Representatives, January 1949, when the Chinese Communists took over Peking. Kennedy said:\n\nMr. Speaker, over this weekend we have learned the extent of the disaster that has befallen China and the United States. The responsibility for the failure of our foreign policy in the Far East rests squarely with the White House and the Department of State.\n\nThe continued insistence that aid would not be forthcoming unless a coalition government with the Communists was formed, was a crippling blow to the National Government.\n\nSo concerned were our diplomats and their advisers, the Lattimores and the Fairbanks [both scholars in the field of Chinese history, Owen Lattimore a favorite target of McCarthy, John Fairbank, a Harvard professor], with the imperfection of the democratic system in China after 20 years of war and the tales of corruption in high places that they lost sight of our tremendous stake in a non- Communist China. . . .\n\nThis House must now assume the responsibility of preventing the onrushing tide of Communism from engulfing all of Asia.\n\nWhen, in 1950, Republicans sponsored an Internal Security Act for the registration of organizations found to be \"Communist-action\" or \"Communist-front,\" liberal Senators did not fight that head-on. Instead, some of them, including Hubert Humphrey and Herbert Lehman, proposed a substitute measure, the setting up of detention centers (really, concentration camps) for suspected subversives, who, when the President declared an \"internal security emergency,\" would be held without trial. The detention-camp bill became not a substitute for, but an addition to, the Internal Security Act, and the proposed camps were set up, ready for use. (In 1968, a time of general disillusionment with anti-Communism, this law was repealed.)\n\nTruman's executive order on loyalty in 1947 required the Department of Justice to draw up a list of organizations it decided were \"totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive . . . or as seeking to alter the form of government of the United States by unconstitutional means.\" Not only membership in, but also \"sympathetic association\" with, any organization on the Attorney General's list would be considered in determining disloyalty. By 1954, there were hundreds of groups on this list, including, besides the Communist party and the Ku Klux Klan, the Chopin Cultural Center, the Cervantes Fraternal Society, the Committee for the Negro in the Arts, the Committee for the Protection of the Bill of Rights, the League of American Writers, the Nature Friends of America, People's Drama, the Washington Bookshop Association, and the Yugoslav Seaman's Club.\n\nIt was not McCarthy and the Republicans, but the liberal Democratic Truman administration, whose Justice Department initiated a series of prosecutions that intensified the nation's anti-Communist mood. The most important was the prosecution of Julius and F.thel Rosenberg in the summer of 1950.\n\nThe Rosenbergs were charged with espionage. The major evidence was supplied by a few people who had already confessed to being spies, and were either in prison or under indictment. David Greenglass, the brother of Ethel Rosenberg, was the key witness. He had been a machinist at the Manhattan Project laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico, in 1944-1945 when the atomic bomb was being made there and testified that Julius Rosenberg had asked him to get information for the Russians. Greenglass said he had made sketches from memory for his brother-in-law of experiments with lenses to be used to detonate atomic bombs. He said Rosenberg had given him half of the cardboard top to a box of Jell-O, and told him a man would show up in New Mexico with the other half, and that, in June 1945, Harry Gold appeared with the other half of the box top, and Greenglass gave him information he had memorized.\n\nGold, already serving a thirty-year sentence in another espionage case, came out of jail to corroborate Greenglass's testimony. He had never met the Rosenbergs, but said a Soviet embassy official gave him half of a top to a box of Jell-o, and told him to contact Greenglass, saying, \"I come from Julius.\" Gold said he took the sketches Greenglass had drawn from memory and gave them to the Russian official.\n\nThere were troubling aspects to all this. Did Gold cooperate in return for early release from prison? After serving fifteen years of his thirty-year sentence, he was paroled. Did Greenglass-under indictment at the time he testified-also know that his life depended on his cooperation? He was given fifteen years, served half of it, and was released. How reliable a memorizer of atomic information was David Greenglass, an ordinary-level machinist, not a scientist, who had taken six courses at Brooklyn Polytechnical Institute and flunked five of them? Gold's and Greenglass's stories had first not been in accord. But they were both placed on the same floor of the Tombs prison in New York before the trial, giving them a chance to coordinate their testimony.\n\nHow reliable was Gold's testimony? It turned out that he had been prepared for the Rosenberg case by four hundred hours of interviews with the FBI. It also turned out that Gold was a frequent and highly imaginative liar. He was a witness in a later trial where defense counsel asked Gold about his invention of a fictional wife and fictional children. The attorney asked: \". . . you lied for a period of six years?\" Gold responded: \"I lied for a period of sixteen years, not alone six years.\" Gold was the only witness at the trial to connect Julius Rosenberg and David Greenglass to the Russians. The FBI agent who had questioned Gold was interviewed twenty years after the case by a journalist. He was asked about the password Gold was supposed to have used-\"Julius sent me.\" The FBI man said:\n\nGold couldn't remember the name he had given. He thought he had said: I come from - or something like that. I suggested, \"Might it have been Julius?\"\n\nThat refreshed his memory.\n\nWhen the Rosenbergs were found guilty, and Judge Irving Kaufman pronounced sentence, he said:\n\nI believe your conduct in putting into the hands of the Russians the A-bomb years before our best scientists predicted Russia would perfect the bomb as already caused the Communist aggression in Korea with the resultant casualties exceeding 50,000 Americans and who knows but that millions more of innocent people may pay the price of your treason. . . .\n\nHe sentenced them both to die in the electric chair.\n\nMorton Sobell was also on trial as a co-conspirator with the Rosenbergs. The chief witness against him was an old friend, the best man at his wedding, a man who was facing possible perjury charges by the federal government for lying about his political past. This was Max Elitcher, who testified that he had once driven Sobell to a Manhattan housing project where the Rosenbergs lived, and that Sobell got out of the car, took from the glove compartment what appeared to be a film can, went off, and then returned without the can. There was no evidence about what was in the film can. The case against Sobell seemed so weak that Sobell's lawyer decided there was no need to present a defense. But the jury found Sobell guilty, and Kaufman sentenced him to thirty years in prison. He was sent to Alcatraz, parole was repeatedly denied, and he spent nineteen years in various prisons before he was released.\n\nFBI documents subpoenaed in the 1970s showed that Judge Kaufman had conferred with the prosecutors secretly about the sentences he would give in the case. Another document shows that after three years of appeal a meeting took place between Attorney General Herbert Brownell and Chief Justice Fred Vinson of the Supreme Court, and the chief justice assured the Attorney General that if any Supreme Court justice gave a stay of execution, he would immediately call a full court session and override it.\n\nThere had been a worldwide campaign of protest. Albert Einstein, whose letter to Roosevelt early in the war had initiated work on the atomic bomb, appealed for the Rosenbergs, as did Jean-Paul Sartre, Pablo Picasso, and the sister of Bartolomeo Vanzetti. There was an appeal to President Truman, just before he left office in the spring of 1953. It was turned down. Then, another appeal to the new President, Dwight Eisenhower, was also turned down.\n\nAt the last moment, Justice William 0. Douglas granted a stay of execution. Chief Justice Vinson sent out special jets to bring the vacationing justices back to Washington from various parts of the country. They canceled Douglas's stay in time for the Rosenbergs to be executed June 19, 1953. It was a demonstration to the people of the country, though very few could identify with the Rosenbergs, of what lay at the end of the line for those the government decided were traitors.\n\nIn that same period of the early fifties, the House Un-American Activities Committee was at its heyday, interrogating Americans about their Communist connections, holding them in contempt if they refused to answer, distributing millions of pamphlets to the American public: \"One Hundred Things You Should Know About Communism\" (\"Where can Communists be found? Everywhere\"). Liberals often criticized the Committee, but in Congress, liberals and conservatives alike voted to fund it year after year. By 1958, only one member of the House of Representatives (James Roosevelt) voted against giving it money. Although Truman criticized the Committee, his own Attorney General had expressed, in 1950, the same idea that motivated its investigations: \"There are today many Communists in America. They are everywhere\u2014in factories, offices, butcher shops, on street comers, in private business\u2014and each carries in himself the germs of death for society.\"\n\nLiberal intellectuals rode the anti-Communist bandwagon. Commentary magazine denounced the Rosenbergs and their supporters. One of Commentary's writers, Irving Kristol, asked in March 1952: \"Do we defend our rights by protecting Communists?\" His answer: \"No.\"\n\nIt was Truman's Justice Department that prosecuted the leaders of the Communist party under the Smith Act, charging them with conspiring to teach and advocate the overthrow of the government by force and violence. The evidence consisted mostly of the fact that the Communists were distributing Marxist-Leninist literature, which the prosecution contended called for violent revolution. There was certainly not evidence of any immediate danger of violent revolution by the Communist party. The Supreme Court decision was given by Truman's appointee, Chief Justice Vinson. He stretched the old doctrine of the \"clear and present danger\" by saying there was a clear and present conspiracy to make a revolution at some convenient time. And so, the top leadership of the Communist party was put in prison, and soon after, most of its organizers went underground.\n\nUndoubtedly, there was success in the attempt to make the general public fearful of Communists and ready to take drastic actions against them\u2014imprisonment at home, military action abroad. The whole culture was permeated with anti-Communism. The large-circulation magazines had articles like \"How Communists Get That Way\" and \"Communists Are After Your Child.\" The New York Times in 1956 ran an editorial: \"We would not knowingly employ a Communist party member in the news or editorial departments . . . because we would not trust his ability to report the news objectively or to comment on it honestly. . . . An FBI informer's story about his exploits as a Communist who became an FBI agent\u2014\"I Led Three Lives\"\u2014was serialized in five hundred newspapers and put on television. Hollywood movies had titles like I Married a Communist and I Was a Communist for the FBI. Between 1948 and 1954, more than forty anti-Communist films came out of Hollywood.\n\nEven the American Civil Liberties Union, set up specifically to defend the liberties of Communists and all other political groups, began to wilt in the cold war atmosphere. It had already started in this direction back in 1940 when it expelled one of its charter members, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, because she was a member of the Communist party. In the fifties, the ACLU was hesitant to defend Corliss Lamont, its own board member, and Owen Lattimore, when both were under attack. It was reluctant to defend publicly the Communist leaders during the first Smith Act trial, and kept completely out of the Rosenberg case, saying no civil liberties issues were involved.\n\nYoung and old were taught that anti-Communism was heroic. Three million copies were sold of the book by Mickey Spillane published in 1951, One Lonely Night, in which the hero, Mike Hammer says: \"I killed more people tonight than I have fingers on my hands. I shot them in cold blood and enjoyed every minute of it. . . . They were Commies . . . red sons-of-bitches who should have died long ago. . . .\" A comic strip hero, Captain America, said: \"Beware, commies, spies, traitors, and foreign agents! Captain America, with all loyal, free men behind him, is looking for you. . . .\" And in the fifties, schoolchildren all over the country participated in air raid drills in which a Soviet attack on America was signaled by sirens: the children had to crouch under their desks until it was \"all clear.\"\n\nIt was an atmosphere in which the government could get mass support for a policy of rearmament. The system, so shaken in the thirties, had learned that war production could bring stability and high profits. Truman's anti-Communism was attractive. The business publication Steel had said in November 1946-even before the Truman Doctrine that Truman's policies gave \"the firm assurance that maintaining and building our preparations for war will be big business in the United States for at least a considerable period ahead.\"\n\nThat prediction turned out to be accurate. At the start of 1950, the total U.S. budget was about $40 billion, and the military part of it was about $12 billion. But by 1955, the military part alone was $40 billion out of a total of $62 billion.\n\nIn 1960, the military budget was $45.8 billion\u20149.7 percent of the budget. That year John F. Kennedy was elected President, and he immediately moved to increase military spending. In fourteen months, the Kennedy administration added $9 billion to defense funds, according to Edgar Bottome (The Balance of Terror).\n\nBy 1962, based on a series of invented scares about Soviet military build-ups, a false \"bomber gap\" and a false \"missile gap,\" the United States had overwhelming nuclear superiority. It had the equivalent, in nuclear weapons, of 1,500 Hiroshima-size atomic bombs, far more than enough to destroy every major city in the world-the equivalent, in fact, of 10 tons of TNT for every man, woman, and child on earth. To deliver these bombs, the United States had more than 50 intercontinental ballistic missiles, 80 missiles on nuclear submarines, 90 missiles on stations overseas, 1,700 bombers capable of reaching the Soviet Union, 300 fighter-bombers on aircraft carriers, able to carry atomic weapons, and 1,000 land-based supersonic fighters able to carry atomic bombs.\n\nThe Soviet Union was obviously behind\u2014it had between fifty and a hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles and fewer than two hundred long-range bombers. But the U.S. budget kept mounting, the hysteria kept growing, the profits of corporations getting defense contracts multiplied, and employment and wages moved ahead just enough to keep a substantial number of Americans dependent on war industries for their living.\n\nBy 1970, the U.S. military budget was $80 billion and the corporations involved in military production were making fortunes. Two-thirds of the 40 billion spent on weapons systems was going to twelve or fifteen giant industrial corporations, whose main reason for existence was to fulfill government military contracts. Senator Paul Douglass, an economist and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of the Senate, noted that \"six-sevenths of these contracts are not competitive. . . . In the alleged interest of secrecy, the government picks a company and draws up a contract in more or less secret negotiations.\"\n\nC. Wright Mills, in his book of the fifties, The Power Elite, counted the military as part of the top elite, along with politicians and corporations. These elements were more and more intertwined. A Senate report showed that the one hundred largest defense contractors, who held 67.4 percent of the military contracts, employed more than two thousand former high-ranking officers of the military.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States, giving economic aid to certain countries, was creating a network of American corporate control over the globe, and building its political influence over the countries it aided. The Marshall Plan of 1948, which gave $16 billion in economic aid to Western European countries in four years, had an economic aim: to build up markets for American exports. George Marshall (a general, then Secretary of State) was quoted in an early 1948 State Department bulletin: \"It is idle to think that a Europe left to its own efforts . .. would remain open to American business in the same way that we have known it in the past.\"\n\nThe Marshall Plan also had a political motive. The Communist parties of Italy and France were strong, and the United States decided to use pressure and money to keep Communists out of the cabinets of those countries. When the Plan was beginning, Truman's Secretary of State Dean Acheson said: \"These measures of relief and reconstruction have been only in part suggested by humanitarianism. Your Congress has authorized and your Government is carrying out, a policy of relief and reconstruction today chiefly as a matter of national self-interest.\"\n\nFrom 1952 on, foreign aid was more and more obviously designed to build up military power in non-Communist countries. In the next ten years, of the $50 billion in aid granted by the United States to ninety countries, only $5 billion was for nonmilitary economic development.\n\nWhen John F. Kennedy took office, he launched the Alliance for Progress, a program of help for Latin America, emphasizing social reform to better the lives of people. But it turned out to be mostly military aid to keep in power right-wing dictatorships and enable them to stave off revolutions.\n\nFrom military aid, it was a short step to military intervention. What Truman had said at the start of the Korean war about \"the rule of force\" and the \"rule of law\" was again and again, under Truman and his successors, contradicted by American action. In Iran, in 1953, the Central Intelligence Agency succeeded in overthrowing a government which nationalized the oil industry. In Guatemala, in 1954, a legally elected government was overthrown by an invasion force of mercenaries trained by the CIA at military bases in Honduras and Nicaragua and supported by four American fighter planes flown by American pilots. The invasion put into power Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas, who had at one time received military training at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nThe government that the United States overthrew was the most democratic Guatemala had ever had. The President, Jacobo Arbenz, was a left-of-center Socialist; four of the fifty-six seats in the Congress were held by Communists. What was most unsettling to American business interests was that Arbenz had expropriated 234,000 acres of land owned by United Fruit, offering compensation that United Fruit called \"unacceptable.\" Armas, in power, gave the land back to United Fruit, abolished the tax on interest and dividends to foreign investors, eliminated the secret ballot, and jailed thousands of political critics.\n\nIn 1958, the Eisenhower government sent thousands of marines to Lebanon to make sure the pro-American government there was not toppled by a revolution, and to keep an armed presence in that oil-rich area.\n\nThe Democrat-Republican, liberal-conservative agreement to prevent or overthrow revolutionary governments whenever possible whether Communist, Socialist, or anti-United Fruit-became most evident in 1961 in Cuba. That little island 90 miles from Florida had gone through a revolution in 1959 by a rebel force led by Fidel Castro, in which the American-backed dictator, Fulgencio Batista, was overthrown. The revolution was a direct threat to American business interests. Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy had repealed the Platt Amendment (which permitted American intervention in Cuba), but the United States still kept a naval base in Cuba at Guantanamo, and U.S. business interests still dominated the Cuban economy. American companies controlled 80 to 100 percent of Cuba's utilities, mines, cattle ranches, and oil refineries, 40 percent of the sugar industry, and 50 percent of the public railways.\n\nFidel Castro had spent time in prison after he led an unsuccessful attack in 1953 on an army barracks in Santiago. Out of prison, he went to Mexico, met Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara, and returned in 1956 to Cuba. His tiny force fought guerrilla warfare from the jungles and mountains against Batista's army, drawing more and more popular support, then came out of the mountains and marched across the country to Havana. The Batista government fell apart on New Year's Day 1959.\n\nIn power, Castro moved to set up a nationwide system of education, of housing, of land distribution to landless peasants. The government confiscated over a million acres of land from three American companies, including United Fruit.\n\nCuba needed money to finance its programs, and the United States was not eager to lend it. The International Monetary Fund, dominated by the United States, would not loan money to Cuba because Cuba would not accept its \"stabilization\" conditions, which seemed to undermine the revolutionary program that had begun. When Cuba now signed a trade agreement with the Soviet Union, American-owned oil companies in Cuba refused to refine crude oil that came from the Soviet Union. Castro seized these companies. The United States cut down on its sugar buying from Cuba, on which Cuba's economy depended, and the Soviet Union immediately agreed to buy all the 700,000 tons of sugar that the United States would not buy.\n\nCuba had changed. The Good Neighbor Policy did not apply. In the spring of 1960, President Eisenhower secretly authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to arm and train anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Guatemala for a future invasion of Cuba. When Kennedy took office in the spring of 1961 the CIA had 1,400 exiles, armed and trained. He moved ahead with the plans, and on April 17, 1961, the CIA-trained force, with some Americans participating, landed at the Bay of Pigs on the south shore of Cuba, 90 miles from Havana. They expected to stimulate a general rising against Castro. But it was a popular regime. There was no rising. In three days, the CIA forces were crushed by Castro's army.\n\nThe whole Bay of Pigs affair was accompanied by hypocrisy and lying. The invasion was a violation\u2014recalling Truman's \"rule of law\"\u2014of a treaty the U.S. had signed, the Charter of the Organization of American States, which reads: \"No state or group of states has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other state.\"\n\nFour days before the invasion-because there had been press reports of secret bases and CIA training for invaders-President Kennedy told a press conference: \". . . there will not be, under any conditions, any intervention in Cuba by United States armed forces.\" True, the landing force was Cuban, but it was all organized by the United States, and American war planes, including American pilots, were involved; Kennedy had approved the use of unmarked navy jets in the invasion. Four American pilots of those planes were killed, and their families were not told the truth about how those men died.\n\nThe success of the liberal-conservative coalition in creating a national anti-Communist consensus was shown by how certain important news publications cooperated with the Kennedy administration in deceiving the American public on the Cuban invasion. The New Republic was about to print an article on the CIA training of Cuban exiles, a few weeks before the invasion. Historian Arthur Schlesinger was given copies of the article in advance. He showed them to Kennedy, who asked that the article not be printed, and The New Republic went along.\n\nJames Reston and Turner Catledge of the New York Times, on the government's request, did not run a story about the imminent invasion. Arthur Schlesinger said of the New York Times action: \"This was another patriotic act, but in retrospect I have wondered whether, if the press had behaved irresponsibly, it would not have spared the country a disaster.\" What seemed to bother him, and other liberals in the cold war consensus, was not that the United States was interfering in revolutionary movements in other countries, but that it was doing so unsuccessfully.\n\nAround 1960, the fifteen-year effort since the end of World War II to break up the Communist-radical upsurge of the New Deal and wartime years seemed successful. The Communist party was in disarray-its leaders in jail, its membership shrunken, its influence in the trade union movement very small. The trade union movement itself had become more controlled, more conservative. The military budget was taking half of the national budget, but the public was accepting this.\n\nThe radiation from the testing of nuclear weapons had dangerous possibilities for human health, but the public was not aware of that. The Atomic Energy Commission insisted that the deadly effects of atomic tests were exaggerated, and an article in 1955 in the Reader's Digest (the largest-circulation magazine in the United States) said: \"The scare stories about this country's atomic tests are simply not justified.\"\n\nIn the mid-fifties, there was a flurry of enthusiasm for air-raid shelters; the public was being told these would keep them safe from atomic blasts. A government consultant and scientist, Herman Kahn, wrote a book, On Thermonuclear War, in which he explained that it was possible to have a nuclear war without total destruction of the world, that people should not be so frightened of it. A political scientist named Henry Kissinger wrote a book published in 1957 in which he said: \"With proper tactics, nuclear war need not be as destructive as it appears....\"\n\nThe country was on a permanent war economy which had big pockets of poverty, but there were enough people at work, making enough money, to keep things quiet. The distribution of wealth was still unequal. From 1944 to 1961, it had not changed much: the lowest fifth of the families received 5 percent of all the income; the highest fifth received 45 percent of all the income. In 1953, 1.6 percent of the adult population owned more than 80 percent of the corporate stock and nearly 90 percent of the corporate bonds. About 200 giant corporations out of 200,000 corporations\u2014one-tenth of 1 percent of all corporations\u2014controlled about 60 percent of the manufacturing wealth of the nation.\n\nWhen John F. Kennedy presented his budget to the nation after his first year in office, it was clear that, liberal Democrat or not, there would be no major change in the distribution of income or wealth or tax advantages. New York Times columnist James Reston summed up Kennedy's budget messages as avoiding any \"sudden transformation of the home front\" as well as \"a more ambitious frontal attack on the unemployment problem.\" Reston said:\n\nHe agreed to a tax break for business investment in plant expansion and modernization. He is not spoiling for a fight with the Southern conservatives over civil rights. He has been urging the unions to keep wage demands down so that prices can be competitive in the world markets and jobs increased. And he has been trying to reassure the business community that he does not want any cold war with them on the home front.\n\n. . .this week in his news conference he refused to carry out his promise to bar discrimination in Government-insured housing, but talked instead of postponing this until there was a \"national consensus\" in its favor. . . .\n\nDuring these twelve months the President has moved over into the decisive middle ground of American politics. . . .\n\nOn this middle ground, all seemed secure. Nothing had to be done for blacks. Nothing had to be done to change the economic structure. An aggressive foreign policy could continue. The country seemed under control. And then, in the 1960s, came a series of explosive rebellions in every area of American life, which showed that all the system's estimates of security and success were wrong.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/424307", "artist_names": "Depeche Mode", "full_title": "Barrel of a Gun by\u00a0Depeche\u00a0Mode", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e85a8b5b93f6e9a9b8028ebc48d97eb2.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e85a8b5b93f6e9a9b8028ebc48d97eb2.856x856x1.jpg", "id": 424307, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 354383, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1605788211, "path": "/Depeche-mode-barrel-of-a-gun-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 10, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Depeche-mode-barrel-of-a-gun-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1997, "month": 4, "day": 14}, "release_date_for_display": "April 14, 1997", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Apr. 14, 1997", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/9628f07ac5cfa3e2aff46d606bedd543.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9628f07ac5cfa3e2aff46d606bedd543.862x862x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 2, "hot": false, "pageviews": 15068}, "title": "Barrel of a Gun", "title_with_featured": "Barrel of a Gun", "updated_by_human_at": 1669938932, "url": "https://genius.com/Depeche-mode-barrel-of-a-gun-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/943", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7a4ffbd0f759023b7989fd7c4a4ef13b.918x516x1.jpg", "id": 943, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/10a9f03f632c7933ab25bc332283db54.500x500x1.jpg", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Depeche Mode", "slug": "Depeche-mode", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Depeche-mode"}, "artist": "Depeche Mode", "lyrics": "Barrel of a Gun Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDo you mean this horny creep\nSet upon weary feet\nWho looks in need of sleep\nThat doesn't come?\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis twisted, tortured mess\nThis bed of sinfulness\nWho's longing for some rest\nAnd feeling numb\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat do you expect of me?\nWhat is it you want?\nWhatever you've planned for me\nI'm not the one\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Verse 3]\nA vicious appetite\nVisits me each night\nAnd won't be satisfied\nWon't be denied\n\n[Verse 4]\nAn unbearable pain\nA beating in my brain\nThat leaves the mark of Cain\nRight here inside\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat am I supposed to do\nWhen everything that I've done\nIs leading me to conclude\nI'm not the one?\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhatever I've done\nI've been staring down the barrel of a gun\nWhatever I've done\nI've been staring down the barrel of a gun\nWhatever I've done (Whatever, whatever)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIs there something you need from me?\nAre you having your fun?\nI never agreed to be\nYour holy one\n\n[Chorus]\nWhatever I've done\nI've been staring down the barrel of a gun\nWhatever I've done (Whatever, whatever)\nI've been staring down the barrel of a gun\nWhatever I've done (Whatever, whatever)\nI've been staring down the barrel of a gun10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/490531", "artist_names": "The Chemical Brothers (Ft.

Hennigan, U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, 1974\n\nTHE SEEK BUTTON on the Ford's radio is working. The downtown recedes. Miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield. The SEEK function locks on someplace in stereo, college FM probably. \"Yeah,\" a new friend says, \"Whas up. Whas goin on.\" The radio has another button, VOL, which gets jacked repeatedly while the Ford hurtles, happily, to the source of the noise. Not to the station's broadcast booth on a campus across the river, nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs, but rather to RJam Productions in North Dorchester, where black kids from Boston's now-integrated high schools-Latin, Madison Park, Jeremiah Burke, Mattapan-cut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radio's new friend, a young man named Schoolly D who right now, at speaker-damaging volume, sounds darn big. \"Before we start this next record\u2026,\" Schooly's saying. The record in question is called \"Signifying Rapper,\" a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from Side 2 of Schoolly's Smoke Some Kill.\nThe black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then. On the southbound left of the Fitzgerald Expressway pass 20 blocks of grim Irish-Catholic housing projects, the western border of Belfast, complete with Sinn Fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious United Ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused \"Them\" from wherever it is \"They\" live-the Third World fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white South Boston. On the Expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of Haiti, Jamaica and Georgia; a territory that maps of Boston call North Dorchester.\n\nUniting the two sides of the Expressway is just about nothing. Both neighborhoods are tough and poor. Both hate the college world across the river, which, because of Boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen. And kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto Philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from Smoke Some Kill, very much richer.\n\nNot that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when Morgan v. Hennigan, Boston's own Brown v. Board of Education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected Italians were sometimes unwelcome in the Irish precincts east of the Expressway, kids in Boston's Little Belfast sang along with James Brown over the radio.\n\"Say it loud\nI'm black and I'm proud\nSay it loud\nI'm black and I'm proud!\"\n\nExcept that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: Jesus christ, \"I'm proud to be black\" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, Jesus, and you get the hell outta there. And so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts.\n\n\"Say it loud\nI'm mmm hum proud\nSay it loud\nMum hum hum proud!\"\n\nBut rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting \"ghetto\" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. How, for example, does the sing-along fan of Smoke Some Kill mumble his way through these lines:\n\n\"Black is beautiful\nBrown is sick? slick? stiff?\nYellow's OK\nBut white ain't shit.\"\n\nRjam Productions, modestly headquartered in a mixed black/Hispanic Field, Corner section of North Dorchester, is as follows:\n\n* One (1) four-car garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block;\n* One (1) touch-tone telephone (leased);\n* Two (2) Chevy Blazers, vanity-plated RJAM1 and RJAM2, each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks (also leased);\n* One (1) VCR with Kathleen Turner's Body Heat cued up on the morning in question;\n* Most importantly, eight (8) promising acts under binding contract\nIf, as has happened to many local labels, Rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors, these would be the pieces. But there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneer's gavel. Schoolly D, the original Signifying Rapper, looms irresistibly from the pages of rap \"fanzines\" Hip-Hop and The Source; and Rjam's prime, unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next Schoolly D. Or the next Ice T, or Kool Moe Dee, or L. L. Cool J., or whoever's the special hero of the kid cutting the demo. On this particular morning, the dream is to be the next MC Lyte--a hard-rapping woman known for jams like \"MC Lyte vs. Vanna Whyte\" and \"10% Dis\"--since today is Tam-Tam's day and Tam-Tam is, at 16, a tough girl in the MC Lyte mold who, like MC Lyte, can dance, look good, and tell men to beat it, all at once.\n\nOr so claims Tam-Tam's producer, promoter, and dutch uncle, Gary Smith, who opened RJam on Martin Luther King's birthday, '89, with his older brother Nate. Nate, the elder statesman, is 25. Gary, 22, runs the company while Nate travels with his boyhood-friend-turned-boss, quadruple-platinum, Prince-derived rapper/singer, Bobby Brown. RJam was founded in part with an investment from the 23-year-old multi-millionaire Brown, a native of Roxbury. Brown now lives in Los Angeles.\n\nNate and Gary Smith turn a healthy profit making demos at $500/tape, but the brothers aren't in the health business. Their aim: to follow in the corporate footsteps of Def Jam, a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in Hollis, Queens, which since its basement days, has given America Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J., the Beastie Boys, and much of the rest of that culture-quake called rap. Gary Smith doesn't compare RJam to Def Jam, and, unlike Def Jam's Russell Simmons, Gary produces pop, soul, and R&B as well as straight rap, and actually prefers R&B. But how many sophomores at nearby Jeremiah Burke can afford to dream in R&B, to front music lessons and $500 for an nth-hand sound set-up, find three friends to learn drums, bass and keyboards, and then raise another $500 to make a demo at RJam? Anybody with a larynx can rap, however, and Rjam's brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman, Boston Edison and the Chevrolet Motor Credit Corp.\n\nTwenty minutes farther south on the Fitzgerald Expressway, across the Neponset River and into the pricey suburbs, is the scene of John Cheever's boyhood, more recently celebrated as Massachusetts Miracle country, where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week, four of which will fail within 12 months. RJam's Gary Smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban Chambers of Commerce, sharing their worries about cash flow, overhead, and the enforceability of his contracts; but Gary's world and theirs are as far apart as those of Ward and Eldridge Cleaver. Worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives' seaside homes. In Gary's neighborhood, property values are actually falling.\n\nWaiting less than patiently for Tam-Tam, Gary honks twice. A tall, grave girl with an angel's heart-shaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of RJAM1. She has, apparently, at least two voices, the cynical, sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling Pebbles men ain't worth it, and the whisper in which she now says hello.\n\nAs RJAM1 re-crosses North Dorchester, heading back to the soundproof studios to get the day's work started, Gary and DJ Reese hash out production details. Tam-Tam's a dignified island in the back seat, and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the Motor City in '63 with Berry Gordy and an eighty-pound teenage Diana Ross, just voted Best Dressed at Cass Technical High School, driving crosstown to record a little number called \"Where Did Our Love Go.\"\n\nAsk Tam-Tam about Diana Ross, and she gives a beatific smile. She's 16; she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to, when rap was new and she was 8; Run-DMC or somebody, she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences. Like most of rap's black audience (as distinct from rap's white audience, which is usually a decade older), Tam-Tam has no first-hand recollection of James Brown except as a source for rap. She is too young to have attended segregated schools. She was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in Boston and can't remember the awful day in '74 when \"pro-neighborhood\" marchers from Irish South Boston came upon a black pedestrian at City Hall and beat him with pole-mounted American flags.\n\nTam-Tam has star presence, and like many who do, she seems to see very little of what goes on around her, the price of the star's intense focus on self. She reminds you of Senator Gary Hart. He, too, had star presence. In front of a crowd, Hart was riveting; in the elevator riding up to the auditorium, he was barely there. Being barely there in the neighborhood Tam-Tam calls home is probably not such a bad thing, and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here. Ambition is, finally, a form of hope, a scarce commodity in North Dorchester.\n\nBack in Rjam's control booth, Dj Reese and producer Ralph Stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be \"Ho, You're Guilty.\" Drum parts are taken from a Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the user's choice of drum-matrix. The TR-909's keys, on a console designed to resemble, vaguely, the familiar piano, are named after the sound each creates-bass, snare, mid-tom, hi-tom--and the sounds are named after the actual drums which, until the TR-909, were required to make those sounds. The TR-909 even sports a key named HAND CLAP, making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger, rendering obsolete the Zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping. The finished \"Ho, You're Guilty\" will sound lush with percussion, melody, and instrumental breaks. Not one human musician will be employed in the recording process.\n\nEach percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track: a snare track, a bass track, a clap track, etc. Reese has been studying the classics lately, too, viz: James Brown's Dead on the Heavy Funk from '75ish, including the ageless groove, \"Funky President,\" in which James announces his third-party candidacy. Some of Bobby Byrd's Dead guitar, and a holy moment when James exhales rhythmically, have been isolated from a store-bought cassette of Dead, re-recorded on clean tape, then re-re-recorded onto a computer-readable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by Ralph Stacey using a Roland D-50 linear synth. The guitar and the exhalation then go, as altered, from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board. Reese, the DJ, will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24 strands.\n\nAs Reese and Ralph Stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape, Tam-Tam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth. You ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf. She doesn't seem to register the question. \"The other career besides rap I'd like to pursue is modelling,\" she says. \"I'm five-seven. That's the perfect height for a model.\"\n\nMixing takes the rest of the day. Producer Ralph Stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question: \"Why do you want to write about rap, anyway?\" It is lucky that at that minute Reese is done mixing. Tomorrow the RJam staff will tape Tam-Tam's vocal track and lay this over Reese's rhythm track. Then the sound will be \"fattened\" with stacks of horns, guitar hooks, bells, canned applause, and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the Rolands. The final demo tape of \"Ho, You're Guilty\" will then be shopped to the 20 major, minor, and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12-inch single.\n\nEveryone's ready to call it a day. Gary Smith's already huddled with some new wanna-be stars in RJam's reception area. Reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth, and Tam-Tam immediately stands, modelling forgotten, utterly alert. Reese gestures to her with maestro hands. She raps at an absent Antoinette in the hard, sexy voice you haven't heard since this morning, extemporaneous but on beat:\n\"I'm a female\nYou're just a fairytale.\"\n\nThe small-w we here are two white Boston males: one native, one oft-transplanted; both residing in Somerbridge, a dim, ethnic-Portuguese neighborhood whose gentrification we abet. M. is an attorney with a taste for jazz, Blues, funk; D. a grad student and would-be drifter who watches TV instead of sleeping. Our cultural tastes and interests are day and night. They converged only lately, when D's stereo arrived UPS and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable, somewhat furtive, and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called rap/hip-hop.* About our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague & distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing. For instance, we agreed that real or serious rap is not JJ FAD or Tone Loc or Beasties, Egyptian Lover or Fat Boys, not experiments or freakshows or current commercial crossover slush. \"Serious\" rap--a unique U.S. inner-city fusion of funk, technified reggae, teen-to-teen \"hardcore\" rock, and the early 70s \"poetry of the black experience\" of Nikki Giavonni, the Last Poets, etc.--has, since its late-70s delivery at the record-scratching hands of Afrika Bambaataa and his Zulu Nation, Sugarhill Gang, Kool Herc and his automated Herculords, and Grandmaster Flash, always had its real roots in the Neighborhood, the black gang-banger Underground. Black music, of and for blacks.\n\nWe concurred as to the wheres and whens of rap's begetting--mid-to-late 70s' South Bronx house parties; then, by decade's end, block parties, with municipal electric lights tapped for a power source, literal dancing in the streets; by '82, regular rap-houses and then \"floating clubs\"--the Roxy every Sunday, The Bronx's Disco Fever TWTh--everybody Breaking to a new musical antimusic being fashioned from records and turntables and an amateur DJs ad-lib banter; a very heavy reggae influence at the beginning; the more rhythmic pure rap an offshoot, its brisker, sparer, backbeat designed for Breakdance, and the smooth-rapping partygoer who just didn't want to shut up when others' music was on. We agreed, too, on rough chronology: amateur house-partiers giving way to professional DJs, pioneers; they, too, then overshadowed by new art-entrepreneurs, former Breakers, failed singers, gag-majorettes; then the rise of \"Indies,\" the tiny independent labels that keep most new music on life-support--Sugar Hill, Jive, Tommy Boy, Wild Pitch, Profile Records, Enjoy--then, after King Tim III's \"Personality Jock\" and Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight,\" an entree into urban black radio; then to underground \"Mix\" radio; then corporate levels, digital technology, very big money, the early-80s talent that became an early Scene's cream--Spoonie G. and Sequence, Eric Fresh, Unknown DJ, Egyptian Lover and Run-DMC. Then, Spring '84, the extraordinary Midas touch of Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons' Def Jam label (now under contract to CBS) from which sprang a mid-80s stable of true stars, in the Underground--Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J, Slick Rick, the still-unparalleled Eric B. and Rakim--and L.A.'s alternatives: Kool Moe Dee, L.A. Dream Team, and others. And now, at decade's end, an absolute explosion of rap-as-pop, big business, MTV, special fashions, posters, merchandise, with only a few big, new, cutting-edge acts--L.A.'s N.W.A., Philadelphia's Schoolly D, Miami's 2 Live Crew, De La Soul's House-blend of rap/funk/jazz--remaining too esoteric or threatening or downright obscene to cross all the way over and cash in with big labels. By '89 rap is finally proving as \"important\" (read also lucrative) to an anemic shock-and rebellion-music industry as Punk was an exact decade ago. This was all just data. We agreed on it, and on how it was curious that we both had such strange, distant facts down cold.\n\nOur point of departure, essay-wise, was always less what we know than what we felt, listening: less what we liked than why. For this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap, trying to summon a kind of objective, critical, purely \"aesthetic\" passion that the music itself made impossible. For outsiders, rap's easy to move to, hard to dissect. The more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued, the more we felt that the stuff's appeal for two highbrow, upscale whites was just plain incongruous. Because serious rap has, right from the start, presented itself as a closed show. Usually critical questions of culture, context, background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions. Not here. No question that serious rap is, and is very self-consciously, music by urban blacks about same to and for same. To mainstream whites it's a tight cohesion that can't but look, from outside the cultural window, like occlusion, clannishness (sic) and inbreeding, a kind of reverse snobbery about what's \"def\" and \"fresh\" and in-the-Scene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college Societies and WASP-only country clubs. Serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or Establishment, and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individuals--the Great White Male is rap's Grand Inquisitor, its idiot questioner--its Alien Other no less than Reds were for McCarthy. The music's paranoia, together with its hermetic racial context, helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary.\n\nOther incongruities. Rap is a \"music\" essentially without melody, built instead around a digitally synthesized drum- and back-beat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waiting-room table, enhanced by \"sampled\" (pirated) \"krush grooves\" (licks or repetitive chord-series) conceived and recorded by pre-rap rock icons, the whole affair characterized by a distinctive, spare, noisy, clattering \"style\" whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of low-I amperage around the performative circuit of the MC/rapper and his record-scratching, sound-mixing Sancho Panza, the DJ.\n\nThe rapper (the guy in the cameo cut or Kangol hat, pricey warm-up, unlaced Adidas, extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion) offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight, stressed, rhymed verse, the verse's syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboing-for-rhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from Nantucket. The lyrics, nearly always self-referential, tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes, themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull. Eg: just how bad/cool/fresh/def the rapper and his lyrics are; just how equally un-all-these his music rivals are; how troublesome, vacuous and acquisitive women are; how wonderful it is to be \"paid in full\" for rapping instead of stealing or dealing; how gangs are really families, 'caine's constant bad news. And, in particular, how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to late-80s American glory.\n\nThe masks are many, too many for anything really but direct aural inspection: rap personae can change frequently even within single albums, the rapper delivering Hard, violent Black Nationalist communique on one cut, dubbing against Trinidadian steel drums on another, basking in big label eclat on a third, cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb, cooing to his \"bitch\" and then on the flip side, threatening to go get his gun again if she can't learn who's boss. Though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face, the quintessential rap group is unquintessential, chameleonesque. This is either by weird design, or it's a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessness\u2026or most likely, it's just a good old venerable synecdoche of rap's genre itself, one that's now moving so fast it can't quite fix on its own identity -- much less hold still for anything like cool, critical classification or assessment, from outside.\n\nThe MC's Alice Toklas-esque DJ hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black Germanness of a whole lot of digital editing & playback equipment. His responsibility is the song behind and around the rap -- the backbeat, krush groove, and the \"sound carpet,\" i.e. a kind of electric aural environment, a chaos behind the rapper's rhymed order, a digitalized blend of snippets, squeaks, screams, sirens, snatches from pop media, all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of \"samples\" that results. The most recognizable of these samples range from staccato record-scratches to James Brown and Funkadelic licks, to M.L.K.'s public Dream, to quotidian pop pap like \"The Theme from Shaft,\" Brady Bunch dialogue, and '50s detergent commercials.\n\nWe have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hip-hop available in every single on-line periodical ... xcept for one or two underground newsletters (viz. The City Sun, Fresh-Est) circulated in parts of the Bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine China White or AKs. From the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and PhDs, the following has become clear. Outside England, where the Punk-weaned audience has developed a taste for spectacle-through-windows, for vicarious Rage and Protest against circumstances that have exactly 0% to do with them, most of what Rolling Stone calls \"devoted rock consumers\" (meaning we post-baby-boomers), plus almost all established rock critics, tend to regard non-crossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic, or swaggering and bellicose and dangerous--at all events, basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive self-referentiality\u2026in short, as closed to them, to us, as a music. Unrecognizable as what we've been trained and adverted to buy as pop.... Great to dance to, of course, but then what might the white audience for today's mainstream expect? Rap, whether fecund or sterile, is today's pop music's lone cutting edge, the new, the unfamiliar, the brain-resisted-while-body-boogies. And that resisted, alien, exhilarating cutting edge has always been black.\n\n\"What have you left me? what have I got?\nLast night in cold blood my young brother got shot\nMy homey got jacked\nMy mother's on crack\nMy sister can't work cause her arms show tracks\nMadness, insanity\nLive in profanity\nThen some punk claim that they understandin' me?\nGive me a break--what world do you live in?\nDeath is my sex--guess my religion.\"**\n\nWhat makes this stuff so much more disturbing, more real to outsiders than the Punk Rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously? Maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom: I always found it tough to listen straight-faced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit. All doctrine and pronouncement, exclusively anti-, this Punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void, nothing human to grab onto. I have no idea what a Punk performer thinks, feels, is, day-to-day... in fact I always suspected he had no day, but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow. Can you imagine a Punk with four-foot hair and spiked jacket and nose-ring, say, eating a bologna sandwich? Replacing a light bulb? Putting a quarter in a meter? Not me, boy. And even Barnum, who knew fear sells, also knew that freakshows aren't frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance. 0% affinity = 0% empathy. And fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat.\n\nPublic Enemy and N.W.A., Ice T and Schoolly D discomfit us, our friends, the critics we read and cornered, because the Hard rappers' lyrics are conscientious about being of/for the real lives and attitudes of recognizable, if alien, persons. Here's where it's a level up from mere spectacle: ideology in Hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition. This makes rap not only better than Punk, but way scarier. Serious Hard raps afford white listeners genuine, horse's-mouth access to the life-and-death plight and mood of an American community on the genuine edge of im-/explosion, an ugly new sub-nation we've been heretofore conditioned to avoid, remand to the margins, not even see except through certain carefully abstract, attenuating filters.\n\nFor outsiders, rap is hard to dissect, easy to move to. The command is: dance, don't understand; participate, don't manipulate. Rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology. The first is that nu style of speak--the \"dialect drug,\" De La Soul calls it--that rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us. Some in-words, like \"fly,\" meaning \"finelooking,\" have been in coin since the beginning, now venerable as Old English because they turn up on Grandmaster Flash cuts from '82. Others, like \"dead presidents,\" rap for $$, are either coming into or going out of currency, depending on when you read this. Rap, a club language, has myriad ways to describe one's own or others' looks. \"Fly\" is how a man digs a woman. One would never describe oneself as \"fly,\" even when cataloguing one's own attractions (done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps Village Voice personals). \"Fresh\" means irresistibly stylish, oft-modified by \"funky,\" \"crazy,\" or \"stoopid,\" predominantly used to convey the fly-ness of things other than women, including oneself or one's rap, which two concepts rappers, like schizophrenics, can't always keep separate in their heads. \"Dope\" means \"def,\" and \"def\" means crazy funky stoopid fresh. Synonyms include: the shit, the It, the cool, the thang, the word, the grooviest, the categorical imperative, die weltanschung, the that-which-Potter-Stewart-would-know-if-he-saw. A def rapper is so style-defining as to make the stylish mere copycats. To be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machine--not seeking solitude, but rather confident that others will follow. The def rapper MC's a def rap, which rap def-ly tells of its own (and the rapper's) def-ness--so def, as MC/manager, entrepreneur Russell Rush Simmons brags, that it had to be on a label called Def Jam.\n\nRap celebrates power, equating strength with style, and style with the \"I\" in \"Individuality.\" Rappers \"dis\"--dismiss--the styleless, faceless. To \"ill\" is to be weak or wrong; to \"bite\" is to thieve another's dope beat. And only the ill would bite.\n\nEarly remastered pop was the first fake music ever, since what the record buyer of '63 experienced as Aural Event on his turntable couldn't happen live. Rock began to become an Illusion of Event which technology made possible; rock became more like the movies, starting down a long road at the end of which was MTV.\n\nNot that this kept Phil Spector up nights. The gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean, for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price. With each magnetic jump from live, as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes, the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied. Dual high-bias media with 2 units each of sonic garbage per 10,000 units of Elvis Presley, retaped on similar 2-units-per-10,000 tape, became 4 units of hiss; retaped, 8; then 16; then 32. As the sound got fuller, it decayed.\n\nThe solution was a breakthrough called multi-tracking--using recorders that could capture and play back on 2 (as in stereo), 4 (as in '67's then-ear-shattering Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band), 12, 16, and today 24 parallel tracks, eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next. Rhythms, melodies, harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks, allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and re-mix, adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track. Rap Edisons like Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa began as party DJs, not musicians. Their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer, allowing them to \"stack\" the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike, was a kind of crude, extemporaneous multitracking. Technological loops like those in the NASA-esque studios of CBS and Polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys. Carter was President. The Bee Gees, with five Top-Ten hits in twelve months, were king.\n\nDigital recording, the science dividing Rjam's Tam-Tam on tape from Tam-Tam as heard \"live\" is a technology that converts music to codes or \"digits.\" The codes are \"read\" by a computer, one combining sophisticated sound-to-code translation hardware with a number-crunching COS and a high-response synthesizer, at speeds of 40,000 digits per second and up. The recorded sounds, reduced to numbers, can be shaped, mangled, muffled, amplified, and even canonized.*** Hardware then translates the digits, as read and altered, back into sound, which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds. The result: hiss-free reproduction on an infinity of tracks, each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely.\n\nDigital recording, part of the 80s sea-change in how pop gets made, divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer, the engineer at the mixing board, the producer who coordinates the multi-tracking and mixing process, and the electronic hardware that actually \"makes\" the music we buy. The latest synthesizers**** produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations, with voltage-meters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to \"attack-delay envelope\" (another non-rap term, denoting the microtimed, counterpoised quality of a note's duration, how a note's sound/quaver-structure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fades--the manipulation of a piano's foot-pedals, for example, affects the delay component of each note and chord's envelope). The Kurzweil 250, a state-of-the-art system, is a 1-?track/12,018-note synthesizer linked by software to an Apple MacIntosh Plus, which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound. The Kurzweil could put all of culture in a blender--take Janet Leigh's Cremora-curdling scream from Psycho, store it in the Mac, program the synth such that an F# will be reproduced as Janet Leigh's F# scream, then play \"We Shall Overcome\" as if screamed by Janet Leigh; store this; treat similarly Bach's St. Matthew's Passion, except with vast choruses of screaming Janet Leighs, then \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" then \"Twist and Shout\" (by the Isleys, not the Beatles), all as screams; then replay the four as one horrific jumble, or select amidst the jumble; and then whatever you came up with in the final, painstakingly re-mixed mix you could play backwards. And call that \"finished.\" Or never finish. It's like holding music at gunpoint. You can make it do--or do to you --whatever you can think of. Whim is the only limit.\n\nBasically we decided we were into rap because, even media-hype aside, this music had some kind of hard edge to it. Date of composition here is July '89. Think back. This last has been a fiscal year in which Madonna's \"back on top,\" in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts, in which Rod Stewart's out of cryogenics and back on top.... MTV's ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels; Bobby McFerrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synth-reggae invitation to \"Be Happy,\" a song that has the same verbal-pre-packaging feel as \"Where's the Beef?\"\n\nThis last year heavy metal's fake-Satanist male models accounted for 1/2 of total U.S. record sales; U2 filmed a $20,000,000 homage to their own self-righteousness and Bono's ever more ill-disguised megalomania. A year when even good old REM finally went corporate-pop with Green, when good old Springsteen trashed his bride, when as modest and nascent a talent as Tracy Chapman earned cymbal-crashing critical raves for her competent, updated frappe of Baez and Armatrading, so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh. Just not a notable pop year at all. Except in rap. Rap appears in the famished late 80s as potentially a genuine musical Scene the way early jazz, rock, the Summer of Love, folk/protest, god even the way New Wave and Punk were \"Scenes\"--the S-word here simultaneously meaning: something new to look at; something loud and upsetting (\"Oh please, Veronica, let's not have a Scene!\"); and, best, an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet, marry and beget. Whether by virtue or default, rap is pretty much what there is to like right now, if you want to regard today's pop as anything more than covert jingles in 4/4-time. In our opinion.\n\nBut so the point is we enjoy it. Plus we've developed some theses about why serious rap is important, both as art-for-own-sake and as a kind of metaphor-with-larynx for a subbed-culture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the American present.\n\nRap is expanding gas-like through the 80s' dry time, growing from house party schtick, gang anthem, a small-label fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimers--then somehow, when we weren't looking, into Scene, movement, On The Air--finally, in the last 24 months, assuming the fecund role of genuine Genre. Exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track. There's now Dub's mix of rap and reggae, House's mix of rap and 70s-, huge-afro'd funk, Acid House's psychedelic hip-hop. There is black rap for white mass-consumption (Tone Loc, Run?DMC), black rap for local set and -house consumption (countless local stars and wanna-be's in every large city), ultra-black rap superstars for the whole marginal Nation inside (Heavy D, Public Enemy, Big Daddy Kane), white rap for white masses (the execrable Beastie Boys). There is Hispanic, Salsa-influenced rap out of different West Coast barrios, rap fused with West Indian or Islamic traditional music in Digital Underground, Eric B. and Rakim, and others, or fused with oh-so-danceable R&B in the new \"jack swing\" offshoot (Bobby Brown, MC Hammer); even gay and bohemian young urban Bs have their trendsetters in Teddy Riley and Guy, De La Soul, Kwabe. Etc. etc.***** A major impediment to sampling this Scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the Scene itself is changing. If you're reading this in print it's already dated.\n\nAnd the rap world's vitality is one of replacement as well as variety, allowing the genre to remain fresh, as band after band is seduced into the \"real\" music biz. This Scene is hydra-like. Almost the moment a rap artist like Run-DMC or L. L. Cool J \"breaks through\" into major-market mix appeal, MTV's land of corporate bankability, certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed. The breakthrough band's B-boys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime: after all, they've been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status, about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice. Their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame, of the now-enhanced authority of their \"Message\"--though it's hard to feature Public Enemy rapping about a Black-Militant renaissance, about revolution and American apocalypse, while lily-white CBS Records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats.\n\nNevertheless, back in the underground Scene, the breakthrough band's tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal, to await feverishly \"their\" crew's spots on the same music TV they love to dis. In short, there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in late-60s protest rock. Which if you think about it, is passing strange. The white mainstream Other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the 60s \"Establishment\" too look downright benign.\n\nOur opinion, then, from a distance: not only is a serious rap serious poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great 80s Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we've been encouraged sadly to write off,6 it's quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. \"Real\" (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocab, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred and (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn't get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers, doesn't get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership (most of the moved being poets themselves), doesn't generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best PhD-poets rent their names and time ... and especially does not inspire a whole culture's youth to try to follow in their Connecticut-catalogue brogans' prints. Because of rap's meteoric rise, though, you've got poor kids, tough kids, \"underachievers,\" a \"lost generation\"... more young people--ostensibly forever turned off \"language\" by TV, video games and low U.S.D.E. budgets--more of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time, trying to put words together in striking and creative ways, than the U.S.A. has probably ever had at one time. That few of these will become \"stars\" matters far less than the grim stats about, say, the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status: the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values (and values enough to let rap-dissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing) can obviously be applied in mainstream-approved, \"productive\" ways--G.E.D.'s college, Standard Written English ...perhaps someday even ad-copywriting!\n\nBut is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted four-car garages like North Dorchester's RJam's in spite of the genre's near-disciplinary prosodic restrictions, or because of them? Can't really tell. Probably doesn't matter. The fact remains that, were \"important poetry\" presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a Supply-Side democracy (popularity, effect, the separation of fan from his cash), staid journals like Poetry and American Poetry Review would be featuring some number of fade-cut, multiple-earring'd authors' photos in each issue; and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to \"listen rude\" to Wilbur and Levertov and Ashbery, just as e.g Rimbaud and Pound did to their own contemporaries ... to the delight and invigoration of a time's poetry...\n\n... And even just the prospected fantasy of seeing Public Enemy's be-clocked Flavor Fav and like a Jorie Graham or Amy Clampitt sitting down over beer and Celestial Seasonings to hash out the debate over line-breaks in dactylic pentameter, a very serious young homeboy in Italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhyme's renaissance--at least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhyme-as-form--to the cold corridors of Serious Appreciation.\n\nUnlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late 80s, though, rap's own quality, the def freshness of the MC's bit, is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against. In case you thought we forgot, rap is first of all a movement in rock music, and thus the time-honored requirement is that the rap Scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock 'n roll to justify one of its essential roles, rebellion-against. Except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter, spread, grow in urgency--from the 50s' parents and principals, homework, hot rods, the sweet hurt of teen love, to the urban 80s, police, violent death, homelessness, the lure of ecstatic drugs that dehumanize weaponry, fatherlessness, the animal emptiness of sex w/o love, the almost Trilaterally sinister White Establishment (\"THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBLE THE GOVERNMENT'S. . . \"), Everyone Else: life as a series of interruptions from an angry slumber about what the electric voices say you must have and the human voices say you may not, about the betrayal of the past, of the promises exacted by Carmichael, X, and the now-formal martyrdom of King.\n\nSegregation may affect their hearts and minds, Earl Warren warned, as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, both alumni of Boston's old separate-but-awful schools, bear loud witness. Now, 40 years after X disgustedly quit a racist high school and began a career as a kind of be-bop gang-banger, 35 years after Brown v. Board of Education invented integration, 15 years after Morgan v. Hennigan brought Brown to Boston, North Dorchester is worse and its schools aren't better. A former United States Secretary of Education converts to Drug Czar, symbolizing a national change of mind: now drugs, not poor schools (and certainly not the American apartheid of which segregated schools were but one facet), is our root \"innercity\" problem. Tam-Tam's Boston is strangely less hopeful than the notoriously segregated pre-Hennigan city, perhaps because before Hennigan reformers could promise that segregation was why things were so bad. Segregation was blame's bullseye: abolish the bullseye, and blame for the estrangement of the races flies everywhere, hitting the cops, or the courts, or the teachers, or the taught, or what's taught. There's even a rap--B.D.P.'s \"Why is That?\"--blaming our miseries on the failure of the schools to \"teach black kids to be black.\"\n\nBut everything the white rock listener pays to enjoy is black-begotten. If today's Top?40 environment seems bleak or befouled, imagine the present mainstream without its sweetest sourcewaters, without the King-Waters-King Blues trinity, the Brownian soul, the backbeat, cut time, blue notes, funky French curves of sax and brass, the guitar solo, call-and-response, the Cold Medina or Lucky Powder, those lithely syncopated quintets in pomade and linen suits, the single hand in the white glove holding Pepsi aloft in the shadow of accidental flames.... Black music is American pop's breath and bread; and we, as both born audience and born salesmen, know it.\n\nSo maybe it's them. Them. Maybe we're approaching an enforced fork in the musical road where the white-run entertainment industry will have to pack up what it's taken and go seek its fortune on the backs of new minorities. Maybe, in serious rap, the extreme new insulation of the black sound is not only intentional but preplanned, part of a neo-Nationalist agenda, the hermetic new Scene's tight circle more like something large and coiled than something small and flat.\n\nYou may now be getting some hazy idea of the sorts of really quite scary possibilities with which the rap we like is replete. And, hazier, of how complicated this stuff of sampler-from-outside can be. What's remained passing strange, for use, is the vague threat's appeal. The unease and ambivalence with which the rare white at the window loves rap renders that love no less love. Whence the fear, though, is really no matter. For look at the world, at the masses we're part of. At what you look at closest. The plain 80s data is that, whereas love, devotion, passion seem only to divide, it's fear and strangeness that bind crowds, fill halls, unite Us, somehow, as audience, under the great tent.\n\n*'Hip-hop' is an older synonym, coined by Rap pioneer, Kool Herc, to describe the heavily danceable Jamaican scatting he introduced between records at the huge South Bronx block parties he and other new-Scene celebrities, like Jazzy Five and former Black Spades leader, Afrika Bambaataa, could turn into late-70s frenzies of Breakdance (both music and dance a self-conscious reaction against the glittered unreality of downtown Disco).\n\n**Except but now hey kids! thanks to AT&T you can now speak directly to Ice T and hear his philosophy of life by phone! 1-900-907-9111. \"Chill out with Ice T,\" the rapper adrape in military hardware and ammunition says on MTV, \"I'm just waiting on you to call me,\" pointing at the camera and then himself lest the audience get at all confused. \"Don't forget to ask your parent's permission first\" (white corporate voice-over)--$2.00 first minute, etc. etc.\n\n***\"Canon\" being another non-jive rap term, meaning the division of a single sequence of sound into two or more repeating sound-sequences, like a vocal round.\n\n**** ... themselves the heirs of a long, 20th-century evolutionary process, from the playe-?piano to the 20s Oncles Martenot and Theremin and Trautonium (crude electronic instruments big in France), to Pierre Schaeffer's musique concrete in '48, to the first Electronic Music Synthesizer invented by engineers at RCA in the 50s to the inauguration of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in '59, to Robert Moog's '64 development of the Moog 55, the first emitter of amplified \"blurps, fwipps, simps, twings, and schlonks\" to be commercially produceable. Walter/Wendy Carlos used a Moog 55 for his/her '68 Switched-On Bach, an album that did more than anything to popularize synthesized sound.\n\n***** Note how the ecstatic force's movement extends beyond sound into dance-Chicago-based house-dancing is very different from Coast-based rap-dancing, while both are distinct from the Quaalude sway a De La Soul's lazy complexity invites--and beyond dance into urban haute couture itself. The \"cameo\" or \"fade,\" that troubling cyberpunk flat-top haircut favored by Carl Lewis and Grace Jones but popularized by the group Cameo's rapping Larry Blackmon, has now become less a haircut than a sculptural statement: words, logos, slogans and complex signs razored into the rigid anvil of hair that is, according to the Voice, \"the most culturally conscious unisex hairstyle since the afro.\" The standard 80s-rap uniform--sideways baseball cap or Kangol, ropey chains, acetate warmup and unlaced hightops--\"...now symbolizes a cruder, more casual era,\" and is diffracting into a rap-House-gay-jackswing look replete with polka-dot ties, loose pleated twills, and expensive dance-loafers or British \"moon boots,\" a combination Ricky Ricardo-Frank Sinatra dapper that now befits a Scene with the dignity, silliness and pull of real Genre. Plus don't forget that just one big change in street and school fashions means millions and millions in garment revenue--even more $$ once the white mainstream, as is its won't, follows in the cutting edge's media-delayed wake.\n\n****** \"We've lost a whole generation to their own culture out here,\" rues an LAPD Assistant Commissioner in a 14 May '89 Boston TV news special on the national Wa-?On

you be seein' out your window\nLil' Dap: Yo I be seeing out my window gunshots everyday\nMelachi:Man yo I be seeing sex money and drugs too but yo\nTell 'em how Duke said\nLil' Dap: The world's about to end\n[Verse 1: Melachi the Nutcracker]\nBorn in the ghetto it's hard to survive\nSome have achieved and many brothers tried\nBut I realized which life to choose\nI wanna make money so I gotta pay dues\nBut there's no rules and you only have one chance\nIf ya fuck up kid you face the circumstance\nAt night I used to scream and shout\nLivin' in the ghetto trying to get the hell out\nSo I would try as I watch my friends die\nBut all I could do was sit back and cry\nThese are feelings I'm expressing through my rhymes\nI been through hard times so many problems on my mind\nI wasn't living rich and I also wasn't poor\nI try to appreciate but I deserve more\nYeah superman supa star\nGive me supa fat dough like Pablo Escobar\n\"Super duper star\"\n\n[Verse 2: Lil' Dap]\nFeared by bandits hated by chicks\nLoved by kids I never did a bid\nYes the Group Home is thick\nPlus I don't eat beef cause these dizzy ass niggas that can think shit is sweet\nYo I work hard and hard my man trace it down to the car\nAfter that keep it movin' have no time to be foolin'\nAround town A&R's you get down with the hype sound\nThe things I say will make a grown man dream\nI speak sayings \"Go by yourself, be by yourself\"\nLet my lyrics vibrate and shake the earth\nI travel ghetto to ghetto, back streets to the street\nKick a rhyme or crime with this ill mastermind\nMom dukes used to tell me with these tears in her eyes\nNow I'm out on my own survival with the dime\nLike an African tribe little Dap will blow your mind\nCheck it out like this\nYou might also likeMelachi:\nAnd then like that\n\n\"Super star\"\n\n[Hook]\n(\"So what the fuck y'all movin' on up\")\n(\"Yes the Group Home is thick so all y'all punks hear this)\" (x3)\n(\"So what the fuck y'all movin' on up\")\n(\"Yo check it check it out like this here we go\")\n\n[Verse 3: Melachi]\nWalkin' the tunnels of hell the next level\nIt's the Nutcracker givin' hell to the devil\nPlayin' the game the New York pain\nMakes me wanna bust but I just maintain\nCause nowadays I talk to a brother\nAlways love your mother cause you'll never get another\nIn the streets bustin' off shots fuck the cops\nI got superstar props\nBig time doe, money is a thriller\nI'm gettin' more iller than the Zodiac killer\nNo lie but before I say bye\nYou can't take money with cha when you die\n\n\"Super duper star\"\n[Verse 4: Lil' Dap]\nYo I got niggas flipping they wig\nChicks grabbing they cunts\nAs they rhyme they get doper and since they greet me with blunts\nOne time for your mind before I break these streets\nAin't nothing holding me back hip hop track\nYo son you know the feelin' shit will get revealed\nAs the times will get better\nAnd you know I got skills I seen the days turn into nights\nAs the stars shine bright\nMotherfuckers Moet and chicks they keep steppin'\nLike Dom Perignon one day will live large\nWord to Allah and it don't seem hard\nNo more jealousy and envy\nCurse is put upon me\nWatch me live free at the clink\nWith my niggas you'll see\nRaising to the top like a rocket ship, yo I go far\n\"Super star\"\n\n[Hook]10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path":

the girl next door\nShe tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand\nThere's something women like about a pickup man\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I turned sixteen, I saved a few hundred bucks\nMy first car was a pickup truck\nI was cruising the town and the first girl I seen\nWas Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecoming queen\nShe flagged me down and climbed up in the cab\nAnd said, \"I never knew you were a pickup man\"\n[Chorus]\nYou can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill\nAnd I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville\nI got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made\nYou know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates\nI met all my wives in traffic jams\nThere's just something women like about a pickup man\n\n[Verse 3]\nMost Friday nights I can be found\nIn the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge\nBacked into my spot at the drive-in show\nYou know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow\nI never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand\nCause there's something women like about a pickup man\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill\nAnd I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville\nI got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made\nYou know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates\nI met all my wives in traffic jams\nThere's just something women like about a pickup man\n\n[Bridge]\nA bucket of rust or a brand new machine\nOnce around the block and you'll know what I mean\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill\nAnd I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville\nI got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made\nYou know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates\nI met all my wives in traffic jams\nThere's just something women like about a pickup man\nYeah, there's something women like about a pickup manEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1338261", "artist_names": "Gerald Levert", "full_title": "Can't

grabbed me by the arm said come on let's go\nShe dipped down, spun around, and do-ce-doed\n\n[Verse 4]\nShe rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees\nShe craweled across the floor and jumped

tried to lock me down\n'Cause the Glock they found was stolen\nThat's how I'm rollin'\nCalvin Klein's no friend of mine\nSo I don't like Marky\nOr the monarchy\nDon't 'Start Me Up' like a Rolling Stone\nI'll leave ya sulkin' like Macaulay Culkin in 'Home Alone'\nSo Get a Grip like Steven Tyler\nI used to trip with the Divine Styler\nBack in the days there were Irish ways\nAnd Irish laws, stand up for The Cause\n[Chorus]\nWhen it's time to rock a funky joint\nI'm on point\nWhen it's time to rock a funky jam\nI'm the man (4x)\n\n[Verse 2: Danny Boy]\nWell it's the D to the A, double N, Y-B-O\nY? 'Cause I rock shit like Ronnie Dio\nIt's a black day of rest, quick, run, get your vest\nI'm down with the Hill 'cause I still got the skill\nTo turn the party out, it's all about the skyscraper\nYour girl caught the vapors so I might videotape her\nI make a lot of papers so I don't have to scrape the\nBottom of the barrel, I rock fly apparel\nNow I could pull your card\nStarting up the Harley Davidson\nI got the gun, so the drama, you could save it!\n\n[Verse 3: DJ Lethal]\nWell it's the mad bum Russian\nFunky with percussion\nFrom L.A. to Flushing\nI get your girlie blushin'\nI'll cut ya like the butcher\n(But it ain't Joe the Biter!)\nThe old rock a loop cause I'm Super like Schneider\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhen it's time to rock a funky joint\nI'm on point\nWhen it's time to rock a funky jam\nI'm the man (4x)\n\n[Verse 4: Everlast]\nI'm ill, retarded\nSo don't get me started\nI might lose my cool\nYou'll lose if we duel\n'Cause I can stomp a hole in the soul of a punk\nWith the rhymes in my head and the beats in my trunk\nI got skill kid and I'm gonna milk it\nFor all it's worth, I'm gettin' mines on Earth\nSo step to the next head\nOr like Sadat X said\n'He's gone and that's how it's supposed to be'\nDon't stand so close to me 'cause\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen it's time to rock a funky joint\nI'm on point\nWhen it's time to rock a funky jam\nI'm the man

you're gonna do when it's starts sinkin'\nMothafucka, you probably start drinkin'\nI don't know, but I'll never be a sucker's friend\nJust because a fool's makin' dead presidents\nRodney O & Joe Cooley will never quit\nAnd all that bullshit dancin' ain't sayin shit\nI'm only down with my homies from the get-go\nFuck O.P.P. and a sideshow\nIf you don't like it, here goes my middle

funky\nFunk, funk, funky\nFunk, funk, funky\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Cooley]\nHere I go with the flow, some dope stuff from Joe\nWhy don't you sit back, hey yo, and bop with the tempo\nSo what up, niggas? Yeah, I got the funky jam\nCome up on your blindside, aw shit, here I am\nI'm not down with the R&B, it make me sick\nSeeing a crooner tryin to add a rap a little bit\nYou know what I'm talkin' about, that shit's not real rap\nThey try to add the hip-hop flavor, and it's still wack\nRodney O, Joe Cooley got the gangster track\nComin' off strong, we're not givin' no slack\nKickin' street shit cause I know it would stick\nI got the hoochie mamas hummin' on my dick\nSit back rap lovers and smile\nThe crew is about to entertain ya for a while\nYou love it, you like it, it's a straight up rap show\nAnd to you R&B fans, you don't hear me though\nYou might also like[Scratching: Joe Cooley]\n\n[Interlude]\nY'all ready for this?\n\n[Bridge]\nWho we?\nWho we?\n\n[Verse 3: Rodney O]\nTime for me to kick another fly funky verse\nAnd if I die, put a sound system in my hearse\nYou don't hear me though, it's a title, bro\nI'm callin' money when I slam down my domino\nUgh, fever in the funk house, yeah\nAnd if you play, then you know what I'm talkin about\nWho you're foolin' when you say that you can fade the O?\nI got a New York critic in a choke hold\nHe dissed my record cause he didn't like my vocals\nNow I'm showin' him the meaning of loco\nI'm not friends with my peers, so I'm overlooked\nI got the p-funk, fool, on a funky hook\nI'm payin' suckers back for all the years of dissin' me\nBut now I'm rollin', and there ain't no stoppin' me\nRodney O and Joe down with the psycho\nBack to the hood, fool, but you don't hear me though\n[Chorus: Pumpkin]\nFunk, funk, funky\nFunk, funk, funky\nFunk, funk, funky\nFunk, funk, funky\n\n[Verse 4: Joe Cooley]\nL.A.'s the place where the hardcore is happenin'\nThat's the way it is, so that's the way we're rappin'\nSome New Yorkers don't know where we're comin from\nAnd one had the nerve to try to diss Compton?\nI take it personal when you diss my hood, son\nNow you got me wanna break you off somethin' (Yeah)\nNow you got me wanna break you off somethin' (Yeah)\nNow you got me wanna break you off somethin'\n\n[Chorus: Joe Cooley & Pumpkin]\nFunk, funk, funky\nJoe Cooley is funk, funk, funky\nRodney O is funk, funk, funkyn\nThis

Coko, Taj, Lelee, Coko, Taj & Leelee]\nAyo, T-Roni,  I really like this guy\nBut he's just too blind to see it\nFor real, Coko?\nDang, what you gon' do about that?\nI don't know\nSing it to him, Coko\nYeah, Le', I'ma do that\nI'ma let him know that I ain't going nowhere\nAnd my lovin' is gon' be right here\nFor real though\nWord!\n[Verse 1]\nLately, there seem to be\nSome insecurities\nAbout the way I feel\nAnd where I wanna be\nBoy, you know it's with you\nNo one can do\nThe things you do\nTo me\nNever to be mistaking\nLong as it's love we're making\nThere'll be no hesitating\nYou and me\nThat's the way it will be\nAnd I won't leave\nYour side\n'Cause you know love will be\n\n[Chorus: SWV]\nRight here\nBe right here\nRight here\nBe right here (Don't you have)\nNo fear (No fear)\nHave no fear (Don't shed)\nNo tears (No tears)\nLove is here\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nTrue love, some don't believe in\nThat's what just I'm givin'\nI'm gonna keep it strong\nI'll be holding on\nTo you\nNo one can do\nMe like you do\nIt's true\nSure as the sun is shining\nOur love will keep on climbing\nThere's gonna be some rain\nGonna be some pain\nBut as long as I know\nBoy, time will show\nOur love will grow\nAnd I know love will be\n\n[Chorus: SWV]\nRight here\nBe right here (Be right here)\nRight here\nBe right here (You don't need to have no)\nNo fear (No fear)\nHave no fear (And don't you have no)\nNo tears\nLove will be\nRight here (My love's gonna be right here)\nBe right here\nRight here\nBe right here (You don't need to have no)\nNo fear (No fear)\nHave no fear (Don't you shed no)\nNo tears\nLove is here\n[Bridge: SWV]\nWon't let go, you should know\nThis thing is real\nNo questions, just listen to\nYour heart and love will be right\u2014\n\n[Verse 3: Taj]\nBaby, what's the problem? It seems like we're having trouble\nYou don't seem to understand that the life I lead ain't double\nMy heart belongs to you, and only you and you know it's true\nA phony imitation just won't do\nRelax your mind, I'm not the kind who runs around and wastes my time\nOn the fine brothers that just don't compare\nI'll be there, I swear, far and near, have no fear\nI don't care, you can count on me, I'm right here\n\n[Chorus: SWV]\nRight here (Be\u2014 Be\u2014 Be\u2014 Be\u2014)\nBe right here (Be\u2014 Be right here)\nRight here\nBe right here (You don't need to have no)\nNo fear (No fear)\nHave no fear (Don't you shed no)\nNo tears (No tears)\nLove is here\nRight here (Love's gonna be, my love's gonna be right here), my love's gonna be right here\nBe right here\nRight here\nBe right here (I ain't goin' nowhere)\nNo fear (Love's gonna be, love's gonna be)\nHave no fear (Don't you shed no)\nNo tears\nLove will be\n\n[Outro]\nRight here (Love's gonna be, love's gonna be), my love's gonna be\nLove's gonna be, love's gonna be (My love's gonna be)\nRight here (Love's gonna be, love's gonna be), my love's gonna be\nBe right here\nNo fear (Love's gonna be, love's gonna be)\nLove's gonna be, love's gonna be (Don't you shed no)\nNo tears\nLove is here (Love's gonna be right here)\nRight here (Love's gonna be, love's gonna be)\nBe right here (Love's gonna be, love's gonna be)\nRight here (Love's gonna be, love's gonna be)\nBe right here\nNo fear (Love's gonna be, love's gonna be)\nHave no fear (Love's gonna be, love's gonna be)\nNo tears1Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

are you dissing, maybe I'm missing\nThe reason that you're smiling or wilding so listen\nIn my head I just want to take 'em down\nImagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down\nLet it flow like a mud slide\nWhen I get on I like to ride and glide\nI've got depth of perception in my text y'all\nI get props at my mention cause I vex y'all\nSo what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?\n(What'cha want?)\nWhen you're so funny with the money that you flaunt\nI said where'd you get your information from?\nYou think that you can front when revelation comes?\nI said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha

than a cherry pie with ready whip topping\nGoin' from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall\nWell, I'll be calling out you people like a casting call\nOh well, it's wacked when you're jacked in the back of a ride\nWith your know, with your flow when you're out gettin' by\nBelieve me, what you see is what you get\nAnd you see me, comin' off as you can bet\nWell, I think I'm losin' my mind this

amount\nSee I'm the long leaner victor the cleaner\nI'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena\nWell, I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce\nYou've got the rhyme and reason but no

got the big brown boots\nWhen you wanna get kicked like a rhyme\nFrom the heart and the mind\nThere was a time when the blunt got lit\nI take a hit of the weed and then blew a smoke screen\nNo Visine, just a little Afro-Sheen\nAnd a High Times magazine\nI like to smoke y'all but the pigs come sweating\nThey like the smell of the weed that I'm smoking\nThey can't have none of the number one

weekend in a rock and roll band\nOne Friday night, in my hometown bar\nIn walked a girl who looked like a movie star\nShe stared at me and it was turning me on\nShe said she worked in a beauty salon\nI heard a voice inside me say\nShe ain't pretty, she just looks that way\n\nWe made a date to go for a drink\nI wore my jeans and she wore a mink\nThere was this misconception all over town\nThat she ate lonely guy heart by the pound\nShe said, \"Take me home, there won't be no fuss\"\nI said, \"Sure, you got some change for the bus?\"\nWatching her leave, I heard the bartender say\nShe ain't pretty she just looks that way\nSo, uh, I called her up, her father was home\nSaid, \"She's busy, she can't come to the phone\"\nI held my breath and decided to wait\nA guy like me doesn't get many dates\nI fell in love with a model from hell\nIt took some time for my hormones to tell\nThat chasing her has been a grave mistake\nShe ain't pretty she just looks that way\n\nHer ego wrote cheques incredibly fast\nBut her personality didn't have the cash\nI laughed out loud to my total dismay\nShe ain't pretty she just looks that way\n\nShe ain't pretty she just looks that

child?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd in remembering a road sign\nI am remembering a girl when I was young\nAnd we said these songs are true, these days are ours\nThese tears are free and hey\nThe cross is in the ballpark\nThe cross is in the ballpark\n[Chorus]\nWe had a lot of fun, had a lot of money\nWe had a little son and we thought we'd call him Sonny\nSonny gets married and moves away\nSonny has a baby and bills to pay\nSonny gets sunnier day by day by day by day\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, I've been waking up at sunrise\nI've been following the light across my room\nI watch the night receive the room of my day\nSome people say the sky is just the sky\nBut I say why deny the obvious child?\nWhy deny the obvious child?\n\n[Bridge]\nSonny sits by his window and thinks to himself\nHow it's strange that some rooms are like cages\nSonny's yearbook from high school is down from the shelf\nAnd he idly thumbs through the pages\nSome have died, some have fled from themselves\nOr struggled from here to get there\nSonny wanders beyond his interior walls\nRuns his hand through his thinning brown hair\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell I'm accustomed to a smoother ride\nOr maybe I'm a dog that's lost his bite\nI don't

me for thinking, but there's something under my hair\nI bet you thought the lights were on but no one's living there\nYou think that if you tell enough lies they will see the truth?\nI hope they bury your old ideas the same time they bury you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor\nMaking love and music's the only things worth fighting for\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are the new power generation, we want to change the world\nThe only thing that's in our way is you\nYour old fashioned music, your old ideas\nWe're sick and tired of you telling us what to do\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nWe are the new\nWe are the new, we are the new\nMaking love and music\nNew power, we stand\n\n[Verse 3]\nPardon us for caring, we didn't know it was against the rules (shout it out)\nIf we only want to love one another\nThen tell me now who's the fool (tell me, tell me)\nNo father, no mother, no sister, no brother, nobody can make me stop\nSaid if you didn't come to party child, I think you better get up of my block\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor\nMaking love and music's the only things worth fighting for\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are the new power generation, we want to change the world\nThe only thing that's in our way is you\nYour old fashioned music, your old ideas\nWe're sick and tired of you telling us what to do\nWe are the new power generation, we want to change the world\nGo on and get up off my block\nThe only thing that's in our way is you\nGet up off my block, because\nYour old fashioned music, your old ideas\nLove is there if you'd just open up to it\nWe're sick and tired of you telling us what to do\nIf you'd just believe your whole world would change\n[Outro]\nNew power generation, you've got to rearrange\nWe are the new power generation, you've got to give up all the fight\nWe are the new power generation\nWe got to try to love one another, baby\nWe are the new power generation\nWe are the new power

crimes\nI get caught then my mind's defined in my son's rhymes\nCause my thoughts stay runnin like thugs from one-time\nI been through it under the influence\nBustin off I'm runnin into it\nSee me say he didn't do it\nPut the nine to his mind and blew it\nCause some times I lose it give me a gun and I'll abuse it\nPuffin with my family, my bitch, my money or my music\nMakin killas say he's too sick when he do shit\nBut I'm on some new shit, and it's too late the fuse lit\nI treat my nine like a new bitch\nAnd the shit do kick, word\n[Hook: Lord Tariq]\nI'm on the Cross Bronx with Fat Joe and my

record for when I perform\nLonely nights inside a university dorm\nI put pen to paper with a paper and pen\nFor the times I'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men\nI get raw like Eddie, rough like Freddy\nKrueger with a Luger turnin' men into spaghetti\nI'm like Fats Domino, off of Blueberry Hill\nBecause my rhymes are funky fresh and not run of the mill\nJust like a king has palaces I give an analysis\nYou can't talk because you suffer from paralysis\nOf the mouth, of the lip, of the tongue\nComin' to you compliments of a brother named Young\nNow you can't talk because I'm leaving you speechless\nSo be quiet and let an educator teach this\nIt's due to my producer, so he's in a rage\nAnd Mike you control the vinyl I'll control the stage\n'Cause I come off\n[Verse 2]\nFour score and seven years ago\nThere were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know\nFour score and seven years later\nI dig holes in those rappers like the moon with a crater\nBecause to battle me you're really taking a risk\n'Cause you're an eight track tape and I'm a compact disc\nLike Tyson drops boxers in rapid succession\nThat's how I'm droppin' MCs in the rappin' profession\nI'm comin' off, just like the clothes on a hooker\nAnd I can fly like Jimmy Superfly Snuka\nLike a shuttle goes up into outer space\nPeople's hands go up when I enter the place\nI don't mean to brag or boast or to tell ya I'm great\nBut I can rock the microphone like Dorothy Hamill can skate\nYeah, I can say a funky rhyme like Greg Louganis can dive\nDon't have to be Saturday night for Young MC to get live\n'Cause I come off\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYo I come off, My name is Young MC and baby I come off\nYo the brother's comin' off, Bust this, Here we go\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow one behold, Young MC struck gold\nFrom the rhymes that I've been sayin' to the young and the old\nFrom the battles I've been havin' with the smart and the dumb\nFrom the records I've been makin' with the mic and the drum\nYou know the other rappers wanna play a game with me\nThey run and hide when they hear the name of Young MC\nLike a kid playing tag, that's how it's got to be\nSo when I start I say Olly Olly Oxen Free\nYo, you can never write a rhyme as strong as this one\nSo pay attention cause you don't wanna miss one, of my healthy rhymes\nNobody's are healthier, New York, New Jersey, LA or Philadelphia\nCity to city, and town to town, place to place\nCountry to country, 'cause I get around\nEven if you were in prison you'da heard me play\n'Cause the warden had me rock and I'm on the PA\nSo when you get out come and see my show\nAnd if you start static back in you go\n'Cause comin' off is the title and the theme of the jam\nAnd when the rhymes are finally finished people say God damn\n'Cause I come off\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n\nI come off. Yo baby, I come off.

1995, films about life in South Central had painted a bleak portrait of the hood that was largely covered in splashes of red. Colors (1988), Boyz N the Hood (1991), and Menace II Society (1993) all centered on themes of bloodshed and tragedy, which became synonymous with life in that part of the city, especially for people across the country who watched the L.A. riots play out on televisions in their living rooms exactly three years earlier.\n\nThe films illuminated real issues in the community, but violence wasn\u2019t the only thing those in South Central wanted to be known for. So, a trio of native Angelenos in their early 20s\u2014rapper-actor Ice Cube, DJ Pooh, and director F. Gary Gray\u2014set out to share a different, more lighthearted, flavor of neighborhood life. It involved a lost job, two friends, a porch, some weed, and an eventful day. Gray, who directed the music video for Cube\u2019s \u201cIt Was a Good Day\u201d in early 1993, had the perfect spot to film it: 126th and Normandie, the block he grew up on.\n\nProblem was, Cube had never acted in a comedy, Gray hadn\u2019t directed a feature-length movie, and they only had 20 days to shoot once New Line Studios signed on. The project was happening\u2014they just weren\u2019t sure what was going to come out on the other side.\n\nOn a modest estimated budget of $3.5 million, Friday made nearly $30 million at the box office and spawned two sequels. The film\u2019s strengths fell on the performances and improvisations of its mixed cast of new and veteran comedians, such as Bernie Mac, John Witherspoon, Anna Maria Horsford, Reynaldo Rey, Angela Means, Faizon Love, A.J. Johnson, and in particular, Chris Tucker, who co-starred as the bigmouth stoner Smokey and went on to star in three Rush Hour movies with Jackie Chan (but none of the Friday sequels). The film also helped propel the careers of a young Meagan Good and Michael Clarke Duncan.\n\nTwenty years after its release, Friday\u2019s impact is apparent every time the Internet generation tweets \u201cBye, Felicia\u201d\u2014a misspelling of Angela Means\u2019 character, Felisha\u2014or someone shouts a Smokey quote in a WorldStar video. These one-liners keep its popularity high, but it\u2019s the film\u2019s story about family and community, with characters who mirror people in our own lives, that has kept Friday burning on screens throughout the hood and beyond. Friday represents a coming-of-age moment for films that use life in South Central as their backdrop, and its attention to detail\u2014the slamming of metal screen doors, the sizzle of eggs in the morning, broken-down cars with alarms\u2014made it an authentic glimpse into family life, not just in South Central, but in neighborhoods around the country, during the \u201990s.\n\nThis is the oral history of Friday, a film about $200, shot in 20 days, that is still smoking 20 years later.Chapter 1: The ScriptDJ Pooh: It was in \u201994, I believe, when we started writing the Friday script. Cube and I were sitting in the Street Knowledge basement [Cube\u2019s old record production company] working on some tracks and we started talking about a movie.\nIce Cube: In the hood, they was doing movies like Boyz N the Hood, which I did, Menace II Society, South Central, and even Colors, going back that far. Everybody was looking at our neighborhood like it was hell on Earth, like the worst place you can grow up in America. And I\u2019m like, Why? I didn\u2019t see it all that way. I mean, I knew it was crazy around where I grew up but we had fun in the hood. We used to trip off the neighborhood. I was a fan of Cheech and Chong movies, of In Living Color, Robert Townsend\u2019s Hollywood Shuffle; we watched them all the time and laughed at them. DJ Pooh is not only a superproducer but also a fool and crazy as hell. We in the studio laughing all day, smoking weed, and we were just like, \u201cYo, we need to create something to show how the hood really is, from our vantage point.\u201d That\u2019s how it started.\n\nDJ Pooh: We came up with a rough idea of a movie that would take place in a day, a regular Friday in the hood. We started building around that. Me and Cube grew up around the same neighborhood, so we knew a lot of the same people. We started thinking about people we knew, what was going on, stuff that happened in our lives growing up, and just laughing and clowning about a bunch of different scenarios. Every hood has a Deebo or a Felisha.\n\nIce Cube: The script took a couple months to get together. Friday was the third script I wrote. I wrote one before called America Eats Its Young. After that I wrote a script called Fo\u2019 Life, a hardcore script about the hood and going to jail and shit like that. [Boyz N the Hood director] John Singleton had encouraged me to start writing scripts because I wrote vivid records. He was like, \u201cIf you can write a vivid record that can make me see it in my mind, you can write a script.\u201d The first two scripts I wrote were underdeveloped. Being self-taught, sometimes it takes a couple of tries to figure out what you need to do. By the time I wrote Friday, I was coming around, getting the whole structure of a script together. We had three acts and just had to have structure. I was on tour in Europe and [Pooh] was in L.A. and we would get on the phone and talk out stuff. I would be telling Pooh what I wrote and we\u2019d throw in the stuff he thought of that we could add and we would just go back and forth until we had a final script, a whole day of craziness.\n\nDJ Pooh: Cube is one of the hardest working guys I know. He\u2019d be on the road performing one night and then be up before me the next morning on the phone.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I was involved before Cube even started the script. I met Cube through WC while shooting a music video for \u201cDress Code.\u201d We all went to Washington High School. Cube didn\u2019t live too far away from me. Back in the day, he lived off Western near Imperial. Cube and I did a few videos after that: \u201cTrue to the Game,\u201d \u201cReally Doe,\u201d and \u201cIt Was a Good Day.\u201d I told him over the course of doing his music videos that I was doing a short film I wanted to finish and I needed a little support. He donated some money to help me out. A couple months later, he said, \u201cListen, I know you\u2019re doing your short film, but I have this idea about the neighborhood. Why don\u2019t you do a feature film?\u201d At the time, Matty Rich had shot this film Straight Out of Brooklyn on credit cards. Cube was like, \u201cWe should do our own film for $75,000, shoot it black and white, and it\u2019ll just be about guys from our neighborhood.\u201d I said, \u201cGreat idea, let\u2019s go.\u201d Cube went on tour and he started sending me pages from Europe and I\u2019d send him my thoughts.\n\nIce Cube: Everything in Friday happened on my block at one point or another. We had a little kid named Chris who would knock over the trashcans with his bike and we wanted to whoop his ass. We wanted to catch him on that bike, we never could. In the movie we finally caught him. That\u2019s why we put that in there.\n\nF. Gary Gray: He\u2019d describe some of these moments along the way, and I envisioned it in my neighborhood. What you see in Friday is a reflection of how I grew up, the house I grew up in, the neighbors that I had. I just delivered what I experienced. When I got the green light for the movie I took a camera and I shot the whole movie on video. My friend Andy played the role of Smokey for me as a stand-in. I went through the entire script and shot it with him and another friend. I wanted to see what the movie felt like and try to find creative ways to make it. A lot of times when you shoot a movie, hindsight is 20/20, and after you watch it you\u2019re like, \u201cDamn, I wish I did this, I wish I did that.\u201d Shooting it on video camera lets you watch it, even if it was real crude. It\u2019s like visuals or storyboards.\n\nDJ Pooh: I got some of that stuff up on my Instagram.\n\nF. Gary Gray: Friday fell apart because Cube was gonna do a sports movie called Defense, which I think he wrote. I wouldn\u2019t say I was devastated, but I was really looking forward to doing it. I went off to go do another project called Rollin 80s and he went out to go do Defense. Then both of those movies fell apart and we came back together for Friday. I was maybe 23 when production of Friday started. Knowing Cube and how determined he is, Friday probably would have been made at some point either way. But I\u2019m glad Defense fell apart. And the same with Rollin 80s. That would have been my first major movie, and it would have sent me on a different trajectory. Who knows\u2026.Chapter 2: The StudioIce Cube: We knew nobody in Hollywood would understand the comedy in Friday. Hollywood wasn\u2019t ready for it. When we wrote it, we intended to raise the money ourselves and do the movie\u2014it was always greenlit in our eyes. It was just about writing it and raising the money, keeping the budget low. Our manager, Pat Charbonnet, helped us flesh the script out and keep costs low.\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: You\u2019ll be surprised, as the idea was coming together and scripts were being written, by how many people weren\u2019t interested and turned it down. There was little to no interest, and fortunately for us, we opened up a pre-production office and brokered some money into the initial startup to get it going. There was a determination on all parts that, no matter who said yay or nay, the project had to be done\u2014it was a good, funny vehicle. It was right off of the heels of Robert Rodriguez doing El Mariachi, which was a super-low-budget independent film that took off so well. On the strength of the talent that Ice Cube possessed, I believed that certainly something like this could happen if we dedicated ourselves to moving mountains, even if we had not made a film before. There was a naive belief that if Rodriguez could do it, then for sure we could do it, too. If Cheech and Chong could make Up in Smoke, and the movies like that preceding it, certainly we could be part of a new paradigm. The script had many, many, many incarnations before it got to the point where a deal was struck with New Line Cinema.\n\nIce Cube: We thought it was a good bet because New Line was already in the business of doing these kind of movies. They had done House Party. They understood the black movie market. I wanted Gary to direct because he was a talented director from the hood. You didn\u2019t have to teach him these little nuances that were in the movie, like Big Worm\u2019s rollers and shit. He knew all the hood flavor that needed to be in the movie.Chapter 3: The CastF. Gary Gray: It being a comedy scared the shit out of me. Ice Cube was the nigga you loved to hate. He was like the toughest man in America, and when you take someone you\u2019re used to delivering on hard-hitting social issues in hardcore gangster rap, and who has a hardcore point of view on politics, you would never think comedy. I was excited to do my first film. I wasn\u2019t sure how it would turn out and how people would receive Cube. This is the beginning and possibly the end of my career all in one moment.\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: Cube has an incredible sense of humor. It\u2019s the intelligent dry wit of one-liners that can just nuke you. At the time, if you didn\u2019t know him, you didn\u2019t know about him and his one-liners, and, apart from the intensity of his lyrics, I don\u2019t think people knew that he just had so many extraordinary abilities.\n\nRegina King: I got to know Cube in between scenes on the set of Boyz N the Hood. Regardless of how you saw him in Boyz N the Hood, outside of that serious role, he laughed and cracked and bagged and did all those things that everyone else was doing their early 20s. He definitely has a comedic side\u2014I mean, he wrote the lyrics for \u201cGangsta\u2019s Fairytale,\u201d and that song is comedic, if you will. He definitely has his timing right. It felt natural to be there with him.\nAngela Means: I had appeared on Def Comedy Jam three times, got a standing ovation at the Apollo, had just done House Party 3, did Bernie Mac\u2019s pilot, Pearl\u2019s Place to Play, and I was with SOBG, the premiere black management company in the city. I was headlining, I was a host on the black comedy circuit. I knew I could steal the Felisha part because I knew Cube wanted stand-ups. I went in, read for it, and felt really good about it. I knew all of the actors from the comedy community. A week or so after the audition I called my agents and they said, \u201cWe passed on that. It\u2019s not for you, Angela. You\u2019re the \u2018pretty girl!\u2019\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m about to be the pretty girl that\u2019s a hood rat, and then I\u2019m going to go have a baby! And I\u2019m a wrap!\u201d I was pregnant at the time.\n\nDJ Pooh: Originally I was playing Smokey. A lot of the character was based on stuff that went on in my life. I sold weed when I was young and was unsuccessful because I was also a connoisseur. I\u2019d be like, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna smoke this sack right here, but if I break this sack down I can get the money back.\u201d It was a horrible idea.\n\nIce Cube: New Line felt I had screen experience but Pooh didn\u2019t have as much, so they didn\u2019t want him to play Smokey. Pooh was like, \u201cMan, how we going to let New Line come in and tell us how to put this movie together?\u201d A million dollars is the reason why, shit! [Laughs.] They ain\u2019t fuck with us on nothing but the cast, so we had to play ball to a certain degree. We had to find another co-star.\n\nDJ Pooh: One day we were sitting around watching Def Comedy Jam and we saw Chris [Tucker] perform and me and Cube couldn\u2019t stop laughing. We thought, \u201cThis dude would be able to play the hell out of Smokey. Let\u2019s see if we can get him to come in and read for him.\u201d And that\u2019s what happened and it was over like that.\n\nKim Hardin: Smokey was the most challenging role to cast, because someone had to have the energy to bounce off the calm demeanor that Cube has. Cube was laid-back with his comedy. I probably auditioned everybody who was on the [black comedy] circuit at the time for the role of Smokey. None of them were hitting what I knew Cube and Gary Gray were looking for. I had just hired Chris Tucker to do one scene opposite Eddie Griffin in The Walking Dead, so I brought Chris in and the first time he auditioned for me, he was horrible. It was a combination of things: He had just come off the road from doing a couple of stand-up gigs, hadn\u2019t read the script, and at the time he didn\u2019t know that comedians can improv, put their own thing on whatever the dialogue is. I knew Chris could do better. When a person isn\u2019t prepared, they can\u2019t do their best job. I allowed him to prepare and come back. Any other casting director may have been like, \u201cYou were horrible. Next!\u201d\n\nFaizon Love: Chris was frustrated. He had lost some roles to D.L. Hughley and some other comedians. He was like, \u201cFuck this shit.\u201d He half-heartedly went through the audition and didn\u2019t do good the first time. He didn\u2019t give a fuck. He was like, \u201cMan! Ain\u2019t nobody going to go see an Ice Cube movie!\u201d His exact words. I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you crazy, motherfucker?!\u201d\n\nAngela Means: Chris Tucker and I were comics in Atlanta together, coming up at the same time, and I always looked at him as my little brother, like a responsibility. I heard through the grapevine that they basically wrote the [Smokey] part for him. He goes in for his audition and they tell him to come back, to go study, get a coach, whatever. He called me from a payphone and was like, \u201cAng, I need your coach. They said to go away, that I wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d I was like, \u201cNigga, that\u2019s your part! You don\u2019t need no coach, they want you! What happened?\u201d He goes, \u201cI don\u2019t know, man!\u201d I was like, \u201cJust get over here, and bring all of your material!\u201d Me, Faizon, and A.J. had our jobs\u2014it was just Chris left. We were all a clique and Chris didn\u2019t have his part, so I told Faizon that Chris needed our help. I put a big pot of spaghetti on the stove and Chris and Faizon came over. We kept saying, \u201cSay the line! What do you think when you say that line?! When you hear the line, what does the line mean?! Now say something else! Say it, nigga, just say that shit! Say another line!\u201d\n\nFaizon Love: That\u2019s when we got the whole twitching shit. I said, \u201cYou should still be twitching from all that [sherm]. \u2019Cause you so fucked up from that shit.\u201d\n\nAngela Means: By the time that spaghetti was gone, Chris was Smokey.\n\nFaizon Love: He got that shit, then he went back in and nailed it.\n\nIce Cube: I wanted Chris. He had that funny stand-up on Def Comedy Jam and New Line had just put him in House Party 3 but he was underused in that movie. New Line suggested other actors, people off of In Living Color but I was like, \u201cNah, we need a new fresh face.\u201d\n\nF. Gary Gray: If you look at Pooh play Smokey in the tapes, he was hella funny. I just felt like Chris was a perfect fit with Cube. I go for authenticity. There have been times in my career where I hired real killers and thugs, and the moment you roll the camera it\u2019s like a deer in headlights. They can\u2019t even be themselves. Chris\u2019 brilliance is that he shines when the lights are on. We saw Tommy Davidson, who was hella funny too, and there was talk about Chris Rock playing Smokey because he had kind of a bigger name, but Chris Rock is very New York. Although Chris [Tucker] is from Georgia, he had kind of an L.A. vibe, so we just rolled the dice and scored. His instincts are amazing, and as much as I could want to take credit for Friday, I wouldn\u2019t. Friday is Friday because of Chris Tucker.\n\nIce Cube: Even Pooh will tell you that Chris blew that shit out the water. Ultimately it was the best move.\nDJ Pooh: Red was such a smaller role than Smokey. Cube said to me, \u201cIt\u2019s a small role, but it\u2019s as small or as big as you make it.\u201d At first, I was like, \u201cAh, this nigga. Cut that big-and-small shit out,\u201d \u2019cause I got a small role. But it was dope, it was perfect. He was right. And every actor that we went out to get, we basically got. We were working with some veterans, some legends, and we also had the opportunity to work with some new talent because New Line didn\u2019t make us go get the biggest black actor to get the film off the ground.\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: I was doing Amen at the time. I auditioned and one of the producers, Andre Robinson, said, \u201cI was shocked when you said you would come in!\u201d I asked why and he said, \u201cBecause you\u2019re on a hit show.\u201d Well, this seemed like fun. I heard afterward that I wasn\u2019t their first choice before I auditioned. They had somebody else in mind and she couldn\u2019t make it. So, by default, I got it. I know, I know. But to be honest, I didn\u2019t know Ice Cube\u2019s songs when I went in.\n\nTiny Lister: I auditioned for the [Deebo] role after I became Zeus in the WWF. I was already bigger than life as Zeus, wrestling Hulk Hogan in the movie No Holds Barred. I used to get real death threats from the white world. They saw this big black guy from Compton and Vince McMahon promoted that I was a killer and a gangster. He needed to sell pay-per-views, so since I\u2019m from Compton, he took the negative things about Compton and used them to scare the white WWF public. Zeus was larger than life. I was the biggest black character actor in Hollywood but I had to prove it to Pat Charbonnet, who was producing the movie with Ice Cube. Me and Nia Long went in together. Pat didn\u2019t know how big I was at the time. It took Gary Gray to make sure I got the role, because he knew the influence I already had. He knew how powerful and famous I was.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I fought for [Tiny] because his audition was off. Some of the stuff the producers were concerned about was stuff I was concerned about. There were some people that were nervous about what he would deliver. I wasn\u2019t sure how Tiny\u2019s performance was gonna come off. It\u2019s those times when we didn\u2019t understand what he was saying. He would say \u201cargooing\u201d [arguing] or \u201cwhoostle\u201d [whistle], and I was like, will the audience understand what the fuck just came out of his mouth? It was funny to us but I was trying to communicate a moment or a scene in the sequence and if you didn\u2019t understand what he was saying, you could lose an entire plot point. I was nervous about that, but Tiny is from Compton, big as hell, and he understands the culture. For us, it was just about what\u2019s funny, what\u2019s authentic.\n\nFaizon Love: Back then, I hated auditioning. I would only do it if I was in character and they called me by the character\u2019s name. When I came in the door, I was Big Worm, smoking a joint and talking shit. [Casting director] Kim Hardin was there, she was a pretty lady. Her feet were fucking gorgeous, I just wanted to fuck her feet. I was talking about how gorgeous her feet were. I walked out of there and they were like, \u201cYeah, you got it.\u201d\n\nKim Hardin: There was a whole thing with Mrs. Parker, who lives across the street and waters her lawn. I watched The Price Is Right and thought Kathleen [Bradley] was a beautiful woman, so I brought her in.\n\nKathleen Bradley: I was on The Price Is Right, as one of \u201cBarker\u2019s Beauties.\u201d I was actually the first black Barker Beauty.\n\nKim Hardin: I was so glad [Cube and Gary] liked her. She was perfect. Because they were going to be like \u201cDaaaamn!\u201d when she\u2019s bending over, she had to do that in the audition. She came in for Gary and he really wanted her to accentuate, just bend down low. I was like, really?!\n\nF. Gary Gray: I know we picked the right person. I\u2019m sure to this day Kathleen can\u2019t go anywhere without someone saying, \u201cHeyyy, Ms. Parker,\u201d which I\u2019m sure is a gift and a curse.\n\nKim Hardin: Then the midget! We hired [Tony Cox] from I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka because he played one of the midgets under the big hats. I brought him in for the audition, he did good. I brought in several midgets, but he\u2019s the one that stood out, because he had more experience.\n\nA.J. Johnson: Tommy Davidson was supposed to be Ezal but didn\u2019t end up doing it. Cube called me up and said he and DJ Pooh had a part for me in this movie. He asked if I wanted to play a crackhead. I said, \u201cYeah, no problem!\u201d [Laughs.] When I first seen the script, I didn\u2019t think the movie was going to do well. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWho\u2019s going to come see a movie about two dudes sitting on a porch smoking weed?\u201d I was trying to make the best of that from the jump.\n\nKim Hardin: Meagan Good came to my office to drop off her picture and resum\u00e9. She was scared and shy and said, \u201cHi, ma\u2019am, I just wanted to drop off my picture and I hope you bring me in for an audition.\u201d She read for me and I brought her back to read for Gary. He liked to give his notes to the casting director to redirect to the actor. His note to me was: \u201cTell her to do it again, but this time say a curse word.\u201d Mind you, she\u2019s like 13 at the time, so I told Gary that it wasn\u2019t cool to make her do that. We still gave her the part. That was her first speaking role in a film. In one of my classes, Meagan later said she was thankful that I protected her from having to curse at her age for her first movie. I felt like tearing up and shit.\n\nFaizon Love: Back then, there weren\u2019t a lot of projects for black actors. We was just paying our rent, to tell you the truth. If anybody tells you they was doing this movie because they wanted to work on their fucking acting, they are fuckin\u2019 bullshitting.Chapter 4: The ShootPatricia Charbonnet: The moment Gary walked on that set\u2014even during pre-production and casting\u2014he was a consummate professional at a very young age. With the atmosphere of clowning and fooling around, Gary was a serious anchor, like an old soul who knew that, in spite of all this camaraderie, there was a film that had to be delivered at the end of the day, and his neck was on the line. We absolutely, unequivocally believed in him and his ability to pull it off, which is why we chose him as director. You have just so much energy crackling, and at age 24 Gary had an astounding ability to steer that ship to shore.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I was totally nervous, I had 20 days to shoot a movie. I\u2019m glad I was naive back then. I didn\u2019t know 20 days wasn\u2019t enough time to shoot a movie. I just did what came natural because I didn\u2019t go to film school and I didn\u2019t have experience making feature films.\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: How are we going to get it done and delivered to New Line in 20 days, not really having any money? This was an extremely low-budget film at the time. A lot of money was spent on food trucks, food stations. The thought was, just have so much food around, make it good, and when people are feeling like, \u201cWhy am I still doing this?\u201d they\u2019ll have something good to eat and they\u2019ll still want to be there.\n\nF. Gary Gray: When you don\u2019t have a lot of money to pay people, you better feed them right. We fed them right.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: With Friday, I didn\u2019t make $5,000. There was no money made on that. It was all fun and getting to know each other. We were deep in the hood, too. I don\u2019t smoke weed or anything like that, so I didn\u2019t hang around to get any weed, but they would smoke weed.\n\nShawn Barton: I didn\u2019t want to make anyone look like a caricature or a clich\u00e9. They\u2019re all based on real people. Pretty much all of the clothes came from the Slauson Swap Meet. They knew me, like, \u201cYou\u2019re getting clothes for Friday, right? Tell Cube I rap.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do that after I get these flannels.\u201d\n\nFaizon Love: I knew exactly the look I wanted for Big Worm. Back in the day, dudes used to go get perms. Prince had the same perm. Billy Dee had a perm in Star Wars. Lionel Richie had a perm. Then I wore mine, like I was going to have one of the great perms. Somebody gotta bring it back.\n\nF. Gary Gray: The Orange Crush lowrider that Big Worm drives was famous in the hood. It was like a rolling billboard for Los Angeles. Our transportation person tracked it down because we thought it was a car that a guy who sells weed and rolls with rollers in his hair would drive. Something with so much personality captured who Big Worm was immediately. You know who that guy is if he\u2019s driving that car. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a dope car, but it definitely says, \u201cI\u2019m a specific type of person. Don\u2019t fuck with me.\u201d It worked perfectly for his character.\n\nFaizon Love: I\u2019m the one who brought the lowrider around and dudes were like, \u201cAw, man, that\u2019s the kind of car you using?\u201d And the neighbors were like, \u201cLet me show you mine!\u201d The orange lowrider belonged to this guy named Blaze. He was from the neighborhood. He later sold that car to Japan. Then Blaze got murdered.\n\nShawn Barton: For Smokey\u2019s character, Chris had on a blue T-shirt, blue hat, and blue Chuck Taylors. We shot in South Central, and being born and bred a South Central girl, I was sensitive to neighborhoods. I didn\u2019t put him in that suit to make it that he was a gang member or anything like that. I chose a lot of these darker colors because when you\u2019re dealing with lighter colors, like white and tans, it\u2019s a little harder for continuity to match, like when there\u2019s a sweat stain. I chose darker colors so it wouldn\u2019t be an issue for me. I probably would have had him in all-black, but the blue came in because of lighting and night shooting and Chris\u2019 darker skin tone.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I spotted Smokey\u2019s convertible Ford Pinto when I was driving down the street. I told my transportation guy to find this broken-down car off of Western Avenue, find who owns it, and put it on a flatbed, or tow it to the block. I saw that shit and I was like, that\u2019s an instant joke. That should be Smokey\u2019s car. I loved it because it was a convertible Pinto\u2014probably the only one that existed on planet Earth. That car never drove right. All the guys pushed it during the scenes it was in. The engine sputtering? All sound effects. We had to put license plates on it; it wasn\u2019t even registered. That shit should be in a museum right now. The alarm thing wasn\u2019t in the script. I did that in post-production. Chris just waved and I put an alarm sound effect on that. I did the same thing to Red\u2019s car. I thought it would be funny if those piece of shit cars had alarms on them. The \u201cchirp chirp\u201d was an extra joke.\n\nShawn Barton: I took inspiration for the look of Felisha from around the \u201980s, when we moved from South Central. One of the reasons why my mom moved away from there was when crack started taking over. We saw some of our neighbors get into that world. In that day, they were called \u201cstrawberries,\u201d and a strawberry was a girl who would prostitute or do things for drugs. Their clothes would look like they were wearing someone else\u2019s clothes and they would look a mess. I liked styling [Angela Means as Felisha] because she was a challenge as far as making her look bad; I had to turn this gorgeous girl into someone that was not so hot. But Gary would still say she looked too pretty. I was like, how do I this? Men\u2019s clothing that was the only way.\n\nF. Gary Gray: We shot it in South Central, so there was gonna be a lot of gang activity, but there was really only one neighbor who was an asshole, the kind who would scream during some of the takes. For the most part everybody was respectful.\n\nAngela Means: We were rolling with Cube, who was hip-hop royalty. We were with hood royalty in the hood in the mid \u201990s. It was lovely. Everyone was cool except for one dude who would get drunk, even during the day, and shout, \u201cFuck y\u2019all! Fuck you, motherfucker! I\u2019m a star! This is my neighborhood! This is my house! Fuck you! All you motherfuckers don\u2019t mean shit! Don\u2019t give a fuck about no Ice-T!\u201d\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: \u201cThis ain\u2019t no real movie! If it were, you wouldn\u2019t be shooting here!\u201d He would carry on, and then I guess they gave him an extra $25 and he would go back inside and shut up. His poor wife was so embarrassed.\n\nIce Cube: It\u2019s fun for the first few days, until the neighborhood gets mad at you. They can\u2019t walk up the street \u2019cause you got the shit blocked off, Mom can\u2019t pick up the groceries, all that stuff.\n\nTiny Lister: When I played the Deebo character I\u2019d become the character, so when they say cut, I didn\u2019t ever cut. Even in South Central, the streets loved me because I\u2019m from Compton. I would ride the bicycle and chase the fans around\u2014it would be like 500 fans around the set every day. It might be up to a thousand sometimes. The audience loved us so much. They played like I was the baddest guy in the world. [Laughs.] They know I\u2019m not a gangbanger, they know I like milk and cookies. They knew we loved them and they gave us love back. It was beautiful, but at the same time you keep your eyes open. There were fans around us who were just as bad as Deebo for real!\n\nJohn Witherspoon: We had the Crips gang on the outskirts there. They were kids and they were nice and we all took pictures with them.\n\nA.J. Johnson: The Crips were all cool. We were out all night, and they were out all night with us. The whole neighborhood was out. Gary Gray told them to be quiet when we finna shoot, and they\u2019d be quiet. Wasn\u2019t nobody making no noise. They see something funny and when they say cut, they all started laughing.\n\nF. Gary Gray: We had a couple of drive-bys around the corner but not on our set. When you\u2019re shooting in South L.A. and Compton, you gotta deal with what you gotta deal with.\n\nDJ Pooh: We were shooting on the block, and we needed some kids to go to Big Worm\u2019s ice cream truck. And when I see Meagan Good walking down I asked, \u201cHey, little girl, you wanna be at the ice cream truck in the movie? Get your mom to sign the papers and come down here.\u201d Next thing you know, she\u2019s an actress.\n\nFaizon Love: Chris was like my little brother. We drove to set together. We had a little raggedy Jetta that we shared. We would smoke weed on the way.\n\nNia Long (via AV Club): I bought myself a BMW. It was so cute. I was shooting Friday at the time, and Chris Tucker and I saw each other on the freeway, on the way to the set. I was going [Waves, imitates honking.] \u201cToot, toot!\u201d in my car. He had a busted window with a pizza box over it because he couldn\u2019t afford to fix the window! We get to work and he goes, \u201cWhen I grow up, I want to be just like you.\u201d\n\nDJ Pooh: It never felt like work, we were just having a good time. Chris and I shared a trailer. We\u2019d get there in the morning, light one up, and start the day. It was like part of the movie.\n\nIce Cube: We improvised probably 65 percent. It was that kind of movie.\n\nFaizon Love: I didn\u2019t use anything that was in the script, but they liked it. Me and Chris flipped our shit. I got that line \u201cPlaying with my money is like playing with my emotions,\u201d from a Peabo Bryson song, \u201cFeel the Fire.\u201d All of us just made our characters our own. You have to.\n\nPaula Jai Parker: I\u2019d lived in Washington D.C. when I was going to college and I had seen girls that reminded me of Joi. The blonde dookie braids became popular and, Lord, those nails. I did the nails, I created those and put those on. I don\u2019t know where I got that from. I was just young and inspired.\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: Probably the person who worked the hardest was the script supervisor when it came to lines. John Witherspoon always said his lines one way, then the next day he said them another way, then the next day he said it a different way. It wasn\u2019t always the same, it was free-flowing and fluid. Actors like Chris Tucker were allowed to display their own comedic skills. That\u2019s why the freedom that existed on the set shows up so easy on the film, and it makes people feel like they could be there.\n\nF. Gary Gray: A one-page scene could stretch to two pages after all the ad-libbing. Then you end up having a four-hour movie. I would tell them, \u201cHey, I want you to improvise, but I want you to be at least conscious of time.\u201d\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: Chris Tucker was like an electrical storm, every single day. He was also a difficult person for the script supervisor. When he went into improv, he was unstoppable, so the pressure was on and stuff had to be rewritten all of the time since there was so much electricity flowing on set. When he would break out into an improvisational piece, or even John Witherspoon, Gary just managed all of those competing energies so well.\n\nAngela Means: Chris wasn\u2019t originally in the \u201cYou got knocked the fuck out!\u201d scene. That shows you how on fire Chris was. He just ran in and said, \u201cYou got knocked the fuck out!\u201d Every single take that Chris Tucker did you had to hold your laugh, even if it was just a pickup line.\n\nChris Tucker (via 1994 Interview): You know in the neighborhood when you get in a fight, get beat up, there\u2019s always somebody that comes over. They don\u2019t ask you if you need help. They be like, \u201cMan, God, you got your butt kicked. Man, he knocked you out!\u201d Like you don\u2019t know what happened. You was right there, you were the one that got knocked out, he\u2019s telling you how you got knocked out. So I was just trying to bring that to the screen, man, let people see that this is what goes down in the neighborhood everyday. The good side of South Central, not what they see on the news.\n\nDJ Pooh: They had a trampoline out there and some big heavy cushion bags that stunt guys normally fall on. So they do the [Deebo] punch and I jump back off the thing in the air and land on the bag. I was stoked, like, \u201cI can do my own stunts! I got this!\u201d Then I jumped, missed the corner of that bag, and landed on my tailbone and my elbow. We did that scene about seven, eight times.\n\nIce Cube: Bernie was always the realest. He always had the best advice. He didn\u2019t talk a lot but when he did it was always potent. He\u2019d say stuff like \u201cYou hesitating a lot,\u201d as we\u2019re sitting there trying to figure out what we\u2019re going to shoot next. Bernie was an underused talent. I was so happy when he was down to do it and then he came and got busy.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: Bernie Mac was hilarious, boy. The reverend, he was funny. And the lady across the street with the big breasts.\n\nTony Cox: Running across that street wore me out. Gary was like, \u201cMan, I want that energy! I want energy!\u201d Man, my little stump legs were wearing out. I was so glad when that scene was over with. My legs were shaking. I\u2019ve never been through anything like that. That\u2019s the most I\u2019ve ever run in my life. That\u2019s like a whole year of walking for me. I kissed the ground when it was over.\n\nFaizon Love: We were all in honeywagons, which is unheard of now. They\u2019re these little dressing rooms that they normally put actors who are just beginning in. Pooh, me, Chris, Nia, and Angela Means were all on the steps of our honeywagon sharing a joint one day and I was like, \u201cDamn, this would be a dope-ass picture.\u201d\n\nA.J. Johnson: Michael Clarke Duncan was an extra shooting dice. Nobody knew him! Everybody on that set was brand new! Wasn\u2019t nobody really big but Ice Cube.\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: Cube\u2019s mother came on the set and said he always wanted to be in the business since he was a little boy. She was so impressed with me\u2014I was one of black people\u2019s superstars then because Amen was out\u2014but I said, \u201cNo, this is all your son.\u201d She looked at him and said, \u201cDo you know who this is?\u201d and he said, \u201cYeah, ma.\u201d [Laughs.] I was like, \u201cWait a minute, your son did all of this! This is his movie!\u201d\n\nJohn Witherspoon: I had my character in my head. I looked at my uncles, my daddy, and all the rest of the people that I know, them old crazy dudes. In the script, they first had that we had eggs and bacon for breakfast. But I told them you gotta say all the chitlins, all the collard greens, all the pigs feet, all the hog balls.\n\nF. Gary Gray: When Witherspoon came in, you knew he was going to give you something brilliant. Even shooting the bathroom sequence, as crass as it was. We put a chewed Snickers bar in the toilet for effect, so when Cube walked in we showed him this fake turd. I\u2019m not much into the toilet humor but it\u2019s low-hanging fruit with Witherspoon. We just put our foot on the gas pedal.\n\nAngela Means: During the scene where Craig says \u201cBye, Felisha,\u201d Gary was going to break down the set and do a reverse shot of me. I was supposed to walk up to the porch where Chris and Cube were and face the camera when I spoke to them, like everyone else did. I was like, no. If Felisha is going to invade people\u2019s space, then she is going to invade people\u2019s space. She\u2019s oblivious to personal space and boundaries. I told Gary, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just save a whole hour and let Felisha\u2019s ass just sit down in between them?\u201d Neither Cube or Chris knew I was going to sit down, and when I did Chris wasn\u2019t even acting, he was like, \u201cDAMN!\u201d He was pissed at me. [Laughs.] It made the scene better, and broke up the monotony of everyone coming to the porch. Her sitting down was a moment that we found together. Not that it was that big a deal, but it did save like a good hour, and it created that scene, the three sitting on the porch like that.\n\nA.J. Johnson: When Ezal sees Craig and Smokey, I was only supposed to ask for two dollars, but I ad-libbed and made up so much stuff, like jumping on the car and falling in the store. Gary loved it so much he kept it in there. My brother and sister were on crack, so I was just thinking about them and the stuff they did. When you think of them, it\u2019s easier to think of some crackhead stuff.\n\nF. Gary Gray: We had to shoot that store scene fast. We were off the 126th St. campus. Anything off of that block was \u201coff campus,\u201d so we had to deal with the elements. It was an area that was a cross section for a lot of gangs. Cube was a huge star, and with being a huge star in Los Angeles from the streets, comes street politics. To drive down Normandie towards 126th St., past El Segundo and into different neighborhoods, with this camera, car, and lights, we had to have armed security follow us, because we just didn\u2019t know what was gonna happen. We didn\u2019t know what the reaction was going to be. While we had a lot of love in my neighborhood, you just don\u2019t know if that love extended outside of that neighborhood. So when we shot the store scene, we were in another part of town. We had no issues, but it was something we were aware of.\n\nA.J. Johnson: When it came to making something up, if I went somewhere, Chris came right there with me. When I called to him, \u201cYou behind there taking a shit?\u201d he was like, \u201cDon\u2019t tell nobody.\u201d I was like, \u201cMan, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d but of course then I told everybody, \u201cHey, Smokey back there taking a shit!\u201d I wasn\u2019t supposed to do none of that. My father was in the theatre business and he always taught me, when the camera\u2019s on you, make sure you go as big as you can.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I directed my part [at the store]. I\u2019d put a stand-in there, take his place, and when it was done, take a look at the performance and determine how bad it was and then take the lesser of the evils and move on.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: Gary had to deal with all these comics tryna change the lines and saying, \u201cI wanna say this,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t wanna say this.\u201d He was very professional with that. He got everybody comfortable and everybody shot their scenes. They were happy to do them because of Gary and Cube. Everybody wants to be happy with Cube, because Cube is cool.\n\nF. Gary Gray: When you have brilliant people around, you get moments like \u201cBye, Felisha\u201d and \u201cDAAAAMN!\u201d and all that stuff. You can\u2019t write that. That just comes in the moment out of the electricity of all the artists and their collaboration. I love having my guys improv because it\u2019s natural and authentic. But when you\u2019re dealing with a comedian\u2019s instinct to perform on 10 at every moment, sometimes that interferes with what you have in mind and the rhythm and the pacing in telling the story. Sometimes you\u2019d have to convince a performer to tone it down just to preserve the sequence, to not swing for the fence in this moment because it\u2019s going to negatively affect everything around it. When you\u2019re 24 years old, you\u2019re not quite sure how to articulate that. It can come off a certain way and can be misunderstood.\n\nTiny Lister: I thought F. Gary Gray was somebody special. He was the new eager director, but he had his ear to the streets. He knew what was going on in the streets, and knew what they wanted. He was from the street we shot on. He came along at the right time, it was another young black director being born.\n\nAngela Means: I remember Gary wrestling with profanity and asking me to tone it down. Then it turned into Chris\u2019 film and he ran with it. Gary wanted to scale the profanity back, because it had become every other word. He was like, \u201cGuys, we\u2019re better than this.\u201d\n\nF. Gary Gray: A lot of times they said I was serious. I was just focused on the scene we were shooting and making sure I was prepared to answer questions. I was making sure people felt like I knew what I was doing. I was a little self-conscious about that, but like anything else it\u2019s a learning experience. You don\u2019t know what you know until you do it. And I had my moments where I laughed with my team.\n\nFaizon Love: Chris was always fucking around with Gary. At that time, Gary looked like one of the members of New Edition, so we would call him \u201cRonnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mikey, and Gary too.\u201d We would sit in the back of the van just fucking with Gary and he would be like, \u201cTake me seriously! I\u2019m the director!\u201d Like, yeah, right. It was fun because Gary would fire us every day. We were like kids in little league, like Bad News Bears. We were supposed to respect this director, and he was the first one we went after.\n\nAngela Means: When Gary put the \u201cF\u201d in front of his name, we were on the shuttle bus going somewhere and Chris kept saying, \u201cEff Gary Gray! I said, eff Gary Gray!\u201d\n\nF. Gary Gray: That still happens to this day. That\u2019s one of the ways that they would fuck with me, take the initial and fill in the blank. Tucker just naturally targeted everybody. Everybody was picked on, everybody was fair game. It\u2019s what gets you through those long days. People would bag on each other and Tiny was a big target. The name \u201cTiny,\u201d as big as he is, and he can only see out of one eye and he\u2019s loud\u2026. But he\u2019s like a teddy bear. He did the bully thing on the set but it was all funny to us. We would all talk about each other and that was just our way to say, \u201cI got love for you, man.\u201d If I talk about you, I\u2019m fucking with you. If I\u2019m quiet, you probably got something to worry about.\n\nTony Cox: What made it so much fun is that you had all of these comedians. People were going after people. Chris was going after Tiny. I was getting into it with Tiny. Chris was doing the same stuff he would do in the movie, behind Tiny\u2019s head. Tiny was like, \u201cI\u2019ll hurt you!\u201d Chris would say, \u201cHow can you hurt me? If I get on that bad eye side, you can\u2019t see nothing. I\u2019ll wrap you up.\u201d We were all out there shooting night scenes, laughing at 2 and 3 in the morning and they were trying to get us to keep the noise down because people were sleeping. But that shit was funny. Everybody was cracking on everybody. That\u2019s the most fun that I\u2019ve ever had. I couldn\u2019t wait to get to work. I\u2019ve never felt like that.\n\nA.J. Johnson: Bernie Mac was the funniest. When those cameras went off Bernie stayed on. Bernie Mac had everybody laughing on that set. Singing, cracking jokes, running around playing with people. If it was time to eat, he\u2019d make up songs about it\u2019s time to eat. He was incredible. Anything he said came out funny.\n\nFaizon Love: It was pretty much a functioning set, just with us idiots working.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I wish the fight sequence was a little better. There are a couple of things I would improve. There are moments where the fight didn\u2019t feel as real as I wanted it to. I\u2019ve always wanted to do action, so that was my moment to shine, and it felt a little staged. They\u2019re lumbering around with garbage cans and bricks and I didn\u2019t get the coverage I wanted to. Then you have the challenge of Tiny coming from the wrestling world and people associating [the fakeness of] wrestling with the scene. I wanted it to turn up. It felt a little slow. I just didn't have enough time.\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: When Deebo pulled out the knife to go after my character\u2019s son, I told Gary she can\u2019t stand there and watch someone try to kill her child and not jump in. That\u2019s your instinct as a mother. Gary came back 10 minutes later and said, \u201cOK, you go for him but let John [Witherspoon] hold you back.\u201d That\u2019s when John says, \u201cLet him be a man, let him be a man,\u201d and I respond, \u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s a man or not, I\u2019m not going to stand here and watch him hurt him.\u201d I was glad that stayed in the film. It\u2019s in the little moments that you have to be so clear in the people you\u2019re portraying because you have a responsibility to the people who are watching.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: The lesson about not using weapons made it a bit more serious for my character. You put yourself in the same place as the father. You just found a gun on your son. If this neighborhood\u2019s so bad, I\u2019d never have moved here. I told him use fists. You kids are weak, sissified. So use your fists, live to fight another day. That was poignant, and helped the film.\n\nF. Gary Gray: With all my work, as it relates to the streets, there\u2019s the element of how we need to think about our practices and come together. In Friday, I wish there was more of a transition to that message. It seems the movie crashes into that moment. You\u2019re experiencing all these fun moments and then all of a sudden there\u2019s this message. It grounds the movie but the execution is inelegant.\n\nShawn Barton: Between Ice Cube and Chris Tucker, I had like a hundred pairs of black and blue Converse that I gave away at the end of shooting. I was like the Converse peddler.\n\nF. Gary Gray: All the music in the movie is music Cube and I grew up with. On Saturday, when we had to do our chores, my mom would throw on \u201970s soul and it just felt warm. When you grow up poor, all you have is your friends, your family, and music.\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: When Gary dropped the music into the film it was a fantasy soundtrack. You can drop in all the great music that you want to, but if that film is going to be released, someone has to pay for it to be in the film. Toby Emmerich of New Line was such a believer that he put up so much money to allow us to have all of the music in that film. I will never forget that because Gary delivered a film with this music in it, and there was no money whatsoever to buy any of these songs.Chapter 5: The ReleaseF. Gary Gray: When I showed the first cut to Chris and Cube, they didn\u2019t like it. The first cut was long and I learned a lot, but after I watched it, I didn't know if I\u2019d ever work again.\n\nFaizon Love: When we first saw it, Chris thought that it sucked. He was like, \u201cWhat the fuck is this bullshit?\u201d He thought we\u2019d never work again.\n\nF. Gary Gray: Then when we played it for our audience it was like, \u201cOh yeah, this movie is good.\u201d\n\nFaizon Love: They sent Chris and me to Howard University to premiere it. We go there and we watch it and we\u2019re like, \u201cAy, let\u2019s get the fuck out of here before the movie ends.\u201d As we\u2019re leaving, the lady that\u2019s running it stops us, like, \u201cWhere you guys going?\u201d We hear the crowd erupt, like \u201cAaahhhh!\u201d We were like, \u201cDamn, do they want their money back? What the fuck?\u201d They loved the movie\u2014they started clapping and wanted us to sign autographs.\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: My manager went to a screening and he told me, \u201cAnna, this is going to be a hit. They were rolling in the aisle.\u201d I asked, \u201cWas it that funny?\u201d When I saw it, all I could do was look at my hips, how big they were.\n\nIce Cube: We knew we had something. It wasn\u2019t really understood by mainstream media but it was accepted by the hood. We were in a space that people rarely get in with neighborhood comedies. It was a proud moment. Everybody thought that I was Mr. Neighborhood Terror and all I could do was talk about all the bad shit that was going on. Coming out with a movie like Friday, to me, was like the vindication of coming out with a song like \u201cIt Was a Good Day,\u201d showing that Ice Cube ain\u2019t no animal.\n\nFaizon Love: The premiere at Mann\u2019s [Chinese Theater] was crazy! All of Cube\u2019s kids were babies and I held one of them. The whole auditorium was weed. It was smoked out. It. Was. Smoked. Out.\n\nDJ Pooh: I barely remember the premiere, I just remember that somebody with me got the L.A. Times and said, \u201cMan, they dissed your movie.\u201d The review was like, \u201cIf you\u2019re into watching a predominantly black film with everybody sitting around on the porch smoking weed, then this film is for you.\u201d He talked bad about it. I was mad as hell. But people were like, \u201cOh shit, sitting in the house and niggas smoking weed? That\u2019s my shit!\u201d I think niggas flocked out, they helped out.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I didn't read reviews, but I heard. We didn\u2019t go into this movie thinking we might get an Oscar nomination. It\u2019s not Oscar bait. It feels good, it\u2019s a guilty pleasure. You can let your hair down. I read an interview with Michael Jordan and the interviewer asked what his favorite movie was. He said Friday, and the interviewer hadn\u2019t heard of it. Jordan said, \u201cAnd you call yourself a film critic?\u201d\n\nIce Cube: It didn\u2019t make a lot of box office noise. It made $20\u201324 million in the box office.\n\nF. Gary Gray: In terms of return on investment, it was one of the most profitable films of 1995. The industry was surprised. It\u2019s this little movie that came out of nowhere and it was No. 2 at the box office. It was only in a small amount of theaters but the per-screen average was really high.\n\nFaizon Love: The movie was a huge bootleg on the street before it came out. We didn\u2019t know the extent of it. After we got our checks, we knew. It was a means to pay your rent. We didn\u2019t know bootlegging was a downfall for film and television or we would\u2019ve kicked them people\u2019s asses, like \u201cMotherfucka!\u201d But we were living the dream. Best pussy ever. We were great. This is the kind of guy Chris is: While we were filming, there was this hot truck out called a Land Cruiser\u2014it was like the Rolls-Royce back then. Chris and I didn\u2019t have no money, so we were going from dealership to dealership test driving it. [Laughs.] When Chris got his first check\u2014I don\u2019t know what it was\u2014he came to my apartment and he had the truck. He drops me the keys and he\u2019s like, \u201cYou drive.\u201d Because we used to share a car and that\u2019s how our relationship was.\n\nAngela Means: We knew it was Chris Tucker\u2019s breakout.\n\nKim Hardin: I had no idea that it was going to do as well as it did\u2014and cross over. It crossed over as far as people of all races could relate to the subject matter and think it was funny.\n\nAngela Means: I\u2019m a country girl, I\u2019m from a 175-acre farm, dirt road, and I have no star thing about me. When Friday first came out, people would come up to me. I ran into Malcolm-Jamal Warner and the first thing out of his mouth was: \u201cGary freaked it! Gary freaked it!\u201d and I was like, \u201cDidn\u2019t he?! Gary freaked that motherfucker!\u201d I was in a grocery store right after, with my little baby, and a group of girls bombarded me. They were loud, and there were a lot of them jumping up and down, and they were saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the crackhead! It\u2019s the crackhead!\u201d I was like, \u201cDon\u2019t call me a crackhead in front of my baby!\u201d I got put out of a mall in Ontario because they said I was creating a commotion. I told them I was just shopping but they said I had to go. I obeyed. I\u2019m not a gangster, I\u2019m a country girl; I learned how to drive on a tractor. [Laughs.]Chapter 6: The LegacyIce Cube: It made its noise on DVD. That\u2019s when it really started getting heavy.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: People pulled [VHS and DVD copies] off the shelves and wouldn\u2019t return them when they rented them.\n\nIce Cube: When the mainstream did eventually understand Friday, people started to try to emulate it in a lot of ways. When I saw There\u2019s Something About Mary, I was like, \u201cDamn, that\u2019s a lot like the middle of Friday right there.\u201d It had the same flavor. I started seeing people pluck a little bit from it\u2014you know you doing the right thing when you see that.\n\nFaizon Love: There were a plethora of roles afterward. The \u201990s was a movie every week. It was abuzz. Television shows, all kinds of shit. It was a different time. In the \u201990s, the music was growing too. Tupac was always around and Dr. Dre\u2014that\u2019s who we hung out with. I was shooting a television show and Chris called me like, \u201cC\u2019mon, man, we going to shoot a Tupac video\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cI can\u2019t leave, I\u2019m doing a fucking TV show!\u201d But we got to shoot with Dre when we shot the Friday video for \u201cKeep Their Heads Ringin'.\u201d We shot that in an airplane hangar. That was a party! Dre landed in a helicopter. We was like, \u201cOh shit!\u201d\n\nA.J. Johnson: It opened a lot of doors for me. Robert Townsend said he seen me in Friday and he loved it, so that\u2019s why he hired me for BAPS. Master P hired me for I Got the Hook Up off of Friday, and then Cube gave me The Players Club from _Friday*.\n\nPaula Jai Parker: I\u2019ve been in over 100 television shows and movies over the last 20 years but no one shows me love as much as the people who love me from my very first film, Friday.\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: Twenty years ago, they weren\u2019t doing a lot of these movies, so being able to document the black middle class was really a delight. In most of the movies that were being done, they didn\u2019t have families. That\u2019s one of the reasons why this one was so welcoming, not just in the black community, but in every community\u2014you saw the characters as whole people. Even in Eddie Murphy movies we didn\u2019t see a family until The Nutty Professor.\n\nShawn Barton: I would never say Friday is an \u201cimportant\u201d film. What it\u2019s done is join everyone across the board. I like that it has reached so many demographics. It\u2019s joined us all in ways that I don\u2019t think we thought about while shooting. We were thinking a pocket of people will think this is funny, or a pocket who get high will relate to it.\n\nTiny Lister: I heard of people naming their animals and their kids Deebo. There\u2019s so many white people that name their animals and their kids that, and they live in different parts of the world\u2014you\u2019d think they wouldn't touch that.\n\nFaizon Love: I didn\u2019t know how big it was until \u201999. I was doing a movie in South Africa and this guy who looked like a bushman called me \u201cBig Worm.\u201d I was like, \u201cNO FUCKING WAY! This guy doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s seen an electric appliance all of his life!\u201d\n\nA.J. Johnson: Kids who weren\u2019t even born when we shot the movie come up to me and say, \u201cHey, Ezal! My neck! My back! My neck and my back!\u201d\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: Every TSA agent that I run into always asks, \u201cWhen are you going to do another Friday? We saw a poster online.\u201d They also say, \u201cThat\u2019s Cube\u2019s mother!\u201d Yes, I am. I am Ice Cube\u2019s mother. [Laughs.] It\u2019s interesting what you\u2019re known as. I\u2019ve done more than 100 movies and that\u2019s the one that everybody knows. Since Friday, I\u2019ve gotten to play most rappers\u2019 mother. I think that\u2019s God\u2019s joke on me, making me famous for being every rapper\u2019s mother. I say that because I don\u2019t know the rap music. Not that I dislike it, I just can\u2019t talk as fast as they can and I don\u2019t understand the things they\u2019re saying.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: I\u2019m Mr. Jones no matter where I\u2019m at. I said things in that movie I\u2019ll probably die with. \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody go in the bathroom for 35\u201345 minutes.\u201d People say that when I\u2019m in the airport, and I\u2019m in the airport all the time. When I do my show, that\u2019s the first thing I say when I come out. I do that line and they all repeat it with me. It\u2019s been that way for 20 years.\n\nAngela Means: I found out that #ByeFelicia was trending when my friend called to say congratulations on my son\u2019s first college offer. When we got off of the phone he said, \u201cBye, Felisha.\u201d I was like, \u201cHow ancient are you with that \u2018Bye, Felisha\u2019 shit?\u201d and he said, \u201cDude, #ByeFelicia is trending!\u201d I was like, \u201cTrending? What\u2019s \u2018trending\u2019?\u201d He told me to punch in \u201c#ByeFelicia\u201d and see what happens. My jaw dropped. I love the way Keith Olbermann says it.\n\nTiny Lister: This is what I see with my own eyes\u2014well, I\u2019m blind in one eye, so this is what I see with my working eye: I did a couple of comedy things for Chris Tucker, came on stage as Deebo on a bicycle. At the end of his comedy session, in front of 3,500 to 5,000 people, they were chanting, \u201cFriday! Friday! Friday!\u201d When I go with Ice Cube and watch him perform, at the end of his rap session, they talking about Friday. They not talking about when Chris did the thing with Jackie Chan. They not talking about Ice Cube when he did Three Kings. Michael Jordan wanted to do the second Friday\u2014it was his kids\u2019 favorite movie. When Chris pulled out, I guess he backed out. Deion Sanders wanted to be in Next Friday. Patti LaBelle wanted to play Chris Tucker\u2019s mother.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: It\u2019s annoying that Chris Tucker doesn\u2019t want to be associated with this character again. It\u2019s ridiculous \u2019cause [Smokey] made him. He wasn\u2019t doing that much before that. If he doesn\u2019t want to do it because of the marijuana, marijuana is being legalized all over the country. He\u2019s got some contradiction there, because marijuana\u2019s not a big deal anymore.\n\nFaizon Love: Chris is a fucking idiot. He does do sequels\u2014he did 900 Rush Hour movies. I even talked him into doing the first one. People have their own ways. I still love him as a brother but I just can\u2019t talk to him like you can\u2019t talk to an idiot.\n\nIce Cube: I don\u2019t understand to this day why [Chris] would want to run from something that made him a movie star. But you got to respect somebody wanting a life change. When you bring God into the equation, you can\u2019t say nothing against that.\n\nChris Tucker (via Sway in the Morning): Friday is a great movie, and I definitely don't regret doing that, and I love that people still love that movie. What I said years ago is to better myself\u2014I\u2019m a perfectionist. I always wanted not to be like every other comedian, and, at the time, just cuss, just to cuss for no reason. I said I want to better myself, and if I do cuss, it\u2019s for a reason and it doesn't take the place of the material or what I'm talking about.\n\nDJ Pooh: I was disappointed that Chris distanced himself but I respect his decision. That\u2019s that man\u2019s life. That\u2019s who that man is, so I respect that. But at the same time, his fans would love to see him back as Smokey in Last Friday. And I think there\u2019s a way to do it where it could still be funny, \u2019cause Chris is still funny.\n\nIce Cube: Smokey would be running a little rehab scam these days.\n\nChris Tucker (via Sway In the Morning): I\u2019m actually trying to help [the studio] come up with some ideas and be a part of the producing process with Cube to see if we can come up with something, so that might happen. If I do a movie like Friday again it has to evolve. I evolved from Smokey when I was that age when I did that movie.\n\nTiny Lister: It would cost a lot to bring everybody back. Ice Cube\u2019s numbers have changed, Chris\u2019 number have changed. F. Gary Gray\u2019s numbers have changed. All of ours have.\n\nFaizon Love: We\u2019re too old to do another Friday sequel. Ice Cube and I were at the airport six months ago and I asked, \u201cHow much do you get asked when we doing another Friday?\u201d and he\u2019s like \u201cMan, every fucking day.\u201d And he\u2019s putting out some good stuff! I can\u2019t see it working right now. Everybody is old and fat. Chris Tucker is my size! [Laughs.]\n\nIce Cube: It did everything we wanted it to do. We grew up on Car Wash, Let\u2019s Do It Again, Uptown Saturday Night, and Cheech and Chong. We wanted to make a hood classic that people could grow up on and be one of their favorite movies of all time. The movie is alive and kicking and people are still enjoying it like they did 20 years ago. Hearing Zach Randolph from the Memphis Grizzlies being called Zeebo and Stuart Scott quote Friday lines, it was like us saying Scarface lines.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I wasn\u2019t surprised that people liked it, I wasn\u2019t even surprised about the success of it. I am surprised about the legs that it still to this day and the cultural impact that it had on popular culture, the fact that it spawned a franchise. People say \u201cBye, Felisha\u201d and some people don\u2019t even know where it comes from. For that to ring loudly 20 years later? That was a small moment and it wasn\u2019t even a structured joke! Quotables coming from a process where a bunch of kids got together and made a movie, essentially about the block Cube, Pooh, and I grew up on, that surprises me. When you read the script, you couldn\u2019t say this was a guaranteed hit. We were lucky to have Mike De Luca over at New Line roll the dice, and to have Cube put his career on the line. All the moons and the stars aligned for us on this project.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1032733", "artist_names": "Dion", "full_title": "And the Night Stood Still by\u00a0Dion", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/67ebfe55b1488d4b6f83b1c8de0266f4.300x294x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/67ebfe55b1488d4b6f83b1c8de0266f4.1000x981x1.jpg", "id": 1032733, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 8613973, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1625757338, "path": "/Dion-and-the-night-stood-still-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Dion-and-the-night-stood-still-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1989, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1989", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1989", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/67ebfe55b1488d4b6f83b1c8de0266f4.300x294x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/67ebfe55b1488d4b6f83b1c8de0266f4.1000x981x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "And the Night Stood Still", "title_with_featured": "And the Night Stood Still", "updated_by_human_at": 1625758826, "url": "https://genius.com/Dion-and-the-night-stood-still-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/2825", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ec4210ecddfcfaa9313786ab1e6fce57.999x999x1.jpg", "id": 2825, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ec4210ecddfcfaa9313786ab1e6fce57.999x999x1.jpg", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Dion", "slug": "Dion", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Dion"}, "artist": "Dion", "lyrics": "And the Night Stood Still LyricsDo you remember on the night that we first met\nThe moment I looked in your eyes I never will forget\nDo you remember oh the time that we first kissed\nRemember thinking to myself could it really be like this\n\nAnd we danced beneath the midnight moon\nWhoa!
