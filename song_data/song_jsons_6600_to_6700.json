feel\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I said my heart was beating loud\nIf we could escape the crowd somehow\nIf I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?\n'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight\nSo, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?\n[Verse 2]\nHey, you might think that I'm crazy\nBut you know I'm just your type\nI might be a little hazy\nBut you just cannot deny\nThere's a spark in-between us\nWhen we're dancing on the floor\nI want more, wanna see it\nSo, I'm asking you tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I said my heart was beating loud\nIf we could escape the crowd somehow\nIf I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?\n'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight\nSo, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?\n\n[Spoken Interlude]\nIf I said I want your body, would you hold it against me?\n\n[Bridge]\nGive me something good\nDon't wanna wait, I want it now\nDrop it, like a hood\nAnd show me how you work it out\nAlright\nYou might also like[Breakdown]\nIf I said my heart was beating loud\nIf I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I said my heart

Review Lyrics(from my site https://moflow7.wordpress.com/)\n\n\n\nDuring my eighth grade year, I was digging through my parents\u2019 old boxes when I discovered 2Pac Shakur\u2019s Better Dayz album, this still-intact two-disc CD case. From that day, Better Dayz was everywhere with me, as I also had a CD player to listen to this album (uncovered in the box as well). In this current age of iPods and MP3s, of 2 Chainz and Drake, I had an ancient device that I valued like a diamond in the rough, obsessed over an album my peers knew or cared nothing for (When I was an eighth grader, I obviously had a wild social life)\n\nI didn\u2019t care. Sure, I listened to and loved rappers (Post-Blueprint Jay-Z, Eminem, T.I., and (regrettably) Lil Wayne), but Better Dayz was the first album I cherished, sparking a deeper passion for music than I once possessed. It would be disgraceful for me to not review this album before any other because, without this, I would have little love for rap (if at all). Without further delay, here\u2019s my track-by-track review of Better Dayz.\n\nDisc 1\n\n1. Intro \u2013 This is the best way to begin an album. A reporter is at the unveiling of Better Dayz and she wonders where the songs are coming from since, you know, Pac was dead and all when this album was made. The fans in the background chant \u201cTu-Pac! Tu-Pac!\u201d before they all count down the seconds for the release of Better Dayz.\n2. Still Ballin\u2019 \u2013 This is the first official song on the album, and it\u2019s a mediocre one, lasting under three minutes, possessing a good-but-not-great beat, and featuring a rapper named Trick Daddy. Really? This is what the fans were hyped up about?\n\n3. When We Ride On Our Enemies \u2013 Okay, this is a little better, with a beat that lets you know something amazing is about to happen, but (like \u201cStill Ballin\u201d) it\u2019s under three minutes and is a mediocre song overall. Right now, the best thing about Better Dayz is the intro\n\n4. Changed Man \u2013 Wow. This. Is. Amazing. The guitar instrumental is awesome, giving a laid-back mood to the song. Johnt\u00e1 Austin, this no-name singer, provides a phenomenal chorus while 2Pac and T.I. (the King of the South) trade verses about how they\u2019re, well, \u201cchanged men\u201d. This song is easily a highlight of Better Dayz.\n\n5. F**k \u2018Em All \u2013 And now we\u2019re back to crap. Oh yeah, it also featured Outlawz, the duo that appeared in \u201cMe Against the World\u201d\n\n6. Never B Peace \u2013 Hey, this song ain\u2019t half bad (and the beat\u2019s pretty good, too). As I look at whose featured (some nobodies named E.D.I and Kastro), I realize this was a lot better than I expected it to be\n\n7. Mama\u2019s Just A Little Girl \u2013 When people think of Pac\u2019s classic ballads to the ladies, they\u2019ll think of \u201cDear Mama\u201d but this song was pretty good too. \u201cMama\u2019s Just A Little Girl\u201d has a soulful edge to it and 2Pac raps with passion on this track, but it\u2019s Kimma Hill who dampens the songs brightness as she delivers a very unsatisfying chorus (there\u2019s a reason why nobody\u2019s heard of her). This is definitely no \u201cDear Mama\u201d\n\n8. Street Fame \u2013 Not many would attribute 2Pac\u2019s legendary success to his lyricism or wordplay but, in this track, Shakur simply obliterated the mic (\u201cPositive identification/ Got me rushed to the station\u201d), and rappers should really collaborate more with Daz Dillinger (the producer who made this song\u2019s beat) because he is a BEAST. Just listen to this sick piano instrumental for yourself. I\u2019m ignoring that this song was from the `94 album Thug Life Vol. 1 to say \u201cStreet Fame\u201d is one of Better Dayz\u2019s finest tracks. As Pac said in this song \u201cLyrics\u2019ll leave you spellbound.\u201d They sure did\n\n9. Whatcha Gonna Do? \u2013 You know what I\u2019m going to do? Skip this song. Hey, thanks for asking\n\n10. Fair XChange \u2013 At first, I hated this track but it slowly grew on me. As for the song itself, it\u2019s one of 2Pac\u2019s typical tracks dedicated to the ladies\n\n11. Late Night \u2013 2Pac ripped apart this song\u2019s phenomenal beat, easily the best beat I\u2019ve heard in this album\n\n12. Ghetto Star \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a more stereotypical song title and I can\u2019t think of two more non-sensical stage names than this track\u2019s guest rapper and producer (Nutt-So and Go-Twice, respectively). Because of this, I assume I\u2019ll be listening to absolute garbage. Instead, I receive this intense instrumental accompanied by a super-serious Shakur, who once again brandished his lyrical excellence, providing an in-depth explanation of his struggles\n\n13. Thugz Mansion (Acoustic) \u2013 I never understood what was so great about this. Yeah, there are some good aspects to this song (the beautiful guitar instrumental, and Nas spitting fire), but 2Pac\u2019s rhymes were stolen form the original and J.Phoenix submitted a very sub-par chorus. It is what it is: a good-but-not-great rendition of a hip-hop classic (which will be in Disc 2)\n\n(End of Disc 1)\nYou might also likeDisc 2\n\n1. My Block \u2013 This extraordinary guitar instrumental is present as 2Pac describes the struggles of the ghettos and he looks beyond that for hope. There\u2019s also this group of little kids who form a first-class chorus. Disc 2 is definitely on a great start\n\n2. Thugz Mansion \u2013 Over the years, I\u2019ve listened to tons and tons of excellent songs, but this is still my all-time favorite. \u201cThugz Mansion\u201d begins with Pac inventing the idea of a heaven for thugs like him, which leads into this masterpiece. To me, the beat isn\u2019t that impressive but that\u2019s the one flaw I found. On \u2018Thugz Mansion\u201d, 2Pac flaunts his lyrical excellence and injects his rhymes with unbridled passion. There\u2019s also a notable rhyme in Verse 2 where Shakur says \u201cNobody cares, seen the politicians ban us/ They\u2019d rather see us locked in chains, please explain why they can\u2019t stand us\u201d, an idea that Kanye West expounded upon in his well-known song \u201cNew Slaves\u201d. And don\u2019t get me started on R&B legend Anthony Hamilton, who explodes into this track with an unrivaled chorus. If you\u2019re going to listen to one song on Better Dayz, this is it (As an eighth grader, I pushed the repeat button so often that it broke)\n\n3. Never Call You B**ch Again \u2013 It\u2019s another excellent guitar instrumental, and Pac once again steps up his game. This song is about the rap legend gaining a newfound appreciation for the special woman who stood by him through thick and thin. Tyrese Gibson, who\u2019s currently known as \u201cthat black guy\u201d in the Fast and Furious franchise, is featured in this track and, while he\u2019s definitely no Anthony Hamilton, he provides an amazing chorus. Disc 2 of Better Dayz is 3-for-3; there are no crappy tracks or sub-par songs as of right now\n\n4. Better Dayz \u2013 The streak continues. The title track features a great chorus by Ron Isley, a soothing, reminiscing beat, and a spectacular Shakur (whose emotional performances on this album have become the norm). \u201cBetter Dayz\u201d is a superb song all-around\n\n5. U Can Call \u2013 We\u2019re now 5-for-5! \u201cU Can Call\u201d is definitely a standout track in Better Dayz, a laid-back song about picking up women that features a phenomenal beat, the second-best beat on Better Dayz (\u201cLate Night\u201d, of course, is first), and an equally excellent chorus by Jazze Pha\n\n6. Military Minds \u2013 The streak ends. I\u2019m not saying this was a bad song. Actually, it was an awesome song with an amazing beat but \u201cMilitary Minds\u201d died when 2Pac continuously chanted \u201cWhere my thugs at\u201d\n\n7. Fame \u2013 The good times return. With the same song title as Young Jeezy\u2019s immortal track (and the one great Snowman song I could find), this no-name producer (Hurt M Badd) creates a great beat as 2Pac and Outlawz tears it to bits. \u201cFame\u201d also approaches a level of emotion that reminiscent of Disc 2\u2019s earlier tracks as the pirate chant-like\u00a0hook begins the song with \u201cOne thing we all adore/ Something worth dying for/ Nothing but pain/ Stuck in this game/ Searching for fortune and fame\u201d (This song is one of Better Dayz\u2019s finest, but I really want more from Pac)\n\n8. Fair XChange (remix) \u2013 My ears are bleeding. This is by far the worst song Better Dayz has to offer, a much more insufferable track than \u201cWhatcha Gonna Do?\u201d, and that\u2019s something nearly impossible to pull off. Skip this song\n\n9. Catchin\u2019 Feelins \u2013 Produced by E.D.I (the same guy who featured in \u201cNever B Peace\u201d), this track\u2019s beat sounds suspiciously similar to the one in \u201cGhetto Star\u201d. Overall, this is a pretty good song, nothing special (and it also features Outlawz)\n\n10. There U Go \u2013 A laid-back song reminiscent of \u201cChanged Man\u201d and \u201cLate Night\u201d, this track is about Pac catching his woman cheating on him and how he feels about it. Big Syke (who collaborated with Pac on \u201cAll Eyez On Me\u201d) is featured in here along with Outlawz, who surprisingly fit the mood of \u201cThere U Go\u201d and temporarily resign from their usually intense rhymes\n\n11. This Life I Lead \u2013 You can take one look at the song title and know exactly what this track is about. Like \u201cFame\u201d, 2Pac inserts a single verse, a very good verse but still one verse, and delivers a mediocre hook. Also in this song is Outlawz (shocker), who steal 2Pac\u2019s immortal line: \u201cI ain\u2019t a killa, but don\u2019t push me.\u201d Not one of Better Dayz\u2019s finest\n\n12. Who Do U Believe In? \u2013 Over the last couple of tracks, I wanted 2Pac to take over, to simply dominate, and he does on this one. Over the simplistic guitar instrumental, Pac gets deep, discussing religion on a level I haven\u2019t heard since \u201cThugz Mansion\u201d. Yaki Kadafi (an Outlawz member) makes an appearance and his mediocricy as a rapper, sort of obvious throughout this album, is on full display here. Despite the fact that \u201cWho Do U Believe In?\u201d was originally from the `99 compilation album Suge Knight Represent: Chronic 2000, this is a very good track in Better Dayz.\n13. They Don\u2019t Give A F**k About Us \u2013 The previous song would\u2019ve been a great way to finish this album; instead, we\u2019re stuck with this. Sure, this track\u2019s theme was a deep one, about what happens when people die and if others will care about them, but overall it was a very second-rate song\n\n14. Outro \u2013 Only thirteen seconds long, this is 2Pac saying he\u2019ll come back from the dead and he says this twice. (End of Disc 2)\n\nConclusion\n\nEverybody loved 2Pac, but when he died, they dismissed the albums that were released after that, claiming the posthumous albums were either not as good as the ones when he was alive or were copied material from Pac\u2019s previous works. That might be true for the other posthumous albums but Better Dayz, with the exception of a few songs, is entirely original and this album, as a whole, is just as good as the ones Shakur created when he was alive\n\nDon\u2019t judge me, but honestly I was having (very small) doubts about whether or not 2Pac really is the greatest. Listening to Better Dayz crushed those doubts to smithereens and now I can continue to scream my loyalty to 2Pac Shakur, the one and only king of rap (R.I.P)\n\nTop tracks\n\n1. Thugz Mansion\n\n2.

created\nFor a special purpose\nAnd, uh\nWhat's more special than you?\nYou feel me?\n[Verse 1]\nIt's on, baby, let's get lost\nYou don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss\nFor real, want you to show me how you feel\nI consider myself lucky, that's a big deal\nWhy?\nWell, you got the key to my heart\nBut you ain't gonna need it\nI'd rather you open up my body\nAnd show me secrets you didn't know was inside\nNo need for me to lie\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's too big (Big)\nIt's too wide (Wide)\nIt's too strong (Strong)\nIt won't fit (Fit)\nIt's too much (Much)\nIt's too tough (Tough)\nHe talk like this 'cause he can back it up\nHe got a big ego\nSuch a huge ego\nI love his big ego\nIt's too much\nHe walk like this 'cause he can back it up\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nUsually I'm humble\nRight now, I don't choose\nYou can leave with me\nOr you could have the blues\nSome call it arrogant\nI call it confident\nYou decide when you find out what I'm working with\nDamn, I know\nI'm killing you with them legs\nBetter yet, them thighs\nMatter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?\nBoy, you a sight to see\nKinda something like me\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's too big (Big)\nIt's too wide (Wide)\nIt's too strong (Strong)\nIt won't fit (Fit)\nIt's too much (Much)\nIt's too tough (Tough)\nI talk like this 'cause I can back it up\nI got a big ego\nSuch a huge ego\nBut, he loves my big ego\nIt's too much\nI walk like this 'cause I can back it up\n[Hook]\nI, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up\nI, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up\nI, I, I can back it up\nI can back it up\nI walk like this 'cause I can back it up\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's too big (Big)\nIt's too wide (Wide)\nIt's too strong (Strong)\nIt won't fit (Fit)\nIt's too much (Much)\nIt's too tough (Tough)\nHe talk like this 'cause he can back it up\nHe got a big ego\nSuch a huge ego (Such a huge ego)\nBut, I love his big ego\nIt's too much\nHe walk like this 'cause he can back it up\n\n[Bridge]\nEgo so big, you must admit\nI got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch\nEgo so strong, you ain't know?\nI don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...\nWhoa...\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWoah-oh-oh-oh\nWoah-woah-woah\nWoah-woah-woah\nWoah-woah, woah-woah, woo...\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh-oh-oh\nOh, oh-oh-oh\nOh, oh-oh-oh\nOh, oh-oh-oh26Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 13,

bleed\nMy only friends are pirates\nThat's just who I am\nI'm better as a memory than as your man\n[Verse 2]\nNever sure when the truth won't do\nI'm pretty good on a lonely night\nI move on the way a storm blows through\nI never stay, but then again, I might\nI struggle sometimes to find the words\nAlways sure until I doubt\nWalk a line until it blurs\nBuild walls too high to climb out\nBut I'm honest to a fault\nThat's just who I am\nI'm better as a memory than as your man\n\n[Bridge]\nI see you leaning, you're bound to fall\nI don't want to be that mistake\nI'm just a dreamer and nothing more\nYou should know it before it gets too late\n\n[Verse 3]\nCause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel\nYou never know where they're gonna land\nFirst you're spinning, then you're standing still\nLeft holding a losing hand\nBut one day you're gonna find someone\nAnd right away you'll know it's true\nThat all of your seeking's done\nIt was just a part of the passing through\nRight there

there is no where I can say I'd rather be now\nI see that, you're my shining star\nI mean that, girl you got my heart, and now I hold your hand cause you made me a stronger man\nI wish that I could

and I told you that I'd be your man\nSo many things have come so many things have gone\nOne thing that's stayed the same is our love is still growing strong\n\n{Chorus}\nBaby just look at us all this time and we're still in love\nSomething like this just don't exist\nBetween a backwoods boy and a fairy tale princess\nPeople said it would never work out\nLiving our dreams has shattered all doubts\nIt feels good to prove 'em wrong\nLiving our love song\nOh darling would you look at me\nWith my heart beating fast and my shaking knees\nIt's pretty hard to believe after all these years I still need you this badly\nYou're dancing in my arms with a spotlight moon in a sea of stars\nGirl we've come so far everything I want is everything that you are\nI just want to lay you down\nSay I

smile\nStands at the door\nAnd says, 'Will you please come with me?'\nSarah Beth is scared to death\n'Cause the doctor just told her the news\nBetween the red cells and white\nSomething's not right\nBut we're gonna take care of you\n\nSix chances in ten, it won't come back again\nWith the therapy we're gonna try\nIt's just been approved\nIt's the strongest there is\nI think we caught it in time\n\nSarah Beth closes her eyes\nShe dreams she's dancing\nAround and around, without any cares\nAnd her very first love is holding her close\nAnd the soft wind is blowing her hair\n\nSarah Beth is scared to death\nAs she sits, holding her mom\nSays it would be a mistake\nFor someone to take\nA girl with no hair to the prom\n\nFor just this morning, right there on her pillow\nWas the cruelest of

1]\nIt's kinda crazy babe, how I remember things\nLike where you came from and how you had nothin'\nI went and made you fly, put extras on your ride\nDidn't miss a birthday now you can't even remember mine\nYou made it clear to me (You wasn't down for me)\nLove made me blind, baby (But now I see)\nYou had things up your sleeve (Ho) don't even lie to me\nI even heard it from your family\n\n[Chorus]\nHow could you let somebody lay where I laid?\nHow could you give him everything that we made?\nHow could you call him all the names that you used to call me?\nHow could you, how could you just forget about me?\nHow could you teach him all the things I taught you?\nHow could you put him on to the ghetto Kama Sutra?\nHow could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?\nHow could you, how could you just forget about me?\n[Verse 2]\nYou must be out your mind, you got a lot of nerve\nTo think that I'm gon' chill after all the shit I heard\nI damn near carried you, I could've married you\nGood thing I found out 'fore I bought that seven-karat for you\nI know you're sick about (The way I found you out)\nGo head and pack it out (I hope he's got room in his house)\nYou should have thought of me before you hopped in them sheets\nDamn I can't believe that you did this to me, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nHow could you let somebody lay where I laid?\nHow could you give him everything that we made?\nHow could you call him all the names that you used to call me?\nHow could you, how could you just forget about me?\nHow could you teach him all the things I taught you?\nHow could you put him on to the ghetto Kama Sutra?\nHow could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?\nHow could you, how could you just forget about me?\n\n[Bridge]\nGirl, I tried to give you everything\nCan't believe the ways you repaid me\nGirl you had it all\nBut I guess my all wasn't good enough for you\nBaby I've accepted it, and I ain't gon' trip\nGirl, I'm moving on\nSometimes I can't help but think, that another man's\nGonna get the one I made for me\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nHow could you let somebody lay where I laid?\nHow could you give him everything

could you just go and lay there?)\n(How could you, how could you give him everything?)\nHow could you girl?
