Here Lyrics[Intro]\nI'd like to thank y'all for this opportunity to drop the jewelery, and get this shit poppin' musically\n\n[Verse 1]\nFeels like I'm locked in hell's gate and God's my cellmate\nSaying \"plot this jailbreak, pop the cops who tailgate!\"\nYou sealed your fate, prying inside my business\nTo find a mind as scientific as Mayan hieroglyphics\nAs God's my witness, I'll spit viral sickness\nLike Bible-scripted Black Plague in the last day's final minutes\nOn primal vicious grind, 'til my vinyl shipments climb\nThrough the grapevine to be the finest vintage wine\nSky's the limit? Fine, I'm in your atmosphere\nThe racketeer the sky into falling on your rap career\nAnd I ain't stacking near the millions I'm worth\n'cuz saying something ill in a verse and having skills are a curse\nBut still, I got a feeling that this villain at work'll be\nMore chillin' than still-born children at birth\nI'm the king, my underlings are building my church\nAnd when your mom close her eyes to pray, I'm stealing her purse\nNow, God willing I become the illest on earth\nWhere love is hate, so I just pray your feelings get hurt\nMy life is tragic, so it's only right I right the madness\nLike being psychopathic's my right of passage\nDon't care what the price of gas is, I'll splash it on you\nWhile I'm lighting matches and put out the flames with nitric acid\nSpiteful bastard, I'm back with a vengeance\nA fifth of Jack and Mac-11 to capture the essence\n[Hook]\nI'm just an artist getting closer to the edge\nSo when I go over, know I put my soul in what I said\nFor real, 'Bolic ain't focused on the bread\nI had enough of that, so if you with me where the fuck you at?\n\n(Where the fuck you at?) We right here! [x4]\n\n[Verse 2]\nFuck your gunfights, all I need is one mic and crowd time\nAnd I can outshine the sunlight on cloud 9\nFor now I'm climbing uphill and grinding\n'til I chill reclining on a diamond-studded silver lining\nFearless rhyming, but those skeptics don't get it\nMost said I dig my own grave, I'm too poetic\nStress like Po said, let's Organize Konfusion\nI'm just a microphone fiend, always high, using\nThe rush intoxicated me and fortified the movement\nAnd plus I get to slaughter guys, all for my amusement\nDrawing my conclusion, don't need a label budget\nSo I'm saying \"fuck it\" like I'm way above it, you can hate or love it\nRaised in Suffolk, fighting like I'm Razor Ruddock\nWithout a pot to piss in, urinate in public\nIn the home of Rakim, Erick Sermon, R.A. the Rugged\nDiabolic's dancing with the devil angel-dusted\nBring the ruckus, let's rumble in the slums\nSo I can punch you in the ribs 'til they're puncturing your lungs\nI'm just wondering, how the fuck you doubling your funds\nBy lying about scratching off the numbers on a gun?\nCuz the muthafuckas where I'm from feel inside\nThat even though Dilla died, hiphop is still alive\nAnd it will survive the fake thugs talking tough\nWhen I click the nine and get a dial tone and call your bluff\nYou might also like[Hook]1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1066340", "artist_names": "Tony Bennett (Ft.

grow up to be a man?\n[Verse 2: Mike Love, Group, Brian Wilson]\nWill I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?\n(fourteen, fifteen)\nWill I settle down fast or will I first wanna travel the world?\n(sixteen, seventeen)\nNow I'm young and free, but how will it be\n\n[Chorus: Group]\nWhen I grow up to be a man?\n\n[Bridge: Group]\nOooooh\nOooooh\nOooooh\n\n[Verse 3: Mike Love,

Cliff White examines the output of the sex machine inch by inch.Cathy McGowan, reminiscing on BBC's 'The Story of Pop':\n\n\"When he came here he was hailed as the great James Brown \u2013 and the show was awful. I mean he just couldn't produce the sound. It was terrible. I mean it was really awful. It was a bad, bad show. A disaster. And the only reason that they devoted the whole show to Brown was because of the following that he'd got here built up because of the hysteria on the part of the mods. You know, it was like everything else. It was like everybody's-gotta- say-you-like-James-Brown-week. So, of course, the demand for James Brown records was such that everyone was writing into the programme saying James Brown. Every mod you asked would say James Brown. So you imagined that he was so big that if you could just get this James Brown... And that's really where Ready Steady Go! fell flat on their face \u2013 because it was awful. And the worst thing of all was that when he actually did his numbers the mods didn't like him. When he actually came into the studio they didn't like him. The music and the records were so fantastic, but when they actually came there to the studio to do it live... something went.\"\n\nNow then, if you're the perceptive kind of reader that the editor like to thinks you are, you'll have begun to realize that Ms. McGowan and her mohair-suited friends were just a teeny bit disappointed with James Brown. What was that again? \"...when they actually came to the studio...something went.\" What \"went\", of course, on that memorable Friday evening in March 1966, was the cosy notion that here was simply another harmless jigaboo with a trendy kind of rhythm and a humble smile.\n\nThere were a lot of them about at the time. In return for the legion of guitar-playing boys next door that were flocking across the Atlantic, we were receiving an amazing array of American talent. Rockers (black and white assorted, some famous, some not so), bluesmen (rural and urban, old and ancient), and a diverse selection of \"soul\" singers were all suddenly turning up on our shores. And it was the soul stars who were the darlings of the young and hip.\n\nIn truth, they were a mixed bunch. Some, like Solomon Burke and Ben E. King, proved to be even greater than their records had suggested, others (choose your own) would have done better to stay home and be admired from afar. But at least they were all greeted warmly at RSG where things were super and smashing so long as they loved our wonderful country and performed their hit(s) adequately. And then came James Brown.\n\nBrown didn't so much appear on RSG as dominate an hour of television that just happened to fill the program's regular spot. He strutted and stamped and screamed, he sweated and grunted and fell on his knees (and screamed), he danced across the stage like he had skates on and then charged around the studio, through the audience, and back again (screaming). In short, he was quite uncontrollable, and he kept it up for the entire show, pouring out barely intelligible lyrics while his bloody great band hit chords that fractured nerves and hammered relentless riffs without mercy.\nAll in all, he was quite magnificent. Little old ladies in faraway places were moved to bombard TV Times with outraged invective, including, as I recall (although this may possibly be my fancy), a cry of \"why are these monkeys allowed on TV instead of our own great stars like Helen Shapiro?\" Even the oh-so-hipsters retreated behind a screen of confusion from where they still hurl the occasional brickbat. Yes indeed, Brown stirred reactions that had lain dormant since the hey-day of rock 'n' roll. Two years earlier Little Richard had perpetrated an hour of similar mayhem without any fuss, because even by 1964 rock had become comfortably old-hat, and anyway somehow it was always clear that really he was a sweet boy who just got carried away with himself. As far as the Ray Charles spectacular, screened shortly after \u2013 he was so acceptable, he was respectable. Brown was altogether more menacing. In fact, judging by the hysterical backlash you'd have thought he was some kind of revolutionary, bent on smashing the status quo. In a way, you'd have been right.\n\nFor the most part Brown has always been portrayed by the mass (i.e. predominantly white) media as a cunning opportunist. Energetic, certainly, sometimes even astute, but basically a musical bore who has achieved his success by understanding and using the mechanics of the industry to his great advantage. Part of this assessment is true enough \u2013 Brown has indeed skillfully manipulated his way to fame and fortune. It's the conclusion that this necessarily indicated musical poverty that's at fault.\n\nBefore Brown, black performers could either be true to themselves and accept the limited recognition/rewards that came their way, or bend to suit the mores of white establishment controlled show-biz. To a greater extent than is generally admitted this is still true, but at least black music and musicians are now an influential slice of the industry rather than an exploited sub-culture. It would be silly to promote Brown as the sole architect of this upheaval, there are too many other socio-political factors involved, but his has been the extreme example that defines the whole change. He has achieved more than any other single back entertainer, while continuing to produce music that is so intensely personal that it irritates many sensitive black souls, let alone white audiences.\n\nI'm not, here, going to attempt to examine how he achieved the hitherto impossible. Instead I urge you to take a fresh listen to the aural evidence of his defiant independence, for Brown's music has always been the clearest expression of the complex tangle of angry frustration, determination, raw energy and pride with which he has forged his career. Now, with other black bands beginning to break through with updated spin-offs from various Brown themes \u2013 and the Average White Band creating waves with a remarkably clever pastiche of what he was doing several years ago \u2013 there seem to be grounds for a calmer assessment than the old tooth 'n' nail \"he's fantastic/no he's trash\" arguments.\n\nAfter always deliberately vetoing any Greatest Hits/Best Of albums (because he's forever insisting that \"the best is yet to come\"), in the last couple of years Brown finally compromised by allowing American Polydor to put together two unsatisfactory compilations from his extensive repertoire, under the title Soul Classics. Malcolm Jones at British Polydor seized the opportunity to squeeze an extra four tracks onto each of the original volumes, and is now extending the series with a third album already issued and at least one more on the way.\n\nCompared to, say, Atlantic's Ray Charles Story or the recent Tamla Motown Anthology series, the Brown albums are a frustrating disappointment. The tracks have been drawn at random from all points of his long and complex career and jumbled illogically together without regard to recording dates or continuity of style and atmosphere; all of his extended performances have been issued in truncated form (usually 'Part One' only); and, perhaps the greatest sin, there has been no attempt to sketch in even the simplest of background details. The only sleevenote (500 words on Volume Three) suggests that Brown is probably \"the most important artist in the history of R&B music\" but does nothing about the packaging to contradict the usual impression of a prolific but shallow hit machine.\n\nHaving said that, it must be emphasised that there is far greater evidence of his talent in the grooves. With hardly a dud track amongst the 42 so far used, for the first time it's possible to obtain a meaty selection of Brown\u2019s important recordings without forking out for 20 or 30 albums or a shelf full of singles. Assuming that we'll have to wait until his death before someone takes the trouble to collate a better sampling of the man's work, I wholeheartedly recommend Soul Classics and offer the following notes as a guide around his maze of recordings.\n\nAlthough cut-and-dried divisions are necessarily an over-simplification, there have been several distinct phases in the revolution of Brown's music reflecting parallel changes I his career. Using these as a base, I have suffixed the album tracks A to F and then summarized the six ages of Brown, craftily headed by appropriate song titles from the relevant period. Included are some generalisations which ardent discographers may wish to pick holes. Don't write and tell me \u2013 I'm just trying to make an awkward job less difficult. The additional suffix 'X' indicates bastard tracks recorded without his own band.\n\nSoul Classics \u2013 Volume I\n\n(Polydor 2391.057)\n\nSex Machine (E), My Part/ Make It Funky \u2013 Part 3 (F), Cold Sweat (D) , Superbad (E), I Got You (I Feel Good) (C), Money Won't Change You (C), Night Train (B), Make It Funky \u2013 Part I (F), Papa's Got A Brand New Bag (C).

In case you don't and were about to be confused, here's a bit of background detail: At the beginning of 1956, Brown (and The Famous Flames) were signed by King Records of Cincinnati who issued his records on their subsidary, Fedral, until November 1960 when they were transferred to the parent label. By the end of 1963 Brown had clashed so often with his producers and King's boss Syd Nathan that he ignored his contract and sent his own recordings to Smash, a division of Mercury. Although he was eventually forced to return to Kind until 1971 when he joined Polydor, he retained complete control of his own recordings. He'd stopped using the Famous Flames on record by mid-1964, but kept them as part of the stage show for a couple more years.\n\nWhat d'ya mean you're still confused?\n\nAnd now, to the music....\n\n(A) Messing With The Blues (Feb 1956 \u2013 Jan. 1959)\n\nThe sharp-eyed among you will have noticed that there are no tracks suffixed (A). Brown's first eight sessions yielded 32 tracks with vocal group the Famous Flames, using studio musicians mainly supervised by King's A&R man Gene Redd. With the exception of the very first release 'Please, Please, Please', a beautifully adapted gospel song 'Try Me', and the last side from these sessions 'Bewildered', they were a commercial disaster. Stylistically they were nothing new, borrowing from earlier gospel-based R&B groups like the Dominoes and, in particular, the Five Royales. However Brown was never much of a singer in the accepted sense of the word so the overall sound was much rawer than the predecessors. As American writer Alan Leeds once observed, it was \"rather like Little Richard leading The Drifters\". When you consider that these are the only sides by Brown that year average '50s vocal group specialist deigns to collect, you'll realise how far removed they are from his later work.\n\nSo far Soul Classics ignores these formative sessions, but as well as the three tracks mentioned there are several other interesting examples of Brown's/the group's/the company's search for identity which ought to be aired again, including a frantic rocker 'Chonnie-On-Chon', a novelty song 'That Dood It', and an intense blues 'Why Does Everything Happen To Me'. Collectors who want to hear these and more should look out for Brown's first two LP's. Please, Please, Please (King 610, reissued 909) and Try Me/The Unbeatable JB (King 635, reissued 919), released here on London HA8231 and HA 8203 respectively. Long deleted, they still occasionally turn up in discount stores and oldies lists.\n\n(B) I Got The Money (June 1959 \u2013 Oct. 1963)\n\nIn the strength of his first national hit ('Try Me'), Brown was signed by a major booking agency, assembled a permanent road band, and began recording highly original, exciting hits. With each success he increased the size of his band and stage-show; by 1962 he'd become America's foremost R&B star. The following year he was awarded million dollar sales for Live At The Apollo, gained his first pop Top 20 entry ('Prisoner Of Love'), and prepared to divorce himself from King.\n\nWith a well-rehearsed tight little band punching in and around his unorthodox phrasing, each new record took him further away from his contemporaries and closer to a realistic expression of his own emotions. Unexpected changes of tempo; sudden stops between verses, or even within verses; and a three-sided interplay between Brown, the band, and the Famous Flames, were used on both the fast numbers \u2013 the foundation of his intricate dance routines \u2013 and the pleading love songs which he extended into hysterical sermons.\nSoul Classics includes a few of the best known uptempo tracks (although they've missed the finest of the lot, 'I Got Money'), but all the great wailers are omitted, including 'You've Got The Power', 'The Bells', 'I Don't Mind', 'Baby You're Right', 'Like A Baby', and the superb 'Lost Someone'. Hopefully, future volumes will do something about this. In the meantime Polydor are going one better by reissuing Live At The Apollo. A historic recording by anybody's standards, it captures the young emergent Brown at the precise moment of fruition, when all of his energy and ideas gelled in one cataclysmic performance. Never known to be self-effacing, Brown refers to it simply as \"a masterpiece\". I'm inclined to agree. BUY IT.\n\n(C) Brand New Bag (Jan. 1964 \u2013 Jan. 1967).\n\nThe triumphant expression of independent success. From now on Brown is solely responsible for his own recordings and cuts sides all over America, wherever he happens to be at the moment of inspiration. Results are erratic, not only artistically but technically (for instance, 'Money Won't Change You', cut at the Talent-Master studios in New York, is so badly mixed it's liable to shatter your stylus. Live At The Garden, recorded six months later in New Jersey, is even worse. It should never have been issued). But the best are by far the most unique recordings ever made by a \"rhythm & blues\" singer. Aided by his bandleader Nat Jones, Brown begins to break down traditional forms of song construction. Hits like 'Out Of Sight' (cut in Chicago), 'Papa's got a Brand New Bag (Charlotte, North Carolina), and 'I Got You' (Miami) introduce new concepts in rhythmic progression which owe nothing to King Records or indeed anyone else except Brown and his alter ego, the band.\n\nThis was JB's peak period of white acceptance; the years in which he scored his biggest \"pop\" hits. Although this was partly due to the compulsive attraction of his new style for dancers, it was as much a mood of the times, for this was during the first \"R&B boom\" when all black entertainers were suddenly the in thing. Being the most flamboyant, Brown got the lion's share of attention \u2013 until it was realised just how disturbing he really was. His most widely acclaimed hit from this time, 'It's A Man's, Man's Man's World' had little to do with the overall development of his music, being an intensely performed ballad, written by someone else and recorded with a large orchestra.\n\n(D) It's A New Day (May 1967 \u2013 Nov. 1969)\n\nAlfred Ellis takes over from Jones to help Brown complete his rejection of conventional music. The hits become loose two-part improvisations over which Brown is virtually scat singing. White audiences get confused and begin to lose interest, but his impact on black music is immense and can be heard today in a wide range of derivations, from street funk bands to calmer recordings like Ben E. King's 'Supernatural Thing'. At the same time, many of his lyrics reflect his involvement in social programmes and political manoeuvring.\n\nIn many ways this was Brown's peak. His music had become so individualistic that it defied categorization; personally he radiated the charisma of a crusading politician; he was expanding his small autonomous corporation to include various other business ventures; and there was seemingly nothing on the horizon to threaten him. In fact his conflicting, and often na\u00efve, political assertions started to backfire; some of his projects (a night club and a chain of restaurants) soon collapsed, and younger black musicians (Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone) were already making waves that would rock his boat.\n\nAlthough Soul Classics includes most of the essential tracks from the period, they destroy much of the evidence of his creativity by using Part One's only. A great many extended records, including some of Brown's, are indeed totally unnecessary \u2013 often just an easy alternative to finding a flip side. However, performances like \u2018Cold Sweat\u2019, \u2018Mother Popcorn\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s A New Day\u2019 have got to be heard in toto to be fully appreciated. You wouldn\u2019t expect to find the first couple of minutes of \u2018Sad Eyed Lady\u2019 on a Best Of Dylan album would you? Well Brown shouldn\u2019t have suffered similar treatment here. I realise that time is at a premium on a multi-track compilation; nevertheless, these were arguably some of the most important and influential black records of the '60s, and it\u2019s a pity Polydor haven\u2019t shown than appropriate respect.\n\n(E) Superbad (April 1970 - May 1971)\n\nA short but vital period when Brown employed younger black musicians to recover from political ambiguity and the sudden loss of the band that had supported him through the sixties. (They left to try for a solo career as Maceo & All The King\u2019s Men). In just over a year he recorded some of his finest sides \u2013 all dynamic Afro-rhythmic hits that reaffirmed his commitment to black roots and enhanced his, by then, legendary reputation.\n\nThe driving force behind this rejuvenation were the two Collins brothers (Phelps \"Cat Fish\" \u2013 gtr, William \" Bootsy\" \u2013 bass) who were groomed by Brown as part of the New Dapps, transferred to the major league in his own JB\u2019s, and then left to form their own group the House Guests before doing a stint with Funkadelic. Although they only appeared on about half a dozen sides, their fresh approach left its mark on many of Brown\u2019s subsequent recordings.\n\n(F) Make It Funky (July 1971 \u2013 present day)\n\nWith many new bands building successful careers on the styles that Brown introduced in the '60s, he adopts his \u2018Godfather\u2019 image. But although, as a personality, he has become something of a grand old man of black music, he has so far refused to abandon young black audiences and continues to aim his records at that market. Obviously aware that he is no longer ahead of the field, his music has become erratic again in search for a new direction. At his best he is still unapproachable: often he is just an imitation of younger musicians.\n\nPart of the trouble is that Brown got bored. After a decade and a half of challenge during which, step by determined step, he achieved more or less everything he could have hoped for, he had nothing left to fight \u2013 so his music reflected dulled emotions. Finding that he could still sell records without any greater effort he started playing games, including calling a nondescript flipside 'Parts 15 & 16' and issuing two versions of the same song as consecutive singles.\n\nAlso, modern techniques in recording have done nothing for the man whose greatest performances have stemmed from \"live-in-studio\" sessions with his own band. Increasing use of pre-recorded backing tracks, multi-overdubs, and various electronic gadgets have proved a poor substitute for spontaneous creativity.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t believe that Brown is about to fade gracefully away. Now that his box-office receipts are down, record sales are becoming unpredictable, and other bands are carrying on where he left off, he has something to prove again.

want to know?\nI want to know, what's the matter with you, baby?\nYou know that you done me wrong\nSorry, didn't mean no harm\nOh baby, let me take you out tonight\nMake every little thing all right\nYou know you told me there would never be another\nAnd you know you lied\nWhen you lied, you hurt me, baby\nWhen I left and I went away\nI didn't know how much I loved you until today\nOh baby, leaving me wasn't right\nAnd now you want to take me out tonight\nMary, won't you let me get on your good side?\nIf I did that, Marvin, it would hurt my pride\nHey, let me make it up to you if I can\nI can't do it, don't you understand?\nWhat's the matter with you, baby, what's the matter?\nI told you that you done me wrong\nWell, can you forgive me, Mary, please forgive me?\nI'll try, but it'll take some time\nHurry up, hurry up, before I lose my mind\nI've got a feeling everything is going to work all right\nBut you can't take me out tonight\n[Chorus]\nWhoa, whoa, whoaYou might also

please let me off this bus\"\n\n[Chorus]\nNadine, honey, is that you?\nOh, Nadine, honey, is that you?\nSeems like every time I see you, darling, you got something else to do\n[Verse 2]\nI saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back\nAnd started walkin toward a coffee colored Cadillac\nI was pushin through the crowd to get to where she's at\nAnd I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat\n\n[Chorus]\nNadine, honey, is that you?\nOh, Nadine, honey, where are you?\nSeems like every time I catch up with you, you're up to something new\n\n[Verse 3]\nDowntown searching for her, looking all around\nSaw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown\nI caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab\nWith a twenty-dollar bill and told him, \"Catch that yellow cab\"\n\n[Chorus]\nNadine, honey, is that you?\nOh, Nadine, honey, is that you?\nSeems like every time I catch up with you, you're up to something new\n\n[Verse 4]\nShe moves around like a wayward summer breeze\n\"Go, driver, go, go, catch her, pretty please\"\nMoving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier\nLeaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear\nYou might also

lie\n\nYou don't have to cry when you kiss her goodbye\nYou can find someone else if you give it a try\nSomebody else with a heart so true\nThat she'll never, never, never stop loving you\nBe grateful she's gone, no more to lead you on\nOnly fools want to try living a li-i-i-ie\n\nI know that you're sad but it's not so bad\nWhen you think of the heartaches you might've had\nShe's only a flirt with a rovin' eye\nLet her go, don't you know you're a lucky guy?\n\nThis first love may die but you've still got time, give it one more try\nAnd that's better than living a lie\nAnd that's better than

late) she has (too late)\n(Spoken):\nI just guess that you're wonderin' why I always sing a sad song\nBut you see, I had a woman who was very good to me\n& I can remember the times she used to sit down & tell me these words:\nSaid, 'Pickett, I want you to know I love you from the bottom of my heart\n& whatever you need, I don't want you to go to your mother, your father, your sister or your brother\nI'll be a leadin' pull when you're fallin' down\nWhen all your money's gone, I want you to know you can count on me'\nBut I didn't appreciate that woman then\nYou know what? I had to run & chase after every little girl around town\nSo finally one day I got home & I found my little girl gone\n& people, you know it hurt me so bad (ha ha) I had to hang my little head & cry\nThen I began to read the letter she left for me layin' there; it read like this, children\n\nIt's too late, she's gone, oh (she's gone)\n'It's too late I'm gone away' (she's gone)\nAh yeah (too late) don't you know it, children (too late)\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nSay it one more time (too late) listen (too late)\nI wanna hear you understand what I'm talkin' about (too late)\n... &

love\nHe's up and he's gone\nThere's no breakfast for him\nCause he lives on the love of his sweet little gem\nThe days not through, though it's not very long\nBefore he must talk to his girl on the phone\nThat's how it is when a boy falls in love\nHis girl's voice on the phone brings him wondrous delight\nWhen a boy is in love\nIf there's been any darkness, it all fades from sight\nWhen a boys in love\nHe can hardly wait til the moment they meet\nFor he knows when he sees her his day will be complete\nWhen they're finally alone and he kisses her lips\nThe world sings a love song and his heart turns a flip\nThat's how it is when a boy falls in love\n\nAt the end of the day the time comes they must part\nThe strings of regret tear away at his heart\nAnd late in the night as he sleeps on his bed\nVisions of her sweet song, how they dance in his head\nAnd before you know he is buying a ring\nTo capture forever that sweet darling thing\nThat's how it is when a boy falls in
