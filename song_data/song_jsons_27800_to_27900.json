Mizzy just came on the news\nI'm thinkin', \"Damn, he back in trouble again\"\nMade me a mil' 'cause I can\nI know who I am, and I give thanks to the man\nThe tiger just jumped out the can\nThat's my lil' man, right back gettin' action again\nThat young nigga shit, we still on it\nMy dawg goin' through it, I feel for him\nShe told me she love me, I fell for it\nGot real niggas sittin' in jail for it\nBuy the pack, I'ma put it in the mail for it\nOn the hunt for the money, I smell for it\nI went big dawg on them, this Tom Ford\nThat lil' boy shit I ain't goin' for it\nGettin' money every day I wake up\nDon't ask me, \"Did me and lil' shawty break up?\"\nThem M's comin' in, let 'em stack up\nDon't ride my wave, dawg, back up\nI ain't never had shit, I gotta act up\nDon't come too close, my dawgs wan' buck\nI don't need no help, I don't ask for much\nIf I ever go broke, we maskin' up\n[Chorus: Lil Baby]\nRan the money up, way up\nLife ain't sweet, ain't no lay-up\nDrip for sale, they gotta pay us\nI stayed down and I came up\nStayed the same and they changed up\nI knew they was gon' change up\nMoney never gon' change us\nI just be in my lane stuck\n\n[Verse 2: Gunna]\nI parked the Bentley inside the garage\nI don't know how much hate I can dodge\nI can get you knocked off with a nod\n4 Pockets Full, everyone got a knot\nI say this shit from the heart\nI knew you weren't real, you weren't there from the start\nAnything good in my way came from God\nGo get on stage and I get an applause\nDamn Young Gunna done growed up\nBack to back the coupes, they know it's us\nMy bro took a loss and I picked him up\nWe stick together, they ain't rich as us\nI wanna sit down, she ain't lit enough\nEvery time I count cash, swear I get a rush\nMy money long as the yellow bus\nIt ain't no secret, I'm livin' plush\nYou might also like[Chorus: Lil Baby]\nRan the money up, way up\nLife ain't sweet, ain't no lay-up\n(Cook that shit up, Quay!)\nDrip for sale, they gotta pay us\nI stayed

is coming soon, I\u2019ma miss it\nThe sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker\nWe hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma\nHigh above the ground but I'm under her charisma\nHer sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system\nThe quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin\u2019\nMy astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick\nPlanet of the aches, and she is my prescription\nWe out of this world, baby, we have been evicted\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]\nIntergalactical love\nThe sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love\nAnd I'll

earliest convenience\nBut fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers\nI'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers\nGirl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color\nAnd some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder\nThe crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble\nReal shit, nigga, my candle still lit\nHad to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint\nBig up to my nigga with a strap on 'em\nI never turn my back on \u2019em\n\u2019Cause nigga act like they cool with ya\nBut a lot of these niggas be transformers\nA lot of these players be bench-warmers\nThe game ain't easy, but it\u2019s fair, nigga\nI'mma sit in this throne so long\n'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga\nBad bitch play with my hair, nigga\nSaid, \"Relax, Tune, baby

psychic\n'Cause you said there be days like this\nThey want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices\nPlease swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers\nReal shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip\nIt'll be on in a heartbeat\nYou can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip\nI fear God, never fear men\nGive back, never give in\nBeat odds, never beat women\nKeep an open mind, let 'em peek in it\nReach highs, never reach limits\nNeed minds, I don't need plenty\nThis C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz\nWhen I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight\nI almost asked her to creep with me\nBut I was young, and I held my tongue\nBut with that tongue, I just keep spitting\nSo it all worked out\n[Interlude 2: Lil Wayne & Sampha]\nAnd now I'm in this bitch\nAnd life said, \"Tune, you knew me for way too long\"\nI never change, you know I been this bitch\nAnd then she said, \"Let it all work out\"\n\"Let it all work out, let it all work out\" (Yeah)\n\"Let it all work out, let it all work

letter you ain't finished writin'\nIt read, \"I'm sorry for even apologizing\"\nI tried, compromising and went kamikaze\nI found my momma's pistol where she always hide it\nI cry, put it to my head and thought about it\nNobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie\nHung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered\nToo much was on my conscience to be smart about it\nToo torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding\nI shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me\nIt's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying\nGod came to my side and we talked about it\nHe sold me another life and he made a prophet\n\n[Outro: Lil Wayne & Sampha & Jacida Carter]\nYeah, and he said\n\"Let it all work out\" (Yeah)\n\"Let it all work out\"\n(I'm still in this bitch)\n\"Let it all work out\"\n(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)\n\"Let it all work out\"\nLet it all work out (Phew)\n\"Let it all work out\"\n(But he said, \"Remember this:\")\n\"Let it all work out\"\n\"Let

here\n'Cause love don't live here\nBut I'm here, and she here\nShe tell me stay all night\nShe just want a refill\nAnd then she want to start fights\n'Bout \"What about how she feel?\"\nShe tell me I'm a cheap thrill\nI know she don't mean that\nShe think I feed her lies\nBut I don't get no feedback\nAs she watch me pack\n\"Baby where my keys at?\"\nKiss her on the forehead and tell her that

the morn'\nAnd she upset and I'm calm\nAnd when a woman is scorned\nIs when your welcome is worn\nAnd now her temperature's showin'\nAnd I just weather her storm\nAnd she expect me to stay\nI be like,

yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nIt's 2002, everything was totally new\nWe were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof\nWe wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included\nA multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse\nWe were so bulletproof\u2014wrote, souped, and soaked in our youth\nThought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe\nThe death of Doody broke us in two\nWe were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do\nAnd at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too\nSo I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through\nEveryone tried to go solo, really nobody blew\nI was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew\nThe plan was put everyone in position so that they knew\nHow to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds\nI just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth\n'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group\nShoot!\n[Pre-Chorus: Mario Resto, Eminem & Both]\nIf I could leave this all behind\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\nDown to the river with you\nHelp me leave this all behind\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nIt was never the same, and it's bothered me since\nAnd the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets\nThe more time goes by, the more life happens\nAnd we gotta be men, we got responsibilities\nPlus we don't say how we feel\nAnd I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in\nBeen with you guys thick and thin\nBut it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends\nWhich reminded me, Biz, \"Rockstar\" was the shit\nY'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit\nIf you'da put D12 on it, wish I coulda did\nPorter tried talkin' you into comin' up off it\nI know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is\nI think of all of the trips to BET\nAnd the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with\nMaybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features\nBut that's water under the bridge\nBut I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Mario Resto, Eminem & Both]\nIf I could leave this all behind\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\nDown to the river with you\nHelp me leave this all behind\n\n[Chorus]\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nBacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end\nOne minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits\nYou can already sense the climate is startin' to shift\nTo these kids you no longer exist\nWent from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch\nTo tiny drops, little drips\nAnd by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed\nYou start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed\nAll the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get\nFor turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva, and Swift?\nA Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished\nI ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment\nBut it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none\nI just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this\nTo my partners, I can't say how sorry I am\nThis is not how I planned for our story to end\nI love all of you men\nBut I just can't be the guy everybody depends\nOn for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair\nI will always be here, but that spark isn't there\nAnd I don't know how to recapture that time and that era\nI've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air\nI'm barely chartin' myself\nFeels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent\nTo treat y'all like a stepping stone\nThough I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road\nDone all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up\nBut the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live\nThe less is left for closure, so let's let this go\nIt's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nI never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones\nI never meant to use you all for my stepping stones159Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 12, "api_path": "/songs/3930560", "artist_names": "Eminem &

finally attain your dreams?\nOn the come up, where they run up from the world of many fiends\nI been at it since a teen, get this money, get the cream\nHard work and sacrifice but not a lot know what I mean\nMost these rappers ain't got no class like bomb threats\nAnd bein' ill is a disease, it's the onset\nAnd it don't matter where you at, if you white or if you black\nIf you rich or you poor, we gon' always want more\nBut one thing I can be sure, as long as I got the floor\nI'ma use this power to paint a picture of unity\nAnd yeah I'm rippin' it up with that energy like it's two of me\nFuck

on a big wheel\nMy enemy lives in his mother's basement\nThat's why my videos don't got no Baphomet product placement\nI'm a real one\nThe honey is sweet, the apple's bitter\nThey'll try to convince you you stronger without your woman than when you with her\nAnd tell you they kidding while Twitter trashing your litter\nI know the devil's a liar\nI know that players is quitters, I heard you hire your hitters\nI know the higher the bidder, that mean the less on return\nSo I just hire a sitter\nI'm not no boss nigga, I'm a soldier\nKingdom builder, man somebody shoulda told ya\nFuck

Lyrics[Intro]\nHere we go\nYeah\n\n[Verse]\nYesterday morning was crazy\nI had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe\nThat shit is in stone, sealed and signed\nShe not my lover like \"Billie Jean\", but the kid is mine\nSandi used to tell me all it takes is one time, and all it took was one time\nShit, we only met two times, two times\nAnd both times were nothin' like the new times\nNow it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines\nJust tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes\nIt's breakin' my spirit\nSingle father, I hate when I hear it\nI used to challenge my parents on every album\nNow I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent\nAlways promised the family unit\nI wanted it to be different because I've been through it\nBut this is the harsh truth now\nAnd fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now\nI don't want you worry 'bout whose house\nYou live at, or who loves you more or who's not there\nWho did what to who 'fore you got here\nNah, look, I'm too proud to let that come between me and you now\nRealize I gotta think for two now\nI gotta make it, I better make it\nI promise if I'm not dead, then I'm dedicated\nThis the first positive DNA we ever celebrated\nI can't forget the looks on they faces\nGot the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'\nTell Gelo bring some Mod Ros\u00e9 and the Baccarats out\nFor our cheers to the next generation\nBut this Champagne toast is short-lived\nI got an empty crib in my empty crib\nI only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick\nI think he must've brought you like twenty gifts\nYour mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit\nBut man, you know\nI still had to get it for my boy though, you know\nYou haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip\nHe probably could'a did stand-up\nYeah, but at the same time, he's a stand up\nAnd that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up\nOctober baby for irony's sake, of course\nI got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours\nAnd believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more\nSorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground\nThey said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town\nHopefully by the time you hear this\nMe and your mother will have come around\nInstead of always cuttin' each other down\nGod willin', I got a good feelin'\nYou got a good spirit\nWe'll talk more when you hear this, my G\n[Outro]\nI'm changing from boy to a man\nNo one to guide me, I'm all alone\nNo one to cry on\nI need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain\nOf changing from boy to a man\nNo one to guide me, I'm all alone\nNo one to cry on\nI need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain\nOf changing from boy to a man\nI'm all alone\nNo one to cry on\nI need

this far from the shore\nWe might not ever go back anymore\nGot you all in your emotions, hit you with the force then\nTell me your desires, I won't ever tire\nYou'd rather play the game than to throw the fight\nBoy you know that ain't right\nWhen I\u2019m needing your affection, I need that attention\nUp and down motion, come swim in my ocean, yeah yeah\n\n[Chorus: Beyonc\u00e9 & JAY-Z]\nLet's

hide in the hills\nWe watched the sky turn peach\nSummer's light like, summer's night\nIt's like, Christ masterpiece\nShe taste like Corona Light, sweet\nEven the lime gotta squeeze\nShe gave me a lil' swig, to chase behind my weed\nIf I can stay in her hair forever, that'd be fine by me\nI don't have no concept of time\nEven with a rose gold Concept on me\nI remember summer nights in the projects\nBullet rounds interrupting my Chi\nWhen the worst thing that could happen\nZipped up his jacket and ran back down the street\nIn Bel-Air, only the nights get cold\nI wrapped a yellow jacket 'round Bey\nIt's not lost on me, music has my kids sound asleep\nYou might also like[Chorus: Beyonc\u00e9 & JAY-Z]\nOh, let's make love in the summertime, yeah\nOn the sands, beach sands, make

wait\nWhat the fuck you expect\nWhen a nigga got a cape and he's great?\nOven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste\nThe love just accentuates the hate\nThis is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight\nJust add water, stir it like a shake\nPlay amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith\nGet the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race\n[Refrain]\nThese are the games we play, we are the names they say\nThis is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes\n\n[Verse 2]\nTo all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae\nThis is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days\nAnd baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches\nThey try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches\nStood on every couch, in the A at the black party\nNo jewelry on, but you richer than everybody\nYou laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder\nAnd we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours\nWe can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold\nMy numbers lookin' like a bank code\n\n[Refrain]\nThese are the games we play, we are the names they say\nThis is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes\n\n[Verse 3]\nAin't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'\nThe draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'\nWith Ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options\nCaviar facials remove the toxins\nThis ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters\nWho grew up on legends from outta Yonkers\nInfluenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies\nI'm two-point-two incentivised\nIf you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money\nOr been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy\nThis ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya\nWho said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers\nThe only kingpin who ain't sinkin'\nChess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin\nStay woke, nigga, or get out\nStill pull them whips out, still spread the chips out\nMight buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out\nThe message in this music, all my niggas had to live out\nSee Pusha T LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also like[Refrain]\nThese are the games we play, we are the names they

track\nI turned the preacher daughter bad, I think I'm a devil\nThese niggas know what up, know I'm 'bout whateva\nI'm in the streets, I keep that heat, you know that I be steppin'\n\n[Verse 1]\nI miss the Nawf just like my granny, my heart in them trenches\nYo' girl gon' cheat on you for nothing, so I'm done with these bitches\nI think about it every minute, ain't stoppin' my mission\nOn my payroll I got hittas, I pay 'em commision\nInterrogated by detectives, won't tell 'em I did it\nI told Montana that I love him, on Dave I meant it\nPut twenty thousand on his head, they catch him, I send it\nGet on my knee on side the bed like \"Father, forgive me\"\nWas sellin' weed, fucked up my profit, I ain't make a dolla\nThe fame gettin' to my niggas, I cut off my partners\nBefore I call on you, I put my trust up in this choppa\nMovin' like he can't get touched real quick, I bet I stop 'em\nNigga ain't give me shit but hand out like I owe him something\nI don't give a fuck, if we step together, I'll show you something\nBitches think they slick, they all deceive so I'll never love 'em\nBre was my first love but she changed so I'll never trust her\n[Bridge]\nThis the files of a nigga who ain't neva bleed\nThis the story of a child who was in them streets\nWhy the fuck I'm taking care of them? They ain't do shit for me\nWhy the fuck I'm showing you so much love?\nAnd bitch you leaving me\n\n[Verse 2]\nKeandre dead, the only thing I think about is Tyler\nI'm full of pain but wake up every morning and I'm smilin'\nThey think I'm dumb, you got me fucked up, I got plenty knowledge\nThey don't give a fuck 'bout how I feel, they don't know my problems\nJust 'cause you around me, I ain't forget 'bout everything you said\nI let some shots off in the air for my niggas dead\nDo anything in the world for you, I'm livin' red\nShowin' love to them niggas, they might bust my head\nMad 'bout a gun, but for a fact bitch I won't do you nothin'\nMad that I'm up but you remember, you ain't give me nothing\nI ain't give up on my mission, fuck you mean bitch? I was steady hustlin'\nHandin' all you niggas money bitch, and I was steady strugglin'\nMontana know about my pain and everything I told him\nI told him watch what he was saying, but shit I had to fold him\nUp in that cell, bitch I was cryin' with no one to hold me\nYoungBoy a soldier, I remember what my grampa told me\n\n[Chorus]\nBatty boy if you cross, I'ma take your life\nI'm full of drugs so I'ma die if I get caught tonight\nTell my lil' brother and my sons it's gon' be alright\nNBA until the end, it's a way of life\nYoung nigga fillin' up his arm with some heroin\nHe was abandoned as a child screamin', \"Red rum\"\nYou spell it backwards, what that mean? Nigga, murder\nLivin' wrong and right, trustin' nobody 'til his time come\nYo' ex just exposed you, now you mad like I was neva here\nWhere I come from I gotta keep this bitch up on my hip\nMomma forgive me for all them times I use to trip\nKnow it's a purpose in this world why I need to live\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nIt ain't too long\nY'all don't give a fuck 'bout me, bitch\nI did something for all y'all, y'all got me fucked up\nOff the flap I ain't gotta smile in nobody face\nY'all tell me 'bout all y'all problems, y'all don't ask how I'm feelin' huh?\nBitch I been feelin' like I'm finna die, bitch I cry alone\nThis for all, this for all them young niggas who gone\nAnd all the people who miss they babies, you heard me?\nFuck everybody who ain't mine, y'all ain't making my life no betta, gang\n\n[Chorus]\nYoung nigga fillin' up his arm with some heroin\nHe was abandoned as a child screamin', \"Red rum\"\nYou spell it backwards, what that mean?
