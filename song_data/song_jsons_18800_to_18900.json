Lemme get your coat\nScott throws Knives' coat on the floor. Knives waves\n\nKNIVES CHAU\nHi, sorry, what was your name?\n\nKIM PINE\nKim\n\nKNIVES CHAU\nYou play the drums?\nREVEAL Kim sitting behind the drumset, sticks in her hands\n\nKIM PINE\n...yes\n\nKNIVES CHAU\nThat is so awesome\n\nSCOTT\nKnives, that's Young Neil\n\nKNIVES CHAU\nHi.

WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 9\n\nScott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He\nTurns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal\n\n\"WALLACE WELLS, ROOMMATE, 24 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: HE IS GAY!\"\n\nSCOTT\nBefore you hear some dirty lies\nFrom someone else, yes, I'm dating\nA 17 year old\nWallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading\n\nWALLACE\nIs he cute?\n\nSCOTT\nHa, ha, ha, ha\n\nWALLACE\nDoes this mean we have to stop\nSleeping together?\n\nSCOTT\nDo you see another bed in here?\nTINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the\nOne room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included\n\nWALLACE\nYeah. You're totally my bitch forever\n\nSCOTT\nSo. The whole seventeen year old\nThing. Don't tell too many people\n\nWALLACE\nHey, you know me\n\n\n\nSCOTT\nI mean. Don't tell my sister\n\nWALLACE\nYou know me\nWallace tosses the NOW magazine aside, starts texting\n\nSCOTT\nWho are you texting?\nRINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up\n\nSTACEY (O.S.)\nSeventeen years old? Scandal!\nIntercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on\nHer cellphone in THE SECOND CUP. A sign behind her reads '\u0153If\nYou are using your cellphone, you will not be served'\u009d\n\n\"STACEY PILGRIM, YOUNGER SISTER, 19, RATING: 'T' FOR TEEN.\"\n\nSCOTT\nThat's not true.

Scott sinks into an armchair\n\nSTACEY\nWho is this mysterious child you date?\n\nSCOTT\nHer name is Knives. Knives Chau\n\nSTACEY\nA seventeen year old Chinese\nSchoolgirl? You're ridiculous\n\nSCOTT\nIt's a Catholic school too\n\nSTACEY\nWith the uniform and everything?\n\n\n\nSCOTT\nYeah, the whole deal\n\nSTACEY\nOh my God, you haven't-\n\nSCOTT\nNo no no. We haven't even held\nHands. I think she hugged me once\n\nSTACEY\nUm, Scott. Why are you doing this?\n\nSCOTT\nI don't know...it's just nice, you\nKnow? It's just...simple\n\nSTACEY\nIt's been over a year since you got\nDumped by she-who-will-not-be-named\nScott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine\nLooking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad\n\nSTACEY (CONT'D)\nSo, are you legitimately moving on\nOr is this just you being insane?\nScott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next\nTo a hot redhead in happier times\n\nSCOTT\nCan I get back to you on that?\nA SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly...\n\n10 EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - DAY 10\n\nWallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL\nUniformed boys and girls pour out\n\nWALLACE\nI do not want to be here. At all\n\nSCOTT\nThis school has boys too\n\nWALLACE\nI hate you. Even I would think twice\nAbout dating a seventeen year old\n\nSCOTT\nWell, she's only allowed out when\nThe sun is up, so I wouldn't call\nIt dating, more like...\n\n\nWALLACE\nPlaytime?\n\nSCOTT\nThat doesn't sound so good either\n\n\n\nKNIVES CHAU (O.S.)\nScott! Heyyyy!\nKnives skips to Scott. Her shy friend TAMARA lingers behind\n\nSCOTT\nHey Knives, this is my cool gay\nRoommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay\n\nKNIVES CHAU\nOh, hi! Do you want to know who in\nMy class is gay?\n\nWALLACE\nYes. Does he wear glasses?\n\nSCOTT\nWallace, you go now! Begone!\nWallace pulls Knives close. Whispers\n\nWALLACE\nYou're too good for him. Run\n\n11 INT. THE ARCADE - DAY 11\n\nScott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION (think a martial\nArts version of DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION)\nThey punch and kick in unison, side by side\nSCOTT\nDid you know the original name of Pac-\nMan was Puck-man? You would think it's\nBecause Pac-Man looks like a yellow\nHockey puck, but actually it comes\nFrom the Japanese phrase paku-paku\nWhich means to flap ones mouth open\nAnd closed. They changed it over here\nBecause Puck-Man is too easy to\nVandalize.

Nothing\nCould beat Matthew's mystical\nPowers. Nothing but pre-teen\nCapriciousness. We only kissed\nOnce.

It hits Patel square in the\nEyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish\n\nMATTHEW PATEL\nThis is impossible, how can it be?!\nScott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time\nTo see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face\n\nSCOTT\nOpen your eyes. Maybe you'll see\nK.O! Scott punches Patel. He explodes into COINS.

Things They Carried LyricsFirst Lieutenant Jimmy Cross carried letters from a girl named Martha, a junior at Mount Sebastian College in New Jersey. They were not love letters, but Lieutenant Cross was hoping, so he kept them folded in plastic at the bottom of his rucksack. In the late afternoon, after a day's march, he would dig his foxhole, wash his hands under a canteen, unwrap the letters, hold them with the tips of his fingers, and spend the last hour of light pretending. He would imagine romantic camping trips into the White Mountains in New Hampshire. He would sometimes taste the envelope flaps, knowing her tongue had been there. More than anything, he wanted Martha to love him as he loved her, but the letters were mostly chatty, elusive on the matter of love. She was a virgin, he was almost sure. She was an English major at Mount Sebastian, and she wrote beautifully about her professors and roommates and midterm exams, about her respect for Chaucer and her great affection for Virginia Woolf. She often quoted lines of poetry; she never mentioned the war, except to say, Jimmy, take care of yourself. The letters weighed 10 ounces. They were signed Love, Martha, but Lieutenant Cross understood that Love was only a way of signing and did not mean what he sometimes pretended it meant. At dusk, he would carefully return the letters to his rucksack. Slowly, a bit distracted, he would get up and move among his men, checking the perimeter, then at full dark he would return to his hole and watch the night and wonder if Martha was a virgin.\nThe things they carried were largely determined by necessity. Among the necessities or near-necessities were P-38 can openers, pocket knives, heat tabs, wristwatches, dog tags, mosquito repellent, chewing gum, candy, cigarettes, salt tablets, packets of Kool-Aid, lighters, matches, sewing kits, Military Payment Certificates, C rations, and two or three canteens of water. Together, these items weighed between 15 and 20 pounds, depending upon a man's habits or rate of metabolism. Henry Dobbins, who was a big man, carried extra rations; he was especially fond of canned peaches in heavy syrup over pound cake. Dave Jensen, who practiced field hygiene, carried a toothbrush, dental floss, and several hotel-sized bars of soap he'd stolen on R&R in Sydney, Australia. Ted Lavender, who was scared, carried tranquilizers until he was shot in the head outside the village of Than Khe in mid-April. By necessity, and because it was SOP, they all carried steel helmets that weighed 5 pounds including the liner and camouflage cover. They carried the standard fatigue jackets and trousers. Very few carried underwear. On their feet they carried jungle boots\u20142.1 pounds\u2014and Dave Jensen carried three pairs of socks and a can of Dr. Scholl's foot powder as a precaution against trench foot. Until he was shot, Ted Lavender carried 6 or 7 ounces of premium dope, which for him was a necessity. Mitchell Sanders, the RTO, carried condoms. Norman Bowker carried a diary. Rat Kiley carried comic books. Kiowa, a devout Baptist, carried an illustrated New Testament that had been presented to him by his father, who taught Sunday school in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. As a hedge against bad times, however, Kiowa also carried his grandmother's distrust of the white man, his grandfather's old hunting hatchet. Necessity dictated. Because the land was mined and booby-trapped, it was SOP for each man to carry a steel-centered, nylon-covered flak jacket, which weighed 6.7 pounds, but which on hot days seemed much heavier. Because you could die so quickly, each man carried at least one large compress bandage, usually in the helmet band for easy access. Because the nights were cold, and because the monsoons were wet, each carried a green plastic poncho that could be used as a raincoat or groundsheet or makeshift tent. With its quilted liner, the poncho weighed almost 2 pounds, but it was worth every ounce. In April, for instance, when Ted Lavender was shot, they used his poncho to wrap him up, then to carry him across the paddy, then to lift him into the chopper that took him away.\n\nThey were called legs or grunts.\n\nTo carry something was to hump it, as when Lieutenant Jimmy Cross humped his love for Martha up the hills and through the swamps. In its intransitive form, to hump meant to walk, or to march, but it implied burdens far beyond the intransitive.\n\nAlmost everyone humped photographs. In his wallet, Lieutenant Cross carried two photographs of Martha. The first was a Kodacolor snapshot signed Love, though he knew better. She stood against a brick wall. Her eyes were gray and neutral, her lips slightly open as she stared straight-on at the camera. At night, sometimes, Lieutenant Cross wondered who had taken the picture, because he knew she had boyfriends, because he loved her so much, and because he could see the shadow of the picture-taker spreading out against the brick wall. The second photograph had been clipped from the 1968 Mount Sebastian yearbook. It was an action shot\u2014women's volleyball\u2014and Martha was bent horizontal to the floor, reaching, the palms of her hands in sharp focus, the tongue taut, the expression frank and competitive. There was no visible sweat. She wore white gym shorts. Her legs, he thought, were almost certainly the legs of a virgin, dry and without hair, the left knee cocked and carrying her entire weight, which was just over 100 pounds. Lieutenant Cross remembered touching that left knee. A dark theater, he remembered, and the movie was Bonnie and Clyde, and Martha wore a tweed skirt, and during the final scene, when he touched her knee, she turned and looked at him in a sad, sober way that made him pull his hand back, but he would always remember the feel of the tweed skirt and the knee beneath it and the sound of the gunfire that killed Bonnie and Clyde, how embarrassing it was, how slow and oppressive. He remembered kissing her good night at the dorm door. Right then, he thought, he should've done something brave. He should've carried her up the stairs to her room and tied her to the bed and touched that left knee all night long. He should've risked it. Whenever he looked at the photographs, he thought of new things he should've done.\n\nWhat they carried was partly a function of rank, partly of field specialty.\nAs a first lieutenant and platoon leader, Jimmy Cross carried a compass, maps, code books, binoculars, and a .45-caliber pistol that weighed 2.9 pounds fully loaded. He carried a strobe light and the responsibility for the lives of his men.\n\nAs an RTO, Mitchell Sanders carried the PRC-25 radio, a killer, 26 pounds with its battery.\n\nAs a medic, Rat Kiley carried a canvas satchel filled with morphine and plasma and malaria tablets and surgical tape and comic books and all the things a medic must carry, including M&M's for especially bad wounds, for a total weight of nearly 20 pounds.\n\nAs a big man, therefore a machine gunner, Henry Dobbins carried the M-60, which weighed 23 pounds unloaded, but which was almost always loaded. In addition, Dobbins carried between 10 and 15 pounds of ammunition draped in belts across his chest and shoulders.\n\nAs PFCs or Spec 4s, most of them were common grunts and carried the standard M-16 gas-operated assault rifle. The weapon weighed 7.5 pounds unloaded, 8.2 pounds with its full 20-round magazine. Depending on numerous factors, such as topography and psychology, the riflemen carried anywhere from 12 to 20 magazines, usually in cloth bandoliers, adding on another 8.4 pounds at minimum, 14 pounds at maximum. When it was available, they also carried M-16 maintenance gear\u2014rods and steel brushes and swabs and tubes of LSA oil\u2014all of which weighed about a pound. Among the grunts, some carried the M-79 grenade launcher, 5.9 pounds unloaded, a reasonably light weapon except for the ammunition, which was heavy. A single round weighed 10 ounces. The typical load was 25 rounds. But Ted Lavender, who was scared, carried 34 rounds when he was shot and killed outside Than Khe, and he went down under an exceptional burden, more than 20 pounds of ammunition, plus the flak jacket and helmet and rations and water and toilet paper and tranquilizers and all the rest, plus the unweighed fear. He was dead weight. There was no twitching or flopping. Kiowa, who saw it happen, said it was like watching a rock fall, or a big sandbag or something\u2014just boom, then down\u2014not like the movies where the dead guy rolls around and does fancy spins and goes ass over teakettle\u2014not like that, Kiowa said, the poor bastard just flat-fuck fell. Boom. Down. Nothing else. It was a bright morning in mid-April. Lieutenant Cross felt the pain. He blamed himself. They stripped off Lavender's canteens and ammo, all the heavy things, and Rat Kiley said the obvious, the guy's dead, and Mitchell Sanders used his radio to report one U.S. KIA and to request a chopper. Then they wrapped Lavender in his poncho. They carried him out to a dry paddy, established security, and sat smoking the dead man's dope until the chopper came. Lieutenant Cross kept to himself. He pictured Martha's smooth young face, thinking he loved her more than anything, more than his men, and now Ted Lavender was dead because he loved her so much and could not stop thinking about her. When the dustoff arrived, they carried Lavender aboard. Afterward they burned Than Khe. They marched until dusk, then dug their holes, and that night Kiowa kept explaining how you had to be there, how fast it was, how the poor guy just dropped like so much concrete. Boom-down, he said. Like cement.\n\nIn addition to the three standard weapons\u2014the M-60, M-16, and M-79\u2014they carried whatever presented itself, or whatever seemed appropriate as a means of killing or staying alive. They carried catch-as-catch-can. At various times, in various situations, they carried M-14s and CAR-15s and Swedish Ks and grease guns and captured AK-47s and Chi-Coms and RPGs and Simonov carbines and black market Uzis and .38-caliber Smith & Wesson handguns and 66 mm LAWs and shotguns and silencers and blackjacks and bayonets and C-4 plastic explosives. Lee Strunk carried a slingshot; a weapon of last resort, he called it. Mitchell Sanders carried brass knuckles. Kiowa carried his grandfather's feathered hatchet. Every third or fourth man carried a Claymore antipersonnel mine\u20143.5 pounds with its firing device. They all carried fragmentation grenades\u201414 ounces each. They all carried at least one M-18 colored smoke grenade\u201424 ounces. Some carried CS or tear gas grenades. Some carried white phosphorus grenades. They carried all they could bear, and then some, including a silent awe for the terrible power of the things they carried.\n\nIn the first week of April, before Lavender died, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross received a good-luck charm from Martha. It was a simple pebble, an ounce at most. Smooth to the touch, it was a milky white color with flecks of orange and violet, oval-shaped, like a miniature egg. In the accompanying letter, Martha wrote that she had found the pebble on the Jersey shoreline, precisely where the land touched water at high tide, where things came together but also separated. It was this separate-but-together quality, she wrote, that had inspired her to pick up the pebble and to carry it in her breast pocket for several days, where it seemed weightless, and then to send it through the mail, by air, as a token of her truest feelings for him. Lieutenant Cross found this romantic. But he wondered what her truest feelings were, exactly, and what she meant by separate-but-together. He wondered how the tides and waves had come into play on that afternoon along the Jersey shoreline when Martha saw the pebble and bent down to rescue it from geology. He imagined bare feet. Martha was a poet, with the poet's sensibilities, and her feet would be brown and bare, the toenails unpainted, the eyes chilly and somber like the ocean in March, and though it was painful, he wondered who had been with her that afternoon. He imagined a pair of shadows moving along the strip of sand where things came together but also separated. It was phantom jealousy, he knew, but he couldn't help himself. He loved her so much. On the march, through the hot days of early April, he carried the pebble in his mouth, turning it with his tongue, tasting sea salt and moisture. His mind wandered. He had difficulty keeping his attention on the war. On occasion he would yell at his men to spread out the column, to keep their eyes open, but then he would slip away into daydreams, just pretending, walking barefoot along the Jersey shore, with Martha, carrying nothing. He would feel himself rising. Sun and waves and gentle winds, all love and lightness.\n\nWhat they carried varied by mission.\n\nWhen a mission took them to the mountains, they carried mosquito netting, machetes, canvas tarps, and extra bug juice.\n\nIf a mission seemed especially hazardous, or if it involved a place they knew to be bad, they carried everything they could. In certain heavily mined AOs, where the land was dense with Toe Poppers and Bouncing Betties, they took turns humping a 28-pound mine detector. With its headphones and big sensing plate, the equipment was a stress on the lower back and shoulders, awkward to handle, often useless because of the shrapnel in the earth, but they carried it anyway, partly for safety, partly for the illusion of safety.\n\nOn ambush, or other night missions, they carried peculiar little odds and ends. Kiowa always took along his New Testament and a pair of moccasins for silence. Dave Jensen carried night-sight vitamins high in carotene. Lee Strunk carried his slingshot; ammo, he claimed, would never be a problem. Rat Kiley carried brandy and M&M's candy. Until he was shot, Ted Lavender carried the starlight scope, which weighed 6.3 pounds with its aluminum carrying case. Henry Dobbins carried his girlfriend's pantyhose wrapped around his neck as a comforter. They all carried ghosts. When dark came, they would move out single file across the meadows and paddies to their ambush coordinates, where they would quietly set up the Claymores and lie down and spend the night waiting.\n\nOther missions were more complicated and required special equipment. In mid-April, it was their mission to search out and destroy the elaborate tunnel complexes in the Than Khe area south of Chu Lai. To blow the tunnels, they carried one-pound blocks of pentrite high explosives, four blocks to a man, 68 pounds in all. They carried wiring, detonators, and battery-powered clackers. Dave Jensen carried earplugs. Most often, before blowing the tunnels, they were ordered by higher command to search them, which was considered bad news, but by and large they just shrugged and carried out orders. Because he was a big man, Henry Dobbins was excused from tunnel duty. The others would draw numbers. Before Lavender died there were 17 men in the platoon, and whoever drew the number 17 would strip off his gear and crawl in headfirst with a flashlight and Lieutenant Cross's .45-caliber pistol. The rest of them would fan out as security. They would sit down or kneel, not facing the hole, listening to the ground beneath them, imagining cobwebs and ghosts, whatever was down there\u2014the tunnel walls squeezing in\u2014how the flashlight seemed impossibly heavy in the hand and how it was tunnel vision in the very strictest sense, compression in all ways, even time, and how you had to wiggle in\u2014ass and elbows\u2014a swallowed-up feeling\u2014and how you found yourself worrying about odd things: Will your flashlight go dead? Do rats carry rabies? If you screamed, how far would the sound carry? Would your buddies hear it? Would they have the courage to drag you out? In some respects, though not many, the waiting was worse than the tunnel itself. Imagination was a killer.\n\nOn April 16, when Lee Strunk drew the number 17, he laughed and muttered something and went down quickly. The morning was hot and very still. Not good, Kiowa said. He looked at the tunnel opening, then out across a dry paddy toward the village of Than Khe. Nothing moved. No clouds or birds or people. As they waited, the men smoked and drank Kool-Aid, not talking much, feeling sympathy for Lee Strunk but also feeling the luck of the draw. You win some, you lose some, said Mitchell Sanders, and sometimes you settle for a rain check. It was a tired line and no one laughed.\nHenry Dobbins ate a tropical chocolate bar. Ted Lavender popped a tranquilizer and went off to pee.\n\nAfter five minutes, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross moved to the tunnel, leaned down, and examined the darkness. Trouble, he thought\u2014a cave-in maybe. And then suddenly, without willing it, he was thinking about Martha. The stresses and fractures, the quick collapse, the two of them buried alive under all that weight. Dense, crushing love. Kneeling, watching the hole, he tried to concentrate on Lee Strunk and the war, all the dangers, but his love was too much for him, he felt paralyzed, he wanted to sleep inside her lungs and breathe her blood and be smothered. He wanted her to be a virgin and not a virgin, all at once. He wanted to know her. Intimate secrets: Why poetry? Why so sad? Why that grayness in her eyes? Why so alone? Not lonely, just alone\u2014riding her bike across campus or sitting off by herself in the cafeteria\u2014even dancing, she danced alone\u2014and it was the aloneness that filled him with love. He remembered telling her that one evening. How she nodded and looked away. And how, later, when he kissed her, she received the kiss without returning it, her eyes wide open, not afraid, not a virgin's eyes, just flat and uninvolved.\n\nLieutenant Cross gazed at the tunnel. But he was not there. He was buried with Martha under the white sand at the Jersey shore. They were pressed together, and the pebble in his mouth was her tongue. He was smiling. Vaguely, he was aware of how quiet the day was, the sullen paddies, yet he could not bring himself to worry about matters of security. He was beyond that. He was just a kid at war, in love. He was twenty-four years old. He couldn't help it.\n\nA few moments later Lee Strunk crawled out of the tunnel. He came up grinning, filthy but alive. Lieutenant Cross nodded and closed his eyes while the others clapped Strunk on the back and made jokes about rising from the dead.\n\nWorms, Rat Kiley said. Right out of the grave. Fuckin' zombie.\n\nThe men laughed. They all felt great relief.\n\nSpook city, said Mitchell Sanders.\n\nLee Strunk made a funny ghost sound, a kind of moaning, yet very happy, and right then, when Strunk made that high happy moaning sound, when he went Ahhooooo, right then Ted Lavender was shot in the head on his way back from peeing. He lay with his mouth open. The teeth were broken. There was a swollen black bruise under his left eye.\n\nThe cheekbone was gone. Oh shit, Rat Kiley said, the guy's dead. The guy's dead, he kept saying, which seemed profound\u2014the guy's dead. I mean really.\n\nThe things they carried were determined to some extent by superstition. Lieutenant Cross carried his good-luck pebble. Dave Jensen carried a rabbit's foot. Norman Bowker, otherwise a very gentle person, carried a thumb that had been presented to him as a gift by Mitchell Sanders. The thumb was dark brown, rubbery to the touch, and weighed 4 ounces at most. It had been cut from a VC corpse, a boy of fifteen or sixteen. They'd found him at the bottom of an irrigation ditch, badly burned, flies in his mouth and eyes. The boy wore black shorts and sandals. At the time of his death he had been carrying a pouch of rice, a rifle, and three magazines of ammunition.\n\nYou want my opinion, Mitchell Sanders said, there's a definite moral here.\n\nHe put his hand on the dead boy's wrist. He was quiet for a time, as if counting a pulse, then he patted the stomach, almost affectionately, and used Kiowa's hunting hatchet to remove the thumb.\n\nHenry Dobbins asked what the moral was.\nMoral?\n\nYou know. Moral.\n\nSanders wrapped the thumb in toilet paper and handed it across to Norman Bowker. There was no blood. Smiling, he kicked the boy's head, watched the flies scatter, and said, It's like with that old TV show\u2014Paladin. Have gun, will travel.\n\nHenry Dobbins thought about it.\n\nYeah, well, he finally said. I don't see no moral.\n\nThere it Is, man.\n\nFuck off.\n\nThey carried USO stationery and pencils and pens. They carried Sterno, safety pins, trip flares, signal flares, spools of wire, razor blades, chewing tobacco, liberated joss sticks and statuettes of the smiling Buddha, candles, grease pencils, The Stars and Stripes, fingernail clippers, Psy Ops leaflets, bush hats, bolos, and much more. Twice a week, when the resupply choppers came in, they carried hot chow in green mermite cans and large canvas bags filled with iced beer and soda pop. They carried plastic water containers, each with a 2-gallon capacity. Mitchell Sanders carried a set of starched tiger fatigues for special occasions. Henry Dobbins carried Black Flag insecticide. Dave Jensen carried empty sandbags that could be filled at night for added protection. Lee Strunk carried tanning lotion. Some things they carried in common. Taking turns, they carried the big PRC-77 scrambler radio, which weighed 30 pounds with its battery. They shared the weight of memory. They took up what others could no longer bear. Often, they carried each other, the wounded or weak. They carried infections. They carried chess sets, basketballs, Vietnamese-English dictionaries, insignia of rank, Bronze Stars and Purple Hearts, plastic cards imprinted with the Code of Conduct. They carried diseases, among them malaria and dysentery. They carried lice and ringworm and leeches and paddy algae and various rots and molds. They carried the land itself\u2014Vietnam, the place, the soil\u2014a powdery orange-red dust that covered their boots and fatigues and faces. They carried the sky. The whole atmosphere, they carried it, the humidity, the monsoons, the stink of fungus and decay, all of it, they carried gravity. They moved like mules. By daylight they took sniper fire, at night they were mortared, but it was not battle, it was just the endless march, village to village, without purpose, nothing won or lost. They marched for the sake of the march. They plodded along slowly, dumbly, leaning forward against the heat, unthinking, all blood and bone, simple grunts, soldiering with their legs, toiling up the hills and down into the paddies and across the rivers and up again and down, just humping, one step and then the next and then another, but no volition, no will, because it was automatic, it was anatomy, and the war was entirely a matter of posture and carriage, the hump was everything, a kind of inertia, a kind of emptiness, a dullness of desire and intellect and conscience and hope and human sensibility. Their principles were in their feet. Their calculations were biological. They had no sense of strategy or mission. They searched the villages without knowing what to look for, not caring, kicking over jars of rice, frisking children and old men, blowing tunnels, sometimes setting fires and sometimes not, then forming up and moving on to the next village, then other villages, where it would always be the same. They carried their own lives. The pressures were enormous. In the heat of early afternoon, they would remove their helmets and flak jackets, walking bare, which was dangerous but which helped ease the strain. They would often discard things along the route of march. Purely for comfort, they would throw away rations, blow their Claymores and grenades, no matter, because by nightfall the resupply choppers would arrive with more of the same, then a day or two later still more, fresh watermelons and crates of ammunition and sunglasses and woolen sweaters\u2014the resources were stunning\u2014sparklers for the Fourth of July, colored eggs for Easter\u2014it was the great American war chest\u2014the fruits of science, the smokestacks, the canneries, the arsenals at Hartford, the Minnesota forests, the machine shops, the vast fields of corn and wheat\u2014they carried like freight trains; they carried it on their backs and shoulders\u2014and for all the ambiguities of Vietnam, all the mysteries and unknowns, there was at least the single abiding certainty that they would never be at a loss for things to carry.\n\nAfter the chopper took Lavender away, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross led his men into the village of Than Khe. They burned everything. They shot chickens and dogs, they trashed the village well, they called in artillery and watched the wreckage, then they marched for several hours through the hot afternoon, and then at dusk, while Kiowa explained how Lavender died, Lieutenant Cross found himself trembling.\n\nHe tried not to cry. With his entrenching tool, which weighed 5 pounds, he began digging a hole in the earth.\n\nHe felt shame. He hated himself. He had loved Martha more than his men, and as a consequence Lavender was now dead, and this was something he would have to carry like a stone in his stomach for the rest of the war.\n\nAll he could do was dig. He used his entrenching tool like an ax, slashing, feeling both love and hate, and then later, when it was full dark, he sat at the bottom of his foxhole and wept. It went on for a long while. In part, he was grieving for Ted Lavender, but mostly it was for Martha, and for himself, because she belonged to another world, which was not quite real, and because she was a junior at Mount Sebastian College in New Jersey, a poet and a virgin and uninvolved, and because he realized she did not love him and never would.\n\nLike cement, Kiowa whispered in the dark. I swear to God\u2014boom, down. Not a word.\n\nI've heard this, said Norman Bowker.\n\nA pisser, you know? Still zipping himself up. Zapped while zipping.\n\nAll right, fine. That's enough.\n\nYeah, but you had to see it, the guy just\u2014\n\nI heard, man. Cement. So why not shut the fuck up?\n\nKiowa shook his head sadly and glanced over at the hole where Lieutenant Jimmy Cross sat watching the night. The air was thick and wet. A warm dense fog had settled over the paddies and there was the stillness that precedes rain.\n\nAfter a time Kiowa sighed.\n\nOne thing for sure, he said. The lieutenant's in some deep hurt. I mean that crying jag\u2014the way he was carrying on\u2014it wasn't fake or anything, it was real heavy-duty hurt. The man cares.\n\nSure, Norman Bowker said.\n\nSay what you want, the man does care.\n\nWe all got problems.\n\nNot Lavender.\n\nNo, I guess not, Bowker said. Do me a favor, though.\n\nShut up?\n\nThat's a smart Indian. Shut up.\n\nShrugging, Kiowa pulled off his boots. He wanted to say more, just to lighten up his sleep, but instead he opened his New Testament and arranged it beneath his head as a pillow. The fog made things seem hollow and unattached. He tried not to think about Ted Lavender, but then he was thinking how fast it was, no drama, down and dead, and how it was hard to feel anything except surprise. It seemed unchristian. He wished he could find some great sadness, or even anger, but the emotion wasn't there and he couldn't make it happen. Mostly he felt pleased to be alive. He liked the smell of the New Testament under his cheek, the leather and ink and paper and glue, whatever the chemicals were. He liked hearing the sounds of night. Even his fatigue, it felt fine, the stiff muscles and the prickly awareness of his own body, a floating feeling. He enjoyed not being dead. Lying there, Kiowa admired Lieutenant Jimmy Cross's capacity for grief. He wanted to share the man's pain, he wanted to care as Jimmy Cross cared. And yet when he closed his eyes, all he could think was Boom-down, and all he could feel was the pleasure of having his boots off and the fog curling in around him and the damp soil and the Bible smells and the plush comfort of night.\n\nAfter a moment Norman Bowker sat up in the dark.\n\nWhat the hell, he said. You want to talk, talk. Tell it to me.\n\nForget it.\n\nNo, man, go on. One thing I hate, it's a silent Indian.\n\nFor the most part they carried themselves with poise, a kind of dignity. Now and then, however, there were times of panic, when they squealed or wanted to squeal but couldn't, when they twitched and made moaning sounds and covered their heads and said Dear Jesus and flopped around on the earth and fired their weapons blindly and cringed and sobbed and begged for the noise to stop and went wild and made stupid promises to themselves and to God and to their mothers and fathers, hoping not to die. In different ways, it happened to all of them. Afterward, when the firing ended, they would blink and peek up. They would touch their bodies, feeling shame, then quickly hiding it. They would force themselves to stand. As if in slow motion, frame by frame, the world would take on the old logic\u2014absolute silence, then the wind, then sunlight, then voices. It was the burden of being alive. Awkwardly, the men would reassemble themselves, first in private, then in groups, becoming soldiers again. They would repair the leaks in their eyes. They would check for casualties, call in dustoffs, light cigarettes, try to smile, clear their throats and spit and begin cleaning their weapons. After a time someone would shake his head and say, No lie, I almost shit my pants, and someone else would laugh, which meant it was bad, yes, but the guy had obviously not shit his pants, it wasn't that bad, and in any case nobody would ever do such a thing and then go ahead and talk about it. They would squint into the dense, oppressive sunlight. For a few moments, perhaps, they would fall silent, lighting a joint and tracking its passage from man to man, inhaling, holding in the humiliation. Scary stuff, one of them might say. But then someone else would grin or flick his eyebrows and say, Roger-dodger, almost cut me a new asshole, almost.\n\nThere were numerous such poses. Some carried themselves with a sort of wistful resignation, others with pride or stiff soldierly discipline or good humor or macho zeal. They were afraid of dying but they were even more afraid to show it.\n\nThey found jokes to tell.\n\nThey used a hard vocabulary to contain the terrible softness. Greased they'd say. Offed, lit up, zapped while zipping. It wasn't cruelty, just stage presence. They were actors. When someone died, it wasn't quite dying, because in a curious way it seemed scripted, and because they had their lines mostly memorized, irony mixed with tragedy, and because they called it by other names, as if to encyst and destroy the reality of death itself. They kicked corpses. They cut off thumbs. They talked grunt lingo. They told stories about Ted Lavender's supply of tranquilizers, how the poor guy didn't feel a thing, how incredibly tranquil he was.\n\nThere's a moral here, said Mitchell Sanders.\n\nThey were waiting for Lavender's chopper, smoking the dead man's dope.\n\nThe moral's pretty obvious, Sanders said, and winked. Stay away from drugs. No joke, they'll ruin your day every time.\n\nCute, said Henry Dobbins.\n\nMind blower, get it? Talk about wiggy. Nothing left, just blood and brains.\n\nThey made themselves laugh.\n\nThere it is, they'd say. Over and over\u2014there it is, my friend, there it is\u2014as if the repetition itself were an act of poise, a balance between crazy and almost crazy, knowing without going, there it is, which meant be cool, let it ride, because Oh yeah, man, you can't change what can't be changed, there it is, there it absolutely and positively and fucking well is.\n\nThey were tough.\n\nThey carried all the emotional baggage of men who might die. Grief, terror, love, longing\u2014these were intangibles, but the intangibles had their own mass and specific gravity, they had tangible weight. They carried shameful memories. They carried the common secret of cowardice barely restrained, the instinct to run or freeze or hide, and in many respects this was the heaviest burden of all, for it could never be put down, it required perfect balance and perfect posture. They carried their reputations. They carried the soldier's greatest fear, which was the fear of blushing. Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to. It was what had brought them to the war in the first place, nothing positive, no dreams of glory or honor, just to avoid the blush of dishonor. They died so as not to die of embarrassment. They crawled into tunnels and walked point and advanced under fire. Each morning, despite the unknowns, they made their legs move. They endured. They kept humping. They did not submit to the obvious alternative, which was simply to close the eyes and fall. So easy, really. Go limp and tumble to the ground and let the muscles unwind and not speak and not budge until your buddies picked you up and lifted you into the chopper that would roar and dip its nose and carry you off to the world. A mere matter of falling, yet no one ever fell. It was not courage, exactly; the object was not valor. Rather, they were too frightened to be cowards.\n\nBy and large they carried these things inside, maintaining the masks of composure. They sneered at sick call. They spoke bitterly about guys who had found release by shooting off their own toes or fingers. Pussies, they'd say. Candy-asses. It was fierce, mocking talk, with only a trace of envy or awe, but even so the image played itself out behind their eyes.\n\nThey imagined the muzzle against flesh. So easy: squeeze the trigger and blow away a toe. They imagined it. They imagined the quick, sweet pain, then the evacuation to Japan, then a hospital with warm beds and cute geisha nurses.\n\nAnd they dreamed of freedom birds.\n\nAt night, on guard, staring into the dark, they were carried away by jumbo jets. They felt the rush of takeoff. Gone! they yelled. And then velocity\u2014wings and engines\u2014a smiling stewardess\u2014but it was more than a plane, it was a real bird, a big sleek silver bird with feathers and talons and high screeching. They were flying. The weights fell off; there was nothing to bear. They laughed and held on tight, feeling the cold slap of wind and altitude, soaring, thinking It's over, I'm gone!\u2014they were naked, they were light and free\u2014it was all lightness, bright and fast and buoyant, light as light, a helium buzz in the brain, a giddy bubbling in the lungs as they were taken up over the clouds and the war, beyond duty, beyond gravity and mortification and global entanglements\u2014Sin loi! they yelled. I'm sorry, motherfuckers, but I'm out of it, I'm goofed, I'm on a space cruise, I'm gone!\u2014and it was a restful, unencumbered sensation, just riding the light waves, sailing that big silver freedom bird over the mountains and oceans, over America, over the farms and great sleeping cities and cemeteries and highways and the golden arches of McDonald's, it was flight, a kind of fleeing, a kind of falling, falling higher and higher, spinning off the edge of the earth and beyond the sun and through the vast, silent vacuum where there were no burdens and where everything weighed exactly nothing\u2014Gone! they screamed. I'm sorry but I'm gone!\u2014and so at night, not quite dreaming, they gave themselves over to lightness, they were carried, they were purely borne.\n\nOn the morning after Ted Lavender died, First Lieutenant Jimmy Cross crouched at the bottom of his foxhole and burned Martha's letters. Then he burned the two photographs. There was a steady rain falling, which made it difficult, but he used heat tabs and Sterno to build a small fire, screening it with his body, holding the photographs over the tight blue flame with the tips of his fingers.\n\nHe realized it was only a gesture. Stupid, he thought. Sentimental, too, but mostly just stupid.\n\nLavender was dead. You couldn't burn the blame.\n\nBesides, the letters were in his head. And even now, without photographs, Lieutenant Cross could see Martha playing volleyball in her white gym shorts and yellow T-shirt. He could see her moving in the rain.\n\nWhen the fire died out, Lieutenant Cross pulled his poncho over his shoulders and ate breakfast from a can.\n\nThere was no great mystery, he decided.\n\nIn those burned letters Martha had never mentioned the war, except to say, Jimmy, take care of yourself. She wasn't involved. She signed the letters Love, but it wasn't love, and all the fine lines and technicalities did not matter. Virginity was no longer an issue. He hated her. Yes, he did. He hated her. Love, too, but it was a hard, hating kind of love.\n\nThe morning came up wet and blurry. Everything seemed part of everything else, the fog and Martha and the deepening rain.\n\nHe was a soldier, after all.\n\nHalf smiling, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross took out his maps. He shook his head hard, as if to clear it, then bent forward and began planning the day's march. In ten minutes, or maybe twenty, he would rouse the men and they would pack up and head west, where the maps showed the country to be green and inviting. They would do what they had always done. The rain might add some weight, but otherwise it would be one more day layered upon all the other days.\n\nHe was realistic about it. There was that new hardness in his stomach. He loved her but he hated her.\n\nNo more fantasies, he told himself.\n\nHenceforth, when he thought about Martha, it would be only to think that she belonged elsewhere. He would shut down the daydreams. This was not Mount Sebastian, it was another world, where there were no pretty poems or midterm exams, a place where men died because of carelessness and gross stupidity. Kiowa was right. Boom-down, and you were dead, never partly dead.\n\nBriefly, in the rain, Lieutenant Cross saw Martha's gray eyes gazing back at him. He understood.\n\nIt was very sad, he thought. The things men carried inside. The things men did or felt they had to do.\n\nHe almost nodded at her, but didn't.\n\nInstead he went back to his maps. He was now determined to perform his duties firmly and without negligence. It wouldn't help Lavender, he knew that, but from this point on he would comport himself as an officer. He would dispose of his good-luck pebble. Swallow it, maybe, or use Lee Strunk's slingshot, or just drop it along the trail. On the march he would impose strict field discipline. He would be careful to send out flank security, to prevent straggling or bunching up, to keep his troops moving at the proper pace and at the proper interval. He would insist on clean weapons. He would confiscate the remainder of Lavender's dope. Later in the day, perhaps, he would call the men together and speak to them plainly. He would accept the blame for what had happened to Ted Lavender. He would be a man about it. He would look them in the eyes, keeping his chin level, and he would issue the new SOPs in a calm, impersonal tone of voice, a lieutenant's voice, leaving no room for argument or discussion. Commencing immediately, he'd tell them, they would no longer abandon equipment along the route of march. They would police up their acts. They would get their shit together, and keep it together, and maintain it neatly and in good working order.\n\nHe would not tolerate laxity. He would show strength, distancing himself.\n\nAmong the men there would be grumbling, of course, and maybe worse, because their days would seem longer and their loads heavier, but Lieutenant Jimmy Cross reminded himself that his obligation was not to be loved but to lead. He would dispense with love; it was not now a factor. And if anyone quarreled or complained, he would simply tighten his lips and arrange his shoulders in the correct command posture. He might give a curt little nod. Or he might not. He might just shrug and say, Carry on, then they would saddle up and form into a column and move out toward the villages west of Than Khe.8Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/6513532", "artist_names": "Shango (Rock Group)", "full_title": "Day After Day (It's Slippin' Away) by\u00a0Shango\u00a0(Rock Group)", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/07e7fce8e0faa037b6df677a20a4aad3.300x301x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/07e7fce8e0faa037b6df677a20a4aad3.599x600x1.jpg", "id": 6513532, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 6967786, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1613895054, "path": "/Shango-rock-group-day-after-day-its-slippin-away-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Shango-rock-group-day-after-day-its-slippin-away-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1969, "month": 1, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "January 1, 1969", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 1, 1969", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/07e7fce8e0faa037b6df677a20a4aad3.300x301x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/07e7fce8e0faa037b6df677a20a4aad3.599x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Day After Day (It\u2019s Slippin\u2019 Away)", "title_with_featured": "Day After Day (It's Slippin' Away)", "updated_by_human_at": 1613895243, "url": "https://genius.com/Shango-rock-group-day-after-day-its-slippin-away-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/2615376", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "id": 2615376, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Shango (Rock Group)", "slug": "Shango-rock-group", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Shango-rock-group"}, "artist": "Shango (Rock Group)", "lyrics": "Day After Day (It\u2019s Slippin\u2019 Away) LyricsDay after day\nMore people come to L.A\nShhh!

high\nWhen you are near I touch the sky\nWith your soft and sweet caress\nYou brought me such tenderness\nTo think I was once forsaken\nWith your kiss I've been awakened\n\nIt's the lovin' things you do\nThat make me grow so close to you\nGonna want you my whole life through\nFor the lovin' things, baby, that you do\n\nWith your soft and sweet caress\nYou brought me such tenderness\nWith a smile from your young face\nYou gave me back my inspiration\n\nIt's the lovin' things we share\nThat assures me how you care\nOur friends call us a perfect pair\nFor the lovin' things, baby, that we share\n\nIt's the lovin' things you do\nThat make me grow so close to you\nGonna want you my whole life through\nFor the lovin' things, baby, that you do\n\nIt's the lovin' things you do\nThat make me grow so close to you\nI'm gonna want you my whole life through\nFor the lovin' things, baby, that you doYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

miles today\nThrough the rain and the mud\nAnd believe it or not\nThis is the first opportunity\nI've had to sit down and\nWrite in two or three weeks\nThis'll have to be short\nBut I just wanted to send my love\nAnd let you know that I'm doing fine\nBut you know, just being here\nAnd seeing how close these people\nAre to losing their freedom\nMakes me that much more determined\nTo help win this war\n'Cause if we don't, the next battlefield\nMay be closer to home than Vietnam\nMust close for now, all my love\nYour son, Bud\nP.S., how's Tommy doing\nAt State University\nTell him his big brother said hello\nState University, September first\nHi, Dad, we must have\nMarched twenty blocks today\nAnd, baby, I'm beat\nI mean, like the sign\nI was carrying got real heavy\nBut, Dad, everything was out of sight\nThere were recorders and\nPhotographers and cameraman\nFrom every major news\nService and network in the nation\nSo look for your baby boy's picture\nOn the front page of today's paper\nOf course, you might have a\nLittle trouble recognizing me\nWith my groovy beard\nBut, Dad, I know we're right\nHow can you defend my brother\nMurdering all those people overseas\nSo what if the Communists\nDo take over in South Vietnam\nWhy, just today\nOur economics professor assured us\nThat people get along\nJust as well under communism\nAs they do under\nAny other form of government\nI'm sorry, Dad\nBut this God and country bit\nJust isn't my bag\nGotta go, dad, big rally tonight\nYour son, Tommy\nP.S., Dad better send me an\nExtra fifty bucks this week, dig\nDear Mr. and Mrs. Smith\nI know you must be awfully\nProud of your fine son\nI wish I could be there to\nSee you recieve Bud's medal of honor\nIt may comfort you to know\nThat his last thoughts were of you\nAnd as his sergeant\nI can truthfully say\nHe was one of the bravest men\nI have ever known\nDear Mom and Dad\nIt's been some time\nSince I received word about Bud\nSomehow I just didn't have\nThe nerve to come home\nBut I've done a lot of thinking since then\nAbout my turned on friends and\nAbout what they said about communism\nWe were all wrong\nAnd you know, I always just worship Bud\nNow that I've thought it over, I know\nThat he would never fight for something\nUnless he believed in it\nWith all of his heart\nAnd in spite of all my past mistakes\nI hope that somehow, someday\nI can become as big in your eyes\nAs my brother will always be\nYour son, Private Tommy SmithYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/406556",

to say \"I'm sorry\"\nAnd takes a fool to walk away\nSo right here, I wanna say \"I'm sorry\"\nI don't know where you are, but you know I need you\nNow, there's one more thing I'd like to say right

love\n\nNow, there's one more thing\nYou know, to have somebody to worry when you worry\nTo feel the need of a real person when your friends drop you behind\nTo kill your anger just by being nice and kind\nI could say if you leave, it wouldn't bother me\nBut I know that would be a lie\n'Cause baby, deep down inside, you're part of me\nBut I want you to know and I don't care who knows\n\nI still

PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- PAST\nPhil demonstrates a dance from \"High School Musical\" as his horrified kids look on.\n\nPHIL (singing): WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER, YES WE ARE...\n\n10 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- DAY As before.\n\nHALEY: You're not going to embarrass me? You guys embarrass me every single day!\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\nCLAIRE: Honey, relax.\n\nPHIL: Yeah, take a chill pill, biotch.\n\nSFX: DOOR SLAM!\n\nALEX: Mom! Dad!\n\nAlex appears in the doorway, holding her arm.\n\nALEX (CONT'D): Luke just shot me!\n\nLuke enters carrying an air-soft gun.\n\nLUKE I didn't mean to.\n\nAnnoyed, Haley crosses upstairs.\n\nCLAIRE: (to Alex): Are you okay?\n\nALEX: No, the little bitch shot me.\n\nLUKE: They're just plastic BB's. It was an accident.\n\nCLAIRE (to Phil): What did I tell you would happen if you bought him a gun?\n\nPHIL (to Luke): What did I tell you would happen if you shot any animal or any person?\n\nLUKE: That you would shoot me.\n\nPHIL: That's right! Come on. Let's go.\n\nHe starts for the backyard.\n\nCLAIRE: Are you insane, you're going to shoot him?! He's got a birthday party.\n\nCLAIRE (CONT'D): He can't show up with a big hideous welt. You can shoot him later. He'll be home at two.\n\nALEX: Does anyone care about my hideous welt?\n\nPHIL: I can't shoot him at two, I'm showing a house then. What about three? Claire checks her calendar.\n\nCLAIRE: No, he's got a soccer game at three. We've got to leave for that dinner at five. You can shoot him at four- fifteen.\n\nPHIL: Yeah, I guess that works for me.\n\nCLAIRE (writing on calendar): Shoot Luke.\n\nPHIL (to Luke): Have a good day, sport.\n\n11 EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY\nIt is after the soccer game and Gloria and Manny are walking toward their car. Jay lags slightly behind.\n\nMANNY: I'm quitting soccer. It is a game for children.\n\nGLORIA: You're not quitting. You would have stopped that goal if you were staring at that girl again.\n\nMANNY: She is not a girl, she's a woman.\n\nGLORIA: Yay, will you talk to him?\n\nJay catches sight of the Dad from earlier.\n\ufffc\ufffc\nJAY (under his breath) Jackass...\n\nGLORIA: What?\n\nJAY: Not Manny, that Jabroney over there in the blue. He said something to me before I didn't appreciate.\n\nGLORIA:  What he say?\n\nJAY: It doesn't matter. Drop it.\n\nThey all get into the car.\n\nJAY (CONT'D): And by the way, that little blow-up of yours with that other Mom -- why do you always have to do stuff like that? Could you try to remember this is Highland Estates, not Colombia?\n\nGLORIA: I don't care where it is, if someone say something about my family --\n\nJAY: I know, the whole hot Latin thing. I'm just saying, it's not a crime to leave some thoughts unexpressed.\n\nGLORIA: Like you do, you mean.\n\nJAY No, not like -- well yeah, like me. Like a man. A man knows it's not appropriate to go around showing your emotion all the time.\n\nMANNY: I want to tell Brenda Feldman I love her.\n\nJAY: Oh for Crissakes.\n\nGLORIA:  Manny, she's sixteen.\n\nMANNY: Oh, it's okay for you to take an older lover?\n\nJAY: Hey, watch it.\n\nMANNY: I want to go now, to the mall where she works. But I need to stop at home first to get my white silk shirt.\n\nJAY: Okay, not to be the evil stepdad here, but that's just not a good idea.\n\nMANNY: Stop the car.\n\nJay does, and Manny jumps out.\n\nGLORIA: Where are you--\n\nBut he's gone.\n\nJAY: You do realize that's a suicide mission, right? He's 13, he's in a new school, and if he declares his love for a 16 year-old girl while wearing a puffy-sleeved white shirt we're going to be heading down to that school Monday morning with a bolt cutter to get him out of his locker. (then noticing) Oh geez, he's picking flowers.>\n\n12 INTERVIEW -- JAY AND GLORIA\n\nGLORIA: Manny is very passionate, like his father. My first husband was very handsome, but too emotional. It seemed like all we ever do was fight and make love, fight and make love. One day, I'm not joking, we fell out the window together.\n\nJAY: Which were you doing? (to camera) I'm hearing this for the first time.\n\ufffc\n13 INT. GROCERY STORE -- DAY\nMitchell is shopping while he holds Lily. Cameron approaches with some items. He places a pie into their basket.\n\nMITCHELL (re: pie, judgmental): Okay...\n\nCAMERON: What? Your family's coming over and everyone likes pie.\n\nMITCHELL: Oh, please, you like pie.\n\nCAMERON: You like pie.\n\nMITCHELL: Not as much as y-- Oh my God, you have blueberry on your fingers.\n\nCAMERON: What, we're buying it.\n\n14 INTERVIEW -- CAMERON\n\nCAMERON: Yes, Mitchell will be keeping his dental practice and I'll be home full-time, but that does not make me \"the wife.\" Sure, I gained a few pounds while we were expecting the baby, but that was stress. We cut to a shot of Cam hiding in the pantry of their kitchen ravenously eating chocolate, hoping not to get caught.\n\nCAMERON (V.O.) (CONT'D): It's perfectly normal. It would be nice if he understood that.\n\n15 INT. GROCERY STORE -- MOMENTS LATER\nThey are now in line at checkout.\n\nMITCHELL: This doesn't worry you, that she barely slept on the plane and she's still wide awake? I didn't even think Asian eyes opened that wide.\n\nCAMERON: Oh stop worrying.\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\nMITCHELL: Maybe she just can't fall asleep unless she feels a woman's shape. That orphanage was all women.\n\nCAMERON: I guess that's possible.\n\nMitchell tries to hand Lily to Cameron.\n\nCAMERON (CONT'D): What the hell is that supposed to mean?\n\nMITCHELL: I just thought--\n\nCAMERON: What, that I'm more womanly?\n\nMITCHELL Now you're sensitive about that? It wasn't a problem on Halloween when you just had to be Sarah Palin and I was stuck all night in that John McCain harness.\n\nCAMERON: Is there a particular reason you've been in a bitchy mood all day when this is supposed to be the happiest day of our lives?\n\nMITCHELL: I have not been --\n\nThey are now at the checkout line and a few customers are behind them including a woman in a wheelchair.\n\nWHEELCHAIR WOMAN (amused): Look at that baby with those Twinkies.\n\nMitchell turns on her.\n\nMITCHELL Yeah, it's funny isn't it? Hilarious! This baby would have grown up in a crowded orphanage if it weren't for us \"twinkies\" and I'd think someone like you would have a little sympathy for people who are a little different than --\n\ufffc\nCameron slaps him. He has noticed that Lily has grabbed a Hostess Twinkies pack off the nearby display rack and is squishing them.\nM\nITCHELL (CONT'D): What?!\n\nMitchell then takes in the picture of Lily with the Twinkies.\n\nCAMERON: We'd like to pay for your cat food.\n\n16 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S KITCHEN -- DAY\n\nSFX: DOORBELL\n\nHALEY (O.S.): Don't answer it. I'll get it.\n\nClaire quickly crosses to the door and answers it to find, DYLAN, a very tall and mature seventeen-year-old boy.\n\nCLAIRE: Hello, you must be Dylan.\n\nDYLAN: Hey. Dylan. Yeah.\n\nHaley rushes up and puts herself between Dylan and her mom.\n\nHALEY: Hey. Let's go.\n\nThey head up the stairs.\n\nCLAIRE: Hang on. How old are you, Dylan?\n\nDYLAN: Seventeen.\n\nCLAIRE: Oh. That's, um...\n\nPhil enters.\n\nCLAIRE (CONT'D): Phil, Dylan's here and he's seventeen.\n\nPHIL: Sweet. Let me meet this playa. (offers fist bump) Phil Dunphy, yo.\n\n17 INTERVIEW -- PHIL\nPhil stares intently into the camera saying nothing. Then:\n\ufffc\ufffc\nPHIL: It's like that. You just let the eyes do the work. Your mouth might be saying, \"Hey, we cool\", but your eyes are saying, \"I know what you're here for, and that shiznit is broke.\"\n\n18 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- DAY\nPhil is at the bottom of the stairs as Dylan crosses back down to shake hands. Phil starts to put on his \"intimidating\" face, but as Dylan reaches the ground floor Phil sees that Dylan is several inches taller than he is.\n\nDYLAN: Hey, what's up?\n\nPHIL: Nu-in, nu-in much.\n\nHALEY (hating this): Okay.\n\nNever losing eye contact, Phil steps up the first step of the stairs so that now he's a little taller than Dylan.\n\nPHIL: So you two have fun today, just make sure you keep it real, know what I mean?\n\nDYLAN (looks to Haley): Uh..\n\nHATELY: Dad!\n\nPHIL: That's cool. That's--\n\nTo be even more intimidating, Phil steps up another step but loses his grip on the banister when it slips in some baby oil left over from freeing Luke. He awkwardly saves himself, but wrenches his back in the process.\n\nPHIL (CONT'D): Oh boy. Ohhhh. That's not good.\n\nCLAIRE: Honey? You okay?\n\nHALEY: Yeah, I'm ---\n\nPHIL (CONT'D) (unable to stand): -- no I'm not.\n\n19 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER\nDylan carries Phil to the couch, holding him like a baby.\n\nCLAIRE: Should I call the doctor?\n\nPHIL: No. (to Dylan) You're very strong, Homes. Haley is horrified.\n\nEND OF ACT TWO\n\ufffc\ufffc\nACT THREE\n20 INT. MALL - DAY\nJay, Gloria, and Manny are walking through the mall. Jay is still in his track suit. Manny now wears his puffy, white shirt. Manny spots Brenda Feldman, the cute 16 year-old we saw on her bike earlier, at work in Wetzel's Pretzels.\n\nMANNY (reverently): Brenda Feldman.\n\nJAY: I can't watch this.\n\nA saleswoman passes, promoting cologne.\n\nSALESWOMAN: Panache for Men?\n\nJAY (a little annoyed): No.\n\nMANNY: I will take some. (as she spritzes him) Thank you. And that is a lovely color on you.\n\nSALESWOMAN: Well, aren't you a gentleman?\n\nMANNY: \ufffc\ufffcYes.\n\nThe saleswoman moves off as Manny pulls some folded sheets out of his pocket.\n\nGLORIA:  What is that?\n\nMANNY: A poem I have written for Brenda.\n\nJAY: Of course it is.\n\nGloria shoots Jay a steely look.\n\nMANNY: I put my thoughts into words, and now my words into action.\n\nManny crosses over to Wetzel's Pretzels. Jay and Gloria watch him go. It's clear Gloria is giving Jay a cold shoulder.\n\nJAY: I'll give him one thing, he's got some cahoneys.\n\nGLORIA: Please, don't do a torture on my language.\n\nShe turns away from him.\n\nJAY: Look, I know you're upset cause I got a little mad in the car. You want to talk about that?\n\nGLORIA: I'm trying to have an unexpressed emotion.\n\nJAY: So you're just going to stay mad?\n\nGLORIA: I'll just say this: You could learn from Manny. He doesn't keep how he feels inside, and it may not work out for him over there today but it will someday. He's not afraid of how he feels, and women like that. (admiring him) He's like a bullfighter.\n\nJAY (struggling with this a little): Okay, I think I got mad in the car because I was bugged about what that guy said to me at the game. He thought I was your Dad. And that's not the first time that's happened, people... thinking I'm too old for you.\n\nHe looks to Manny. He's reciting his poem now, Brenda holding the flowers Manny has brought. It inspires Jay to go on.\n\nJAY (CONT'D): And I guess I'm worried maybe you'll think that too some day.\n\nGLORIA (melted by his honesty): How can you think that? I would never! How could I when you're so cute?\n\nShe hugs and kisses him -- the public affection is a little too much for Jay.\n\nJAY: Okay, that's enough of that.\n\nGLORIA: And if it bothers you and you want to look a little younger, we can get you some hipper clothes. There's a store right there that--\n\nManny rejoins them.\n\nJAY: Let's not go crazy. I'll be fine.\n\nMANNY: She has a boyfriend.\n\nGLORIA: I'm sorry, Ni\u00f1o.\n\nShe hugs him.\n\nMANNY: I gave her my heart and she gave me a pretzel dog. (then) That was pretty stupid of me, wasn't it?\n\nJAY: You know what, Manny, no it wasn't stupid. It was fantastic. You took a big swing and I respect the hell out of that. C'mon, let's go get some lunch. Anywhere you want to go.\n\nThey start off, Jay striding briskly. Gloria gives Manny a big hug, which causes them to linger behind a bit. After a short distance, Jay is stopped by a security guard.\n\nSECURITY GUARD Excuse me, sir, we ask that all mall- walkers stay to the right.\n\nJAY: What?\n\nHe sees that he is being approached by a large group of senior citizen mall walkers. Many of the men are dressed similarly to Jay. They pass him.\n\nSECURITY GUARD: Thank you sir.\n\nThe security guard heads off.\n\nJAY (to Gloria): I'll meet up with you guys.\n\nJay turns and heads into the funky clothes store as Gloria and Manny continue on their way.\n21 INT. MITCHELL & CAMERON'S CONDO -- DAY\nThe front door opens and Mitchell and Cameron enter, carrying Lily, their luggage and the groceries. There is an antique '60s robot in one corner.\n\nCAMERON: Tada! Your new home! Isn't it gorgeous, except for that robot -- I hate to break it to you, your other daddy is a big nerd.\n\nThey exit into Lily's room.\n22 INT. LILY'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS\nThey enter, and Cameron looks up at the ceiling. On it a mural has been painted. It is a heavenly scene, full of clouds. Emerging from one cloud are Cameron and Mitchell painted like angels with wings.\n\nCAMERON (gasping): Oh my God, do you love it?\n\nMITCHELL: What the hell is it?\n\nCAMERON: I had Andre do it while we were gone. Look, that's us.\n\nMITCHELL: Yeah, I see. With wings.\n\nCAMERON: We're floating above her, always there to protect her.\n\ufffc\ufffc\n\nMITCHELL: Like fairies, you mean. Okay, now I get it. \"Yes, we pulled you out of your home in Vietnam, but don't worry, things will be perfectly normal here. Your dads are floating fairies.\" You know, I really don't need my family ridiculing me over this tonight. Call Andre and have him paint something... less gay.\n\nCAMERON: That is not that gay.\n\nMITCHELL: A triptych of us having sex would be less gay.\n\nCAMERON: You know what? I've put up with this mood of yours all day. What is your deal?\n\nMITCHELL: Nothing.\n\nCAMERON: See when he looks at the floor, Lily? That's what nerdy daddy does when he's lying.\n\nMITCHELL: I never told them, all right?\n\nCAMERON: What?\n\nMITCHELL: I never told my family we were adopting a baby.\n\nCAMERON: Are you kidding me? Why the hell not?\n\nMITCHELL: We weren't telling anyone until we knew it was official and then when the agency called last week I had to, you know, pack and --\n\nCAMERON: We left two days later and I packed for you! You wussed out!\n\nMITCHELL: Okay fine, my family was going to have a big opinion and I just didn't want to hear it.\n\nCAMERON: But it's the ceiling's that's too gay.\n\nMitchell storms off.\n23 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S KITCHEN -- DAY\nClaire is at the foot of the stairs.\n\nHALEY (O.S.): Alex, get out! Mom!\n\nCLAIRE (calling up): Alex, leave your sister alone.\n\nAlex enters.\n\nALEX: I was just getting my sweatshirt.\n\nCLAIRE: You need to respect their privacy. (then) What are they doing up there?\n\nALEX: Nothing. Lying on her bed watching a movie.\n\nCLAIRE (trying to be okay with this): Oh. Oh. Well, good. So, I'm making a cake for tonight, want to help me?\n\nALEX: Can I do the frosting?\n\nCLAIRE: Sure, sweetie.\n\nClaire begins to tie an apron around Alex.\n\nCLAIRE (CONT'D:) Wow, I remember when you used to trip over this thing.\n\nThey smile at that memory, maybe Claire rubs noses with her.\n\ufffc\ufffc\nALEX: So, if Haley got pregnant, would you ever do one of those weird things where you pretend she has mono for a few months and then tell everyone the baby is yours?\n\nCLAIRE: What?\n\nALEX: This senior at school was \"out sick\" for like four months, but Robby Richman swears he saw her breastfeeding at a California Chicken Cafe.\n\n24 EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD -- DAY\nPhil holds the gun.\n\nPHIL: What are you wearing?\n\nReveal Luke wearing three shirts, a big jacket and two hats.\n\nLUKE: Nothing.\n\nPHIL: Uh-uh. Jacket off. One shirt, one hat. No pain, no gain. Jesus, how many pairs of underwear do you have on?\n\nLUKE: Six.\n\n25 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS -- DAY\nClaire and Alex are as before. Claire is looking pretty horrified.\n\nALEX: First of all, it would be really cool to see Haley that fat. And how awesome would it be to have a secret little brother who's really my nephew.\n\nCLAIRE: Alex, Haley is not getting pregnant.\n\nALEX: I'm just saying if. \ufffcOne. (then)\ufffc\n\nCLAIRE (trying to hide her panic): But there's no point in saying if. If is what you say when things can happen and this can't happen. (then) I can't believe I have to prove this to you.\n\nShe rushes out.\n26 EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD - DAY\nLuke is down to one layer of clothes. Phil has the gun.\n\nPHIL: I want you to know, I'm not enjoying this. But it's an important lesson you're learning.\n\nHe begins to pace off steps away from the nervous Luke.\n27 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -DAY -- CONTINUOUS\nClaire walks up the stairs, matching Phil's pace.\n28 EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD - DAY -- CONTINUOUS\nPhil is finishing his paces, then turns.\n\nLUKE: You're too close. It's going to hurt.\n\nPHIL: It's supposed to.\n\nLUKE: Why are you smiling?\n\n29 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -DAY -- CONTINUOUS\nClaire has reached Haley's closed door. She's about to burst in, when she stops and retreats.\n30 EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD - DAY -- CONTINUOUS\nPhil has the gun trained on Luke, then:\n\nPHIL: Oh, forget it. I can't do this. The point is you're scared, and I think you've learned your lesson just by --\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\nBANG! The gun fires, and Luke yelps.\n\nPHIL (CONT'D): Wow.\n\n31 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS\nClaire barrels through Haley's door to find:\n32 INT. HALEY'S ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS\nHaley and Dylan are on her bed, watching a movie on her laptop. They both have Starbucks.\n\nHALEY (mortified): Mom! What are you doing?\n\nCLAIRE: What am I doing? Seeing if you guys need anything, okay?\n\nHALEY: You could knock.\n\nCLAIRE: Knock? You knock when you think\npeople are doing something private, which you aren't, obviously, why would you be? Although I think we all read that study this week saying thirty-nine-percent of sixteen-year- olds have had sexual intercourse. And as long as we're talking, what is with the coffee all the time? Huh? Whatever happened to ice cream? And all the texting and your cell phones glued to your hands, like you're little business-people. Doesn't anyone want to run around and ride bikes and be kids anymore?\n\nThey look at her stunned.\n\nCLAIRE (CONT'D): So did you guys need anything?\n\n33 EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD -- DAY\nPhil is tending to Luke's injury, still holding the gun.\n\nLUKE: You hit my bone!\n\nPHIL: It was an accident!\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\nHALEY: Dad, you have got to talk to Mom! She is like completely freaking out and embarrassing me!\n\nPHIL: Well honey, your Mom isn't always as cool about things as I am --\n\nDylan steps outside, joining Haley, and Phil accidentally fires the gun again, hitting him.\n\nDYLAN: Owww!\n\nHe falls to the ground.\n\nPHIL: What is with this thing?\n\nHALEY: Oh. My. God.\n\nEND OF ACT THREE\n\ufffc\nACT FOUR\n34 INTERVIEW -- MITCHELL & CAMERON (THEIR CONDO)\nThey sit waiting for Mitchell's family. Cameron holds Lily.\n\nMITCHELL: I've got good reason to be nervous. I'm having flashbacks to when I told my family I was gay. My mom cried for a week and my Dad still does this thing where he announces himself before walking into any room we're in to make sure he doesn't see anything.\n\nCAMERON: My parents always knew. My mother says she was in labor with me for twenty-nine hours because I came out of the womb like this:\n\nHe does a big wide-armed flourish.\n\nSFX: DOORBELL\n\nMITCHELL: Uggghhhh. I don't know if I can do this.\n\nCAMERON: I'm giving you three minutes and then I'm bringing her out.\n\nCameron retreats for Lily's room. Mitchell opens the door to reveal Claire, Phil and the kids.\n\nCLAIRE: Hey!\n\nMITCHELL: Hey guys!\n\nShe hands him a bottle of wine.\n\nMITCHELL (CONT'D): Oh, thanks.\n\nCLAIRE: Don't thank me, just open it. was parking Dad right behind us.\n\nJAY: Knock, knock!\n\nTrue to form, Jay both KNOCKS and RINGS THE DOORBELL.\n\nJAY: No kissing! We're here.\n\nJay enters with Gloria and Manny. Jay wears ripped jeans, a garish, very colorful jacket and jeweled Ed Hardy hat. Manny wears his white satin shirt.\n\nMITCHELL: Don't worry, Dad, nothing gay going on in here. May I take your multi- colored coat and jeweled cap? They all ad-lib greetings.\n\nGLORIA (to Mitchell): So how was your trip?\n\nMITCHELL: Oh, it was great. But about that, I actually have something I need to tell you guys...\n\nANGLE ON CAM\n\nHe's just around the corner, holding Lily, waiting for his cue to enter.\n\nMITCHELL (CONT'D): We didn't just go there for pleasure... We kind of have some big news.\n\nJAY: Oh god. If Cam walks out here with boobs, I'm leaving.\n\nCLAIRE: Dad!\n\nHALEY: I hope he didn't embarrass you, Mom.\n\nShe moves off, with attitude.\n\nCLAIRE: That's nothing. She had her first boy over today, I lost it in front of them and then Phil shot him.\n\nANGLE ON CAM\n\nGetting impatient, waiting for his cue.\n\nMITCHELL: So anyway... about a year ago, Cam and I started feeling this longing for something... more.\n\nHaley has joined Manny.\n\nMANNY Hello, Haley. You look especially beautiful tonight.\n\nGLORIA: Manny! Give it a rest.\n\nMITCHELL: Anyway --\n\nPHIL (having noticed her outfit): Wow, that's a beautiful skirt, Gloria.\n\nGLORIA: Oh, thank you. It's suede, Pheel.\n\nHe feels her skirt.\n\nPHIL (hearing \"feel\") Ooh, it's --\n\nClaire slaps his hand away.\n\nCLAIRE: Phil! That's how she says \"Phil\".\n\nThe lights dim.\n\nJAY: What the hell's going on?\n\nMUSIC CUE: LION KING \"CIRCLE OF LIFE\"\n\nEverybody turns. Cameron enters holding Lily. In time to the music, he dramatically raises her toward the heavens. They all look at one another, mystified.\n\nMITCHELL: We adopted a baby.\n\nCLAIRE: What?!\n\nMITCHELL: That's why we went to Vietnam. Her name is Lily.\n\nGLORIA: Oh my god, look at the little angel!\n\nCLAIR: She's yours?!\n\nMITCHELL: I know. I can't believe it either.\n\nPHIL: Hi, Lily. (TO MITCHELL & CAM) Isn't that going to be tough for her to say?\n\nHALEY: She's so cute.\n\nALEX (to Haley): You could totally have one, you know.\n\nCameron brings Lily over to Jay.\n\nMITCHELL: So... what do you think, grandpa?\n\nEverybody turns to see Jay's reaction.\n\nJAY: I gotta admit I never thought I'd get a baby out of you two. (he takes Lily) You're a cute little fortune cookie, aren't ya? (then) Okay. That's wet. Someone take him.\n\nMITCHELL: Her, Dad. I'll change her.\n\nCLAIRE:  Let me help.\n\n35 INT. LILY'S ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER\nMitchell and Claire enter and begin changing Lily's diaper.\n\nCLAIRE: How could you not say something?\n\nMITCHELL: I don't know. Maybe I thought you'd try to talk me out of it.\n\ufffc\nCLAIRE: I love how you see me as some huge busybody. (pushes him aside, takes over changing the diaper)\nI mean, yes, it's a huge responsibility, it's gonna put a lot of pressure on you two that you might not be able to handle. What did Mom say?\n\nMITCHELL: I haven't told her yet, but that was a good sneak preview.\n\nCLAIRE (re: Lily): So what do you know about her parents?\n\nMITCHELL: Not much. I just know her mother was sixteen.\n\nCLAIRE: Oh, God. Well, she's gorgeous.\n\nMITCHELL: Thanks. I just hope...\n\nCLAIRE What?\n\nMITCHELL: I already love her so much and... it's hard enough for any kid, let alone one with two dads. What if, when she gets older, she's ashamed of us?\n\nShe hugs him.\n\nCLAIRE: Oh honey, don't be ridiculous. You're her parents. Of course she'll be ashamed of you. (then) My kids are mortified by me. Which is pretty ironic considering Haley dresses like a hooker, Alex dresses like a lesbian and...\n\n36 INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS\nThe whole family is now gathered around a baby monitor on a table.\n\ufffc\n\nCLAIRE: ...Luke can barely get his shoes on the right feet. And tell me you're not horrified by Dad and that Huggy Bear outfit that Charo out there bought for him.\n\nCLAIRE: The point is, Lily is the luckiest little girl in the world, getting you two. So stop worrying.\n\nMITCHELL: All right.\n\nCLAIRE: Come on, we're all together. Let's go out there and enjoy this. They head back out to the living room.\n\n38 INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS\nAs they enter, everybody stares at them unhappily.\n\nMITCHELL: \ufffc\ufffcWhat?\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\nEND OF SHOWEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

here in this easy chair, it's been a jungle all day, you know\"\nThe 1432 Franklin Pike Circle Hero is home\n\nHe was out pitching ball with the kids in the neighborhood yesterday\nAnd the ole

pulled in to Nazareth\nWas feeling 'bout half past dead\nI just need some place\nWhere I can lay my head\n\"Hey, mister, can you tell me\nWhere a man might find a bed?\"\nHe just grinned and shook my hand\nAnd \"No\" was all he said\n\n[Chorus]\nTake a load off Fanny\nTake a load for free\nTake a load off Fanny\nAnd (and, and) you put the load right on me\n(You put the load right on me)\n[Verse 2]\nI picked up my bag\nI went looking for a place to hide\nWhen I saw Carmen and the Devil\nWalking side by side\nI said \"Hey Carmen, come on\nLet's go downtown?\"\nAnd she said, \"I gotta go\nBut my friend can stick around\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd take a load off Fanny\nTake a load for free\nTake a load off Fanny\nAnd (and, and) you put the load right on me\n(You put the load right on me)\n\n[Verse 3]\nGo down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say\nIt's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day\n\"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?\"\nHe said, \"Do me a favor, son, won't ya stay and keep Anna Lee company?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd take a load off Fanny\nTake a load for free\nTake a load off Fanny\nAnd (and, and) you put the load right on me\n(You put the load right on

load right on me\n(You put the load right on me)\n\n[Verse 5]\nCatch a Cannonball, now, to take me down the line\nMy bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time\nTo get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one\nWho sent me here with her regards for everyone\n\n[Chorus]\nTake a load off Fanny\nTake a load for free\nTake a load off Fanny\nAnd (and, and) you put the load right on me\n(You

Born of parents who are thieves, reared among thieves, and educated as thieves, they finally go forth perfected in their vocation, accomplished at all points, and ready for every species of roguery. In them the love of thieving, and the ability to exercise it, are qualities inseparable from their existence, and never lost until the hour of their death.\n\nNow it chanced that an old woman of this race, one who had merited retirement on full pay as a veteran in the ranks of Cacus, brought up a girl whom she called Preciosa, and declared to be her granddaughter. To this child she imparted all her own acquirements, all the various tricks of her art. Little Preciosa became the most admired dancer in all the tribes of Gipsydom; she was the most beautiful and discreet of all their maidens; nay she shone conspicuous not only among the gipsies, but even as compared with the most lovely and accomplished damsels whose praises were at that time sounded forth by the voice of fame. Neither sun, nor wind, nor all those vicissitudes of weather, to which the gipsies are more constantly exposed than any other people, could impair the bloom of her complexion or embrown her hands; and what is more remarkable, the rude manner in which she was reared only served to reveal that she must have sprung from something better than the Gitano stock; for she was extremely pleasing and courteous in conversation, and lively though she was, yet in no wise did she display the least unseemly levity; on the contrary, amidst all her sprightliness, there was at the same time so much genuine decorum in her manner, that in the presence of Preciosa no gitana, old or young, ever dared to sing lascivious songs, or utter unbecoming words.\n\nThe grandmother fully perceived what a treasure she had in her grandchild; and the old eagle determined to set her young eaglet flying, having been careful to teach her how to live by her talons. Preciosa was rich in hymns, ballads, seguidillas, sarabands, and other ditties, especially romances, which she sang with peculiar grace; for the cunning grandmother knew by experience that such accomplishments, added to the youth and beauty of her granddaughter, were the best means of increasing her capital, and therefore she failed not to promote their cultivation in every way she could. Nor was the aid of poets wanting; for some there are who do not disdain to write for the gipsies, as there are those who invent miracles for the pretended blind, and go snacks with them in what they gain from charitable believers.\n\nDuring her childhood, Preciosa lived in different parts of Castile; but in her sixteenth year her grandmother brought her to Madrid, to the usual camping-ground of the gipsies, in the fields of Santa Barbara. Madrid seemed to her the most likely place to find customers; for there everything is bought and sold. Preciosa made her first appearance in the capital on the festival of Santa Anna, the patroness of the city, when she took part in a dance performed by eight gitanas, with one gitano, an excellent dancer, to lead them. The others were all very well, but such was the elegance of Preciosa, that she fascinated the eyes of all the spectators. Amidst the sound of the tambourine and castanets, in the heat of the dance, a murmur of admiration arose for the beauty and grace of Preciosa; but when they heard her sing\u2014for the dance was accompanied with song\u2014the fame of the gitana reached its highest point; and by common consent the jewel offered as the prize of the best dancer in that festival was adjudged to her. After the usual dance in the church of Santa Maria, before the image of the glorious Santa Anna, Preciosa caught up a tambourine, well furnished with bells, and having cleared a wide circle around her with pirouettes of exceeding lightness, she sang a hymn to the patroness of the day. It was the admiration of all who heard her. Some said, \"God bless the girl!\" Others, \"'Tis a pity that this maiden is a gitana: truly she deserves to be the daughter of some great lord!\" Others more coarsely observed, \"Let the wench grow up, and she will show you pretty tricks; she is closing the meshes of a very nice net to fish for hearts.\" Another more good-natured but ill-bred and stupid, seeing her foot it so lightly, \"Keep it up! keep it up! Courage, darling! Grind the dust to atoms!\" \"Never fear,\" she answered, without losing a step; \"I'll grind it to atoms.\"\n\nAt the vespers and feast of Santa Anna Preciosa was somewhat fatigued; but so celebrated had she become for beauty, wit, and discretion, as well as for her dancing, that nothing else was talked of throughout the capital. A fortnight afterwards, she returned to Madrid, with three other girls, provided with their tambourines and a new dance, besides a new stock of romances and songs, but all of a moral character; for Preciosa would never permit those in her company to sing immodest songs, nor would she ever sing them herself. The old gitana came with her, for she now watched her as closely as Argus, and never left her side, lest some one should carry her off. She called her granddaughter, and the girl believed herself to be her grandchild.\n\nThe young gitanas began their dance in the shade, in the Calle de Toledo, and were soon encircled by a crowd of spectators. Whilst they danced, the old woman gathered money among the bystanders, and they showered it down like stones on the highway; for beauty has such power that it can awaken slumbering charity. The dance over, Preciosa said, \"If you will give me four quartos, I will sing by myself a beautiful romance about the churching of our lady the Queen Do\u00f1a Margarita. It is a famous composition, by a poet of renown, one who may be called a captain in the battalion of poets.\" No sooner had she said this, than almost every one in the ring cried out, \"Sing it, Preciosa; here are my four quartos;\" and so many quartos were thrown down for her, that the old gitana had not hands enough to pick them up. When the gathering was ended, Preciosa resumed her tambourine, and sang the promised romance, which was loudly encored, the whole audience crying out with one voice, \"Sing again, Preciosa, sing again, and dance for us, girl: thou shalt not want quartos, whilst thou hast the ground beneath thy feet.\"\nWhilst more than two hundred persons were thus looking on at the dance, and listening to the singing of the gitana, one of the lieutenants of the city passed by; and seeing so many people together, he asked what was the occasion of the crowd. Being told that the handsome gitana was singing there, the lieutenant, who was not without curiosity, drew near also to listen, but in consideration of his dignity, he did not wait for the end of the romance. The gitanilla, however, pleased him so much, that he sent his page to tell the old crone to come to his house that evening with her troop, as he wished his wife Do\u00f1a Clara to hear them. The page delivered the message, and the old gitana promised to attend.\n\nAfter the performance was ended, and the performers were going elsewhere, a very well-dressed page came up to Preciosa, and giving her a folded paper, said, \"Pretty Preciosa, will you sing this romance? It is a very good one, and I will give you others from time to time, by which you will acquire the fame of having the best romances in the world.\"\n\n\"I will learn this one with much willingness,\" replied Preciosa; \"and be sure, se\u00f1or, you bring me the others you speak of, but on condition that there is nothing improper in them. If you wish to be paid for them, we will agree for them by the dozen; but do not expect to be paid in advance; that will be impossible. When a dozen have been sung, the money for a dozen shall be forthcoming.\"\n\n\"If the Se\u00f1ora Preciosa only pays me for the paper,\" said the page, \"I shall be content. Moreover, any romance which does not turn out so well shall not be counted.\"\n\n\"I will retain the right of choice,\" said Preciosa; and then she continued her way with her companions up the street, when some gentlemen called and beckoned to them from a latticed window. Preciosa went up and looked through the window, which was near the ground, into a cheerful, well-furnished apartment, in which several cavaliers were walking about, and others playing at various games. \"Will you give me a share of your winnings, se\u00f1ors?\" said Preciosa, in the lisping accent of the gipsies, which she spoke not by nature but from choice. At the sight of Preciosa, and at the sound of her voice, the players quitted the tables, the rest left off lounging, and all thronged to the window, for her fame had already reached them. \"Come in! Let the little gipsies come in,\" said the cavaliers, gaily; \"we will certainly give them a share of our winnings.\"\n\n\"But you might make it cost us dear, se\u00f1ors,\" said Preciosa.\n\n\"No, on the honour of gentlemen,\" said one, \"you may come in, ni\u00f1a, in full security that no one will touch the sole of your shoe. I swear this to you by the order I wear on my breast;\" and as he spoke he laid his hand on the cross of the order of Calatrava which he wore.\n\n\"If you like to go in, Preciosa,\" said one of the gitanillas who were with her, \"do so by all means; but I do not choose to go where there are so many men.\"\n\n\"Look you, Christina,\" answered Preciosa, \"what you have to beware of is one man alone; where there are so many there is nothing to fear. Of one thing you may be sure, Christina; the woman who is resolved to be upright may be so amongst an army of soldiers. It is well, indeed, to avoid occasions of temptation, but it is not in crowded rooms like this that danger lurks.\"\n\n\"Well then, let us go in, Preciosa,\" said her companion, \"you know more than a witch.\"\n\nThe old gipsy also encouraged them to go in, and that decided the question. As soon as they had entered the room, the cavalier of the order, seeing the paper which Preciosa carried, stretched out his hand to take it. \"Do not take it from me,\" she said: \"It is a romance but just given to me, and which I have not yet had time to read.\"\n\n\"And do you know how to read, my girl?\" said one of the cavaliers.\n\n\"Ay, and to write too,\" said the old woman. \"I have brought up my grandchild as if she was a lawyer's daughter.\"\nThe cavalier opened the paper, and finding a gold crown inclosed in it, said, \"Truly, Preciosa, the contents of this letter are worth the postage. Here is a crown inclosed in the romance.\"\n\n\"The poet has treated me like a beggar,\" said Preciosa; \"but it is certainly a greater marvel for one of his trade to give a crown than for one of mine to receive it. If his romances come to me with this addition, he may transscribe the whole Romancero General and send me every piece in it one by one. I will weigh their merit; and if I find there is good matter in them, I will not reject them. Read the paper aloud, se\u00f1or, that we may see if the poet is as wise as he is liberal.\" The cavalier accordingly read as follows:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sweet gipsy girl, whom envy's self\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must own of all fair maids the fairest,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ah! well befits thy stony heart\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The name thou, Preciosa,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[66] bearest.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If as in beauty, so in pride\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And cruelty thou grow to sight,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Woe worth the land, woe worth the age\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which brought thy fatal charms to light.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A basilisk in thee we see,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which fascinates our gaze and kills.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No empire mild is thine, but one\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That tyrannises o'er our wills.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How grew such charms 'mid gipsy tribes,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From roughest blasts without a shield?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How such a perfect chrysolite\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Could humble Manzanares yield?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0River, for this thou shalt be famed,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like Tagus with its golden show,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And more for Preciosa prized\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Than Ganges with its lavish flow.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In telling fortunes who can say\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What dupes to ruin thou beguilest?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good luck thou speak'st with smiling lips.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But luckless they on whom thou smilest!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tis said they're witches every one,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The women of the gipsy race;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And all men may too plainly see\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That thou hast witchcraft in thy face.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A thousand different modes are thine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To turn the brain; for rest or move,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speak, sing, be mute, approach, retire,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thou kindlest still the fire of love.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The freest hearts bend to thy sway,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And lose the pride of liberty;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bear witness mine, thy captive thrall,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which would not, if it could, be free.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These lines, thou precious gem of love,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whose praise all power of verse transcend,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He who for thee will live or die,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thy poor and humble lover sends.\n\n\"The poem ends with 'poor' in the last line,\" said Preciosa; \"and that is a bad sign. Lovers should never begin by saying that they are poor, for poverty, it strikes me, is a great enemy to love.\"\n\n\"Who teaches you these things, girl?\" said one of the cavaliers.\n\n\"Who should teach me?\" she replied. \"Have I not a soul in my body? Am I not fifteen years of age? I am neither lame, nor halt, nor maimed in my understanding. The wit of a gipsy girl steers by a different compass from that which guides other people. They are always forward for their years. There is no such thing as a stupid gitano, or a silly gitana. Since it is only by being sharp and ready that they can earn a livelihood, they polish their wits at every step, and by no means let the moss grow under their feet. You see these girls, my companions, who are so silent. You may think they are simpletons, but put your fingers in their mouths to see if they have cut their wise teeth; and then you shall see what you shall see. There is not a gipsy girl of twelve who does not know as much as one of another race at five-and-twenty, for they have the devil and much practice for instructors, so that they learn in one hour what would otherwise take them a year.\"\n\nThe company were much amused by the gitana's chat, and all gave her money. The old woman sacked thirty reals, and went off with her flock as merry as a cricket to the house of the se\u00f1or lieutenant, after promising that she would return with them another day to please such liberal gentlemen. Do\u00f1a Clara, the lieutenant's lady, had been apprised of the intended visit of the gipsies, and she and her doncellas and due\u00f1as, as well as those of another se\u00f1ora, her neighbour, were expecting them as eagerly as one looks for a shower in May. They had come to see Preciosa. She entered with her companions, shining among them like a torch among lesser lights, and all the ladies pressed towards her. Some kissed her, some gazed at her; others blessed her sweet face, others her graceful carriage. \"This, indeed, is what you may call golden hair,\" cried Do\u00f1a Clara; \"these are truly emerald eyes.\"[67] The se\u00f1ora, her neighbour, examined the gitanilla piecemeal. She made a pepetoria[68] of all her joints and members, and coming at last to a dimple in her chin, she said, \"Oh, what a dimple! it is a pit into which all eyes that behold it must fall.\" Thereupon an esquire in attendance on Do\u00f1a Clara, an elderly gentleman with a long beard, exclaimed, \"Call you this a dimple, se\u00f1ora? I know little of dimples then if this be one. It is no dimple, but a grave of living desires. I vow to God the gitanilla is such a dainty creature, she could not be better if she was made of silver or sugar paste. Do you know how to tell fortunes, ni\u00f1a?\"\n\n\"That I do, and in three or four different manners,\" replied Preciosa.\n\n\"You can do that too?\" exclaimed Do\u00f1a Clara. \"By the life of my lord the lieutenant, you must tell me mine, ni\u00f1a of gold, ni\u00f1a of silver, ni\u00f1a of pearls, ni\u00f1a of carbuncles, ni\u00f1a of heaven, and more than that cannot be said.\"\n\n\"Give the ni\u00f1a the palm of your hand, se\u00f1ora, and something to cross it with,\" said the old gipsy; \"and you will see what things she will tell you, for she knows more than a doctor of medicine.\"\n\nThe se\u00f1ora Tenienta[69] put her hand in her pocket, but found it empty; she asked for the loan of a quarto from her maids, but none of them had one, neither had the se\u00f1ora her neighbour. Preciosa seeing this, said, \"For the matter of crosses all are good, but those made with silver or gold are best. As for making the sign of the cross with copper money, that, ladies, you must know lessens the luck, at least it does mine. I always like to begin by crossing the palm with a good gold crown, or a piece of eight, or at least a quarto, for, I am like the sacristans who rejoice when there is a good collection.\"\n\n\"How witty you are,\" said the lady visitor; then turning to the squire, \"Do you happen to have a quarto about you, Se\u00f1or Contreras? if you have, give it me, and when my husband the doctor comes you shall have it again.\"\n\n\"I have one,\" replied Contreras, \"but it is pledged for two-and-twenty maravedis for my supper; give me so much and I will fly to fetch it.\"\n\n\"We have not a quarto amongst us all,\" said Do\u00f1a Clara, \"and you ask for two-and-twenty maravedis? Go your ways, Contreras, for a tiresome blockhead, as you always were.\"\n\nOne of the damsels present, seeing the penury of the house, said to Preciosa, \"Ni\u00f1a, will it be of any use to make the cross with a silver thimble?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Preciosa; \"the best crosses in the world are made with silver thimbles, provided there are plenty of them.\"\n\n\"I have one,\" said the doncella; \"if that is enough, here it is, on condition that my fortune be told too.\"\n\n\"So many fortunes to be told for a thimble!\" exclaimed the old gipsy. \"Make haste, granddaughter, for it will soon be night.\" Preciosa took the thimble, and began her sooth saying.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pretty lady, pretty lady,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a hand as silver fair,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How thy husband dearly loves thee\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Tis superfluous to declare.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thou'rt a dove, all milk of kindness;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet at times too thou canst be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wrathful as a tiger, or a\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lioness of Barbary.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thou canst show thy teeth when jealous;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Truly the lieutenant's sly;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loves with furtive sports to vary\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Magisterial gravity.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What a pity!

The se\u00f1or lieutenant now came in, and heard a glowing account of the charms and accomplishments of the leading gitana. Having made her and her companions dance a little, he emphatically confirmed the encomiums bestowed on Preciosa; and putting his hand in his pocket he groped and rummaged about in it for a while, but at last drew his hand out empty, saying, \"Upon my life I have not a doit. Give Preciosa a real, Do\u00f1a Clara; I will give it you by and by.\"\n\n\"That is all very well, se\u00f1or,\" the lady replied; \"but where is the real to come from? Amongst us all we could not find a quarto to cross our hands with.\"\n\n\"Well, give her some trinket or another, that Preciosa may come another day to see us, when we will treat her better.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Do\u00f1a Clara, \"I will give her nothing to-day, and I shall be sure she will come again.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Preciosa, \"if you give me nothing. I will never come here any more. Sell justice, se\u00f1or lieutenant, sell justice, and then you will have money. Do not introduce new customs, but do as other magistrates do, or you will die of hunger. Look you, se\u00f1or, I have heard say that money enough may be made of one's office to pay any mulets that may be incurred,[70] and to help one to other appointments.\"\n\n\"So say and do those who have no conscience,\" said the lieutenant; \"but the judge who does his duty will have no mulet to pay; and to have well discharged his office, will be his best help to obtain another.\"\n\n\"Your worship speaks like a very saint,\" replied Preciosa; \"proceed thus, and we shall snip pieces off your old coats for relics.\"\n\n\"You know a great deal, Preciosa,\" said the lieutenant; \"say no more, and I will contrive that their majesties shall see you, for you are fit to be shown to a king.\"\n\n\"They will want me for a court fool,\" said the gitanilla, \"and as I never shall learn the trade, your pains will be all for nothing. If they wanted me for my cleverness, they might have me; but in some palaces fools thrive better than the wise. I am content to be a gitana, and poor, and let Heaven dispose of me as it pleases.\"\n\n\"Come along, ni\u00f1a,\" said the old gipsy; \"say no more, you have said a great deal already, and know more than I ever taught you. Don't put too fine a point to your wit for fear it should get blunted; speak of things suitable to your years; and don't set yourself on the high ropes, lest you should chance to have a fall.\"\n\n\"The deuce is in these gitanas,\" said the delighted lieutenant, as they were taking their leave. The doncella of the thimble stopped them for a moment, saying to Preciosa, \"Tell me my fortune, or give me back my thimble, for I have not another to work with.\"\n\n\"Se\u00f1ora doncella,\" replied Preciosa, \"count upon your fortune as if it were already told, and provide yourself with another; or else sew no more gussets until I come again on Friday, when I will tell you more fortunes and adventures than you could read in any book of knight errantry.\"\n\nThe gipsies went away, and falling in with numerous workwomen returning from Madrid to their villages as usual at the Ave Maria, they joined company with them, as they always did for the greater security; for the old gipsy lived in perpetual terror lest some one should run away with her granddaughter.\n\nOne morning after this as they were returning to Madrid to levy black mail along with other gitanas, in a little valley about five hundred yards from the city, they met a handsome young gentleman richly dressed; his sword and dagger were a blazo of gold; his hat was looped with a jewelled band, and was adorned with plumes of various colours. The gitanas stopped on seeing him, and set themselves to observe his movements at their leisure, wondering much that so fine a cavalier should be alone and on foot in such a place at that early hour. He came up to them, and addressing the eldest gitana, said, \"On your life, friend, I entreat you do me the favour to let me say two words in private to you and Preciosa. It shall be for your good.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the old woman, \"so you do not take us much out of our way, or delay us long;\" and calling Preciosa, they withdrew to some twenty paces distance, where they stopped, and the young gentleman thus addressed them: \"I am so subdued by the wit and beauty of Preciosa, that after having in vain endeavoured to overcome my admiration, I have at last found the effort impossible. I, se\u00f1oras (for I shall always give you that title if heaven favours my pretensions), am a knight, as this dress may show you;\" and opening his cloak he displayed the insignia of one of the highest orders in Spain; \"I am the son of\u2014\u2014\" (here he mentioned a personage whose name we suppress for obvious reasons), \"and am still under tutelage and command. I am an only son, and expect to inherit a considerable estate. My father is here in the capital, looking for a certain post which by all accounts he is on the point of obtaining. Being then of the rank and condition which I have declared to you, I should yet wish to be a great lord for the sake of Preciosa, that I might raise her up to my own level, and make her my equal and my lady. I do not seek to deceive; the love I bear her is too deep for any kind of deception; I only desire to serve her in whatever way shall be most agreeable to her; her will is mine; for her my heart is wax to be moulded as she pleases but enduring as marble to retain whatever impression she shall make upon it. If you believe me I shall fear no discouragement from any other quarter, but if you doubt me, I shall despond. My name is\u2014\u2014; my father's I have already given you; he lives in such a house in such a street and you may inquire about him and me of the neighbours, and of others also; for our name and quality are not so obscure but that you may hear of us about the court, and every, where in the capital. I have here a hundred crowns in gold to present to you, as earnest of what I mean to give you hereafter; for a man will be no niggard of his wealth who has given away his very soul.\"\n\nWhilst the cavalier was speaking, Preciosa watched him attentively, and doubtless she saw nothing to dislike either in his language or his person. Turning to the old woman, she said, \"Pardon me, grandmother, if I take the liberty of answering this enamoured se\u00f1or myself.\"\n\n\"Make whatever answer you please, granddaughter,\" said the old woman, \"for I know you have sense enough for anything.\" So Preciosa began.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or cavalier,\" she said, \"though I am but a poor gitana and humbly born, yet I have a certain fantastic little spirit within me, which moves me to great things. Promises do not tempt me, nor presents sap my resolution, nor obsequiousness allure, nor amorous wiles ensnare me; and although by my grandmother's reckoning I shall be but fifteen next Michaelmas, I am already old in thought, and have more understanding than my years would seem to promise. This may, perhaps, be more from nature than from experience; but be that as it may, I know that the passion of love is an impetuous impulse, which violently distorts the current of the will, makes it dash furiously against all impediments, and recklessly pursue the desired object. But not unfrequently when the lover believes himself on the point of gaining the heaven of his wishes, he falls into the hell of disappointment. Or say that the object is obtained, the lover soon becomes wearied of his so much desired treasure, and opening the eyes of his understanding he finds that what before was so devoutly adored is now become abhorrent to him. The fear of such a result inspires me with so great a distrust, that I put no faith in words, and doubt many deeds. One sole jewel I have, which I prize more than life, and that is my virgin purity, which I will not sell for promises or gifts, for sold it would be in that case, and if it could be bought, small indeed would be its value. Nor is it to be filched from me by wiles or artifices; rather will I carry it with me to my grave, and perhaps to heaven, than expose it to danger by listening to specious tales and chimeras. It is a flower which nothing should be allowed to sully, even in imagination if it be possible. Nip the rose from the spray, and how soon it fades! One touches it, another smells it, a third plucks its leaves, and at last the flower perishes in vulgar hands. If you are come then, se\u00f1or, for this booty, you shall never bear it away except bound in the ties of wedlock. If you desire to be my spouse, I will be yours; but first there are many conditions to be fulfilled, and many points to be ascertained.\n\n\"In the first place I must know if you are the person you declare yourself to be. Next, should I find this to be true, you must straightway quit your father's mansion, and exchange it for our tents, where, assuming the garb of a gipsy, you must pass two years in our schools, during which I shall be able to satisfy myself as to your disposition, and you will become acquainted with mine. At the end of that period, if you are pleased with me and I with you, I will give myself up to you as your wife; but till then I will be your sister and your humble servant, and nothing more. Consider, se\u00f1or, that during the time of this novitiate you may recover your sight, which now seems lost, or at least disordered, and that you may then see fit to shun what now you pursue with so much ardour. You will then be glad to regain your lost liberty, and having done so, you may by sincere repentance obtain pardon of your family for your faults. If on these conditions you are willing to enlist in our ranks, the matter rests in your own hands; but if you fail in any one of them, you shall not touch a finger of mine.\"\n\nThe youth was astounded at Preciosa's decision, and remained as if spell-bound, with his eyes bent on the ground, apparently considering what answer he should return. Seeing this, Preciosa said to him, \"This is not a matter of such light moment that it can or ought to be resolved on the spot. Return, se\u00f1or, to the city, consider maturely what is best for you to do; and you may speak with me in this same place any week-day you please, as we are on our way to or from Madrid.\"\n\n\"When Heaven disposed me to love you, Preciosa,\" replied the cavalier, \"I determined to do for you whatever it might be your will to require of me, though it never entered my thoughts that you would make such a demand as you have now done; but since it is your pleasure that I should comply with it, count me henceforth as a gipsy, and put me to all the trials you desire, you will always find me the same towards you as I now profess myself. Fix the time when you will have me change my garb. I will leave my family under pretext of going to Flanders, and will bring with me money for my support for some time. In about eight days I shall be able to arrange for my departure, and I will contrive some means to get rid of my attendants, so as to be free to accomplish my purpose. What I would beg of you (if I might make bold to ask any favour) is that, except to-day for the purpose of inquiring about me and my family, you go no more to Madrid, for I would not that any of the numerous occasions that present themselves there, should deprive me of the good fortune I prize so dearly.\"\n\n\"Not so, se\u00f1or gallant,\" said Preciosa: \"wherever I go I must be free and unfettered; my liberty must not be restrained or encumbered by jealousy. Be assured, however, that I will not use it to such excess, but that any one may see from a mile off that my honesty is equal to my freedom. The first charge, therefore, I have to impose upon you is, that you put implicit confidence in me; for lovers who begin by being jealous, are either silly or deficient in confidence.\"\n\n\"You must have Satan himself within you, little one,\" said the old gipsy; \"why you talk like a bachelor of Salamanca. You know all about love and jealousy and confidence. How is this? You make me look like a fool, and I stand listening to you as to a person possessed, who talks Latin without knowing it.\"\n\n\"Hold your peace, grandmother,\" replied Preciosa; \"and know that all the things you have heard me say are mere trifles to the many greater truths that remain in my breast.\"\n\nAll that Preciosa said, and the sound sense she displayed, added fuel to the flame that burned in the breast of the enamoured cavalier. Finally, it was arranged that they should meet in the same place on that day sennight, when he would report how matters stood with him, and they would have had time to inquire into the truth of what he had told them. The young gentleman then took out a brocaded purse in which he said there were a hundred gold crowns, and gave it to the old woman; but Preciosa would by no means consent that she should take them.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, ni\u00f1a,\" said her grandmother; \"the best proof this se\u00f1or has given of his submission, is in thus having yielded up his arms to us in token of surrender. To give, upon whatever occasion it may be, is always the sign of a generous heart. Moreover, I do not choose that the gitanas should lose, through my fault, the reputation they have had for long ages of being greedy of lucre. Would you have me lose a hundred crowns, Preciosa? A hundred crowns in gold that one may stitch up in the hem of a petticoat not worth two reals, and keep them there as one holds a rent-charge on the pastures of Estramadura! Suppose that any of our children, grandchildren, or relations should fall by any mischance into the hands of justice, is there any eloquence so sure to touch the ears of the judge as the music of these crowns when they fall into his purse? Three times, for three different offences, I have seen myself all but mounted on the ass to be whipped; but once I got myself off by means of a silver mug, another time by a pearl necklace, and the third time with the help of forty pieces of eight, which I exchanged for quartos, throwing twenty reals into the bargain. Look you, ni\u00f1a, ours is a very perilous occupation, full of risks and accidents; and there is no defence that affords us more ready shelter and succour than the invincible arms of the great Philip: nothing beats the plus ultra.[71] For the two faces of a doubloon, a smile comes over the grim visage of the procurator and of all the other ministers of mischief, who are downright harpies to us poor gitanas, and have more mercy for highway robbers than for our poor hides. Let us be ever so ragged and wretched in appearance, they will not believe that we are poor, but say that we are like the doublets of the gavachos of Belmont, ragged and greasy and full of doubloons.\"\n\n\"Say no more, for heaven's sake, grandmother,\" said Preciosa; \"do not string together so many arguments for keeping the money, but keep it, and much good may it do you. I wish to God you would bury it in a grave out of which it may never return to the light, and that there may never be any need of it. We must, however, give some of it to these companions of ours, who must be tired of waiting so long for us.\"\n\n\"They shall see one coin out of this purse as soon as they will see the Grand Turk,\" the old woman replied. \"The good se\u00f1or will try if he has any silver coin or a few coppers remaining, to divide amongst them, for they will be content with a little.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" he said, and he took from his pocket three pieces of eight which he divided among the gitanas, with which they were more delighted than the manager of a theatre when he is placarded as victor in a contest with a rival. Finally it was settled that the party should meet there again in a week, as before mentioned, and that the young man's gipsy name should be Andrew Caballero, for that was a surname not unknown among the gipsies. Andrew (as we shall henceforth call him) could not find courage to embrace Preciosa, but darting his very soul into her with a glance, he went away without it, so to speak, and returned to Madrid. The gipsies followed soon after; and Preciosa, who already felt a certain interest in the handsome and amiable Andrew, was anxious to learn if he was really what he said.\n\nThey had not gone far before they met the page of the verses and the gold crown. \"Welcome, Preciosa,\" he said, coming up to her. \"Have you read the lines I gave you the other day?\"\n\n\"Before I answer you a word,\" said she, \"you must, by all you love best, tell me one thing truly.\"\n\n\"Upon that adjuration,\" he replied, \"I could not refuse an answer to any question, though it should cost me my head.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what I want to know is this: are you, perchance, a poet?\"\n\n\"If I were one, it would certainly be perchance,\" said the page; \"but you must know, Preciosa, that the name of poet is one which very few deserve. Thus I am not a poet, but only a lover of poetry; yet for my own use I do not borrow of others. The verses I gave you were mine, as are these also which I give you now; but I am not a poet for all that\u2014God forbid.\"\n\n\"Is it such a bad thing to be a poet?\" Preciosa asked.\n\n\"It is not a bad thing,\" he answered; \"but to be a poet and nothing else I do not hold to be very good. We should use poetry like a rich jewel, the owner of which does not wear it every day, or show it to all people, but displays it only at suitable times. Poetry is a beautiful maiden, chaste, honest, discreet, reserved, and never overstepping the limits of perfect refinement. She is fond of solitude; she finds pleasure and recreation among fountains, meadows, trees, and flowers; and she delights and instructs all who are conversant with her.\"\n\n\"I have heard for all that,\" said Preciosa, \"that she is exceedingly poor; something of a beggar in short.\"\n\n\"It is rather the reverse,\" said the page, \"for there is no poet who is not rich, since they all live content with their condition; and that is a piece of philosophy which few understand. But what has moved you, Preciosa, to make this inquiry?\"\n\n\"I was moved to it, because, as I believe all poets, or most of them, to be poor, that crown which you gave me wrapped up with the verses caused me some surprise; but now that I know that you are not a poet, but only a lover of poetry, it may be that you are rich, though I doubt it, for your propensity is likely to make you run through all you have got. It is a well-known saying, that no poet can either keep or make a fortune.\"\n\n\"But the saying is not applicable to me,\" said the page. \"I make verses, and I am neither rich nor poor; and without feeling it or making a talk about it, as the Genoese do of their invitations, I can afford to give a crown, or even two, to whom I like. Take then, precious pearl, this second paper, and this second crown enclosed in it, without troubling yourself with the question whether I am a poet or not. I only beg you to think and believe that he who gives you this would fain have the wealth of Midas to bestow upon you.\"\n\nPreciosa took the paper, and feeling a crown within it, she said, \"This paper bids fair to live long, for it has two souls within it, that of the crown and that of the verses, which, of course, are full of souls and hearts as usual. But please to understand, Se\u00f1or Page, that I do not want so many souls; and that unless you take back one of them, I will not receive the other on any account. I like you as a poet and not as a giver of gifts; and thus we may be the longer friends, for your stock of crowns may run out sooner than your verses.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the page, \"since you will have it that I am poor, do not reject the soul I present to you in this paper, and give me back the crown, which, since it has been touched by your hand, shall remain with me as a hallowed relic as long as I live.\"\n\nPreciosa gave him the crown, and kept the paper, but would not read it in the street. The page went away exulting in the belief that Preciosa's heart was touched, since she had treated him with such affability.\n\nIt being now her object to find the house of Andrew's father, she went straight to the street, which she well knew, without stopping anywhere to dance. About half way down it, she saw the gilded iron balcony which Andrew had mentioned to her, and in it a gentleman of about fifty years of age, of noble presence, with a red cross on his breast. This gentleman seeing the gitanilla, called out, \"Come up here, ni\u00f1as, and we will give you something.\" These words brought three other gentlemen to the balcony, among whom was the enamoured Andrew. The instant he cast his eyes on Preciosa he changed colour, and well nigh swooned, such was the effect her sudden appearance had upon him. The girls went up stairs, whilst the old woman remained below to pump the servants with respect to Andrew. As they entered the room, the elder gentleman was saying to the others, \"This is no doubt the handsome gitanilla who is so much talked of in Madrid.\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Andrew; \"and she is unquestionably the most beautiful creature that ever was seen.\"\n\n\"So they say,\" said Preciosa, who had overheard these remarks as she came in; \"but indeed they must be half out in the reckoning. I believe I am pretty well, but as handsome as they say\u2014not a bit of it!\"\n\n\"By the life of Don Juanico, my son,\" said the elder gentleman, \"you are far more so, fair gitana.\"\n\n\"And who is Don Juanico, your son?\" said Preciosa.\n\n\"That gallant by your side,\" said the cavalier.\n\n\"Truly, I thought your worship had sworn by some bantling of two years old,\" said Preciosa. \"What a pretty little pet of a Don Juanico![72] Why he is old enough to be married; and by certain lines on his forehead, I foresee that married he will be before three years are out, and much to his liking too, if in the meantime he be neither lost nor changed.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" said one of the company; \"the gitanilla can tell the meaning of a wrinkle.\"\n\nDuring this time, the three gipsy girls, who accompanied Preciosa, had got their heads together and were whispering each other. \"Girls,\" said Christina, \"that is the gentleman that gave us the three pieces of eight this morning.\"\n\n\"Sure enough,\" said they; \"but don't let us say a word about it unless he mentions it. How do we know but he may wish to keep it secret?\"\n\nWhilst the three were thus conferring together, Preciosa replied to the last remark about wrinkles. \"What I see with my eyes, I divine with my fingers. Of the Se\u00f1or Don Juanico, I know without lines that he is somewhat amorous, impetuous, and hasty; and a great promiser of things that seem impossible. God grant he be not a deceiver, which would be worse than all. He is now about to make a long journey; but the bay horse thinks one thing, and the man that saddles him thinks another thing. Man proposes and God disposes. Perhaps he may think he is bound for O\u00f1ez, and will find himself on the way to Gaviboa.\"\n\n\"In truth, gitana,\" said Don Juan, \"you have guessed right respecting me in several points. I certainly intend, with God's will, to set out for Flanders in four or five days, though you forebode that I shall have to turn out of my road; yet I hope no obstacle will occur to frustrate my purpose.\"\n\n\"Say no more, se\u00f1orito,\" the gipsy replied; \"but commend yourself to God, and all will be well. Be assured I know nothing at all of what I have been saying. It is no wonder if I sometimes hit the mark, since I talk so much and always at random. I wish I could speak to such good purpose as to persuade you not to leave home, but remain quietly with your parents to comfort their old age; for I am no friend to these Flanders expeditions, especially for a youth of your tender years. Wait till you are grown a little more and better able to bear the toils of war; and the rather as you have war enough at home, considering all the amorous conflicts that are raging in your bosom. Gently, gently with you, madcap! Look what you are doing before you marry; and now give us a little dole for God's sake and for the name you bear; for truly I believe you are well born, and if along with this you are loyal and true, then I will sing jubilee for having hit the mark in all I have said to you.\"\n\n\"I told you before, ni\u00f1a,\" said Don Juan, otherwise Andrew Caballero, \"that you were right on every point except as to the fear you entertain that I am not quite a man of my word. In that respect you are certainly mistaken. The word that I pledge in the field I fulfil in the town, or wherever I may be, without waiting to be asked; for no man can esteem himself a gentleman, who yields in the least to the vice of falsehood. My father will give you alms for God's sake and for mine; for in truth I gave all I had this morning to some ladies, of whom I would not venture to assert that they are as obliging as they are beautiful, one of them especially.\"\n\nHearing this, Christina said to her companions, \"May I be hanged, girls, if he is not talking of the three pieces of eight he gave us this morning.\"\n\n\"No, that can't be,\" one of them observed; \"for he said they were ladies, and we are none; and being so true-spoken as he says he is, he would not lie in this matter.\"\n\n\"Oh, but,\" said Christina, \"that is not a lie of any moment that is told without injury to anybody, but for the advantage and credit of him who tells it. Be that as it may, I see he neither gives us anything, nor asks us to dance.\"\n\nThe old gipsy now came into the room and said, \"Make haste, granddaughter; for it is late, and there is much to be done, and more to be said.\"\n\n\"What is it, grandmother?\" said Preciosa, \"A boy or a girl?\"\n\n\"A boy, and a very fine one. Come along, Preciosa, and you shall hear marvels.\"\n\n\"God grant the mother does not die of her after pains,\" said the granddaughter.\n\n\"We will take all possible care of her. She has had a very good time, and the child is a perfect beauty.\"\n\n\"Has any lady been confined?\" said Andrew's father.\n\n\"Yes, se\u00f1or,\" replied the old Gitana: \"but it is such a secret, that no one knows of it except Preciosa, myself, and one other person. So we cannot mention the lady's name.\"\n\n\"Well, we don't want to know it,\" said one of the gentlemen present; \"but God help the lady who trusts her secret to your tongues, and her honour to your aid.\"\n\n\"We are not all bad,\" replied Preciosa; \"perhaps there may be one among us who piques herself on being as trusty and as true as the noblest man in this room. Let us begone, grandmother; for here we are held in little esteem, though in truth we are neither thieves nor beggars.\"\n\n\"Do not be angry, Preciosa,\" said Andrew's father. \"Of you at least I imagine no one can presume anything ill, for your good looks are warrant for your good conduct. Do me the favour to dance a little with your companions. I have here a doubloon for you with two faces, and neither of them as good as your own, though they are the faces of two kings.\"\n\nThe moment the old woman heard this she cried, \"Come along, girls: tuck up your skirts, and oblige these gentlemen.\" Preciosa took the tambourine, and they all danced with so much grace and freedom, that the eyes of all the spectators were riveted upon their steps, especially those of Andrew, who gazed upon Preciosa as if his whole soul was centred in her; but an untoward accident turned his delight into anguish. In the exertion of the dance, Preciosa let fall the paper given her by the page. It was immediately picked up by the gentleman who had no good opinion of the gipsies. He opened it, and said, \"What have we here? A madrigal? Good! Break off the dance, and listen to it; for, as far as I can judge from the beginning, it is really not bad.\" Preciosa was annoyed at this, as she did not know the contents of the paper; and she begged the gentleman not to read it, but give it back to her. All her entreaties, however, only made Andrew more eager to hear the lines, and his friend read them out as follows:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who hath Preciosa seen\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dancing like the Fairy Queen?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ripplets on a sunlit river\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like her small feet glance and quiver.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When she strikes the timbrel featly,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When she warbles, oh how sweetly!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pearls from her white hands she showers,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From her rosy lips drop flowers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not a ringlet of her hair\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But doth thousand souls ensnare.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not a glance of her bright eyes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But seems shot from Love's own skies.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He in obeisance to this sovereign maid,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His bow and quiver at her feet hath laid.\n\n\"Por dios!\" exclaimed the reader, \"he is a dainty poet who wrote this.\"\n\n\"He is not a poet, se\u00f1or,\" said Preciosa, \"but a page, and a very gallant and worthy man.\"\n\n\"Mind what you say, Preciosa,\" returned the other; \"for the praises you bestow on the page are so many lance-thrusts through Andrew's heart. Look at him as he sits aghast, thrown back on his chair, with a cold perspiration breaking through all his pores. Do not imagine, maiden, that he loves you so lightly but that the least slight from you distracts him. Go to him, for God's sake, and whisper a few words in his ear, that may go straight to his heart, and recall him to himself. Go on receiving such madrigals as this every day, and just see what will come of it.\"\n\nIt was just as he had said. Andrew had been racked by a thousand jealousies on hearing the verses; and was so overcome that his father observed it, and cried out, \"What ails you, Don Juan? You are turned quite pale, and look as if you were going to faint.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Preciosa, \"let me whisper certain words in his ear, and you will see that he will not faint.\" Then bending over him she said, almost without moving her lips, \"A pretty sort of gitano you will make! Why, Andrew, how will you be able to bear the torture with gauze,[73] when you are overcome by a bit of paper?\" Then making half-a-dozen signs of the cross over his heart, she left him, after which Andrew breathed a little, and told his friends that Preciosa's words had done him good.\n\nFinally, the two-faced doubloon was given to Preciosa, who told her companions that she would change it, and share the amount honourably with them. Andrew's father intreated her to leave him in writing the words she had spoken to his son, as he wished by all means to know them. She said she would repeat them with great pleasure; and that though they might appear to be mere child's play, they were of sovereign virtue to preserve from the heartache and dizziness of the head. The words were these:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Silly pate, silly pate,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why run on at this rate?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No tripping, or slipping, or sliding!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Have trusty assurance,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And patient endurance\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And ever be frank and confiding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To ugly suspicion\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Refuse all admission,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor let it your better sense twist over.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All this if you do\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You'll not rue,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For excellent things will ensue,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the good help of God and St. Christopher.\n\n\"Only say these words,\" she continued, \"over any person who has a swimming in the head, making at the same time six signs of the cross over his heart, and he will soon be as sound as an apple.\"\n\nWhen the old woman heard the charm, she was amazed at the clever trick played by her granddaughter; and Andrew was still more so when he found that the whole was an invention of her quick wit. Preciosa left the madrigal in the hands of the gentleman, not liking to ask for it, lest she should again distress Andrew; for she knew, without any one teaching her, what it was to make a lover feel the pangs of jealousy. Before she took her leave, she said to Don Juan, \"Every day of the week, se\u00f1or, is lucky for beginning a journey: not one of them is black. Hasten your departure, therefore, as much as you can; for there lies before you a free life of ample range and great enjoyment, if you choose to accommodate yourself to it.\"\n\n\"It strikes me that a soldier's life is not so free as you say,\" replied Andrew, \"but one of submission rather than liberty. However, I will see what I can do.\"\n\n\"You will see more than you think for,\" said Preciosa; \"and may God have you in his keeping, and lead you to happiness, as your goodly presence deserves.\"\n\nThese farewell words filled Andrew with delight; the gitanas went away no less gratified, and shared the doubloon between them, the old woman as usual taking a part and a half, both by reason of her seniority, as because she was the compass by which they steered their course on the wide sea of their dances, pleasantry, and tricks.\n\nAt last the appointed day of meeting came, and Andrew arrived in the morning at the old trysting place, mounted on a hired mule, and without any attendant. He found Preciosa and her grandmother waiting for him, and was cordially welcomed by them. He begged they would take him at once to the rancho,[74] before it was broad day, that he might not be recognised should he be sought for. The two gitanas, who had taken the precaution to come alone, immediately wheeled round, and soon arrived with him at their huts. Andrew entered one of them, which was the largest in the rancho, where he was forthwith assisted by ten or twelve gitanos, all handsome strapping young fellows, whom the old woman had previously informed respecting the new comrade who was about to join them. She had not thought it necessary, to enjoin them to secrecy; for, as we have already said, they habitually observed it with unexampled sagacity and strictness. Their eyes were at once on the mule, and said one of them, \"We can sell this on Thursday in Toledo.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" said Andrew; \"for there is not a hired mule in Madrid, or any other town, but is known to all the muleteers that tramp the roads of Spain.\"\n\n\"Por dios, Se\u00f1or Andrew,\" said one of the gang, \"if there were more signs and tokens upon the mule than are to precede the day of judgment, we will transform it in such a manner that it could not be known by the mother that bore it, or the master that owned it.\"\n\n\"That maybe,\" said Andrew; \"but for this time you must do as I recommend. This mule must be killed, and buried where its bones shall never be seen.\"\n\n\"Put the innocent creature to death!\" cried another gipsy. \"What a sin! Don't say the word, good Andrew; only do one thing. Examine the beast well, till you have got all its marks well by heart; then let me take it away, and if in two hours from this time you are able to know, it again, let me be basted like a runaway negro.\"\n\n\"I must insist upon the mule's being put to death,\" said Andrew, \"though I were ever so sure of its transformation. I am in fear of being discovered unless it is put under ground. If you object for sake of the profit to be made by selling it, I am not come so destitute to this fraternity but that I can pay my footing with more than the price of four mules.\"\n\n\"Well, since the Se\u00f1or Andrew Caballero will have it so,\" said the other gitano, \"let the sinless creature die, though God knows how much it goes against me, both because of its youth, for it has not yet lost mark of mouth, a rare thing among hired mules, and because it must be a good goer, for it has neither scars on its flank nor marks of the spur.\"\n\nThe slaughter of the mule was postponed till night, and the rest of the day was spent in the ceremonies of Andrew's initiation. They cleared out one of the best huts in the encampment, dressed it with boughs and rushes, and seating Andrew in it on the stump of a cork tree, they put a hammer and tongs in his hands, and made him cut two capers to the sound of two guitars. They then bared one of his arms, tied round it a new silk ribbon through which they passed a short stick, and gave it two turns gently, after the manner of the garotte with which criminals are strangled. Preciosa was present at all this, as were many other gitanas, old and young, some of whom gazed at Andrew with admiration, others with love, and such was his good humour, that even the gitanos took most kindly to him.\n\nThese ceremonies being ended, an old gipsy took Preciosa by the hand, and setting her opposite Andrew, spoke thus: \"This girl, who is the flower and cream of all beauty among the gitanas of Spain, we give to you either for your wife or your mistress, for in that respect you may do whatever shall be most to your liking, since our free and easy life is not subject to squeamish scruples or to much ceremony. Look at her well, and see if she suits you, or if there is anything in her you dislike; if there is, choose from among the maidens here present the one you like best, and we will give her to you. But bear in mind that once your choice is made, you must not quit it for another, nor make or meddle either with the married women or the maids. We are strict observers of the law of good fellowship; none among us covets the good that belongs to another. We live free and secure from the bitter plague of jealousy; and though incest is frequent amongst us there is no adultery. If a wife or a mistress is unfaithful, we do not go ask the courts of justice to punish; but we ourselves are the judges and executioners of our wives and mistresses, and make no more ado about killing and burying them in the mountains and desert places than if they were vermin. There are no relations to avenge them, no parents to call us to account for their deaths. By reason of this fear and dread, our women learn to live chaste; and we, as I have said, feel no uneasiness about their virtue.\n\n\"We have few things which are not common to us all, except wives and mistresses, each of whom we require to be his alone to whom fortune has allotted her. Among us divorce takes place, because of old age as well as by death. Any man may if he likes leave a woman who is too old for him, and choose one more suitable to his years. By means of these and other laws and statutes we contrive to lead a merry life. We are lords of the plains, the corn fields, the woods, mountains, springs, and rivers. The mountains yield us wood for nothing, the orchards fruit, the vineyards grapes, the gardens vegetables, the fountains water, the rivers fish, the parks feathered game; the rocks yield us shade, the glades and valleys fresh air, and the caves shelter. For us the inclemencies of the weather are zephyrs, the snow refreshment, the rain baths, the thunder music, and the lightning torches. For us the hard ground is a bed of down; the tanned skin of our bodies is an impenetrable harness to defend us; our nimble limbs submit to no obstacle from iron bars, or trenches, or walls; our courage is not to be twisted out of us by cords, or choked by gauze,[75] or quelled by the rack.\n\n\"Between yes and no we make no difference when it suits our convenience to confound them; we always pride ourselves more on being martyrs than confessors. For us the beasts of burden are reared in the fields, and pockets are filled in the cities. No eagle or other bird of prey pounces more swiftly on its quarry than we upon opportunities that offer us booty. And finally, we possess many qualities which promise us a happy end; for we sing in prison, are silent on the rack, work by day, and by night we thieve, or rather we take means to teach all men that they should exempt themselves from the trouble of seeing where they put their property. We are not distressed by the fear of losing our honour, or kept awake by ambition to increase it. We attach ourselves to no parties; we do not rise by day-light to attend levees and present memorials, or to swell the trains of magnates, or to solicit favours. Our gilded roofs and sumptuous palaces are these portable huts; our Flemish pictures and landscapes are those which nature presents to our eyes at every step in the rugged cliffs and snowy peaks, the spreading meads and leafy groves. We are rustic astronomers, for as we sleep almost always under the open sky, we can tell every hour by day or night. We see how Aurora extinguishes and sweeps away the stars from heaven, and how she comes forth with her companion the dawn, enlivening the air, refreshing the water, and moistening the earth; and after her appears the sun gilding the heights, as the poet sings, and making the mountains smile. We are not afraid of being left chilly by his absence, when his rays fall aslant upon us, or of being roasted when they blaze down upon us perpendicularly. We turn the same countenance to sun and frost, to dearth and plenty. In conclusion, we are people who live by our industry and our wits, without troubling ourselves with the old adage, 'The church, the sea, or the king's household.' We have all we want, for we are content with what we have.\n\n\"All these things have I told you, generous youth, that you may not be ignorant of the life to which you are come, and the manners and customs you will have to profess, which I have here sketched for you in the rough. Many other particulars, no less worthy of consideration, you will discover for yourself in process of time.\"\n\nHere the eloquent old gitano closed his discourse, and the novice replied, that he congratulated himself much on having been made acquainted with such laudable statutes; that he desired to make profession of an order so based on reason and politic principles; that his only regret was that he had not sooner come to the knowledge of so pleasant a life; and that from that moment he renounced his knighthood, and the vain glory of his illustrious lineage, and placed them beneath the yoke, or beneath the laws under which they lived, forasmuch as they so magnificently recompensed the desire he had to serve them, in bestowing upon him the divine Preciosa, for whom he would surrender many crowns and wide empires, or desire them only for her sake.\n\nPreciosa spoke next: \"Whereas these se\u00f1ores, our lawgivers,\" she said, \"have determined, according to their laws that I should be yours, and as such have given me up to you, I have decreed, in accordance with the law of my own will, which is the strongest of all, that I will not be so except upon the conditions heretofore concerted between us two. You must live two years in our company before you enjoy mine, so that you may neither repent through fickleness, nor I be deceived through precipitation. Conditions supersede laws; those which I have prescribed you know; if you choose to keep them, I may be yours, and you mine; if not, the mule is not dead, your clothes are whole, and not a doit of your money is spent. Your absence from home has not yet extended to the length of a day; what remains you may employ in considering what best suits you. These se\u00f1ores may give up my body to you, but not my soul, which is free, was born free, and shall remain free. If you remain, I shall esteem you much; if you depart, I shall do so no less; for I hold that amorous impulses run with a loose rein, until they are brought to a halt by reason or disenchantment. I would not have you be towards me like the sportsman, who when he has bagged a hare thinks no more of it, but runs after another. The eyes are sometimes deceived; at first sight tinsel looks like gold; but they soon recognise the difference between the genuine and the false metal. This beauty of mine, which you say I possess, and which you exalt above the sun, and declare more precious than gold, how do I know but that at a nearer view it will appear to you a shadow, and when tested will seem but base metal? I give you two years to weigh and ponder well what will be right to choose or reject. Before you buy a jewel, which you can only get rid of by death, you ought to take much time to examine it, and ascertain its faults or its merits. I do not assent to the barbarous licence which these kinsmen of mine have assumed, to forsake their wives or chastise them when the humour takes them; and as I do not intend to do anything which calls for punishment, I will not take for my mate one who will abandon me at his own caprice.\"\n\n\"You are right, Preciosa,\" said Andrew; \"and so if you would have me quiet your fears and abate your doubts, by swearing not to depart a jot from the conditions you prescribe, choose what form of oath I shall take, or what other assurance I shall give you, and I will do exactly as you desire.\"\n\n\"The oaths and promises which the captive makes to obtain his liberty are seldom fulfilled when he is free,\" returned Preciosa; \"and it is just the same, I fancy, with the lover, who to obtain his desire will promise the wings of Mercury, and the thunderbolts of Jove; and indeed a certain poet promised myself no less, and swore it by the Stygian lake. I want no oaths or promises, Se\u00f1or Andrew, but to leave everything to the result of this novitiate. It will be my business to take care of myself, if at any time you should think of offending me.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" said Andrew. \"One request I have to make of these se\u00f1ores and comrades mine, and that is that they will not force me to steal anything for a month or so; for it strikes me that it will take a great many lessons to make me a thief.\"\n\n\"Never fear, my son,\" said the old gipsy; \"for we will instruct you in such a manner that you will turn out an eagle in our craft; and when you have learned it, you will like it so much, that you will be ready to eat your hand, it will so itch after it. Yes, it is fine fun to go out empty-handed in the morning, and to return loaded at night to the rancho.\"\n\n\"I have seen some return with a whipping,\" said Andrew.\n\n\"One cannot catch trouts dry shod,\" the old man replied: \"all things in this life have their perils: the acts of the thief are liable to the galleys, whipping, and the scragging-post; but it is not because one ship encounters a storm, or springs a leak, that others should cease to sail the seas. It would be a fine thing if there were to be no soldiers, because war consumes men and horses. Besides, a whipping by the hand of justice is for us a badge of honour, which becomes us better worn on the shoulders than on the breast. The main point is to avoid having to dance upon nothing in our young days and for our first offences; but as for having our shoulders dusted, or thrashing the water in a galley, we don't mind that a nutshell. For the present, Andrew, my son, keep snug in the nest under the shelter of our wings; in duo time, we will take you out to fly, and that where you will not return without a prey; and the short and the long of it is, that by and by you will lick your fingers after every theft.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" said Andrew, \"as a compensation for what I might bring in by thieving during the vacation allowed me, I will divide two hundred gold crowns among all the members of the rancho.\"\n\nThe words were no sooner out of his mouth, than several gitanos caught him up in their arms, hoisted him upon their shoulders, and bore him along, shouting, \"Long life to the great Andrew, and long life to Preciosa his beloved!\" The gitanas did the same with Preciosa, not without exciting the envy of Christina, and the other gitanillas present; for envy dwells alike in the tents of barbarians, the huts of shepherds, and the palaces of princes; and to see another thrive who seems no better than oneself is a great weariness to the spirit.\n\nThis done, they ate a hearty dinner, made an equitable division of the gift money, repeated their praises of Andrew, and exalted Preciosa's beauty to the skies. When night fell, they broke the mule's neck, and buried it, so as to relieve Andrew of all fear of its leading to his discovery; they likewise buried with it the trappings, saddle, bridle, girths and all, after the manner of the Indians, whose chief ornaments are laid in the grave with them.\n\nAndrew was in no small astonishment at all he had seen and heard, and resolved to pursue his enterprise without meddling at all with the customs of his new companions, so far as that might be possible. Especially he hoped to exempt himself, at the cost of his purse, from participating with them in any acts of injustice. On the following day, Andrew requested the gipsies to break up the camp, and remove to a distance from Madrid; for he feared that he should be recognised if he remained there. They told him they had already made up their minds to go to the mountains of Toledo, and thence to scour all the surrounding country, and lay it under contribution. Accordingly they struck their tents, and departed, offering Andrew an ass to ride; but he chose rather to travel on foot, and serve as attendant to Preciosa, who rode triumphantly another ass, rejoicing in her gallant esquire; whilst he was equally delighted at finding himself close to her whom he had made the mistress of his freedom.\n\nO potent force of him who is called the sweet god of bitterness\u2014a title given him by our idleness and weakness\u2014how effectually dost thou enslave us! Here was Andrew, a knight, a youth of excellent parts, brought up at court, and maintained in affluence by his noble parents; and yet since yesterday such a change has been wrought in him that he has deceived his servants and friends; disappointed the hopes of his parents; abandoned the road to Flanders, where he was to have exercised his valour and increased the honours of his line; and he has prostrated himself at the feet of a girl, made himself the lackey of one who, though exquisitely beautiful, is after all a gitana! Wondrous prerogative of beauty, which brings down the strongest will to its feet, in spite of all its resistance!\n\nIn four days' march, the gipsies arrived at a pleasant village, within two leagues of the great Toledo, where they pitched their camp, having first given some articles of silver to the alcalde of the district, as a pledge that they would steal nothing within all his bounds, nor do any other damage that might give cause of complaint against them. This done, all the old gitanas, some young ones, and the men, spread themselves all over the country, to the distance of four or five leagues from the encampment. Andrew went with them to take his first lesson in thievery; but though they gave him many in that expedition, he did not profit by any of them. On the contrary, as was natural in a man of gentle blood, every theft committed by his masters wrung his very soul, and sometimes he paid for them out of his own pocket, being moved by the tears of the poor people who had been despoiled. The gipsies were in despair at this behavior: it was in contravention, they said, of their statutes and ordinances, which prohibited the admission of compassion into their hearts; because if they had any they must cease to be thieves,\u2014a thing which was not to be thought of on any account. Seeing this, Andrew said he would go thieving by himself; for he was nimble enough to run from danger, and did not lack courage to encounter it; so that the prize or the penalty of his thieving would be exclusively his own.\n\nThe gipsies tried to dissuade him from this good purpose, telling him that occasions might occur in which he would have need of companions, as well to attack as to defend; and that one person alone could not make any great booty. But in spite of all they could say, Andrew was determined to be a solitary robber; intending to separate from the gang, and purchase for money something which he might say he had stolen, and thus burden his conscience as little as possible. Proceeding in this way, in less than a month, he brought more gain to the gang than four of the most accomplished thieves in it. Preciosa rejoiced not a little to see her tender lover become such a smart and handy thief; but for all that she was sorely afraid of some mischance, and would not have seen him in the hands of justice for all the treasures of Venice; such was the good feeling towards him which she could not help entertaining, in return for his many good offices and presents. After remaining about a month in the Toledan district, where they reaped a good harvest, the gipsies entered the wealthy region of Estramadura.\n\nMeanwhile Andrew frequently held honourable and loving converse with Preciosa, who was gradually becoming enamoured of his good qualities; while, in like manner, his love for her went on increasing, if that were possible: such were the virtues, the good sense and beauty of his Preciosa. Whenever the gipsies engaged in athletic games, he carried off the prize for running and leaping: he played admirably at skittles and at ball, and pitched the bar with singular strength and dexterity. In a short while, his fame spread through all Estramadura, and there was no part of it where they did not speak of the smart young gitano Andrew, and his graces and accomplishments. As his fame extended, so did that of Preciosa's beauty; and there was no town, village, or hamlet, to which they were not invited, to enliven their patron saints' days, or other festivities. The tribe consequently became rich, prosperous, and contented, and the lovers were happy in the mere sight of each other.\n\nIt happened one night, when the camp was pitched among some evergreen oaks, a little off the highway, they heard their dogs barking about the middle watch, with unusual vehemence. Andrew and some others got up to see what was the matter, and found a man dressed in white battling with them, whilst one of them held him by the leg. \"What the devil brought you here, man,\" said one of the gipsies, after they had released him, \"at such an hour, away from the high road? Did you come to thieve? If so, you have come to the right door?\"\n\n\"I do not come to thieve; and I don't know whether or not I am off the road, though I see well enough that I am gone astray,\" said the wounded man. \"But tell me, se\u00f1ores, is there any venta or place of entertainment where I can get a night's lodging, and dress the wounds which these dogs have given me?\"\n\n\"There is no venta or public place to which we can take you,\" replied Andrew; \"but as for a night's lodging, and dressing your wounds, that you can have at our ranchos. Come along with us; for though we are gipsies, we are not devoid of humanity.\"\n\n\"God reward you!\" said the man: \"take me whither you please, for my leg pains me greatly.\" Andrew lifted him up, and carried him along with the help of some of the other compassionate gipsies; for even among the fiends there are some worse than others, and among many bad men you may find one good.\n\nIt was a clear moonlight night, so that they could see that the person they carried was a youth of handsome face and figure. He was dressed all in white linen, with a sort of frock of the same material belted round his waist. They arrived at Andrew's hut or shed, quickly kindled a fire, and fetched Preciosa's grandmother to attend to the young man's hurts. She took some of the dogs' hairs, fried them in oil, and after washing with wine the two bites she found on the patient's left leg, she put the hairs and the oil upon them, and over this dressing a little chewed green rosemary. She then bound the leg up carefully with clean bandages, made the sign of the cross over it, and said, \"Now go to sleep, friend and with the help of God your hurts will not signify.\"\n\nWhilst they were attending to the wounded man, Preciosa stood by, eyeing him with great curiosity, whilst he did the same by her, insomuch that Andrew took notice of the eagerness with which he gazed; but he attributed this to the extraordinary beauty of Preciosa, which naturally attracted all eyes. Finally, having done all that was needful for the youth, they left him alone on a bed of dry hay, not caring to question him then as to his road, or any other matter.\n\nAs soon as all the others were gone, Preciosa called Andrew aside, and said to him, \"Do you remember, Andrew, a paper I let fall in your house, when I was dancing with my companions, and which caused you, I think, some uneasiness?\"\n\n\"I remember it well,\" said Andrew; \"it was a madrigal in your praise, and no bad one either.\"\n\n\"Well, you must know, Andrew, that the person who wrote those verses is no other than the wounded youth we have left in the hut. I cannot be mistaken, for he spoke to me two or three times in Madrid, and gave me too a very good romance. He was then dressed, I think, as a page,\u2014not an ordinary one, but like a favourite of some prince. I assure you, Andrew, he is a youth of excellent understanding, and remarkably well behaved; and I cannot imagine what can have brought him hither, and in such a garb.\"\n\n\"What should you imagine, Preciosa, but that the same power which has made me a gitano, has made him put on the dress of a miller, and come in search of you? Ah, Preciosa! Preciosa! how plain it begins to be that you pride yourself on having more than one adorer. If this be so, finish me first, and then kill off this other, but do not sacrifice both at the same time to your perfidy.\"\n\n\"God's mercy, Andrew, how thin-skinned you are! On how fine a thread you make your hopes and my reputation hang, since you let the cruel sword of jealousy so easily pierce your soul. Tell me, Andrew, if there were any artifice or deceit in this case, could I not have held my tongue about this youth, and concealed all knowledge of him? Am I such a fool that I cannot help telling you what should make you doubt my integrity and good behaviour? Hold your tongue, Andrew, in God's name, and try to-morrow to extract from this cause of your alarm whither he is bound, and why he is come hither. It may be that you are mistaken in your suspicion, though I am not mistaken in what I told you of the stranger. And now for your greater satisfaction\u2014since it is come to that pass with me that I seek to satisfy you\u2014whatever be the reason of this youth's coming, send him away at once. All our people obey you, and none of them will care to receive him into their huts against your wish. But if this fails, I give you my word not to quit mine, or let myself be seen by him, or by anybody else from whom you would have me concealed. Look you, Andrew, I am not vexed at seeing you jealous, but it would vex me much to see you indiscreet.\"\n\n\"Unless you see me mad, Preciosa,\" said Andrew, \"any other demonstration would be far short of showing you what desperate havoc jealousy can make of a man's feelings. However, I will do as you bid me, and find out what this se\u00f1or page-poet wants, whither he is going, and whom he is in search of. It may be, that unawares he may let me get hold of some end of thread which shall lead to the discovery of the whole snare which I fear he is come to set for me.\"\n\n\"Jealousy, I imagine,\" said Preciosa, \"never leaves the understanding clear to apprehend things as they really are. Jealousy always looks through magnifying glasses, which make mountains of molehills, and realities of mere suspicions. On your life, Andrew, and on mine, I charge you to proceed in this matter, and all that touches our concerns, with prudence and discretion; and if you do, I know that you will have to concede the palm to me, as honest, upright, and true to the very utmost.\"\n\nWith these words she quitted Andrew, leaving him impatient for daylight, that he might receive the confession of the wounded man, and distracted in mind by a thousand various surmises. He could not believe but that this page had come thither attracted by Preciosa's beauty; for the thief believes that all men are such as himself. On the other hand, the pledge voluntarily made to him by Preciosa appeared so highly satisfactory, that he ought to set his mind quite at ease, and commit all his happiness implicitly to the keeping of her good faith. At last day appeared: he visited the wounded man; and after inquiring how he was, and did his bites pain him, he asked what was his name, whither he was going, and how it was he travelled so late and so far off the road. The youth replied that he was better, and felt no pain so that he was able to resume his journey. His name was Alonzo Hurtado; he was going to our Lady of the Pe\u00f1a de Francia, on a certain business; he travelled by night for the greater speed; and having missed his way, he had come upon the encampment, and been worried by the dogs that guarded it. Andrew did not by any means consider this a straightforward statement: his suspicions returned to plague him; and, said he, \"Brother, if I were a judge, and you had been brought before me upon any charge which would render necessary such questions as those I have put to you, the reply you have given would oblige me to apply the thumb-screw. It is nothing to me who you are, what is your name, or whither you are going: I only warn you, that if it suits your convenience to lie on this journey, you should lie with more appearance of truth. You say you are going to La Pe\u00f1a de Francia, and you leave it on the right hand more than thirty leagues behind this place. You travel by night for sake of speed, and you quit the high road, and strike into thickets and woods where there is scarcely a footpath. Get up, friend, learn to lie better, and go your ways, in God's name. But in return for this good advice I give you, will you not tell me one truth? I know you will, you are such a bad hand at lying. Tell me, are you not one I have often seen in the capital, something between a page and a gentleman? One who has the reputation of being a great poet, and who wrote a romance and a sonnet upon a gitanilla who some time ago went about Madrid, and was celebrated for her surpassing beauty? Tell me, and I promise you, on the honour of a gentleman gipsy, to keep secret whatever you may wish to be so kept. Mind you, no denial that you are the person I say will go down with me; for the face I see before me is unquestionably the same I saw in Madrid. The fame of your talents made me often stop to gaze at you as a distinguished man, and therefore your features are so strongly impressed on my memory, though your dress is very different from that in which I formerly saw you. Don't be alarmed, cheer up, and don't suppose you have fallen in with a tribe of robbers, but with an asylum, where you may be guarded and defended from all the world. A thought strikes me; and if it be as I conjecture, you have been lucky in meeting me above all men. What I conjecture is, that being in love with Preciosa\u2014that beautiful young gipsy, to whom you addressed the verses\u2014you have come in search of her; for which I don't think a bit the worse of you, but quite the reverse: for gipsy though I am, experience has shown me how far the potent force of love reaches, and the transformations it makes those undergo whom it brings beneath its sway and jurisdiction. If this be so, as I verily believe it is, the fair gitanilla is here.\"\n\n\"Yes, she is here; I saw her last night,\" said the stranger. This was like a death-blow to Andrew; for it seemed at once to confirm all his suspicions.\n\n\"I saw her last night,\" the young man repeated; \"but I did not venture to tell her who I was, for it did not suit my purpose.\"\n\n\"So, then,\" said Andrew, \"you are indeed the poet of whom I spoke.\"\n\n\"I am: I neither can nor will deny it. Possibly it may be that where I thought myself lost I have come right to port, if, as you say, there is fidelity in the forests, and hospitality in the mountains.\"\n\n\"That there is, beyond doubt,\" said Andrew; \"and among us gipsies the strictest secrecy in the world. On that assurance, se\u00f1or, you may unburden your breast to me: you will find in mine no duplicity whatever. The gitanilla is my relation, and entirely under my control. If you desire her for a wife, myself and all other relations will be quite willing; and if for a mistress, we will not make any squeamish objections, provided you have money, for covetousness never departs from our ranchos.\"\n\n\"I have money,\" the youth replied; \"in the bands of this frock, which I wear girt round my body, there are four hundred gold crowns.\"\n\nThis was another mortal blow for Andrew, who assumed that the stranger could carry so large a sum about him for no other purpose than to purchase possession of the beloved object. With a faltering tongue he replied, \"That is a good lump of money; you have only to discover yourself, and go to work: the girl is no fool, and will see what a good thing it will be for her to be yours.\"\n\n\"O friend,\" exclaimed the youth, \"I would have you know that the power which has made me change my garb is not that of love, as you say, nor any longing for Preciosa; for Madrid has beauties who know how to steal hearts and subdue souls as well as the handsomest gitanas, and better; though I confess that the beauty of your kinswoman surpasses any I have ever seen. The cause of my being in this dress, on foot, and bitten by dogs, is not love but my ill luck.\"\n\nUpon this explanation, Andrew's downcast spirit began to rise again; for it was plain that the wind was in quite a different quarter from what he had supposed. Eager to escape from this confusion, he renewed his assurances of secrecy, and the stranger proceeded thus:\u2014\n\n\"I was in Madrid, in the house of a nobleman, whom I served not as a master but as a relation. He had an only son and heir, who treated me with great familiarity and friendship, both on account of our relationship, and because we were both of the same age and disposition. This young gentleman fell in love with a young lady of rank, whom he would most gladly have made his wife, had it not been for his dutiful submission to the will of his parents, who desired him to marry into a higher family. Nevertheless, he continued furtively to pay court to the lady of his choice, carefully concealing his proceedings from all eyes but mine. One night, which ill luck must have especially selected for the adventure I am about to relate to you, as we were passing by the lady's house, we saw ranged against it two men of good figure apparently. My kinsman wished to reconnoitre them, but no sooner had he made a step towards them than their swords were out, their bucklers ready, and they made at us, whilst we did the same on our side, and engaged them with equal arms. The fight did not last long, neither did the lives of our two opponents; for two thrusts, urged home by my kinsman's jealousy and my zeal in his defence, laid them both low\u2014an extraordinary occurrence, and such as is rarely witnessed. Thus involuntarily victorious, we returned home, and taking all the money we could, set off secretly to the church of San Geronimo, waiting to see what would happen when the event was discovered next day, and what might be the conjectures as to the persons of the homicides.\n\n\"We learned that no trace of our presence on the scene had been discovered, and the prudent monks advised us to return home, so as not by our absence to arouse any suspicion against us. We had already resolved to follow their advice, when we were informed that the alcaldes of the court had arrested the young lady and her parents; and that among their domestics, whom they examined, one person, the young lady's attendant, had stated that my kinsman visited her mistress by night and by day. Upon this evidence they had sent in search of us; and the officers not finding us, but many indications of our flight, it became a confirmed opinion throughout the whole city, that we were the very men who had slain the two cavaliers, for such they were, and of very good quality. Finally, by the advice of the count, my relation, and of the monks, after remaining hid a fortnight in the monastery, my comrade departed in company with a monk, himself disguised as one, and took the road to Aragon, intending to pass over to Italy, and thence to Flanders, until he should see what might be the upshot of the matter. For my part, thinking it well to divide our fortunes, I set out on foot, in a different direction, and in the habit of a lay brother, along with a monk, who quitted me at Talavera. From that city I travelled alone, and missed my way, till last night I reached this wood, when I met with the mishap you know. If I asked for La Pe\u00f1a de Francia, it was only by way of making some answer to the questions put to me; for I know that it lies beyond Salamanca.\"\n\n\"True,\" observed Andrew, \"you left it on your right, about twenty leagues from this. So you see what a straight road you were taking, if you were going thither.\"\n\n\"The road I did intend to take was that to Seville; for there I should find a Genoese gentleman, a great friend of the count my relation, who is in the habit of exporting large quantities of silver ingots to Genoa; and my design is, that he should send me with his carriers, as one of themselves, by which means I may safely reach Carthagena, and thence pass over to Italy; for two galleys are expected shortly to ship some silver. This is my story, good friend: was I not right in saying it is the result of pure ill luck, rather than disappointed love? Now if these se\u00f1ores gitanos will take me in their company to Seville, supposing they are bound thither, I will pay them handsomely; for I believe that I should travel more safely with them, and have some respite from the fear that haunts me.\"\n\n\"Yes, they will take you,\" said Andrew; \"or if you cannot go with our band\u2014for as yet I know not that we are for Andalusia\u2014you can go with another which we shall fall in with in a couple of days; and if you give them some of the money you have about you, they will be able and willing to help you out of still worse difficulties.\" He then left the young man, and reported to the other gipsies what the stranger desired, and the offer he had made of good payment for their services.\n\nThey were all for having their guest remain in the camp; but Preciosa was against it; and her grandmother said, that she could not go to Seville or its neighbourhood, on account of a hoax she had once played off upon a capmaker named Truxillo, well known in Seville. She had persuaded him to put himself up to his neck in a butt of water, stark naked, with a crown of cypress on his head, there to remain till midnight, when he was to step out, and look for a great treasure, which she had made him believe was concealed in a certain part of his house. When the good cap-maker heard matins ring, he made such haste to get out of the butt, lest he should lose his chance, that it fell with him, bruising his flesh, and deluging the floor with water, in which he fell to swimming with might and main, roaring out that he was drowning. His wife and his neighbours ran to him with lights, and found him striking out lustily with his legs and arms. \"Help! help!\" he cried; \"I am suffocating;\" and he really was not far from it, such was the effect of his excessive fright. They seized and rescued him from his deadly peril. When he had recovered a little, he told them the trick the gipsy woman had played him; and yet for all that, he dug a hole, more than a fathom deep, in the place pointed out to him, in spite of all his neighbours could say; and had he not been forcibly prevented by one of them, when he was beginning to undermine the foundations of the house, he would have brought the whole of it down about his ears. The story spread all over the city; so that the little boys in the streets used to point their fingers at him, and shout in his ears the story of the gipsy's trick, and his own credulity. Such was the tale told by the old gitana, in explanation of her unwillingness to go to Seville.\n\nThe gipsies, knowing from Andrew that the youth had a sum of money about him, readily assented to his accompanying them, and promised to guard and conceal him as long as he pleased. They determined to make a bend to the left, and enter La Mancha and the kingdom of Murcia. The youth thanked them cordially, and gave them on the spot a hundred gold crowns to divide amongst them, whereupon they became as pliant as washed leather. Preciosa, however, was not pleased with the continuance among them of Don Sancho, for that was the youth's name, but the gipsies changed it to Clement. Andrew too was rather annoyed at this arrangement; for it seemed to him that Clement had given up his original intention upon very slight grounds; but the latter, as if he read his thoughts, told him that he was glad to go to Murcia, because it was near Carthagena, whence, if galleys arrived there, as he expected, he could easily pass over to Italy. Finally, in order to have him more under his own eye, to watch his acts, and scrutinise his thoughts, Andrew desired to have Clement for his own comrade, and the latter accepted this friendly offer as a signal favour. They were always together, both spent largely, their crowns came down like rain; they ran, leaped, danced, and pitched the bar better than any of their companions, and were more than commonly liked by the women of the tribe, and held in the highest respect by the men.\n\nLeaving Estramadura they entered La Mancha, and gradually traversed the kingdom of Murcia. In all the villages and towns they passed through, they had matches at ball-playing, fencing, running, leaping, and pitching the bar; and in all these trials of strength, skill, and agility Andrew and Clement were victorious, as Andrew alone had been before. During the whole journey, which occupied six weeks, Clement neither found nor sought an opportunity to speak alone with Preciosa, until one day when she and Andrew were conversing together, they called him to them, and Preciosa said, \"The first time you came to our camp I recognised you, Clement, and remembered the verses you gave me in Madrid; but I would not say a word, not knowing with what intention you had come among us. When I became acquainted with your misfortune, it grieved me to the soul, though at the same time it was a relief to me; for I had been much disturbed, thinking that as there was a Don Juan in the world who had become a gipsy, a Don Sancho might undergo transformation in like manner. I speak this to you, because Andrew tells me he has made known to you who he is, and with what intention he turned gipsy.\" (And so it was, for Andrew had acquainted Clement with his whole story, that he might be able to converse with him on the subject nearest to his thoughts.) \"Do not think that my knowing you was of little advantage to you, since for my sake, and in consequence of what I said of you, our people the more readily admitted you amongst them, where I trust in God you may find things turn out according to your best wishes. You will repay me, I hope, for this good will on my part, by not making Andrew ashamed of having set his mind so low, or representing to him how ill he does in persevering in his present way of life; for though I imagine that his will is enthralled to mine, still it would grieve me to see him show signs, however slight, of repenting what he has done.\"\n\n\"Do not suppose, peerless Preciosa,\" replied Clement, \"that Don Juan acted lightly in revealing himself to me. I found him out beforehand: his eyes first disclosed to me the nature of his feelings; I first told him who I was, and detected that enthralment of his will which you speak of; and he, reposing a just confidence in me, made his secret mine. He can witness whether I applauded his determination and his choice; for I am not so dull of understanding, Preciosa, as not to know how omnipotent is beauty; and yours, which surpasses all bounds of loveliness, is a sufficient excuse for all errors, if error that can be called for which there is so irresistible a cause. I am grateful to you, se\u00f1ora, for what you have said in my favour; and I hope to repay you by hearty good wishes that you may find a happy issue out of your perplexities, and that you may enjoy the love of your Andrew, and Andrew that of his Preciosa, with the consent of his parents; so that from so beautiful a couple there may come into the world the finest progeny which nature can form in her happiest mood. This is what I shall always desire, Preciosa; and this is what I shall always say to your Andrew, and not anything which could tend to turn him from his well-placed affections.\"\n\nWith such emotion did Clement utter these words, that Andrew was in doubt whether they were spoken in courtesy only, or from love; for the infernal plague of jealousy is so susceptible that it will take offence at the motes in the sunbeams; and the lover finds matter for self-torment in everything that concerns the beloved object. Nevertheless, he did not give way to confirmed jealousy; for he relied more on the good faith of his Preciosa than on his own fortune, which, in common with all lovers, he regarded as luckless, so long as he had not obtained the object of his desires. In fine, Andrew and Clement continued to be comrades and friends, their mutual good understanding being secured by Clement's upright intentions, and by the modesty and prudence of Preciosa, who never gave Andrew an excuse for jealousy. Clement was somewhat of a poet, Andrew played the guitar a little, and both were fond of music. One night, when the camp was pitched in a valley four leagues from Murcia, Andrew seated himself at the foot of a cork-tree, and Clement near him under an evergreen oak. Each of them had a guitar; and invited by the stillness of the night, they sang alternately, Andrew beginning the descant, and Clement responding.\n\nANDREW.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ten thousand golden lamps are lit on high,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Making this chilly night\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rival the noon-day's light;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Look, Clement, on yon star-bespangled sky,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And in that image see,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If so divine thy fancy be,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That lovely radiant face,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where centres all of beauty and of grace.\n\nCLEMENT\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where centres all of beauty and of grace,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And where in concord sweet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goodness and beauty meet,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And purity hath fixed its dwelling-place.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Creature so heavenly fair,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May any mortal genius dare,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or less than tongue divine,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To praise in lofty, rare, and sounding line?\n\nANDREW\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To praise in lofty, rare, and sounding line\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thy name, gitana bright!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earth's wonder and delight,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Worthy above the empyrean vault to shine;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fain would I snatch from Fame\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trump and voice, whose loud acclaim\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should startle every ear,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And lift Preciosa's name to the eighth sphere.\n\nCLEMENT\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To lift Preciosa's fame to the eighth sphere\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were meet and fit, that so\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The heavens new joy might know\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through all their shining courts that name to hear,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which on this earth doth sound\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like music spreading gladness round,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Breathing with charm intense\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peace to the soul and rapture to the sense.\n\nIt seemed as though the freeman and the captive were in no haste to bring their tuneful contest to conclusion, had not the voice of Preciosa, who had overheard them, sounded from behind in response to theirs.

An animated conversation ensued between the three; and Preciosa displayed so much intelligence, modesty, and acuteness, as fully excused, in Clement's opinion, the extraordinary determination of Andrew, which he had before attributed more to his youth than his judgment. The next morning the camp was broken up, and they proceeded to a place in the jurisdiction of Murcia, three leagues from the city, where a mischance befel Andrew, which went near to cost him his life.\n\nAfter they had given security in that place, according to custom, by the deposit of some silver vessels and ornaments, Preciosa and her grandmother, Christina and two other gitanillas, Clement, and Andrew, took up their quarters in an inn, kept by a rich widow, who had a daughter aged about seventeen or eighteen, rather more forward than handsome. Her name was Juana Carducha. This girl having seen the gipsies dance, the devil possessed her to fall in love with Andrew to that degree that she proposed to tell him of it, and take him for a husband, if he would have her, in spite of all her relations. Watching for an opportunity to speak to him, she found it in a cattle-yard, which Andrew had entered in search of two young asses, when she said to him, hurriedly, \"Andrew\" (she already knew his name), \"I am single and wealthy. My mother has no other child: this inn is her own; and besides it she has large vineyards, and several other houses. You have taken my fancy; and if you will have me for a wife, only say the word. Answer me quickly, and if you are a man of sense, only wait, and you shall see what a life we shall lead.\"\n\nAstonished as he was at Carducha's boldness, Andrew nevertheless answered her with the promptitude she desired, \"Se\u00f1ora doncella, I am under promise to marry, and we gitanos intermarry only with gitanas. Many thanks for the favour you would confer on me, of which I am not worthy.\"\n\nCarducha was within two inches of dropping dead at this unwelcome reply, to which she would have rejoined, but that she saw some of the gitanos come into the yard. She rushed from the spot, athirst for vengeance. Andrew, like a wise man, determined to get out of her way, for he read in her eyes that she would willingly give herself to him with matrimonial bonds, and he had no wish to find himself engaged foot to foot and alone in such an encounter; accordingly, he requested his comrades to quit the place that night. Complying with his wishes as they always did, they set to work at once, took up their securities again that evening, and decamped. Carducha, seeing that Andrew was going away and half her soul with him, and that she should not have time to obtain the fulfilment of her desires, resolved to make him stop by force, since he would not do so of good will. With all the cunning and secrecy suggested to her by her wicked intentions, she put among Andrew's baggage, which she knew to be his, a valuable coral necklace, two silver medals, and other trinkets belonging to her family. No sooner had the gipsies left the inn than she made a great outcry, declaring that the gipsies had robbed her, till she brought about her the officers of justice and all the people of the place. The gipsies halted, and all swore that they had no stolen property with them, offering at the same time to let all their baggage be searched. This made the old gipsy woman very uneasy, lest the proposed scrutiny should lead to the discovery of Preciosa's trinkets and Andrew's clothes, which she preserved with great care. But the good wench Carducha quickly put an end to her fears on that head, for before they had turned over two packages, she said to the men, \"Ask which of these bundles belongs to that gipsy who is such a great dancer. I saw him enter my room twice, and probably he is the thief.\"\n\nAndrew knew it was himself she meant, and answered with a laugh, \"Se\u00f1ora doncella, this is my bundle, and that is my ass. If you find in or upon either of them what you miss, I will pay you the value sevenfold, beside submitting to the punishment which the law awards for theft.\"\n\nThe officers of justice immediately unloaded the ass, and in the turn of a hand discovered the stolen property, whereat Andrew was so shocked and confounded that he stood like a stone statue. \"I was not out in my suspicions,\" said Carducha; \"see with what a good looking face the rogue covers his villany.\" The alcalde, who was present, began to abuse Andrew and the rest of the gipsies, calling them common thieves and highwaymen. Andrew said not a word, but stood pondering in the utmost perplexity, for he had no surmise of Carducha's treachery. At last, an insolent soldier, nephew to the alcalde, stepped up to him, saying \"Look at the dirty gipsy thief! I will lay a wager he will give himself airs as if he were an honest man, and deny the robbery, though the goods have been found in his hands. Good luck to whoever sends the whole pack of you to the galleys. A fitter place it will be for this scoundrel, where he may serve his Majesty, instead of going about dancing from place to place, and thieving from venta to mountain. On the faith of a soldier, I have a mind to lay him at my feet with a blow.\"\n\nSo saying, without more ado he raised his hand, and gave Andrew such a buffet as roused him from his stupor, and made him recollect that he was not Andrew Caballero but Don Juan and a gentleman; therefore, flinging himself upon the soldier with sudden fury, he snatched his sword from its sheath, buried it in his body, and laid him dead at his feet. The people shouted and yelled; the dead man's uncle, the alcalde, was frantic with rage; Preciosa fainted, and Andrew, regardless of his own defence, thought only of succouring her. As ill luck would have it, Clement was not on the spot, having gone forward with some baggage, and Andrew was set upon, by so many, that they overpowered him, and loaded him with heavy chains. The alcalde would gladly have hanged him on the spot, but was obliged to send him to Murcia, as he belonged to the jurisdiction of that city. It was not, however, till the next day that he was removed thither, and meanwhile he was loaded with abuse and maltreatment by the alcalde and all the people of the place. The alcalde, moreover, arrested all the rest of the gipsies he could lay hands on, but most of them had made their escape, among others Clement, who was afraid of being seized and discovered. On the following morning the alcalde, with his officers and a great many other armed men, entered Murcia with a caravan of gipsy captives, among whom were Preciosa and poor Andrew, who was chained on the back of a mule, and was handcuffed and had a fork fixed under his chin. All Murcia flocked to see the prisoners, for the news of the soldier's death had been received there; but so great was Preciosa's beauty that no one looked upon her that day without blessing her. The news of her loveliness reached the corregidor's lady, who being curious to see her, prevailed on her husband to give orders that she should not enter the prison to which all the rest of the gipsies were committed. Andrew was thrust into a dark narrow dungeon, where, deprived of the light of the sun and of that which Preciosa's presence diffused, he felt as though he should leave it only for his grave. Preciosa and her grand-mother were taken to the corregidor's lady, who at once exclaiming, \"Well might they praise her beauty,\" embraced her tenderly, and never was tired of looking at her. She asked the old woman what was the girl's age. \"Fifteen, within a month or two, more or less,\" was the reply. \"That would be the age of my poor Constantia,\" observed the lady. \"Ah, amigas! how the sight of this young girl has brought my bereavement back afresh to my mind.\"\n\nUpon this, Preciosa took hold of the corregidora's bands, kissed them repeatedly, bathed them with tears, and said, \"Se\u00f1ora mia, the gitano who is in custody is not in fault, for he had provocation. They called him a thief, and he is none; they gave him a blow on the face, though his is such a face that you can read in it the goodness of his soul. I entreat you, se\u00f1ora, to see that justice is done him, and that the se\u00f1or corregidor is not too hasty in executing upon him the penalty of the law. If my beauty has given you any pleasure, preserve it for me by preserving the life of the prisoner, for with it mine ends too. He is to be my husband, but just and proper impediments have hitherto prevented our union. If money would avail to obtain his pardon, all the goods of our tribe should be sold by auction, and we would give even more than was asked of us. My lady, if you know what love is, and have felt and still feel it for your dear husband, have pity on me who love mine tenderly and honestly.\"\n\nAll the while Preciosa was thus speaking she kept fast hold of the corregidora's hands, and kept her tearful eyes fixed on her face, whilst the lady gazed on her with no less wistfulness, and wept as she did. Just then the corregidor entered, and seeing his wife and Preciosa thus mingling their tears, he was surprised as much by the scene as by the gitanilla's beauty. On his asking the cause of her affliction, Preciosa let go the lady's hands, and threw herself at the corregidor's feet, crying, \"Mercy, mercy, se\u00f1or! If my husband dies, I die too. He is not guilty; if he is, let me bear the punishment; or if that cannot be, at least let the trial be delayed until means be sought which may save him; for as he did not sin through malice, it may be that heaven in its grace will send him safety.\" The corregidor was still more surprised to hear such language from the gitanilla's lips, and but that he would not betray signs of weakness, he could have wept with her.\n\nWhile all this was passing, the old gitana was busily turning over a great many things in her mind, and after all this cogitation, she said, \"Wait a little, your honour, and I will turn these lamentations into joy, though it should cost me my life;\" and she stepped briskly out of the room. Until she returned, Preciosa never desisted from her tears and entreaties that they would entertain the cause of her betrothed, being inwardly resolved that she would send to his father that he might come and interfere in his behalf.\n\nThe old gipsy woman returned with a little box under her arm, and requested that the corregidor and his lady would retire with her into another room, for she had important things to communicate to them in secret. The corregidor imagined she meant to give him information respecting some thefts committed by the gipsies, in order to bespeak his favour for the prisoner, and he instantly withdrew with her and his lady to his closet, where the gipsy, throwing herself on her knees before them both, began thus:\n\n\"If the good news I have to give to your honours be not worth forgiveness for a great crime I have committed, I am here to receive the punishment I deserve. But before I make my confession, I beg your honours will tell me if you know these trinkets;\" and she put the box which contained those belonging to Preciosa into the corregidor's hands. He opened it, and saw those childish gewgaws, but had no idea what they could mean. The corregidora looked at them, too, with as little consciousness as her husband, and merely observed that they were the ornaments of some little child. \"That is true,\" replied the gipsy, \"and to what child they belonged is written in this folded paper.\" The corregidor hastily opened the paper, and read as follows:\u2014\n\n\"The child's name was Do\u00f1a Constanza de Acevedo y de Menesis; her mother's, Do\u00f1a Guiomar de Menesis; and her father's, D. Fernando de Acevedo, knight of the order of Calatrava. She disappeared on the day of the Lord's Ascension, at eight in the morning, in the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-five. The child had upon her the trinkets which are contained in this box.\"\n\nInstantly, on hearing the contents of the paper, the corregidora recognised the trinkets, put them to her lips, kissed them again and again, and swooned away; and the corregidor was too much occupied in assisting her to ask the gitana for his daughter. \"Good woman, angel rather than gitana,\" cried the lady when she came to herself, \"where is the owner of these baubles?\"\n\n\"Where, se\u00f1ora?\" was the reply. \"She is in your own house. That young gipsy who drew tears from your eyes is their owner, and is indubitably your own daughter, whom I stole from your house in Madrid on the day and hour named in this paper.\"\n\nOn hearing this, the agitated lady threw off her clogs, and rushed with open arms into the sala, where she found Preciosa surrounded by her doncellas and servants, and still weeping and wailing. Without a word she caught her hurriedly in her arms, and examined if she had under her left breast a mark in the shape of a little white mole with which she was born, and she found it there enlarged by time. Then, with the same haste, she took off the girl's shoe, uncovered a snowy foot, smooth as polished marble, and found what she sought; for the two smaller toes of the right foot were joined together by a thin membrane, which the tender parents could not bring themselves to let the surgeon cut when she was an infant. The mole on the bosom, the foot, the trinkets, the day assigned for the kidnapping, the confession of the gitana, and the joy and emotion which her parents felt when they first beheld her, confirmed with the voice of truth in the corregidora's soul that Preciosa was her own daughter: clasping her therefore in her arms, she returned with her to the room where she had left the corregidor and the old gipsy. Preciosa was bewildered, not knowing why she had made all those investigations, and was still more surprised when the lady raised her in her arms, and gave her not one kiss, but a hundred.\n\nDo\u00f1a Guiomar at last appeared with her precious burthen in her husband's presence, and transferring the maiden from her own arms to his, \"Receive, Se\u00f1or, your daughter Constanza,\" she said; \"for your daughter she is without any doubt, since I have seen the marks on the foot and the bosom; and stronger even than these proofs is the voice of my own heart ever since I set eyes on her.\"\n\n\"I doubt it not,\" replied the corregidor, folding Preciosa in his arms, \"for the same sensations have passed through my heart as through yours; and how could so many strange particulars combine together unless it were by a miracle?\"\n\nThe people of the house were now lost in wonder, going about and asking each other, \"What is all this?\" but erring widely in their conjectures; for who would have imagined that the gitanilla was the daughter of their lord? The corregidor told his wife and daughter and the old gipsy that he desired the matter should be kept secret until he should himself think fit to divulge it. As for the old gipsy, he assured her that he forgave the injury she had done him in stealing his treasure, since she had more than made atonement by restoring it. The only thing that grieved him was that, knowing Preciosa's quality, she should have betrothed her to a gipsy, and worse than that, to a thief and murderer. \"Alas, se\u00f1or mio,\" said Preciosa, \"he is neither a gipsy nor a thief, although he has killed a man, but then it was one who had wounded his honour, and he could not do less than show who he was, and kill him.\"\n\n\"What! he is not a gipsy, my child?\" said Do\u00f1a Guiomar.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said the old gitana; and she related the story of Andrew Caballero, that he was the son of Don Francisco de C\u00e1rcamo, knight of Santiago; that his name was Don Juan de C\u00e1rcamo, of the same order; and that she had kept his clothes after he had changed them for those of a gipsy. She likewise stated the agreement which Preciosa and Don Juan had made not to marry until after two years of mutual trial; and she put in their true light the honourable conduct of both, and the suitable condition of Don Juan.\n\nThe parents were as much surprised at this as at the recovery of their daughter. The corregidor sent the gitana for Don Juan's clothes, and she came back with them accompanied by a gipsy who carried them. Previously to her return, Preciosa's parents put a thousand questions to her, and she replied with so much discretion and grace, that even though they had not recognised her for their child, they must have loved her. To their inquiry whether she had any affection for Don Juan, she replied, not more than that to which she was bound in gratitude towards one who had humbled himself to become a gipsy for her sake; but even this should not extend farther than her parents desired. \"Say no more, daughter Preciosa,\" said her father; \"(for I wish you to retain this name of Preciosa in memory of your loss and your recovery); as your father, I take it upon myself to establish you in a position not derogatory to your birth.\"\n\nPreciosa sighed, and her mother shrewdly suspecting that the sigh was prompted by love for Don Juan, said to the corregidor, \"Since Don Juan is a person of such rank, and is so much attached to our daughter, I think, se\u00f1or, it would not be amiss to bestow her upon him.\"\n\n\"Hardly have we found her to-day,\" he replied, \"and already would you have us lose her? Let us enjoy her company for a while at least, for when she marries she will be ours no longer but her husband's.\"\n\n\"You are right, se\u00f1or,\" said the lady, \"but give orders to bring out Don Juan, for he is probably lying in some filthy dungeon.\"\n\n\"No doubt he is,\" said Preciosa, \"for as a thief and homicide, and above all as a gipsy, they will have given him no better lodging.\"\n\n\"I will go see him,\" said the corregidor, \"as if for the purpose of taking his confession. Meanwhile, se\u00f1ora, I again charge you not to let any one know this history until I choose to divulge it, for so it behoves my office.\" Then embracing Preciosa he went to the prison where Don Juan was confined, and entered his cell, not allowing any one to accompany him.\n\nHe found the prisoner with both legs in fetters, handcuffed, and with the iron fork not yet removed from beneath his chin. The cell was dark, only a scanty gleam of light passing into it from a loop-hole near the top of the wall. \"How goes it, sorry knave?\" said the corregidor, as he entered. \"I would I had all the gipsies in Spain leashed here together to finish them all at once, as Nero would have beheaded all Rome at a single blow. Know, thou thief, who art so sensitive on the point of honour, that I am the corregidor of this city, and come to know from thee if thy betrothed is a gitanilla who is here with the rest of you?\"\n\nHearing this Andrew imagined that the corregidor had surely fallen in love with Preciosa; for jealousy is a subtle thing, and enters other bodies without breaking or dividing them. He replied, however, \"If she has said that I am her betrothed, it is very true; and, if she has said I am not her betrothed, she has also spoken the truth; for it is not possible that Preciosa should utter a falsehood.\"\n\n\"Is she so truthful then?\" said the corregidor. \"It is no slight thing to be so and be a gitana. Well, my lad, she has said that she is your betrothed, but that she has not yet given you her hand; she knows that you must die for your crime, and she has entreated me to marry her to you before you die, that she may have the honour of being the widow of so great a thief as yourself.\"\n\n\"Then, let your worship do as she has requested,\" said Andrew; \"for so I be married to her, I will go content to the other world, leaving this one with the name of being hers.\"\n\n\"You must love her very much?\"\n\n\"So much,\" replied the prisoner, \"that whatever I could say of it would be nothing to the truth. In a word, se\u00f1or corregidor, let my business be despatched. I killed the man who insulted me; I adore this young gitana; I shall die content if I die in her grace, and God's I know will not be wanting to us, for we have both observed honourably and strictly the promise we made each other.\"\n\n\"This night then I will send for you,\" said the corregidor, \"and you shall marry Preciosa in my house, and to-morrow morning you shall be on the gallows. In this way I shall have complied with the demands of justice and with the desire of you both.\" Andrew thanked him; the corregidor returned home, and told his wife what had passed between them.\n\nDuring his absence Preciosa had related to her mother the whole course of her life; and how she had always believed she was a gipsy and the old woman's grand-daughter; but that at the same time she had always esteemed herself much more than might have been expected of a gitana. Her mother bade her say truly, was she very fond of Don Juan? With great bashfulness and with downcast eyes she replied that, having considered herself a gipsy, and that she should better her condition by marrying a knight of Santiago, and one of such station as Don Juan de C\u00e1rcamo, and having, moreover, learned by experience his good disposition and honourable conduct, she had sometimes looked upon him with the eyes of affection; but that as she had said once for all, she had no other will than that which her parents might approve.\n\nNight arrived; and about ten they took Andrew out of prison without handcuffs and fetters, but not without a great chain with which his body was bound from head to foot. In this way he arrived, unseen by any but those who had charge of him, in the corregidor's house, was silently and cautiously admitted into a room, and there left alone. A confessor presently entered and bade him confess, as he was to die next day. \"With great pleasure I will confess,\" replied Andrew; \"but why do they not marry me first? And if I am to be married, truly it is a sad bridal chamber that awaits me.\"\n\nDo\u00f1a Guiomar, who heard all this, told her husband that the terrors he was inflicting on Don Juan were excessive, and begged he would moderate them, lest they should cost him his life. The corregidor assented, and called out to the confessor that he should first marry the gipsy to Preciosa, after which the prisoner would confess, and commend himself with all his heart to God, who often rains down his mercies at the moment when hope is most parched and withering. Andrew was then removed to a room where there was no one but Do\u00f1a Guiomar, the corregidor, Preciosa, and two servants of the family. But when Preciosa saw Don Juan in chains, his face all bloodless, and his eyes dimmed with recent weeping, her heart sank within her, and she clutched her mother's arm for support. \"Cheer up, my child,\" said the corregidora, kissing her, \"for all you now see will turn to your pleasure and advantage.\" Knowing nothing of what was intended, Preciosa could not console herself; the old gipsy was sorely disturbed, and the bystanders awaited the issue in anxious suspense.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or Vicar,\" said the corregidor, \"this gitano and gitana are the persons whom your reverence is to marry.\"\n\n\"That I cannot do,\" replied the priest, \"unless the ceremony be preceded by the formalities required in such cases. Where have the banns been published? Where is the license of my superior, authorising the espousals?\"\n\n\"The inadvertance has been mine,\" said the corregidor; \"but I will undertake to get the license from the bishop's deputy.\"\n\n\"Until it comes then, your worships will excuse me,\" said the priest, and without another word, to avoid scandal, he quitted the house, leaving them all in confusion.\n\n\"The padre has done quite right,\" said the corregidor, \"and it may be that it was by heaven's providence, to the end that Andrew's execution might be postponed; for married to Preciosa he shall assuredly be, but first the banns must be published, and thus time will be gained, and time often works a happy issue out of the worst difficulties. Now I want to know from Andrew, should matters take such a turn, that without any more of those shocks and perturbations, he should become the husband of Preciosa, would he consider himself a happy man, whether as Andrew Caballero, or as Don Juan de C\u00e1rcamo?\"\n\nAs soon as Don Juan heard himself called by his true name, he said, \"Since Preciosa has not chosen to confine herself to silence, and has discovered to you who I am, I say to you, that though my good fortune should make me monarch of the world, she would still be the sole object of my desires; nor would I aspire to have any blessing besides, save that of heaven.\"\n\n\"Now for this good spirit you have shown, Se\u00f1or Don Juan de C\u00e1rcamo, I will in fitting time make Preciosa your lawful wife, and at present I bestow her upon you in that expectation, as the richest jewel of my house, my life, and my soul; for in her I bestow upon you Do\u00f1a Constanza de Acevedo Menesis, my only daughter, who, if she equals you in love, is nowise inferior to you in birth.\"\n\nAndrew was speechless with astonishment, while in a few words Do\u00f1a Guiomar related the loss of her daughter, her recovery, and the indisputable proofs which the old gipsy woman had given of the kidnapping. More amazed than ever, but filled with immeasurable joy, Don Juan embraced his father and mother-in-law, called them his parents and se\u00f1ores, and kissed Preciosa's hands, whose tears called forth his own. The secret was no longer kept; the news was spread abroad by the servants who had been present, and reached the ears of the alcalde, the dead man's uncle, who saw himself debarred of all hope of vengeance, since the rigour of justice could not be inflicted on the corregidor's son-in-law. Don Juan put on the travelling dress which the old woman had preserved; his prison and his iron chain were exchanged for liberty and chains of gold; and the sadness of the incarcerated gipsies was turned into joy, for they were all bailed out on the following day. The uncle of the dead man received a promise of two thousand ducats on condition of his abandoning the suit and forgiving Don Juan. The latter, not forgetting his comrade Clement, sent at once in quest of him, but he was not to be found, nor could anything be learned of him until four days after, when authentic intelligence was obtained that he had embarked in one of two Genoese galleys that lay in the port of Cartagena, and had already sailed. The corregidor informed Don Juan, that he had ascertained that his father, Don Francisco de C\u00e1rcanio, had been appointed corregidor of that city, and that it would be well to wait until the nuptials could be celebrated with his consent and approbation. Don Juan was desirous to conform to the corregidor's wishes, but said that before all things he must be made one with Preciosa. The archbishop granted his license, requiring that the banns should be published only once.\n\nThe city made a festival on the wedding-day, the corregidor being much liked, and there were illuminations, bullfights, and tournaments. The old woman remained in the house of her pretended grandchild, not choosing to part from Preciosa. The news reached Madrid, and Don Francisco de C\u00e1rcamo learned that the gipsy bridegroom was his son, and that Preciosa was the gitanilla he had seen in his house. Her beauty was an excuse in his eyes for the levity of his son, whom he had supposed to be lost, having ascertained that he had not gone to Flanders. Besides, he was the more reconciled when he found what a good match Don Juan had made with the daughter of so great and wealthy a cavalier as was Don Fernando de Acevedo. He hastened his departure in order to see his children, and within twenty days he was in Murcia. His arrival renewed the general joy; the lives of the pair were related, and the poets of that city, which numbers some very good ones, took it upon them to celebrate the extraordinary event along with the incomparable beauty of the gitanilla; and the licentiate Pozo wrote in such wise, that Preciosa's fame will endure in his verses whilst the world lasts. I forgot to mention that the enamoured damsel of the inn owned that the charge of theft she had preferred against Andrew was not true, and confessed her love and her crime, for which she was not visited with any punishment, because the joyous occasion extinguished revenge and resuscitated clemency.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[66] Piedra preciosa, precious stone.\n\n[67] It is hard to say what \"exquisite reason\" Cervantes can have had for likening a girl's eyes to emeralds above all other gems.

Scylla and Charybdis) LyricsUrbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:\n\n\u2014And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of Wilhelm Meister. A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.\n\nHe came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.\n\nA noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.\n\n\u2014Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always feels that Goethe's judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.\nTwicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendant's words: heard them: and was gone.\nTwo left.\n\n\u2014Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death.\n\n\u2014Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with elder's gall, to write Paradise Lost at your dictation? The Sorrows of Satan he calls it.\n\nSmile. Smile Cranly's smile.\n\nFirst he tickled her\nThen he patted her\nThen he passed the female catheter.\nFor he was a medical\nJolly old medi...\n\n\u2014I feel you would need one more for Hamlet. Seven is dear to the mystic mind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.\n\nGlittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed low: a sizar's laugh of Trinity: unanswered.\n\nOrchestral Satan, weeping many a rood\nTears such as angels weep.\nEd egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.\n\nHe holds my follies hostage.\n\nCranly's eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house. And one more to hail him: ave, rabbi: the Tinahely twelve. In the shadow of the glen he cooees for them. My soul's youth I gave him, night by night. God speed. Good hunting.\nMulligan has my telegram.\n\nFolly. Persist.\n\n\u2014Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare's Hamlet though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.\n\n\u2014All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex. Clergymen's discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato's world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.\n\nA. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike me!\n\n\u2014The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely. Aristotle was once Plato's schoolboy.\n\n\u2014And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.\n\nHe laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.\n\nFormless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the heavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who suffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon the altar. I am the sacrificial butter.\nDunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name Ineffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no secret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to see if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of light, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the plane of buddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P. must work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very illustrious sister H.P.B.'s elemental.\n\nO, fie! Out on't! Pfuiteufel! You naughtn't to look, missus, so you naughtn't when a lady's ashowing of her elemental.\n\nMr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.\n\n\u2014That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet's musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato's.\nJohn Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:\n\n\u2014Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.\n\n\u2014Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?\nUnsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through spaces smaller than red globules of man's blood they creepycrawl after Blake's buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.\n\nMr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.\n\n\u2014Haines is gone, he said.\n\n\u2014Is he?\n\n\u2014I was showing him Jubainville's book. He's quite enthusiastic, don't you know, about Hyde's Lovesongs of Connacht. I couldn't bring him in to hear the discussion. He's gone to Gill's to buy it.\n\nBound thee forth, my booklet, quick\nTo greet the callous public.\nWrit, I ween, 'twas not my wish\nIn lean unlovely English.\n\n\u2014The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.\n\nWe feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.\n\n\u2014People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarme but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer's Phaeacians.\n\nFrom these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.\n\n\u2014Mallarme, don't you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about Hamlet. He says: il se prom\u00e8ne, lisant au livre de lui-m\u00eame, don't you know, reading the book of himself. He describes Hamlet given in a French town, don't you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.\n\nHis free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.\n\nHAMLET\nou\nLE DISTRAIT\nPi\u00e8ce de Shakespeare\nHe repeated to John Eglinton's newgathered frown:\n\n\u2014Pi\u00e8ce de Shakespeare, don't you know. It's so French. The French point of view. Hamlet ou...\n\n\u2014The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.\n\nJohn Eglinton laughed.\n\n\u2014Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.\n\nSumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.\n\u2014A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not for nothing was he a butcher's son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father's one. Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to shoot. The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.\n\nCranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.\n\nWhelps and dams of murderous foes whom none But we had spared...\nBetween the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.\n\n\u2014He will have it that Hamlet is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best's behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.\n\nList! List! O List!\n\nMy flesh hears him: creeping, hears.\n\nIf thou didst ever...\n\n\u2014What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from limbo patrum, returning to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?\n\nJohn Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.\n\nLifted.\n\n\u2014It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.\n\nLocal colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.\n\u2014Shakespeare has left the huguenot's house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other thoughts.\n\nComposition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!\n\u2014The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied Hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:\n\nHamlet, I am thy father's spirit,\n\nbidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.\n\nIs it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son's name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet's twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?\n\n\u2014But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.\n\nArt thou there, truepenny?\n\n\u2014Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I mean when we read the poetry of King Lear what is it to us how the poet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l'Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet's drinking, the poet's debts. We have King Lear: and it is immortal.\n\nMr Best's face, appealed to, agreed.\n\nFlow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...\n\nHow now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?\n\nMarry, I wanted it.\n\nTake thou this noble.\n\nGo to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson's bed, clergyman's daughter. Agenbite of inwit.\n\nDo you intend to pay it back?\n\nO, yes.\n\nWhen? Now?\n\nWell... No.\n\nWhen, then?\n\nI paid my way. I paid my way.\n\nSteady on. He's from beyant Boyne water. The northeast corner. You owe it.\n\nWait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got pound.\nBuzz. Buzz.\n\nBut I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under everchanging forms.\n\nI that sinned and prayed and fasted.\n\nA child Conmee saved from pandies.\n\nI, I and I. I.\nA.E.I.O.U.\n\n\u2014Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries? John Eglinton's carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.\n\n\u2014She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.\n\nMother's deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. Liliata rutilantium.\nI wept alone.\n\nJohn Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.\n\u2014The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.\n\n\u2014Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.\n\nPortals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.\n\n\u2014A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?\n\n\u2014Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (absit nomen!), Socratididion's Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. But neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.\n\n\u2014But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best's quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.\n\nHis look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.\n\n\u2014He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory. He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling The girl I left behind me. If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, Venus and Adonis, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Do you think the writer of Antony and Cleopatra, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her and gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy. Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way. By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.\nAnd my turn? When?\n\nCome!\n\n\u2014Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.\n\nHe murmured then with blond delight for all:\n\nBetween the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.\n\nParis: the wellpleased pleaser.\nA tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch.\n\n\u2014I am afraid I am due at the Homestead.\n\nWhither away? Exploitable ground.\n\n\u2014Are you going? John Eglinton's active eyebrows asked. Shall we see you at Moore's tonight? Piper is coming.\n\n\u2014Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?\n\nPeter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.\n\n\u2014I don't know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get away in time.\n\nYogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. Isis Unveiled. Their Pali book we tried to pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma. The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship, ringroundabout him. Louis H. Victory. T. Caulfield Irwin. Lotus ladies tend them i'the eyes, their pineal glands aglow. Filled with his god, he thrones, Buddh under plantain. Gulfer of souls, engulfer. Hesouls, shesouls, shoals of souls. Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled, whirling, they bewail.\n\nIn quintessential triviality\nFor years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.\n\n\u2014They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets' verses. We are all looking forward anxiously.\n\nAnxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.\n\nSee this. Remember.\n\nStephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with two index fingers. Aristotle's experiment. One or two? Necessity is that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Argal, one hat is one hat.\nListen.\n\nYoung Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part. Longworth will give it a good puff in the Express. O, will he? I liked Colum's Drover. Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: As in wild earth a Grecian vase. Did he? I hope you'll be able to come tonight. Malachi Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear Miss Mitchell's joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn's wild oats? Awfully clever, isn't it? They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O'Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.\nCordelia. Cordoglio. Lir's loneliest daughter.\n\nNookshotten. Now your best French polish.\n\n\u2014Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...\n\n\u2014O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much correspondence.\n\n\u2014I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.\n\nGod ild you. The pigs' paper. Bullockbefriending.\n\nSynge has promised me an article for Dana too. Are we going to be read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.\n\nStephen sat down.\n\nThe quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask said:\n\n\u2014Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.\n\nHe creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:\n\u2014Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?\n\nAlarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?\n\u2014Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.\n\n\u2014Yes.\n\nChristfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks, from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters' wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.\n\u2014Yes. So you think...\n\nThe door closed behind the outgoer.\n\nRest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.\n\nA vestal's lamp.\n\nHere he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.\n\nCoffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words. Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest. In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks.\nThey are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.\n\u2014Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so much. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.\n\n\u2014But Hamlet is so personal, isn't it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind of private paper, don't you know, of his private life. I mean, I don't care a button, don't you know, who is killed or who is guilty...\nHe rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance. His private papers in the original. Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim in mo shagart. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.\n\nQuoth littlejohn Eglinton:\n\n\u2014I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.\nBear with me.\n\nStephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows. A basilisk. E quando vede l'uomo l'attosca. Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.\n\u2014As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.\n\nDrummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.\n\nHas the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.\n\n\u2014That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.\n\nJohn Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.\n\n\u2014If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare's later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.\n\n\u2014The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.\n\n\u2014There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.\n\nSaid that.\n\n\u2014If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?\n\nHead, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.\n\n\u2014A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.\n\n\u2014The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.\n\nGood Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon's wild oats. Cypherjugglers going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good masters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the sun, west of the moon: Tir na n-og. Booted the twain and staved.\n\nHow many miles to Dublin? Three score and ten, sir. Will we be there by candlelight?\n\n\u2014Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.\n\n\u2014Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?\n\n\u2014Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter's child. My dearest wife, Pericles says, was like this maid. Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?\n\n\u2014The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. l'art d'\u00eatre grand...\n\n\u2014Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?\n\nDo you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all men. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus ...\n\n\u2014His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The images of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.\n\nThe benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.\n\n\u2014I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on Shakespeare in the Saturday Review were surely brilliant. Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with\u2014what shall I say?\u2014our notions of what ought not to have been.\n\nFelicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk's egg, prize of their fray.\n\nHe thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost love thy man?\n\n\u2014That may be too, Stephen said. There's a saying of Goethe's which Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a buonaroba, a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written Romeo and Juliet. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman's invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.\n\nThey list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.\n\n\u2014The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet's ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen's breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore's rocks or what you will, the sea's voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.\n\n\u2014Amen! was responded from the doorway.\n\nHast thou found me, O mine enemy?\n\nEntr'acte.\n\nA ribald face, sullen as a dean's, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.\n\n\u2014You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he asked of Stephen.\n\nPrimrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.\n\nThey make him welcome. Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen.\n\nBrood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.\n\nHe Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.\nGlo\u2014o\u2014ri\u2014a in ex\u2014cel\u2014sis De\u2014o.\n\nHe lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.\n\n\u2014Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion. Mr Mulligan, I'll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.\n\nHe smiled on all sides equally.\n\nBuck Mulligan thought, puzzled:\n\n\u2014Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.\n\nA flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.\n\n\u2014To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.\n\nMr Best turned to him.\n\n\u2014Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He'll see you after at the D. B. C. He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's Lovesongs of Connacht.\n\n\u2014I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?\n\n\u2014The bard's fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.\n\n\u2014The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde's, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That Portrait of Mr W. H. where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.\n\n\u2014For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.\n\nOr Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?\n\n\u2014I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of course it's all paradox, don't you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it's so typical the way he works it out. It's the very essence of Wilde, don't you know. The light touch.\n\nHis glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame essence of Wilde.\n\nYou're darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy's ducats.\n\nHow much did I spend? O, a few shillings.\n\nFor a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.\n\nWit. You would give your five wits for youth's proud livery he pranks in. Lineaments of gratified desire.\n\nThere be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool ruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.\n\nEve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in's kiss.\n\n\u2014Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking. The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.\n\nThey talked seriously of mocker's seriousness.\n\nBuck Mulligan's again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.\n\n\u2014Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!\n\nHe sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:\n\n\u2014The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite!\n\nJoyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue:\n\n\u2014It's what I'm telling you, mister honey, it's queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. 'Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I'm thinking, and he limp with leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.\n\nHe wailed:\n\n\u2014And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.\n\nStephen laughed.\n\nQuickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.\n\n\u2014The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He's out in pampooties to murder you.\n\n\u2014Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.\n\nBuck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.\n\n\u2014Murder you! he laughed.\n\nHarsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Arts. In words of words for words, palabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle. C'est vendredi saint! Murthering Irish. His image, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i'the forest.\n\n\u2014Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.\n\n\u2014... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his Diary of Master William Silence has found the hunting terms... Yes? What is it?\n\n\u2014There's a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card. From the Freeman. He wants to see the files of the Kilkenny People for last year.\n\n\u2014Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...\n\nHe took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked:\n\n\u2014Is he?... O, there!\n\nBrisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.\n\n\u2014This gentleman? Freeman's Journal? Kilkenny People? To be sure. Good day, sir. Kilkenny... We have certainly...\n\nA patient silhouette waited, listening.\n\n\u2014All the leading provincial... Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this gentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me... This way... Please, sir...\n\nVoluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels.\n\nThe door closed.\n\n\u2014The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.\n\nHe jumped up and snatched the card.\n\n\u2014What's his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.\n\nHe rattled on:\n\n\u2014Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. Life of life, thy lips enkindle.\n\nSuddenly he turned to Stephen:\n\n\u2014He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! The god pursuing the maiden hid.\n\n\u2014We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.\n\n\u2014Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. You know Manningham's story of the burgher's wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in Richard III and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon's blankets: William the conqueror came before Richard III. And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.\n\nCours la Reine. Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?\n\n\u2014The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of oxford's mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.\n\nBuck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:\n\n\u2014Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!\n\n\u2014And Harry of six wives' daughter. And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?\n\nDo and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of Juno's eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do. Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.\n\nBuck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton's desk sharply.\n\n\u2014Whom do you suspect? he challenged.\n\n\u2014Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.\n\nLove that dare not speak its name.\n\n\u2014As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.\n\nOld wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.\n\n\u2014It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two deeds are rank in that ghost's mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband's brother. Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.\n\nStephen turned boldly in his chair.\n\n\u2014The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you deny that in the fifth scene of Hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan's daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy's words, wed her second, having killed her first.\n\nO, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father's shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.\n\nHe faced their silence.\n\nTo whom thus Eglinton:\nYou mean the will.\nBut that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.\nShe was entitled to her widow's dower\nAt common law. His legal knowledge was great\nOur judges tell us.\nHim Satan fleers,\nMocker:\nAnd therefore he left out her name\nFrom the first draft but he did not leave out\nThe presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,\nFor his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford\nAnd in London. And therefore when he was urged,\nAs I believe, to name her\nHe left her his\nSecondbest\nBed.\nPunkt.\nLeftherhis\nSecondbest\nLeftherhis\nBestabed\nSecabest\nLeftabed.\n\nWoa!\n\n\u2014Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.\n\n\u2014He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?\n\n\u2014It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.\n\n\u2014Separatio a mensa et a thalamo, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.\n\n\u2014Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling. Let me think.\n\n\u2014Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don't forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.\n\n\u2014Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...\n\n\u2014He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for a king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!\n\n\u2014What? asked Besteglinton.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare and company, limited. The people's William. For terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...\n\n\u2014Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands and said: All we can say is that life ran very high in those days. Lovely!\n\nCatamite.\n\n\u2014The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.\n\nSteadfast John replied severe:\n\n\u2014The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake and have it.\n\nSayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?\n\n\u2014And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could Aubrey's ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen's leech Lopez, his jew's heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: Hamlet and Macbeth with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in Love's Labour Lost. His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter's theory of equivocation. The Sea Venture comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sidney's. As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired The Merry Wives of Windsor, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.\n\nI think you're getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological. Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere.\n\n\u2014Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared,'expectantly. Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.\n\nSufflaminandus sum.\n\n\u2014He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.\n\n\u2014A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him myriadminded.\nAmplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos.\n\n\u2014Saint Thomas, Stephen began...\n\n\u2014Ora pro nobis, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.\n\nThere he keened a wailing rune.\n\n\u2014Pogue mahone! Acushla machree! It's destroyed we are from this day! It's destroyed we are surely!\n\nAll smiled their smiles.\n\n\u2014Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations are made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.\n\n\u2014Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.\n\n\u2014Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.\n\n\u2014Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.\n\n\u2014The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will's widow, is the will to die.\n\n\u2014Requiescat! Stephen prayed.\n\nWhat of all the will to do?\nIt has vanished long ago...\n\n\u2014She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the Merry Wives and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought over Hooks and Eyes for Believers' Breeches and The most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze. Venus has twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.\n\n\u2014History shows that to be true, inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos. The ages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man's worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that Russell is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say that only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.\n\nLean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping with the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there's a gentleman to see you. Me? Says he's your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.\nYour own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.\n\nHurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is attending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.\n\u2014A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father's death. If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with thirtyfive years of life, nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita, with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to hour it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son. Boccaccio's Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void. Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood. Amor matris, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son?\n\nWhat the hell are you driving at?\n\nI know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.\n\nAmplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea.\n\nAre you condemned to do this?\n\n\u2014They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is a new male: his growth is his father's decline, his youth his father's envy, his friend his father's enemy.\n\nIn rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.\n\n\u2014What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.\n\nAm I a father? If I were?\n\nShrunken uncertain hand.\n\n\u2014Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote Hamlet he was not the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.\n\nEglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly glancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.\n\nFlatter. Rarely. But flatter.\n\n\u2014Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big with child. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The play's the thing! Let me parturiate!\n\nHe clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.\n\n\u2014As for his family, Stephen said, his mother's name lives in the forest of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in Coriolanus. His boyson's death is the deathscene of young Arthur in King John. Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the girls in The Tempest, in Pericles, in Winter's Tale are we know. Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded.\n\n\u2014The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.\n\nThe quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with haste, quake, quack.\n\nDoor closed. Cell. Day.\n\nThey list. Three. They.\n\nI you he they.\n\nCome, mess.\n\nSTEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on's back. The playhouse sausage filled Gilbert's soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.\n\nMAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What's in a name?\n\nBEST: That is my name, Richard, don't you know. I hope you are going to say a good word for Richard, don't you know, for my sake. (Laughter)\n\nBUCKMULLIGAN: (Piano, diminuendo)\n\nThen outspoke medical Dick\nTo his comrade medical Davy...\n\nSTEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago, Richard Crookback, Edmund in King Lear, two bear the wicked uncles' names. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.\n\nBEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don't want Richard, my name ...\n\n(Laughter)\n\nQUAKERLYSTER: (A tempo) But he that filches from me my good name...\n\nSTEPHEN: (Stringendo) He has hidden his own name, a fair name, William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John o'Gaunt his name is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What's in a name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars. His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms.\n\nBoth satisfied. I too.\n\nDon't tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.\n\nAnd from her arms.\n\nWait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?\n\nRead the skies. Autontimorumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos. Where's your configuration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: sua donna. Gi\u00e0: di lui. gelindo risolve di non amare S. D.\n\n\u2014What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestial phenomenon?\n\n\u2014A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.\n\nWhat more's to speak?\n\nStephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.\n\nStephanos, my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.\n\n\u2014You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name is strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.\n\nMe, Magee and Mulligan.\n\nFabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto? Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus. Pater, ait. Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.\n\nMr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:\n\n\u2014That's very interesting because that brother motive, don't you know, we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don't you know, the fairytales. The third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.\n\nBest of Best brothers. Good, better, best.\n\nThe quaker librarian springhalted near.\n\n\u2014I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... But perhaps I am anticipating?\n\nHe caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.\n\nAn attendant from the doorway called:\n\n\u2014Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...\n\n\u2014O, Father Dineen! Directly.\n\nSwiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.\n\nJohn Eglinton touched the foil.\n\n\u2014Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund. You kept them for the last, didn't you?\n\n\u2014In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.\n\nLapwing.\n\nWhere is your brother? Apothecaries' hall. My whetstone. Him, then Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.\n\nLapwing.\n\nI am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.\n\nOn.\n\n\u2014You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others? Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what's in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence, the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of King Lear in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney's Arcadia and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?\n\n\u2014That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. Que voulez-vous? Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.\n\n\u2014Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from The Two Gentlemen of Verona onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe. It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in Much Ado about Nothing, twice in As you like It, in The Tempest, in Hamlet, in Measure for Measure\u2014and in all the other plays which I have not read.\n\nHe laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage.\n\nJudge Eglinton summed up.\n\n\u2014The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He is all in all.\n\n\u2014He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five. All in all. In Cymbeline, in Othello he is bawd and cuckold. He acts and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jose he kills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.\n\n\u2014Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!\nDark dome received, reverbed.\n\n\u2014And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When all is said Dumas fils (or is it Dumas p\u00e8re?) is right. After God Shakespeare has created most.\n\n\u2014Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet (p\u00e8re?) and Hamlet fils. A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa's lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck says: If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend. Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call dio boia, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.\n\n\u2014Eureka! Buck Mulligan cried. Eureka!\n\nSuddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's desk.\n\n\u2014May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.\n\nHe began to scribble on a slip of paper.\n\nTake some slips from the counter going out.\n\n\u2014Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.\n\nHe laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.\n\nUnwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of The Taming of the Shrew.\n\n\u2014You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your own theory?\n\n\u2014No, Stephen said promptly.\n\n\u2014Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a dialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.\n\nJohn Eclecticon doubly smiled.\n\n\u2014Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment for it since you don't believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is some mystery in Hamlet but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.\n\nI believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? Egomen. Who to unbelieve? Other chap.\n\n\u2014You are the only contributor to Dana who asks for pieces of silver. Then I don't know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics.\nFraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.\n\n\u2014For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.\n\nBuck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice:\n\n\u2014I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the Summa contra Gentiles in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.\n\nHe broke away.\n\n\u2014Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.\n\nCome, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.\n\nStephen rose.\n\nLife is many days. This will end.\n\n\u2014We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. Notre ami Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.\n\nBuck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.\n\n\u2014Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland. I'll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk straight?\n\nLaughing, he...\n\nSwill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.\n\nLubber...\n\nStephen followed a lubber...\n\nOne day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His lub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.\n\nStephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.\n\nWhat have I learned? Of them? Of me?\n\nWalk like Haines now.\n\nThe constant readers' room. In the readers' book Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet mad? The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.\n\n\u2014O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...\n\nAmused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:\n\n\u2014A pleased bottom.\n\nThe turnstile.\n\nIs that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...\n\nThe curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.\n\nPuck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:\n\nJohn Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won't you wed a wife?\n\nHe spluttered to the air:\n\n\u2014O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers' hall. Our players are creating a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I smell the pubic sweat of monks.\n\nHe spat blank.\n\nForgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And left the femme de trente ans. And why no other children born? And his first child a girl?\n\nAfterwit. Go back.\n\nThe dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling, minion of pleasure, Phedo's toyable fair hair.\n\nEh... I just eh... wanted... I forgot... he...\n\n\u2014Longworth and M'Curdy Atkinson were there...\n\nPuck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:\n\nI hardly hear the purlieu cry\nOr a tommy talk as I pass one by\nBefore my thoughts begin to run\nOn F. M'Curdy Atkinson,\nThe same that had the wooden leg\nAnd that filibustering filibeg\nThat never dared to slake his drouth,\nMagee that had the chinless mouth.\nBeing afraid to marry on earth\nThey masturbated for all they were worth.\n\nJest on. Know thyself.\n\nHalted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.\n\n\u2014Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.\n\nA laugh tripped over his lips.\n\n\u2014Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. Couldn't you do the Yeats touch?\n\nHe went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:\n\n\u2014The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time. One thinks of Homer.\n\nHe stopped at the stairfoot.\n\n\u2014I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.\n\nThe pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men's morrice with caps of indices.\n\nIn sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: Everyman His own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky Mulligan.\n\nHe turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying:\n\n\u2014The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.\n\nHe read, marcato:\n\n\u2014Characters:\n\nTODY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)\nCRAB (a bushranger)\nMEDICAL DICK )\nand ) (two birds with one stone)\nMEDICAL DAVY )\nMOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)\nFRESH NELLY\nand\nROSALIE (the coalquay whore).\n\nHe laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:\n\n\u2014O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!\n\n\u2014The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.\n\nAbout to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.\n\nPart. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.\n\nMy will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.\n\nA man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.\n\n\u2014Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.\n\nThe portico.\n\nHere I watched the birds for augury. Aengus of the birds. They go, they come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots after. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.\n\n\u2014The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown's awe. Did you see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.\nManner of Oxenford.\n\nDay. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.\n\nA dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.\n\nThey followed.\n\nOffend me still. Speak on.\n\nKind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.\n\nCease to strive.

Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?\n\n\u2014Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?\n\n\u2014Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.\n\n\u2014What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane\u2014old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him\u2014lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.\n\u2014Circumcised? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.\n\n\u2014That the lay you're on now? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?\n\nFor nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.

Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.\n\n\u2014Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.\n\n\u2014Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.\n\n\u2014Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?\n\u2014Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.\n\n\u2014-What was that, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.\n\nSo we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.\n\nIn Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.\n\nAnd there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.\n\nI dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!\n\nAnd by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.\n\nSo we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.\n\n\u2014There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.\n\nThe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.\n\n\u2014Stand and deliver, says he.\n\n\u2014That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.\n\u2014Pass, friends, says he.\n\nThen he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:\n\n\u2014What's your opinion of the times?\n\nDoing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.\n\n\u2014I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.\n\nSo begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:\n\n\u2014Foreign wars is the cause of it.\n\nAnd says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:\n\n\u2014It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.\n\n\u2014Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.\n\n\u2014Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Wine of the country, says he.\n\n\u2014What's yours? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.\n\n\u2014Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.\n\n\u2014Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?\n\nAnd with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.\n\nThe figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.\n\nHe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.\n\nSo anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.\n\n\u2014And there's more where that came from, says he.\n\n\u2014Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.\n\n\u2014I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.\n\nWho comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.\n\n\u2014For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.\n\nAnd he starts reading them out:\n\n\u2014Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...\n\n\u2014I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.\n\n\u2014Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, honourable person.\n\n\u2014Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.\n\nAh! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.\n\nAnd lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.\n\nLittle Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.\n\n\u2014Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...\n\nAnd he doubled up.\n\n\u2014Take a what? says I.\n\n\u2014Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.\n\n\u2014O hell! says I.\n\nThe bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.\n\n\u2014Bi i dho husht, says he.\n\n\u2014Who? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.\n\n\u2014When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...\n\nAnd he started laughing.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?\n\n\u2014Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.\n\nTerence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.\n\nThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\n\nBut he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.\n\n\u2014What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.\n\nSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.\n\n\u2014Are you codding? says I.\n\n\u2014Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.\n\nSo Joe took up the letters.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.\n\nSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:\n\n\u2014How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?\n\n\u2014I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...\n\n\u2014You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?\n\n\u2014With Dignam, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is it Paddy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Why?\n\n\u2014Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.\n\n\u2014Who's dead? says Bob Doran.\n\n\u2014You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?\n\n\u2014What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?\n\n\u2014Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.\n\n\u2014Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\n\n\u2014Paddy? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says Alf.\n\nBegob he was what you might call flabbergasted.\n\nIn the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.\n\nAssurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.\n\nHe is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.\n\n\u2014There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.\n\nAnd, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.\n\nLittle Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.\n\nAnd says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:\n\n\u2014Who said Christ is good?\n\n\u2014I beg your parsnips, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.\n\nBut Bob Doran shouts out of him.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.\n\nTerry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.\n\n\u2014The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.\n\nThe tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.\n\n\u2014The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.\n\nAnd mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.\n\nOld Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.\n\n\u2014Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.\n\nSo Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.\n\n\u2014O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?\n\nAnd he starts reading out one.\n\n7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.\n\nHonoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...\n\n\u2014Show us, Joe, says I.\n\n\u2014... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...\n\n\u2014Jesus, says I.\n\n\u2014... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...\n\nThe citizen made a grab at the letter.\n\n\u2014Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.\nH. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.\n\n\u2014And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?\n\nSo they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.\n\n\u2014Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.\n\nAnd Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.\n\n\u2014They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.\n\nAnd he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.\n\nIn the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.\n\nSo they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.\n\n\u2014There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.\n\n\u2014That so? says Joe.\n\n\u2014God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in\n\nKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.\n\n\u2014Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.\n\n\u2014That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...\n\nAnd then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.\n\nThe distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.\n\nSo of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:\n\n\u2014Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!\n\nArrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.\n\nAnd the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b\u00e9zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!\n\n\u2014The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...\n\n\u2014Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.\n\nThe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petit\u00e9patant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Vir\u00e1ga Kis\u00e1szony Putr\u00e1pesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.\n\nQuietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate\u2014short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fianc\u00e9e an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:\n\n\u2014God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.\n\nSo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.\n\nSo howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.\n\n\u2014Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.\n\n\u2014No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.\n\nSo he calls the old dog over.\n\n\u2014What's on you, Garry? says he.\n\nThen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.\n\nAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.\n\nThe curse of my curses\nSeven days every day\nAnd seven dry Thursdays\nOn you, Barney Kiernan,\nHas no sup of water\nTo cool my courage,\nAnd my guts red roaring\nAfter Lowry's lights.\n\nSo he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.\n\nGob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:\n\n\u2014Could you make a hole in another pint?\n\n\u2014Could a swim duck? says I.\n\n\u2014Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.\n\n\u2014Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.\n\n\u2014Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?\n\n\u2014Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.\n\n\u2014Whose admirers? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.\n\nThen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.\n\nSo Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.\n\n\u2014Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.\n\n\u2014No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.\n\n\u2014Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.\n\nAnd off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.\n\nSo Terry brought the three pints.\n\n\u2014Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.\n\n\u2014Slan leat, says he.\n\n\u2014Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.\n\nGob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.\n\n\u2014Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Friend of yours, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?\n\n\u2014I won't mention any names, says Alf.\n\n\u2014I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.\n\n\u2014Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.\n\nSo Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.\n\nGa Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.\n\n\u2014Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.\n\n\u2014Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.\n\n\u2014Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.\n\n\u2014That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?\n\n\u2014Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?\n\nMr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.\n\nMr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?\n\nMr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)\n\nMr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.\n\nMr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.\n\n(Ironical opposition cheers.)\n\nThe speaker: Order! Order!\n\n(The house rises. Cheers.)\n\n\u2014There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?\n\n\u2014Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.\n\n\u2014Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.\n\n\u2014Is that really a fact? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?\n\nSo off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.\n\nA most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.\n\nAmongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.\n\n\u2014Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?\n\n\u2014No, says Joe.\n\n\u2014I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Who? Blazes? says Joe.\n\nAnd says Bloom:\n\n\u2014What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.\n\n\u2014Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.\n\n\u2014We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.\n\n\u2014-True for you, says Joe.\n\nAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:\n\n\u2014Now, don't you think, Bergan?\n\n\u2014Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.\n\nIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.\n\n\u2014He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.\n\n\u2014He is, says Joe. Isn't he?\n\n\u2014Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.\n\n\u2014Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.\n\n\u2014My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.\n\nHe's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.\n\nHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.\n\nPride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.\n\nAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.\n\n\u2014Hello, Ned.\n\n\u2014Hello, Alf.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack.\n\n\u2014Hello, Joe.\n\n\u2014God save you, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?\n\n\u2014Half one, says Ned.\n\nSo J. J. ordered the drinks.\n\n\u2014Were you round at the court? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.\n\n\u2014Hope so, says Ned.\n\nNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.\n\n\u2014Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.\n\n\u2014Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.\n\n\u2014Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.\n\n\u2014Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.\n\n\u2014Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.\n\n\u2014Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.\n\n\u2014Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.\n\n\u2014Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.\n\n\u2014How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...\n\n\u2014Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.\n\n\u2014Nor good red herring, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.\n\nBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.\n\n\u2014And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.\n\nSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.\n\n\u2014Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Good health, Ned, says J. J.\n\n\u2014-There he is again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Where? says Alf.\n\nAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.\n\n\u2014How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Remanded, says J. J.\n\nOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.\n\n\u2014Who tried the case? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Recorder, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\n\n\u2014Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.\n\nAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:\n\n\u2014A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?\n\n\u2014Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\n\n\u2014And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.\n\nAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.\n\n\u2014Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.\n\nSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.\n\n\u2014Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.\n\n\u2014Rely on me, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.\n\n\u2014O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.\n\n\u2014Consider that done, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Very kind of you, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.\n\n\u2014Decree nisi, says J. J.\n\nAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.\n\n\u2014A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.\n\n\u2014And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\n\n\u2014Give us a squint at her, says I.\n\nAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.\n\n\u2014O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!\n\n\u2014There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?\n\nSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.\n\n\u2014Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?\n\nO'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.\n\n\u2014It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.\n\nSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.\n\n\u2014Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.\n\n\u2014The European family, says J. J....\n\n\u2014They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\n\nAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!\n\nHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.\n\n\u2014What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.\n\n\u2014Gold cup, says he.\n\n\u2014Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.\n\n\u2014And Bass's mare? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.\n\n\u2014I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.\n\n\u2014Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.\n\nSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.\n\n\u2014Not there, my child, says he.\n\n\u2014Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.\n\nAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.\n\n\u2014Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.\n\n\u2014Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?\n\n\u2014As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...\n\n\u2014Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.\n\n\u2014Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.\n\nThe fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.\n\n\u2014And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\n\n\u2014And will again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.\n\nAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.\n\n\u2014Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?\n\n\u2014An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\u2014Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.\n\nHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.\n\n\u2014But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?\n\n\u2014I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.\n\nSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.\n\n\u2014A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\n\nThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.\n\n\u2014That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.\n\nThe fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.\n\n\u2014On which the sun never rises, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.\n\nThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.\n\n\u2014But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?\n\nDidn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.\n\n\u2014We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.\n\n\u2014Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...\n\n\u2014We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.\n\n\u2014Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?\n\n\u2014The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Fran\u00e7ais, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.\n\n\u2014And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?\n\nJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.\n\n\u2014Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!\n\n\u2014And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.\n\n\u2014They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.\n\nAnd says J. J.:\n\n\u2014Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.\n\n\u2014Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says he. I will.\n\n\u2014You? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.\n\n\u2014Repeat that dose, says Joe.\n\nBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.\n\n\u2014Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.\n\n\u2014But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014What is it? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.\n\n\u2014By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years.\n\nSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:\n\n\u2014Or also living in different places.\n\n\u2014That covers my case, says Joe.\n\n\u2014What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.\n\nThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\n\n\u2014After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.\n\n\u2014Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.\n\nThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave\u2014all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.\n\n\u2014Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?\n\n\u2014That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.\n\n\u2014And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.\n\nGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.\n\n\u2014Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\n\n\u2014Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.\n\nThat's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.\n\n\u2014But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.\n\nWho's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.\n\n\u2014A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.\n\n\u2014Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.\n\n\u2014That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.\n\nLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.\n\n\u2014Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.\n\n\u2014Hurrah, there, says Joe.\n\n\u2014The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.\n\nAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\n\n\u2014We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\nSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:\n\n\u2014A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.\n\n\u2014Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.\n\n\u2014Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\n\n\u2014Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.\n\n\u2014And a very good initial too, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is?\n\n\u2014Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.\n\n\u2014I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels.\n\n\u2014Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?\n\n\u2014That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.\n\n\u2014There you are, says Terry.\n\nGoodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\n\nSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one.\n\n\u2014Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.\n\nSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense.\n\nOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.\n\n\u2014Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!\n\nSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\n\nMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\n\n\u2014Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\n\n\u2014Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\n\n\u2014Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.\n\n\u2014How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?\n\nAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.\n\n\u2014Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.\n\n\u2014Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?\n\nMine host bowed again as he made answer:\n\n\u2014What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?\n\n\u2014Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!\n\n\u2014Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.\n\nSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.\n\n\u2014Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.\n\n\u2014Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?\n\n\u2014That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.\n\n\u2014Who made those allegations? says Alf.\n\n\u2014I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.\n\n\u2014And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow?\n\n\u2014Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.\n\n\u2014Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.\n\n\u2014Who is Junius? says J. J.\n\n\u2014We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.\n\n\u2014He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.\n\n\u2014Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.\n\n\u2014That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!\n\n\u2014Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother.\n\n\u2014Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.\n\n\u2014O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\n\n\u2014En ventre sa m\u00e8re, says J. J.\n\n\u2014Do you call that a man? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014And who does he suspect? says the citizen.\n\nGob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.\n\n\u2014Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.\n\n\u2014A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\n\n\u2014Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.\n\n\u2014Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.\n\n\u2014You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.\n\n\u2014Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.\n\n\u2014Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.\n\n\u2014Amen, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And I'm sure He will, says Joe.\n\nAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.\n\n\u2014Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.\n\n\u2014Qui fecit coelum et terram.\n\n\u2014Dominus vobiscum.\n\n\u2014Et cum spiritu tuo.\n\nAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:\n\n\u2014Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.\n\n\u2014And so say all of us, says Jack.\n\n\u2014Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.\n\n\u2014Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.\n\nI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.\n\n\u2014I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not...\n\n\u2014No, says Martin, we're ready.\n\nCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,\n\n\u2014Beg your pardon, says he.\n\n\u2014Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret.\n\nAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\n\n\u2014Bye bye all, says Martin.\n\nAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\n\n\u2014-Off with you, says\n\nMartin to the jarvey.\n\nThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.\n\nBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\n\n\u2014Let me alone, says he.\n\nAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:\n\n\u2014Three cheers for Israel!\n\nArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.\n\nAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:\n\n\u2014Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!\n\nAnd says he:\n\n\u2014Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.\n\n\u2014He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.\n\n\u2014Whose God? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.\n\nGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\n\n\u2014By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.\n\nBy Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.\n\n\u2014Stop! Stop! says Joe.\n\nA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great \u00e9clat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy's March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra, kedves bar\u00e1ton! Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra! Gone but not forgotten.\n\nGob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre:\n\n\u2014Where is he till I murder him?\n\nAnd Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.\n\n\u2014Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.\n\nBut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other way and off with him.\n\n\u2014Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!\n\nBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\n\nThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of d\u00e9bris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R. C. S. I.\n\nYou never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.\n\n\u2014Did I kill him, says he, or what?\n\nAnd he shouting to the bloody dog:\n\n\u2014After him, Garry! After him, boy!\n\nAnd the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.\n\nWhen, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai! And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1701223", "artist_names": "The Monkees", "full_title": "It's Nice to Be with You by\u00a0The\u00a0Monkees",

Things You Never Get Used To LyricsSome things you never get used to\n\nIt's the same routine of getting up every morning\nAnd putting on a smile\nBut underneath there's another person\nWho can't find a reason to make living worthwhile\n\nAh, another day to get through\nWithout the love that once was mine\nSometimes I think my heartaches come to an end\nAnd then something brings them all back again\nLike wanting you and like having you\nI'll never get used to\nI've gotten used to not listing\nFor familiar sounds you used to make\nNow I'm trying to get out of the habit\nOf calling your name first thing when I awake\n\nLook here, it's like a child's first step\nI have to learn to walk all, all over again\n'Cause you were always there if I should fall\nAnd now there's nobody else that I can call\nIt's like wanting you and not having you\nI'll never get used to\n\nLost in a cloud\nI think I caught a glimpse of you\nBlindly I rush to touch your hand, huh!\nTo discover it's my mind\nPlaying tricks on me again (Tricks on me again)\n\nSome things you never get used to\nSometimes I think my heartaches come to an end\nAnd then something brings them all back again\nLike wanting

The Athenians also made an expedition against the isle of Melos with thirty ships of their own, six Chian, and two Lesbian vessels, sixteen hundred heavy infantry, three hundred archers, and twenty mounted archers from Athens, and about fifteen hundred heavy infantry from the allies and the islanders. The Melians are a colony of Lacedaemon that would not submit to the Athenians like the other islanders, and at first remained neutral and took no part in the struggle, but afterwards upon the Athenians using violence and plundering their territory, assumed an attitude of open hostility. Cleomedes, son of Lycomedes, and Tisias, son of Tisimachus, the generals, encamping in their territory with the above armament, before doing any harm to their land, sent envoys to negotiate. These the Melians did not bring before the people, but bade them state the object of their mission to the magistrates and the few; upon which the Athenian envoys spoke as follows:\n\nAthenians. Since the negotiations are not to go on before the people, in order that we may not be able to speak straight on without interruption, and deceive the ears of the multitude by seductive arguments which would pass without refutation (for we know that this is the meaning of our being brought before the few), what if you who sit there were to pursue a method more cautious still? Make no set speech yourselves, but take us up at whatever you do not like, and settle that before going any farther. And first tell us if this proposition of ours suits you.\n\nThe Melian commissioners answered:\n\nMelians. To the fairness of quietly instructing each other as you propose there is nothing to object; but your military preparations are too far advanced to agree with what you say, as we see you are come to be judges in your own cause, and that all we can reasonably expect from this negotiation is war, if we prove to have right on our side and refuse to submit, and in the contrary case, slavery.\nAthenians. If you have met to reason about presentiments of the future, or for anything else than to consult for the safety of your state upon the facts that you see before you, we will give over; otherwise we will go on.\n\nMelians. It is natural and excusable for men in our position to turn more ways than one both in thought and utterance. However, the question in this conference is, as you say, the safety of our country; and the discussion, if you please, can proceed in the way which you propose.\n\nAthenians. For ourselves, we shall not trouble you with specious pretences\u2014either of how we have a right to our empire because we overthrew the Mede, or are now attacking you because of wrong that you have done us\u2014and make a long speech which would not be believed; and in return we hope that you, instead of thinking to influence us by saying that you did not join the Lacedaemonians, although their colonists, or that you have done us no wrong, will aim at what is feasible, holding in view the real sentiments of us both; since you know as well as we do that right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.\n\nMelians. As we think, at any rate, it is expedient\u2014we speak as we are obliged, since you enjoin us to let right alone and talk only of interest\u2014that you should not destroy what is our common protection, the privilege of being allowed in danger to invoke what is fair and right, and even to profit by arguments not strictly valid if they can be got to pass current. And you are as much interested in this as any, as your fall would be a signal for the heaviest vengeance and an example for the world to meditate upon.\n\nAthenians. The end of our empire, if end it should, does not frighten us: a rival empire like Lacedaemon, even if Lacedaemon was our real antagonist, is not so terrible to the vanquished as subjects who by themselves attack and overpower their rulers. This, however, is a risk that we are content to take. We will now proceed to show you that we are come here in the interest of our empire, and that we shall say what we are now going to say, for the preservation of your country; as we would fain exercise that empire over you without trouble, and see you preserved for the good of us both.\nMelians. And how, pray, could it turn out as good for us to serve as for you to rule?\n\nAthenians. Because you would have the advantage of submitting before suffering the worst, and we should gain by not destroying you.\n\nMelians. So that you would not consent to our being neutral, friends instead of enemies, but allies of neither side.\n\nAthenians. No; for your hostility cannot so much hurt us as your friendship will be an argument to our subjects of our weakness, and your enmity of our power.\n\nMelians. Is that your subjects' idea of equity, to put those who have nothing to do with you in the same category with peoples that are most of them your own colonists, and some conquered rebels?\n\nAthenians. As far as right goes they think one has as much of it as the other, and that if any maintain their independence it is because they are strong, and that if we do not molest them it is because we are afraid; so that besides extending our empire we should gain in security by your subjection; the fact that you are islanders and weaker than others rendering it all the more important that you should not succeed in baffling the masters of the sea.\n\nMelians. But do you consider that there is no security in the policy which we indicate? For here again if you debar us from talking about justice and invite us to obey your interest, we also must explain ours, and try to persuade you, if the two happen to coincide. How can you avoid making enemies of all existing neutrals who shall look at case from it that one day or another you will attack them? And what is this but to make greater the enemies that you have already, and to force others to become so who would otherwise have never thought of it?\n\nAthenians. Why, the fact is that continentals generally give us but little alarm; the liberty which they enjoy will long prevent their taking precautions against us; it is rather islanders like yourselves, outside our empire, and subjects smarting under the yoke, who would be the most likely to take a rash step and lead themselves and us into obvious danger.\n\nMelians. Well then, if you risk so much to retain your empire, and your subjects to get rid of it, it were surely great baseness and cowardice in us who are still free not to try everything that can be tried, before submitting to your yoke.\nAthenians. Not if you are well advised, the contest not being an equal one, with honour as the prize and shame as the penalty, but a question of self-preservation and of not resisting those who are far stronger than you are.\n\nMelians. But we know that the fortune of war is sometimes more impartial than the disproportion of numbers might lead one to suppose; to submit is to give ourselves over to despair, while action still preserves for us a hope that we may stand erect.\nAthenians. Hope, danger's comforter, may be indulged in by those who have abundant resources, if not without loss at all events without ruin; but its nature is to be extravagant, and those who go so far as to put their all upon the venture see it in its true colours only when they are ruined; but so long as the discovery would enable them to guard against it, it is never found wanting. Let not this be the case with you, who are weak and hang on a single turn of the scale; nor be like the vulgar, who, abandoning such security as human means may still afford, when visible hopes fail them in extremity, turn to invisible, to prophecies and oracles, and other such inventions that delude men with hopes to their destruction.\n\nMelians. You may be sure that we are as well aware as you of the difficulty of contending against your power and fortune, unless the terms be equal. But we trust that the gods may grant us fortune as good as yours, since we are just men fighting against unjust, and that what we want in power will be made up by the alliance of the Lacedaemonians, who are bound, if only for very shame, to come to the aid of their kindred. Our confidence, therefore, after all is not so utterly irrational.\n\nAthenians. When you speak of the favour of the gods, we may as fairly hope for that as yourselves; neither our pretensions nor our conduct being in any way contrary to what men believe of the gods, or practise among themselves. Of the gods we believe, and of men we know, that by a necessary law of their nature they rule wherever they can. And it is not as if we were the first to make this law, or to act upon it when made: we found it existing before us, and shall leave it to exist for ever after us; all we do is to make use of it, knowing that you and everybody else, having the same power as we have, would do the same as we do. Thus, as far as the gods are concerned, we have no fear and no reason to fear that we shall be at a disadvantage. But when we come to your notion about the Lacedaemonians, which leads you to believe that shame will make them help you, here we bless your simplicity but do not envy your folly. The Lacedaemonians, when their own interests or their country's laws are in question, are the worthiest men alive; of their conduct towards others much might be said, but no clearer idea of it could be given than by shortly saying that of all the men we know they are most conspicuous in considering what is agreeable honourable, and what is expedient just. Such a way of thinking does not promise much for the safety which you now unreasonably count upon.\n\nMelians. But it is for this very reason that we now trust to their respect for expediency to prevent them from betraying the Melians, their colonists, and thereby losing the confidence of their friends in Hellas and helping their enemies.\n\nAthenians. Then you do not adopt the view that expediency goes with security, while justice and honour cannot be followed without danger; and danger the Lacedaemonians generally court as little as possible.\n\nMelians. But we believe that they would be more likely to face even danger for our sake, and with more confidence than for others, as our nearness to Peloponnese makes it easier for them to act, and our common blood ensures our fidelity.\n\nAthenians. Yes, but what an intending ally trusts to is not the goodwill of those who ask his aid, but a decided superiority of power for action; and the Lacedaemonians look to this even more than others. At least, such is their distrust of their home resources that it is only with numerous allies that they attack a neighbour; now is it likely that while we are masters of the sea they will cross over to an island?\n\nMelians. But they would have others to send. The Cretan Sea is a wide one, and it is more difficult for those who command it to intercept others, than for those who wish to elude them to do so safely. And should the Lacedaemonians miscarry in this, they would fall upon your land, and upon those left of your allies whom Brasidas did not reach; and instead of places which are not yours, you will have to fight for your own country and your own confederacy.\n\nAthenians. Some diversion of the kind you speak of you may one day experience, only to learn, as others have done, that the Athenians never once yet withdrew from a siege for fear of any. But we are struck by the fact that, after saying you would consult for the safety of your country, in all this discussion you have mentioned nothing which men might trust in and think to be saved by. Your strongest arguments depend upon hope and the future, and your actual resources are too scanty, as compared with those arrayed against you, for you to come out victorious. You will therefore show great blindness of judgment, unless, after allowing us to retire, you can find some counsel more prudent than this. You will surely not be caught by that idea of disgrace, which in dangers that are disgraceful, and at the same time too plain to be mistaken, proves so fatal to mankind; since in too many cases the very men that have their eyes perfectly open to what they are rushing into, let the thing called disgrace, by the mere influence of a seductive name, lead them on to a point at which they become so enslaved by the phrase as in fact to fall wilfully into hopeless disaster, and incur disgrace more disgraceful as the companion of error, than when it comes as the result of misfortune. This, if you are well advised, you will guard against; and you will not think it dishonourable to submit to the greatest city in Hellas, when it makes you the moderate offer of becoming its tributary ally, without ceasing to enjoy the country that belongs to you; nor when you have the choice given you between war and security, will you be so blinded as to choose the worse. And it is certain that those who do not yield to their equals, who keep terms with their superiors, and are moderate towards their inferiors, on the whole succeed best. Think over the matter, therefore, after our withdrawal, and reflect once and again that it is for your country that you are consulting, that you have not more than one, and that upon this one deliberation depends its prosperity or ruin.\n\nThe Athenians now withdrew from the conference; and the Melians, left to themselves, came to a decision corresponding with what they had maintained in the discussion, and answered: \"Our resolution, Athenians, is the same as it was at first. We will not in a moment deprive of freedom a city that has been inhabited these seven hundred years; but we put our trust in the fortune by which the gods have preserved it until now, and in the help of men, that is, of the Lacedaemonians; and so we will try and save ourselves. Meanwhile we invite you to allow us to be friends to you and foes to neither party, and to retire from our country after making such a treaty as shall seem fit to us both.\"\n\nSuch was the answer of the Melians. The Athenians now departing from the conference said: \"Well, you alone, as it seems to us, judging from these resolutions, regard what is future as more certain than what is before your eyes, and what is out of sight, in your eagerness, as already coming to pass; and as you have staked most on, and trusted most in, the Lacedaemonians, your fortune, and your hopes, so will you be most completely deceived.\"\n\nThe Athenian envoys now returned to the army; and the Melians showing no signs of yielding, the generals at once betook themselves to hostilities, and drew a line of circumvallation round the Melians, dividing the work among the different states. Subsequently the Athenians returned with most of their army, leaving behind them a certain number of their own citizens and of the allies to keep guard by land and sea. The force thus left stayed on and besieged the place.\nAbout the same time the Argives invaded the territory of Phlius and lost eighty men cut off in an ambush by the Phliasians and Argive exiles. Meanwhile the Athenians at Pylos took so much plunder from the Lacedaemonians that the latter, although they still refrained from breaking off the treaty and going to war with Athens, yet proclaimed that any of their people that chose might plunder the Athenians. The Corinthians also commenced hostilities with the Athenians for private quarrels of their own; but the rest of the Peloponnesians stayed quiet. Meanwhile the Melians attacked by night and took the part of the Athenian lines over against the market, and killed some of the men, and brought in corn and all else that they could find useful to them, and so returned and kept quiet, while the Athenians took measures to keep better guard in future.\n\nSummer was now over. The next winter the Lacedaemonians intended to invade the Argive territory, but arriving at the frontier found the sacrifices for crossing unfavourable, and went back again. This intention of theirs gave the Argives suspicions of certain of their fellow citizens, some of whom they arrested; others, however, escaped them. About the same time the Melians again took another part of the Athenian lines which were but feebly garrisoned. Reinforcements afterwards arriving from Athens in consequence, under the command of Philocrates, son of Demeas, the siege was now pressed vigorously; and some treachery taking place inside, the Melians surrendered at discretion to the Athenians, who put to death all the grown men whom they took, and sold the women and children for slaves, and subsequently sent out five hundred colonists and inhabited the place themselves.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4605650", "artist_names": "James Brown & The Famous Flames", "full_title": "America is My Home, Pt.

LyricsPeople say that we don't know\nWhat love is or how to make it grow\nWell, I don't know if all that's true\n'Cause you got me and baby, I got you\n\nOh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe\n\nSay, our love won't pay the rent\nBefore it's earned, our money's all been spent\nI guess that's sure, we don't have a lot\nBut at least I'm sure of all the things we've got\nOh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe\n\nI got flowers in the spring, yeah\nI've got you, I've got you to wear my ring\nAnd when I'm sad, you're a clown\nAnd when I get scared, you're always around\n\nLet them say we are wrong\nI don't care, with you I can't go wrong\nBut with our love like your's and mine\nThere ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb\n\nOh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe\n\nI got you to hold my hand\nI got you to understand\nI got you to walk with me\nAnd I got you to talk with me\n\nI got you to kiss goodnight\nI got you, hold me tight\nI got you, I won't let go\nI got you to love me so\n\nOh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe\nI got you, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babeYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 492, "api_path":

Bakke Lyrics438 U.S. 265 (1978)REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\nv.\nBAKKE.No. 76-811.Supreme Court of United States.\nArgued October 12, 1977.\nDecided June 28, 1978.\nCERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.*268\n*269MR. JUSTICE POWELL announced the judgment of the Court.This case presents a challenge to the special admissions program of the petitioner, the Medical School of the University of California at Davis, which is designed to assure the admission *270 of a specified number of students from certain minority groups. The Superior Court of California sustained respondent's challenge, holding that petitioner's program violated the California Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.  2000d et seq., and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court enjoined petitioner from considering respondent's race or the race of any other applicant in making admissions decisions. It refused, however, to order respondent's admission to the Medical School, holding that he had not carried his burden of proving that he would have been admitted but for the constitutional and statutory violations. The Supreme Court of California affirmed those portions of the trial court's judgment declaring the special admissions program unlawful and enjoining petitioner from considering the race of any applicant.[\u2020]]*271 It modified that portion of the judgment denying respondent's requested injunction and directed the trial court to order his admission.\n\nFor the reasons stated in the following opinion, I believe that so much of the judgment of the California court as holds petitioner's special admissions program unlawful and directs that respondent be admitted to the Medical School must be affirmed. For the reasons expressed in a separate opinion, my Brothers THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS concur in this judgment.\n\n*272 I also conclude for the reasons stated in the following opinion that the portion of the court's judgment enjoining petitioner from according any consideration to race in its admissions process must be reversed. For reasons expressed in separate opinions, my Brothers MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN concur in this judgment.\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part.\n[\u2020\u2020]]IThe Medical School of the University of California at Davis opened in 1968 with an entering class of 50 students. In 1971, the size of the entering class was increased to 100 students, a level at which it remains. No admissions program for disadvantaged or minority students existed when the school opened, and the first class contained three Asians but no blacks, no Mexican-Americans, and no American Indians. Over the next two years, the faculty devised a special admissions program to increase the representation of \"disadvantaged\" students in each Medical School class.[1] The special program consisted of *273 a separate admissions system operating in coordination with the regular admissions process.\n\nUnder the regular admissions procedure, a candidate could submit his application to the Medical School beginning in July of the year preceding the academic year for which admission was sought. Record 149. Because of the large number of applications,[2] the admissions committee screened each one to select candidates for further consideration. Candidates whose overall undergraduate grade point averages fell below 2.5 on a scale of 4.0 were summarily rejected. Id., at 63. About *274 one out of six applicants was invited for a personal interview. Ibid. Following the interviews, each candidate was rated on a scale of 1 to 100 by his interviewers and four other members of the admissions committee. The rating embraced the interviewers' summaries, the candidate's overall grade point average, grade point average in science courses, scores on the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), letters of recommendation, extracurricular activities, and other biographical data. Id., at 62. The ratings were added together to arrive at each candidate's \"benchmark\" score. Since five committee members rated each candidate in 1973, a perfect score was 500; in 1974, six members rated each candidate, so that a perfect score was 600. The full committee then reviewed the file and scores of each applicant and made offers of admission on a \"rolling\" basis.[3] The chairman was responsible for placing names on the waiting list. They were not placed in strict numerical order; instead, the chairman had discretion to include persons with \"special skills.\" Id., at 63-64.\n\nThe special admissions program operated with a separate committee, a majority of whom were members of minority groups. Id., at 163. On the 1973 application form, candidates were asked to indicate whether they wished to be considered as \"economically and/or educationally disadvantaged\" applicants; on the 1974 form the question was whether they wished to be considered as members of a \"minority group,\" which the Medical School apparently viewed as \"Blacks,\" \"Chicanos,\" \"Asians,\" and \"American Indians.\" Id., at 65-66, 146, 197, 203-205, 216-218. If these questions were answered affirmatively, the application was forwarded to the special admissions committee. No formal definition of \"disadvantaged\" *275 was ever produced, id., at 163-164, but the chairman of the special committee screened each application to see whether it reflected economic or educational deprivation.[4] Having passed this initial hurdle, the applications then were rated by the special committee in a fashion similar to that used by the general admissions committee, except that special candidates did not have to meet the 2.5 grade point average cutoff applied to regular applicants. About one-fifth of the total number of special applicants were invited for interviews in 1973 and 1974.[5] Following each interview, the special committee assigned each special applicant a benchmark score. The special committee then presented its top choices to the general admissions committee. The latter did not rate or compare the special candidates against the general applicants, id., at 388, but could reject recommended special candidates for failure to meet course requirements or other specific deficiencies. Id., at 171-172. The special committee continued to recommend special applicants until a number prescribed by faculty vote were admitted. While the overall class size was still 50, the prescribed number was 8; in 1973 and 1974, when the class size had doubled to 100, the prescribed number of special admissions also doubled, to 16. Id., at 164, 166.\n\nFrom the year of the increase in class size1971through 1974, the special program resulted in the admission of 21 black students, 30 Mexican-Americans, and 12 Asians, for a total of 63 minority students. Over the same period, the regular admissions program produced 1 black, 6 Mexican-Americans, *276 and 37 Asians, for a total of 44 minority students.[6] Although disadvantaged whites applied to the special program in large numbers, see n. 5, supra, none received an offer of admission through that process. Indeed, in 1974, at least, the special committee explicitly considered only \"disadvantaged\" special applicants who were members of one of the designated minority groups. Record 171.\n\nAllan Bakke is a white male who applied to the Davis Medical School in both 1973 and 1974. In both years Bakke's application was considered under the general admissions program, and he received an interview. His 1973 interview was with Dr. Theodore C. West, who considered Bakke \"a very desirable applicant to [the] medical school.\" Id., at 225. Despite a strong benchmark score of 468 out of 500, Bakke was rejected. His application had come late in the year, and no applicants in the general admissions process with scores below 470 were accepted after Bakke's application was completed. Id., at 69. There were four special admissions slots unfilled at that time, however, for which Bakke was not considered. Id., at 70. After his 1973 rejection, Bakke wrote to Dr. George H. Lowrey, Associate Dean and Chairman of the Admissions Committee, protesting that the special admissions program operated as a racial and ethnic quota. Id., at 259.\n\n*277 Bakke's 1974 application was completed early in the year. Id., at 70. His student interviewer gave him an overall rating of 94, finding him \"friendly, well tempered, conscientious and delightful to speak with.\" Id., at 229. His faculty interviewer was, by coincidence, the same Dr. Lowrey to whom he had written in protest of the special admissions program. Dr. Lowrey found Bakke \"rather limited in his approach\" to the problems of the medical profession and found disturbing Bakke's \"very definite opinions which were based more on his personal viewpoints than upon a study of the total problem.\" Id., at 226. Dr. Lowrey gave Bakke the lowest of his six ratings, an 86; his total was 549 out of 600. Id., at 230. Again, Bakke's application was rejected. In neither year did the chairman of the admissions committee, Dr. Lowrey, exercise his discretion to place Bakke on the waiting list. Id., at 64. In both years, applicants were admitted under the special program with grade point averages, MCAT scores, and benchmark scores significantly lower than Bakke's.[7]\n\nAfter the second rejection, Bakke filed the instant suit in the Superior Court of California.[8] He sought mandatory, injunctive, and declaratory relief compelling his admission to the Medical School. He alleged that the Medical School's special admissions program operated to exclude him from the *278 school on the basis of his race, in violation of his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,[9] Art. I,  21, of the California Constitution,[10] and  601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C.  2000d.[11] The University cross-complained for a declaration that its special admissions program was lawful. The trial *279 court found that the special program operated as a racial quota, because minority applicants in the special program were rated only against one another, Record 388, and 16 places in the class of 100 were reserved for them. Id., at 295-296. Declaring that the University could not take race into account in making admissions decisions, the trial court held the challenged program violative of the Federal Constitution, the State Constitution, and Title VI. The court refused to order Bakke's admission, however, holding that he had failed to carry his burden of proving that he would have been admitted but for the existence of the special program.\n\nBakke appealed from the portion of the trial court judgment denying him admission, and the University appealed from the decision that its special admissions program was unlawful and the order enjoining it from considering race in the processing of applications. The Supreme Court of California transferred the case directly from the trial court, \"because of the importance of the issues involved.\" 18 Cal. 3d 34, 39, 553 P. 2d 1152, 1156 (1976). The California court accepted the findings of the trial court with respect to the University's program.[12] Because the special admissions program involved a racial classification, the Supreme Court held itself bound to apply strict scrutiny. Id., at 49, 553 P. 2d, at 1162-1163. It then turned to the goals the University presented as justifying the special program. Although the court agreed that the goals of integrating the medical profession and increasing the number of physicians willing to serve members of minority groups were compelling state interests, id., at 53, 553 P. 2d, at 1165, it concluded that the special admissions program was not the least intrusive means of achieving those goals. Without passing on the state constitutional or the federal statutory grounds cited in the trial court's judgment, the California court held *280 that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required that \"no applicant may be rejected because of his race, in favor of another who is less qualified, as measured by standards applied without regard to race.\" Id., at 55, 553 P. 2d, at 1166.\n\nTurning to Bakke's appeal, the court ruled that since Bakke had established that the University had discriminated against him on the basis of his race, the burden of proof shifted to the University to demonstrate that he would not have been admitted even in the absence of the special admissions program.[13]Id., at 63-64, 553 P. 2d, at 1172. The court analogized Bakke's situation to that of a plaintiff under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.  2000e-17 (1970 ed., Supp. V), see, e. g., Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747, 772 (1976). 18 Cal. 3d, at 63-64, 553 P. 2d, at 1172. On this basis, the court initially ordered a remand for the purpose of determining whether, under the newly allocated burden of proof, Bakke would have been admitted to either the 1973 or the 1974 entering class in the absence of the special admissions program. App. A to Application for Stay 48. In its petition for rehearing below, however, the University conceded its inability to carry that burden. App. B to Application for Stay A19-A20.[14] The *281 California court thereupon amended its opinion to direct that the trial court enter judgment ordering Bakke's admission to the Medical School. 18 Cal. 3d, at 64, 553 P. 2d, at 1172. That order was stayed pending review in this Court. 429 U. S. 953 (1976). We granted certiorari to consider the important constitutional issue. 429 U. S. 1090 (1977).IIIn this Court the parties neither briefed nor argued the applicability of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Rather, as had the California court, they focused exclusively upon the validity of the special admissions program under the Equal Protection Clause. Because it was possible, however, that a decision on Title VI might obviate resort to constitutional interpretation, see Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346-348 (1936) (concurring opinion), we requested supplementary briefing on the statutory issue. 434 U. S. 900 (1977).AAt the outset we face the question whether a right of action for private parties exists under Title VI. Respondent argues that there is a private right of action, invoking the test set forth in Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66, 78 (1975). He contends *282 that the statute creates a federal right in his favor, that legislative history reveals an intent to permit private actions,[15] that such actions would further the remedial purposes of the statute, and that enforcement of federal rights under the Civil Rights Act generally is not relegated to the States. In addition, he cites several lower court decisions which have recognized or assumed the existence of a private right of action.[16] Petitioner denies the existence of a private right of action, arguing that the sole function of  601, see n. 11, supra, was to establish a predicate for administrative action under  602, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C.  2000d-1.[17] In its view, administrative curtailment of federal funds under that section was the only sanction to be imposed upon recipients that *283 violated  601. Petitioner also points out that Title VI contains no explicit grant of a private right of action, in contrast to Titles II, III, IV, and VII, of the same statute, 42 U. S. C.  2000a-3 (a), 2000b-2, 2000c-8, and 2000e-5 (f) (1970 ed. and Supp. V).[18]\n\nWe find it unnecessary to resolve this question in the instant case. The question of respondent's right to bring an action under Title VI was neither argued nor decided in either of the courts below, and this Court has been hesitant to review questions not addressed below. McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430, 434-435 (1940). See also Massachusetts v. Westcott, 431 U. S. 322 (1977); Cardinale v. Louisiana, 394 U. S. 437, 439 (1969). Cf. Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U. S. 106, 121 (1976). We therefore do not address this difficult issue. Similarly, we need not pass *284 upon petitioner's claim that private plaintiffs under Title VI must exhaust administrative remedies. We assume, only for the purposes of this case, that respondent has a right of action under Title VI. See Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563, 571 n. 2 (1974) (STEWART, J., concurring in result).BThe language of  601, 78 Stat. 252, like that of the Equal Protection Clause, is majestic in its sweep:\"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"The concept of \"discrimination,\" like the phrase \"equal protection of the laws,\" is susceptible of varying interpretations, for as Mr. Justice Holmes declared, \"[a] word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.\" Towne v. Eisner, 245 U. S. 418, 425 (1918). We must, therefore, seek whatever aid is available in determining the precise meaning of the statute before us. Train v. Colorado Public Interest Research Group, 426 U. S. 1, 10 (1976), quoting United States v. American Trucking Assns., 310 U. S. 534, 543-544 (1940). Examination of the voluminous legislative history of Title VI reveals a congressional intent to halt federal funding of entities that violate a prohibition of racial discrimination similar to that of the Constitution. Although isolated statements of various legislators, taken out of context, can be marshaled in support of the proposition that  601 enacted a purely color-blind scheme,[19] without regard to the reach of the Equal Protection *285 Clause, these comments must be read against the background of both the problem that Congress was addressing and the broader view of the statute that emerges from a full examination of the legislative debates.\n\nThe problem confronting Congress was discrimination against Negro citizens at the hands of recipients of federal moneys. Indeed, the color blindness pronouncements cited in the margin at n. 19, generally occur in the midst of extended remarks dealing with the evils of segregation in federally funded programs. Over and over again, proponents of the bill detailed the plight of Negroes seeking equal treatment in such programs.[20] There simply was no reason for Congress to consider the validity of hypothetical preferences that might be accorded minority citizens; the legislators were dealing with the real and pressing problem of how to guarantee those citizens equal treatment.\n\nIn addressing that problem, supporters of Title VI repeatedly declared that the bill enacted constitutional principles. For example, Representative Celler, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and floor manager of the legislation in the House, emphasized this in introducing the bill:\"The bill would offer assurance that hospitals financed by Federal money would not deny adequate care to Negroes. It would prevent abuse of food distribution programs whereby Negroes have been known to be denied food *286 surplus supplies when white persons were given such food. It would assure Negroes the benefits now accorded only white students in programs of high[er] education financed by Federal funds. It would, in short, assure the existing right to equal treatment in the enjoyment of Federal funds. It would not destroy any rights of private property or freedom of association.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 1519 (1964) (emphasis added).Other sponsors shared Representative Celler's view that Title VI embodied constitutional principles.[21]\n\nIn the Senate, Senator Humphrey declared that the purpose of Title VI was \"to insure that Federal funds are spent in accordance with the Constitution and the moral sense of the Nation.\" Id., at 6544. Senator Ribicoff agreed that Title VI embraced the constitutional standard: \"Basically, there is a constitutional restriction against discrimination in the use of federal funds; and title VI simply spells out the procedure to be used in enforcing that restriction.\" Id., at 13333. Other Senators expressed similar views.[22]\nFurther evidence of the incorporation of a constitutional standard into Title VI appears in the repeated refusals of the legislation's supporters precisely to define the term \"discrimination.\" Opponents sharply criticized this failure,[23] but proponents of the bill merely replied that the meaning of *287 \"discrimination\" would be made clear by reference to the Constitution or other existing law. For example, Senator Humphrey noted the relevance of the Constitution:\"As I have said, the bill has a simple purpose. That purpose is to give fellow citizensNegroesthe same rights and opportunities that white people take for granted. This is no more than what was preached by the prophets, and by Christ Himself. It is no more than what our Constitution guarantees.\" Id., at 6553.[24]In view of the clear legislative intent, Title VI must be held to proscribe only those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Fifth Amendment.IIIAPetitioner does not deny that decisions based on race or ethnic origin by faculties and administrations of state universities are reviewable under the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. g., Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U. S. 337 (1938); Sipuel v. Board of Regents, 332 U. S. 631 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629 (1950); McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U. S. 637 (1950). For his part, respondent does not argue that all racial or ethnic classifications are per se invalid. See, e. g., Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81 (1943); Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944); Lee v. Washington, 390 U. S. 333, 334 (1968) (Black, Harlan, and STEWART, JJ., concurring); United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144 (1977). The parties do disagree as to the level of judicial scrutiny to be applied to the special admissions program. Petitioner argues that the court below erred in applying strict scrutiny, as this inexact term has been *288 applied in our cases. That level of review, petitioner asserts, should be reserved for classifications that disadvantage \"discrete and insular minorities.\" See United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152 n. 4 (1938). Respondent, on the other hand, contends that the California court correctly rejected the notion that the degree of judicial scrutiny accorded a particular racial or ethnic classification hinges upon membership in a discrete and insular minority and duly recognized that the \"rights established [by the Fourteenth Amendment] are personal rights.\" Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 22 (1948).\n\nEn route to this crucial battle over the scope of judicial review,[25] the parties fight a sharp preliminary action over the proper characterization of the special admissions program. Petitioner prefers to view it as establishing a \"goal\" of minority representation in the Medical School. Respondent, echoing the courts below, labels it a racial quota.[26]*289 This semantic distinction is beside the point: The special admissions program is undeniably a classification based on race and ethnic background. To the extent that there existed a pool of at least minimally qualified minority applicants to fill the 16 special admissions seats, white applicants could compete only for 84 seats in the entering class, rather than the 100 open to minority applicants. Whether this limitation is described as a quota or a goal, it is a line drawn on the basis of race and ethnic status.[27]\n\nThe guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment extend to all persons. Its language is explicit: \"No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" It is settled beyond question that the \"rights created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal rights,\" Shelley v. Kraemer, supra, at 22. Accord, Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, supra, at 351; McCabe v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 235 U. S. 151, 161-162 (1914). The guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when *290 applied to a person of another color. If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal.\n\nNevertheless, petitioner argues that the court below erred in applying strict scrutiny to the special admissions program because white males, such as respondent, are not a \"discrete and insular minority\" requiring extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process. Carolene Products Co., supra, at 152-153, n. 4. This rationale, however, has never been invoked in our decisions as a prerequisite to subjecting racial or ethnic distinctions to strict scrutiny. Nor has this Court held that discreteness and insularity constitute necessary preconditions to a holding that a particular classification is invidious.[28] See, e. g., Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535, 541 (1942); Carrington v. Rash, 380 U. S. 89, 94-97 (1965). These characteristics may be relevant in deciding whether or not to add new types of classifications to the list of \"suspect\" categories or whether a particular classification survives close examination. See, e. g., Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U. S. 307, 313 (1976) (age); San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 28 (1973) (wealth); Graham v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 365, 372 (1971) (aliens). Racial and ethnic classifications, however, are subject to stringent examination without regard to these additional characteristics. We declared as much in the first cases explicitly to recognize racial distinctions as suspect:\"Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people *291 whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\" Hirabayashi, 320 U. S., at 100.\"[A]ll legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect. That is not to say that all such restrictions are unconstitutional. It is to say that courts must subject them to the most rigid scrutiny.\" Korematsu, 323 U. S., at 216.The Court has never questioned the validity of those pronouncements. Racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination.BThis perception of racial and ethnic distinctions is rooted in our Nation's constitutional and demographic history. The Court's initial view of the Fourteenth Amendment was that its \"one pervading purpose\" was \"the freedom of the slave race, the security and firm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the newly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who had formerly exercised dominion over him.\" Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1873). The Equal Protection Clause, however, was \"[v]irtually strangled in infancy by post-civil-war judicial reactionism.\"[29] It was relegated to decades of relative desuetude while the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, after a short germinal period, flourished as a cornerstone in the Court's defense of property and liberty of contract. See, e. g., Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 661 (1887); Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578 (1897); Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). In that cause, the Fourteenth Amendment's \"one pervading purpose\" was displaced. See, e. g., Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896). It was only as the era of substantive due process came to a close, see, e. g., Nebbia v. New *292 York, 291 U. S. 502 (1934); West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937), that the Equal Protection Clause began to attain a genuine measure of vitality, see, e. g., United States v. Carolene Products, 304 U. S. 144 (1938); Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, supra.\n\nBy that time it was no longer possible to peg the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to the struggle for equality of one racial minority. During the dormancy of the Equal Protection Clause, the United States had become a Nation of minorities.[30] Each had to struggle[31]and to some extent struggles still[32]to overcome the prejudices not of a monolithic majority, but of a \"majority\" composed of various minority groups of whom it was saidperhaps unfairly in many cases that a shared characteristic was a willingness to disadvantage other groups.[33] As the Nation filled with the stock of many lands, the reach of the Clause was gradually extended to all ethnic groups seeking protection from official discrimination. See Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 308 (1880) (Celtic Irishmen) (dictum); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356 (1886) (Chinese); Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33, 41 (1915) (Austrian resident aliens); Korematsu, supra (Japanese); Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U. S. 475 (1954) (Mexican-Americans). The guarantees of equal protection, said the Court in *293 Yick Wo, \"are universal in their application, to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality; and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.\" 118 U. S., at 369.\n\nAlthough many of the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment conceived of its primary function as bridging the vast distance between members of the Negro race and the white \"majority,\" Slaughter-House Cases, supra, the Amendment itself was framed in universal terms, without reference to color, ethnic origin, or condition of prior servitude. As this Court recently remarked in interpreting the 1866 Civil Rights Act to extend to claims of racial discrimination against white persons, \"the 39th Congress was intent upon establishing in the federal law a broader principle than would have been necessary simply to meet the particular and immediate plight of the newly freed Negro slaves.\" McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co., 427 U. S. 273, 296 (1976). And that legislation was specifically broadened in 1870 to ensure that \"all persons,\" not merely \"citizens,\" would enjoy equal rights under the law. See Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 192-202 (1976) (WHITE, J., dissenting). Indeed, it is not unlikely that among the Framers were many who would have applauded a reading of the Equal Protection Clause that states a principle of universal application and is responsive to the racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity of the Nation. See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1056 (1866) (remarks of Rep. Niblack); id., at 2891-2892 (remarks of Sen. Conness); id., 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 883 (1868) (remarks of Sen. Howe) (Fourteenth Amendment \"protect[s] classes from class legislation\"). See also Bickel, The Original Understanding and the Segregation Decision, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 60-63 (1955).\n\nOver the past 30 years, this Court has embarked upon the crucial mission of interpreting the Equal Protection Clause with the view of assuring to all persons \"the protection of *294 equal laws,\" Yick Wo, supra, at 369, in a Nation confronting a legacy of slavery and racial discrimination. See, e. g., Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1 (1948); Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U. S. 284 (1976). Because the landmark decisions in this area arose in response to the continued exclusion of Negroes from the mainstream of American society, they could be characterized as involving discrimination by the \"majority\" white race against the Negro minority. But they need not be read as depending upon that characterization for their results. It suffices to say that \"[o]ver the years, this Court has consistently repudiated `[d]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry' as being `odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.'\" Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 11 (1967), quoting Hirabayashi, 320 U. S., at 100.\n\nPetitioner urges us to adopt for the first time a more restrictive view of the Equal Protection Clause and hold that discrimination against members of the white \"majority\" cannot be suspect if its purpose can be characterized as \"benign.\"[34]*295 The clock of our liberties, however, cannot be turned back to 1868. Brown v. Board of Education, supra, at 492; accord, Loving v. Virginia, supra, at 9. It is far too late to argue that the guarantee of equal protection to all persons permits the recognition of special wards entitled to a degree of protection greater than that accorded others.[35] \"The Fourteenth Amendment is not directed solely against discrimination due to a `two-class theory'that is, based upon differences between `white' and Negro.\" Hernandez, 347 U. S., at 478.\n\nOnce the artificial line of a \"two-class theory\" of the Fourteenth Amendment is put aside, the difficulties entailed in varying the level of judicial review according to a perceived \"preferred\" status of a particular racial or ethnic minority are intractable. The concepts of \"majority\" and \"minority\" necessarily reflect temporary arrangements and political judgments. As observed above, the white \"majority\" itself is composed of various minority groups, most of which can lay claim to a history of prior discrimination at the hands of the State and private individuals. Not all of these groups can receive preferential treatment and corresponding judicial tolerance *296 of distinctions drawn in terms of race and nationality, for then the only \"majority\" left would be a new minority of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. There is no principled basis for deciding which groups would merit \"heightened judicial solicitude\" and which would not.[36] Courts would be asked to evaluate the extent of the prejudice and consequent *297 harm suffered by various minority groups. Those whose societal injury is thought to exceed some arbitrary level of tolerability then would be entitled to preferential classifications at the expense of individuals belonging to other groups. Those classifications would be free from exacting judicial scrutiny. As these preferences began to have their desired effect, and the consequences of past discrimination were undone, new judicial rankings would be necessary. The kind of variable sociological and political analysis necessary to produce such rankings simply does not lie within the judicial competenceeven if they otherwise were politically feasible and socially desirable.[37]*298 Moreover, there are serious problems of justice connected with the idea of preference itself. First, it may not always be clear that a so-called preference is in fact benign. Courts may be asked to validate burdens imposed upon individual members of a particular group in order to advance the group's general interest. See United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U. S., at 172-173 (BRENNAN, J., concurring in part). Nothing in the Constitution supports the notion that individuals may be asked to suffer otherwise impermissible burdens in order to enhance the societal standing of their ethnic groups. Second, preferential programs may only reinforce common stereotypes holding that certain groups are unable to achieve success without special protection based on a factor having no relationship to individual worth. See DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312, 343 (1974) (Douglas, J., dissenting). Third, there is a measure of inequity in forcing innocent persons in respondent's position to bear the burdens of redressing grievances not of their making.\n\nBy hitching the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause to these transitory considerations, we would be holding, as a constitutional principle, that judicial scrutiny of classifications touching on racial and ethnic background may vary with the ebb and flow of political forces. Disparate constitutional tolerance of such classifications well may serve to exacerbate *299 racial and ethnic antagonisms rather than alleviate them. United Jewish Organizations, supra, at 173-174 (BRENNAN, J., concurring in part). Also, the mutability of a constitutional principle, based upon shifting political and social judgments, undermines the chances for consistent application of the Constitution from one generation to the next, a critical feature of its coherent interpretation. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429, 650-651 (1895) (White, J., dissenting). In expounding the Constitution, the Court's role is to discern \"principles sufficiently absolute to give them roots throughout the community and continuity over significant periods of time, and to lift them above the level of the pragmatic political judgments of a particular time and place.\" A. Cox, The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government 114 (1976).\n\nIf it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather than the individual only because of his membership in a particular group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently. Political judgments regarding the necessity for the particular classification may be weighed in the constitutional balance, Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944), but the standard of justification will remain constant. This is as it should be, since those political judgments are the product of rough compromise struck by contending groups within the democratic process.[38] When they touch upon an individual's race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. The Constitution guarantees that right to every person regardless of his background. Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S., at 22; Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U. S., at 351.C*300\nPetitioner contends that on several occasions this Court has approved preferential classifications without applying the most exacting scrutiny. Most of the cases upon which petitioner relies are drawn from three areas: school desegregation, employment discrimination, and sex discrimination. Each of the cases cited presented a situation materially different from the facts of this case.\n\nThe school desegregation cases are inapposite. Each involved remedies for clearly determined constitutional violations. E. g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1 (1971); McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U. S. 39 (1971); Green v. County School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (1968). Racial classifications thus were designed as remedies for the vindication of constitutional entitlement.[39] Moreover, the scope of the remedies was not permitted to exceed the extent of the *301 violations. E. g., Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406 (1977); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717 (1974); see Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424 (1976). See also Austin Independent School Dist. v. United States, 429 U. S. 990, 991-995 (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring). Here, there was no judicial determination of constitutional violation as a predicate for the formulation of a remedial classification.\n\nThe employment discrimination cases also do not advance petitioner's cause. For example, in Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747 (1976), we approved a retroactive award of seniority to a class of Negro truckdrivers who had been the victims of discriminationnot just by society at large, but by the respondent in that case. While this relief imposed some burdens on other employees, it was held necessary \"`to make [the victims] whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination.'\" Id., at 763, quoting Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 418 (1975). The Courts of Appeals have fashioned various types of racial preferences as remedies for constitutional or statutory violations resulting in identified, race-based injuries to individuals held entitled to the preference. E. g., Bridgeport Guardians, Inc. v. Bridgeport Civil Service Commission, 482 F. 2d 1333 (CA2 1973); Carter v. Gallagher, 452 F. 2d 315 (CA8 1972), modified on rehearing en banc, id., at 327. Such preferences also have been upheld where a legislative or administrative body charged with the responsibility made determinations of past discrimination by the industries affected, and fashioned remedies deemed appropriate to rectify the discrimination. E. g., Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania v. Secretary of Labor, 442 F. 2d 159 (CA3), cert. denied, 404 U. S. 854 (1971);[40]Associated General *302 Contractors of Massachusetts, Inc. v. Altshuler, 490 F. 2d 9 (CA1 1973), cert. denied, 416 U. S. 957 (1974); cf. Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966). But we have never approved preferential classifications in the absence of proved constitutional or statutory violations.[41]\nNor is petitioner's view as to the applicable standard supported by the fact that gender-based classifications are not subjected to this level of scrutiny. E. g., Califano v. Webster, 430 U. S. 313, 316-317 (1977); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 211 n. (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring). Gender-based distinctions are less likely to create the analytical and practical *303 problems present in preferential programs premised on racial or ethnic criteria. With respect to gender there are only two possible classifications. The incidence of the burdens imposed by preferential classifications is clear. There are no rival groups which can claim that they, too, are entitled to preferential treatment. Classwide questions as to the group suffering previous injury and groups which fairly can be burdened are relatively manageable for reviewing courts. See, e. g., Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 212-217 (1977); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 645 (1975). The resolution of these same questions in the context of racial and ethnic preferences presents far more complex and intractable problems than gender-based classifications. More importantly, the perception of racial classifications as inherently odious stems from a lengthy and tragic history that gender-based classifications do not share. In sum, the Court has never viewed such classification as inherently suspect or as comparable to racial or ethnic classifications for the purpose of equal protection analysis.\n\nPetitioner also cites Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563 (1974), in support of the proposition that discrimination favoring racial or ethnic minorities has received judicial approval without the exacting inquiry ordinarily accorded \"suspect\" classifications. In Lau, we held that the failure of the San Francisco school system to provide remedial English instruction for some 1,800 students of oriental ancestry who spoke no English amounted to a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.  2000d, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Those regulations required remedial instruction where inability to understand English excluded children of foreign ancestry from participation in educational programs. 414 U. S., at 568. Because we found that the students in Lau were denied \"a meaningful opportunity to participate in the educational program,\" ibid., we remanded for the fashioning of a remedial order.\n\n*304 Lau provides little support for petitioner's argument. The decision rested solely on the statute, which had been construed by the responsible administrative agency to reach educational practices \"which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination,\" ibid. We stated: \"Under these state-imposed standards there is no equality of treatment merely by providing students with the same facilities, textbooks, teachers, and curriculum; for students who do not understand English are effectively foreclosed from any meaningful education.\" Id., at 566. Moreover, the \"preference\" approved did not result in the denial of the relevant benefit\"meaningful opportunity to participate in the educational program\"to anyone else. No other student was deprived by that preference of the ability to participate in San Francisco's school system, and the applicable regulations required similar assistance for all students who suffered similar linguistic deficiencies. Id., at 570-571 (STEWART, J., concurring in result).\n\nIn a similar vein,[42] petitioner contends that our recent decision in United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144 (1977), indicates a willingness to approve racial classifications designed to benefit certain minorities, without denominating the classifications as \"suspect.\" The State of New York had redrawn its reapportionment plan to meet objections of the Department of Justice under  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C.  1973c (1970 ed., Supp. V). Specifically, voting districts were redrawn to enhance the electoral power *305 of certain \"nonwhite\" voters found to have been the victims of unlawful \"dilution\" under the original reapportionment plan. United Jewish Organizations, like Lau, properly is viewed as a case in which the remedy for an administrative finding of discrimination encompassed measures to improve the previously disadvantaged group's ability to participate, without excluding individuals belonging to any other group from enjoyment of the relevant opportunitymeaningful participation in the electoral process.\n\nIn this case, unlike Lau and United Jewish Organizations, there has been no determination by the legislature or a responsible administrative agency that the University engaged in a discriminatory practice requiring remedial efforts. Moreover, the operation of petitioner's special admissions program is quite different from the remedial measures approved in those cases. It prefers the designated minority groups at the expense of other individuals who are totally foreclosed from competition for the 16 special admissions seats in every Medical School class. Because of that foreclosure, some individuals are excluded from enjoyment of a state-provided benefitadmission to the Medical Schoolthey otherwise would receive. When a classification denies an individual opportunities or benefits enjoyed by others solely because of his race or ethnic background, it must be regarded as suspect. E. g., McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U. S., at 641-642.IVWe have held that in \"order to justify the use of a suspect classification, a State must show that its purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is `necessary . . . to the accomplishment' of its purpose or the safeguarding of its interest.\" In re Griffiths, 413 U. S. 717, 721-722 (1973) (footnotes omitted); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S., at 11; McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184, 196 (1964). The special admissions *306 program purports to serve the purposes of: (i) \"reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession,\" Brief for Petitioner 32; (ii) countering the effects of societal discrimination;[43] (iii) increasing the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved; and (iv) obtaining the educational benefits that flow from an ethnically diverse student body. It is necessary to decide which, if any, of these purposes is substantial enough to support the use of a suspect classification.A*307\nIf petitioner's purpose is to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin, such a preferential purpose must be rejected not as insubstantial but as facially invalid. Preferring members of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake. This the Constitution forbids. E. g., Loving v. Virginia, supra, at 11; McLaughlin v. Florida, supra, at 196; Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954).BThe State certainly has a legitimate and substantial interest in ameliorating, or eliminating where feasible, the disabling effects of identified discrimination. The line of school desegregation cases, commencing with Brown, attests to the importance of this state goal and the commitment of the judiciary to affirm all lawful means toward its attainment. In the school cases, the States were required by court order to redress the wrongs worked by specific instances of racial discrimination. That goal was far more focused than the remedying of the effects of \"societal discrimination,\" an amorphous concept of injury that may be ageless in its reach into the past.\n\nWe have never approved a classification that aids persons perceived as members of relatively victimized groups at the expense of other innocent individuals in the absence of judicial, legislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or statutory violations. See, e. g., Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 367-376 (1977); United Jewish Organizations, 430 U. S., at 155-156; South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308 (1966). After such findings have been made, the governmental interest in preferring members of the injured groups at the expense of others is substantial, since the legal rights of the victims must be vindicated. In such a case, the *308 extent of the injury and the consequent remedy will have been judicially, legislatively, or administrative defined. Also, the remedial action usually remains subject to continuing oversight to assure that it will work the least harm possible to other innocent persons competing for the benefit. Without such findings of constitutional or statutory violations,[44] it cannot be *309 said that the government has any greater interest in helping one individual than in refraining from harming another. Thus, the government has no compelling justification for inflicting such harm.\n\nPetitioner does not purport to have made, and is in no position to make, such findings. Its broad mission is education, not the formulation of any legislative policy or the adjudication of particular claims of illegality. For reasons similar to those stated in Part III of this opinion, isolated segments of our vast governmental structures are not competent to make those decisions, at least in the absence of legislative mandates and legislatively determined criteria.[45] Cf. Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88 (1976); n. 41, supra. Before relying upon these sorts of findings in establishing a racial classification, a governmental body must have the authority and capability to establish, in the record, that the classification is responsive to identified discrimination. See, e. g., Califano v. Webster, 430 U. S., at 316-321; Califano *310 v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S., at 212-217. Lacking this capability, petitioner has not carried its burden of justification on this issue.\n\nHence, the purpose of helping certain groups whom the faculty of the Davis Medical School perceived as victims of \"societal discrimination\" does not justify a classification that imposes disadvantages upon persons like respondent, who bear no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special admissions program are thought to have suffered. To hold otherwise would be to convert a remedy heretofore reserved for violations of legal rights into a privilege that all institutions throughout the Nation could grant at their pleasure to whatever groups are perceived as victims of societal discrimination. That is a step we have never approved. Cf. Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424 (1976).CPetitioner identifies, as another purpose of its program, improving the delivery of health-care services to communities currently underserved. It may be assumed that in some situations a State's interest in facilitating the health care of its citizens is sufficiently compelling to support the use of a suspect classification. But there is virtually no evidence in the record indicating that petitioner's special admissions program is either needed or geared to promote that goal.[46] The court below addressed this failure of proof:\"The University concedes it cannot assure that minority doctors who entered under the program, all of whom expressed an `interest' in practicing in a disadvantaged community, will actually do so. It may be correct to assume that some of them will carry out this intention, and that it is more likely they will practice in minority *311 communities than the average white doctor. (See Sandalow, Racial Preferences in Higher Education: Political Responsibility and the Judicial Role (1975) 42 U. Chi. L. Rev. 653, 688.) Nevertheless, there are more precise and reliable ways to identify applicants who are genuinely interested in the medical problems of minorities than by race. An applicant of whatever race who has demonstrated his concern for disadvantaged minorities in the past and who declares that practice in such a community is his primary professional goal would be more likely to contribute to alleviation of the medical shortage than one who is chosen entirely on the basis of race and disadvantage. In short, there is no empirical data to demonstrate that any one race is more selflessly socially oriented or by contrast that another is more selfishly acquisitive.\" 18 Cal. 3d, at 56, 553 P. 2d, at 1167.Petitioner simply has not carried its burden of demonstrating that it must prefer members of particular ethnic groups over all other individuals in order to promote better health-care delivery to deprived citizens. Indeed, petitioner has not shown that its preferential classification is likely to have any significant effect on the problem.[47]DThe fourth goal asserted by petitioner is the attainment of a diverse student body. This clearly is a constitutionally permissible *312 goal for an institution of higher education. Academic freedom, though not a specifically enumerated constitutional right, long has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment. The freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education includes the selection of its student body. Mr. Justice Frankfurter summarized the \"four essential freedoms\" that constitute academic freedom:\"`It is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conductive to speculation, experiment and creation. It is an atmosphere in which there prevail \"the four essential freedoms\" of a universityto determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study.'\" Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 263 (1957) (concurring in result).Our national commitment to the safeguarding of these freedoms within university communities was emphasized in Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U. S. 589, 603 (1967):\"Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned. That freedom is therefore a special concern of the First Amendment . . . . The Nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth `out of a multitude of tongues, [rather] than through any kind of authoritative selection.' United States v. Associated Press, 52 F. Supp. 362, 372.\"The atmosphere of \"speculation, experiment and creation\"so essential to the quality of higher educationis widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body.[48] As the Court *313 noted in Keyishian, it is not too much to say that the \"nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure\" to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.\n\nThus, in arguing that its universities must be accorded the right to select those students who will contribute the most to the \"robust exchange of ideas,\" petitioner invokes a countervailing constitutional interest, that of the First Amendment. In this light, petitioner must be viewed as seeking to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission.\n\nIt may be argued that there is greater force to these views at the undergraduate level than in a medical school where the training is centered primarily on professional competency. But even at the graduate level, our tradition and experience lend support to the view that the contribution of diversity is substantial. In Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S., at 634, the *314 Court made a similar point with specific reference to legal education:\"The law school, the proving ground for legal learning and practice, cannot be effective in isolation from the individuals and institutions with which the law interacts. Few students and no one who has practiced law would choose to study in an academic vacuum, removed from the interplay of ideas and the exchange of views with which the law is concerned.\"Physicians serve a heterogeneous population. An otherwise qualified medical student with a particular background whether it be ethnic, geographic, culturally advantaged or disadvantagedmay bring to a professional school of medicine experiences, outlooks, and ideas that enrich the training of its student body and better equip its graduates to render with understanding their vital service to humanity.[49]\n\nEthnic diversity, however, is only one element in a range of factors a university properly may consider in attaining the goal of a heterogeneous student body. Although a university must have wide discretion in making the sensitive judgments as to who should be admitted, constitutional limitations protecting individual rights may not be disregarded. Respondent urges and the courts below have heldthat petitioner's dual admissions program is a racial classification that impermissibly infringes his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. As the interest of diversity is compelling in the context of a university's admissions program, the question remains whether the *315 program's racial classification is necessary to promote this interest. In re Griffiths, 413 U. S., at 721-722.VAIt may be assumed that the reservation of a specified number of seats in each class for individuals from the preferred ethnic groups would contribute to the attainment of considerable ethnic diversity in the student body. But petitioner's argument that this is the only effective means of serving the interest of diversity is seriously flawed. In a most fundamental sense the argument misconceives the nature of the state interest that would justify consideration of race or ethnic background. It is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, with the remaining percentage an undifferentiated aggregation of students. The diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element. Petitioner's special admissions program, focused solely on ethnic diversity, would hinder rather than further attainment of genuine diversity.[50]\n\nNor would the state interest in genuine diversity be served by expanding petitioner's two-track system into a multitrack program with a prescribed number of seats set aside for each identifiable category of applicants. Indeed, it is inconceivable that a university would thus pursue the logic of petitioner's two-track program to the illogical end of insulating each category of applicants with certain desired qualifications from competition with all other applicants.\n\n*316 The experience of other university admissions programs, which take race into account in achieving the educational diversity valued by the First Amendment, demonstrates that the assignment of a fixed number of places to a minority group is not a necessary means toward that end. An illuminating example is found in the Harvard College program:\"In recent years Harvard College has expanded the concept of diversity to include students from disadvantaged economic, racial and ethnic groups. Harvard College now recruits not only Californians or Louisianans but also blacks and Chicanos and other minority students. . . .\"In practice, this new definition of diversity has meant that race has been a factor in some admission decisions. When the Committee on Admissions reviews the large middle group of applicants who are `admissible' and deemed capable of doing good work in their courses, the race of an applicant may tip the balance in his favor just as geographic origin or a life spent on a farm may tip the balance in other candidates' cases. A farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually bring something that a white person cannot offer. . . . [See Appendix hereto.]\"In Harvard College admissions the Committee has not set target-quotas for the number of blacks, or of musicians, football players, physicists or Californians to be admitted in a given year. . . . But that awareness [of the necessity of including more than a token number of black students] does not mean that the Committee sets a minimum number of blacks or of people from west of the Mississippi who are to be admitted. It means only that in choosing among thousands of applicants who are not only `admissible' academically but have other strong qualities, the Committee, with a number of criteria in mind, pays some attention to distribution among many *317 types and categories of students.\" App. to Brief for Columbia University, Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of Pennsylvania, as Amici Curiae 2-3.In such an admissions program,[51] race or ethnic background may be deemed a \"plus\" in a particular applicant's file, yet it does not insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats. The file of a particular black applicant may be examined for his potential contribution to diversity without the factor of race being decisive when compared, for example, with that of an applicant identified as an Italian-American if the latter is thought to exhibit qualities more likely to promote beneficial educational pluralism. Such qualities could include exceptional personal talents, unique work or service experience, leadership potential, maturity, demonstrated compassion, a history of overcoming disadvantage, ability to communicate with the poor, or other qualifications deemed important. In short, an admissions program operated in this way is flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight. Indeed, the weight attributed to a *318 particular quality may vary from year to year depending upon the \"mix\" both of the student body and the applicants for the incoming class.\n\nThis kind of program treats each applicant as an individual in the admissions process. The applicant who loses out on the last available seat to another candidate receiving a \"plus\" on the basis of ethnic background will not have been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat simply because he was not the right color or had the wrong surname. It would mean only that his combined qualifications, which may have included similar nonobjective factors, did not outweigh those of the other applicant. His qualifications would have been weighed fairly and competitively, and he would have no basis to complain of unequal treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment.[52]\n\nIt has been suggested that an admissions program which considers race only as one factor is simply a subtle and more sophisticatedbut no less effectivemeans of according racial preference than the Davis program. A facial intent to discriminate, however, is evident in petitioner's preference program and not denied in this case. No such facial infirmity exists in an admissions program where race or ethnic background is simply one elementto be weighed fairly against other elementsin the selection process. \"A boundary line,\" as Mr. Justice Frankfurter remarked in another connection, \"is none the worse for being narrow.\" McLeod v. Dilworth, 322 U. S. 327, 329 (1944). And a court would not assume that a university, professing to employ a facially nondiscriminatory admissions policy, would operate it as a cover for the functional equivalent of a quota system. In short, good faith *319 would be presumed in the absence of a showing to the contrary in the manner permitted by our cases. See, e. g., Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U. S. 252 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976); Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202 (1965).[53]BIn summary, it is evident that the Davis special admissions program involves the use of an explicit racial classification never before countenanced by this Court. It tells applicants who are not Negro, Asian, or Chicano that they are totally excluded from a specific percentage of the seats in an entering class. No matter how strong their qualifications, quantitative and extracurricular, including their own potential for contribution to educational diversity, they are never afforded the chance to compete with applicants from the preferred groups for the special admissions seats. At the same time, the preferred *320 applicants have the opportunity to compete for every seat in the class.\n\nThe fatal flaw in petitioner's preferential program is its disregard of individual rights as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S., at 22. Such rights are not absolute. But when a State's distribution of benefits or imposition of burdens hinges on ancestry or the color of a person's skin, that individual is entitled to a demonstration that the challenged classification is necessary to promote a substantial state interest. Petitioner has failed to carry this burden. For this reason, that portion of the California court's judgment holding petitioner's special admissions program invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment must be affirmed.CIn enjoining petitioner from ever considering the race of any applicant, however, the courts below failed to recognize that the State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin. For this reason, so much of the California court's judgment as enjoins petitioner from any consideration of the race of any applicant must be reversed.VIWith respect to respondent's entitlement to an injunction directing his admission to the Medical School, petitioner has conceded that it could not carry its burden of proving that, but for the existence of its unlawful special admissions program, respondent still would not have been admitted. Hence, respondent is entitled to the injunction, and that portion of the judgment must be affirmed.[54]APPENDIX TO OPINION OF POWELL, J.*321Harvard College Admissions Program[55]For the past 30 years Harvard College has received each year applications for admission that greatly exceed the number of places in the freshman class. The number of applicants who are deemed to be not \"qualified\" is comparatively small. The vast majority of applicants demonstrate through test scores, high school records and teachers' recommendations that they have the academic ability to do adequate work at Harvard, and perhaps to do it with distinction. Faced with the dilemma of choosing among a large number of \"qualified\" candidates, the Committee on Admissions could use the single criterion of scholarly excellence and attempt to determine who among the candidates were likely to perform best academically. But for the past 30 years the Committee on Admissions has never adopted this approach. The belief has been that if scholarly excellence were the sole or even predominant criterion, Harvard College would lose a great deal of its vitality and intellectual excellence and that the quality of the educational *322 experience offered to all students would suffer. Final Report of W. J. Bender, Chairman of the Admission and Scholarship Committee and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, pp. 20 et seq. (Cambridge, 1960). Consequently, after selecting those students whose intellectual potential will seem extraordinary to the facultyperhaps 150 or so out of an entering class of over 1,100the Committee seeksvariety in making its choices. This has seemed important. . . in part because it adds a critical ingredient to the effectiveness of the educational experience [in Harvard College]. . . . The effectiveness of our students' educational experience has seemed to the Committee to be affected as importantly by a wide variety of interests, talents, backgrounds and career goals as it is by a fine faculty and our libraries, laboratories and housing arrangements. (Dean of Admissions Fred L. Glimp, Final Report to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, 65 Official Register of Harvard University No. 25, 93, 104-105 (1968) (emphasis supplied).The belief that diversity adds an essential ingredient to the educational process has long been a tenet of Harvard College admissions. Fifteen or twenty years ago, however, diversity meant students from California, New York, and Massachusetts; city dwellers and farm boys; violinists, painters and football players; biologists, historians and classicists; potential stockbrokers, academics and politicians. The result was that very few ethnic or racial minorities attended Harvard College. In recent years Harvard College has expanded the concept of diversity to include students from disadvantaged economic, racial and ethnic groups. Harvard College now recruits not only Californians or Louisianans but also blacks and Chicanos and other minority students. Contemporary conditions in the United States mean that if Harvard College is to continue to offer a first-rate education to its students, *323 minority representation in the undergraduate body cannot be ignored by the Committee on Admissions.\n\nIn practice, this new definition of diversity has meant that race has been a factor in some admission decisions. When the Committee on Admissions reviews the large middle group of applicants who are \"admissible\" and deemed capable of doing good work in their courses, the race of an applicant may tip the balance in his favor just as geographic origin or a life spent on a farm may tip the balance in other candidates' cases. A farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually bring something that a white person cannot offer. The quality of the educational experience of all the students in Harvard College depends in part on these differences in the background and outlook that students bring with them.\n\nIn Harvard College admissions the Committee has not set target-quotas for the number of blacks, or of musicians, football players, physicists or Californians to be admitted in a given year. At the same time the Committee is aware that if Harvard College is to provide a truly heterogen[e]ous environment that reflects the rich diversity of the United States, it cannot be provided without some attention to numbers. It would not make sense, for example, to have 10 or 20 students out of 1,100 whose homes are west of the Mississippi. Comparably, 10 or 20 black students could not begin to bring to their classmates and to each other the variety of points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the United States. Their small numbers might also create a sense of isolation among the black students themselves and thus make it more difficult for them to develop and achieve their potential. Consequently, when making its decisions, the Committee on Admissions is aware that there is some relationship between numbers and achieving the benefits to be derived from a diverse student body, and between numbers and providing a reasonable environment for those students admitted. But *324 that awareness does not mean that the Committee sets a minimum number of blacks or of people from west of the Mississippi who are to be admitted. It means only that in choosing among thousands of applicants who are not only \"admissible\" academically but have other strong qualities, the Committee, with a number of criteria in mind, pays some attention to distribution among many types and categories of students.\n\nThe further refinements sometimes required help to illustrate the kind of significance attached to race. The Admissions Committee, with only a few places left to fill, might find itself forced to choose between A, the child of a successful black physician in an academic community with promise of superior academic performance, and B, a black who grew up in an inner-city ghetto of semi-literate parents whose academic achievement was lower but who had demonstrated energy and leadership as well as an apparently-abiding interest in black power. If a good number of black students much like A but few like B had already been admitted, the Committee might prefer B; and vice versa. If C, a white student with extraordinary artistic talent, were also seeking one of the remaining places, his unique quality might give him an edge over both A and B. Thus, the critical criteria are often individual qualities or experience not dependent upon race but sometimes associated with it.Opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.The Court today, in reversing in part the judgment of the Supreme Court of California, affirms the constitutional power of Federal and State Governments to act affirmatively to achieve equal opportunity for all. The difficulty of the issue presentedwhether government may use race-conscious programs to redress the continuing effects of past discrimination *325 and the mature consideration which each of our Brethren has brought to it have resulted in many opinions, no single one speaking for the Court. But this should not and must not mask the central meaning of today's opinions: Government may take race into account when it acts not to demean or insult any racial group, but to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice, at least when appropriate findings have been made by judicial, legislative, or administrative bodies with competence to act in this area.\n\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and our Brothers STEWART, REHNQUIST, and STEVENS, have concluded that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, as amended, 42 U. S. C.  2000d et seq., prohibits programs such as that at the Davis Medical School. On this statutory theory alone, they would hold that respondent Allan Bakke's rights have been violated and that he must, therefore, be admitted to the Medical School. Our Brother POWELL, reaching the Constitution, concludes that, although race may be taken into account in university admissions, the particular special admissions program used by petitioner, which resulted in the exclusion of respondent Bakke, was not shown to be necessary to achieve petitioner's stated goals. Accordingly, these Members of the Court form a majority of five affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of California insofar as it holds that respondent Bakke \"is entitled to an order that he be admitted to the University.\" 18 Cal. 3d 34, 64, 553 P. 2d 1152, 1172 (1976).\n\nWe agree with MR. JUSTICE POWELL that, as applied to the case before us, Title VI goes no further in prohibiting the use of race than the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment itself. We also agree that the effect of the California Supreme Court's affirmance of the judgment of the Superior Court of California would be to prohibit the University from establishing in the future affirmative-action programs that take race into account. See ante, at 271 n. Since we conclude that the affirmative admissions program at the Davis *326 Medical School is constitutional, we would reverse the judgment below in all respects. MR. JUSTICE POWELL agrees that some uses of race in university admissions are permissible and, therefore, he joins with us to make five votes reversing the judgment below insofar as it prohibits the University from establishing race-conscious programs in the future.[1]IOur Nation was founded on the principle that \"all Men are created equal.\" Yet candor requires acknowledgment that the Framers of our Constitution, to forge the 13 Colonies into one Nation, openly compromised this principle of equality with its antithesis: slavery. The consequences of this compromise are well known and have aptly been called our promise are well known and have aptly been called our \"American Dilemma.\" Still, it is well to recount how recent the time has been, if it has yet come, when the promise of our principles has flowered into the actuality of equal opportunity for all regardless of race or color.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment, the embodiment in the Constitution of our abiding belief in human equality, has been the law of our land for only slightly more than half its 200 years. And for half of that half, the Equal Protection Clause of the Amendment was largely moribund so that, as late as 1927, Mr. Justice Holmes could sum up the importance of that Clause by remarking that it was the \"last resort of constitutional arguments.\" Buck v. Bell, 274 U. S. 200, 208 (1927). Worse than desuetude, the Clause was early turned against those whom it was intended to set free, condemning them to a \"separate but equal\"[2] status before the law, a status *327 always separate but seldom equal. Not until 1954only 24 years agowas this odious doctrine interred by our decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (Brown I), and its progeny,[3] which proclaimed that separate schools and public facilities of all sorts were inherently unequal and forbidden under our Constitution. Even then inequality was not eliminated with \"all deliberate speed.\" Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 301 (1955). In 1968[4] and again in 1971,[5] for example, we were forced to remind school boards of their obligation to eliminate racial discrimination root and branch. And a glance at our docket[6] and at dockets of lower courts will show that even today officially sanctioned discrimination is not a thing of the past.\n\nAgainst this background, claims that law must be \"color-blind\" or that the datum of race is no longer relevant to public policy must be seen as aspiration rather than as description of reality. This is not to denigrate aspiration; for reality rebukes us that race has too often been used by those who would stigmatize and oppress minorities. Yet we cannotand, as we shall demonstrate, need not under our Constitution or Title VI, which merely extends the constraints of the Fourteenth Amendment to private parties who receive federal fundslet color blindness become myopia which masks the reality that many \"created equal\" have been treated within our lifetimes as inferior both by the law and by their fellow citizens. II*328\nThe threshold question we must decide is whether Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars recipients of federal funds from giving preferential consideration to disadvantaged members of racial minorities as part of a program designed to enable such individuals to surmount the obstacles imposed by racial discrimination.[7] We join Parts I and V-C of our Brother POWELL'S opinion and three of us agree with his conclusion in Part II that this case does not require us to resolve the question whether there is a private right of action under Title VI.[8]\n\nIn our view, Title VI prohibits only those uses of racial criteria that would violate the Fourteenth Amendment if employed by a State or its agencies; it does not bar the preferential treatment of racial minorities as a means of remedying past societal discrimination to the extent that such action is consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. The legislative history of Title VI, administrative regulations interpreting the statute, subsequent congressional and executive action, and the prior decisions of this Court compel this conclusion. None of these sources lends support to the proposition that Congress intended to bar all race-conscious efforts to extend the benefits of federally financed programs to minorities who have been historically excluded from the full benefits of American life.AThe history of Title VIfrom President Kennedy's request that Congress grant executive departments and agencies authority *329 to cut off federal funds to programs that discriminate against Negroes through final enactment of legislation incorporating his proposalsreveals one fixed purpose: to give the Executive Branch of Government clear authority to terminate federal funding of private programs that use race as a means of disadvantaging minorities in a manner that would be prohibited by the Constitution if engaged in by government.\n\nThis purpose was first expressed in President Kennedy's June 19, 1963, message to Congress proposing the legislation that subsequently became the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[9]*330 Representative Celler, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and the floor manager of the legislation in the House, introduced Title VI in words unequivocally expressing the intent to provide the Federal Government with the means of assuring that its funds were not used to subsidize racial discrimination inconsistent with the standards imposed by the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments upon state and federal action.\"The bill would offer assurance that hospitals financed by Federal money would not deny adequate care to Negroes. It would prevent abuse of food distribution programs whereby Negroes have been known to be denied food surplus supplies when white persons were given such food. It would assure Negroes the benefits now accorded only white students in programs of high[er] education financed by Federal funds. It would, in short, assure the existing right to equal treatment in the enjoyment of Federal funds. It would not destroy any rights of private property or freedom of association.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 1519 (1964).It was clear to Representative Celler that Title VI, apart from the fact that it reached all federally funded activities even in the absence of sufficient state or federal control to invoke the Fourteenth or Fifth Amendments, was not placing new substantive limitations upon the use of racial criteria, but rather was designed to extend to such activities \"the existing right to equal treatment\" enjoyed by Negroes under those Amendments, and he later specifically defined the purpose of Title VI in this way:\"In general, it seems rather anomalous that the Federal Government should aid and abet discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin by granting money *331 and other kinds of financial aid. It seems rather shocking, moreover, that while we have on the one hand the 14th amendment, which is supposed to do away with discrimination since it provides for equal protection of the laws, on the other hand, we have the Federal Government aiding and abetting those who persist in practicing racial discrimination.\"It is for these reasons that we bring forth title VI. The enactment of title VI will serve to override specific provisions of law which contemplate Federal assistance to racially segregated institutions.\" Id., at 2467.Representative Celler also filed a memorandum setting forth the legal basis for the enactment of Title VI which reiterated the theme of his oral remarks: \"In exercising its authority to fix the terms on which Federal funds will be disbursed . . . , Congress clearly has power to legislate so as to insure that the Federal Government does not become involved in a violation of the Constitution.\" Id., at 1528.\n\nOther sponsors of the legislation agreed with Representative Celler that the function of Title VI was to end the Federal Government's complicity in conduct, particularly the segregation or exclusion of Negroes, inconsistent with the standards to be found in the antidiscrimination provisions of the Constitution. Representative Lindsay, also a member of the Judiciary Committee, candidly acknowledged, in the course of explaining why Title VI was necessary, that it did not create any new standard of equal treatment beyond that contained in the Constitution:\"Both the Federal Government and the States are under constitutional mandates not to discriminate. Many have raised the question as to whether legislation is required at all. Does not the Executive already have the power in the distribution of Federal funds to apply those conditions which will enable the Federal Government itself to live up to the mandate of the Constitution and to require *332 States and local government entities to live up to the Constitution, most especially the 5th and 14th amendments?\" Id., at 2467.He then explained that legislation was needed to authorize the termination of funding by the Executive Branch because existing legislation seemed to contemplate the expenditure of funds to support racially segregated institutions. Ibid. The views of Representatives Celler and Lindsay concerning the purpose and function of Title VI were shared by other sponsors and proponents of the legislation in the House.[10] Nowhere is there any suggestion that Title VI was intended to terminate federal funding for any reason other than consideration of race or national origin by the recipient institution in a manner inconsistent with the standards incorporated in the Constitution.\n\nThe Senate's consideration of Title VI reveals an identical understanding concerning the purpose and scope of the legislation. Senator Humphrey, the Senate floor manager, opened the Senate debate with a section-by-section analysis of the Civil Rights Act in which he succinctly stated the purpose of Title VI:\"The purpose of title VI is to make sure that funds of the United States are not used to support racial discrimination. In many instances the practices of segregation or discrimination, which title VI seeks to end, are unconstitutional. This is clearly so wherever Federal funds go to a State agency which engages in racial discrimination. It may also be so where Federal funds go to support private, segregated institutions, under the decision in Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, 323 F. 2d 959 (C. A. 4, 1963), [cert. denied, 376 U. S. 938 (1964)]. In all cases, such discrimination is contrary to national policy, and to the moral sense of the Nation. Thus, title VI is simply *333 designed to insure that Federal funds are spent in accordance with the Constitution and the moral sense of the Nation.\" Id., at 6544.Senator Humphrey, in words echoing statements in the House, explained that legislation was needed to accomplish this objective because it was necessary to eliminate uncertainty concerning the power of federal agencies to terminate financial assistance to programs engaging in racial discrimination in the face of various federal statutes which appeared to authorize grants to racially segregated institutions. Ibid. Although Senator Humphrey realized that Title VI reached conduct which, because of insufficient governmental action, might be beyond the reach of the Constitution, it was clear to him that the substantive standard imposed by the statute was that of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nSenate supporters of Title VI repeatedly expressed agreement with Senator Humphrey's description of the legislation as providing the explicit authority and obligation to apply the standards of the Constitution to all recipients of federal funds. Senator Ribicoff described the limited function of Title VI:\"Basically, there is a constitutional restriction against discrimination in the use of Federal funds; and title VI simply spells out the procedure to be used in enforcing that restriction.\" Id., at 13333.Other strong proponents of the legislation in the Senate repeatedly expressed their intent to assure that federal funds would only be spent in accordance with constitutional standards. See remarks of Senator Pastore, id., at 7057, 7062; Senator Clark, id., at 5243; Senator Allott, id., at 12675, 12677.[11]*334 Respondent's contention that Congress intended Title VI to bar affirmative-action programs designed to enable minorities disadvantaged by the effects of discrimination to participate in federally financed programs is also refuted by an examination of the type of conduct which Congress thought it was prohibiting by means of Title VI. The debates reveal that the legislation was motivated primarily by a desire to eradicate a very specific evil: federal financial support of programs which disadvantaged Negroes by excluding them from participation or providing them with separate facilities. Again and again supporters of Title VI emphasized that the purpose of the statute was to end segregation in federally funded activities and to end other discriminatory uses of race disadvantaging Negroes. Senator Humphrey set the theme in his speech presenting Title VI to the Senate:\"Large sums of money are contributed by the United States each year for the construction, operation, and maintenance of segregated schools......\"Similarly, under the Hill-Burton Act, Federal grants are made to hospitals which admit whites only or Negroes only. . . .\"In higher education also, a substantial part of the Federal grants to colleges, medical schools and so forth, in the South is still going to segregated institutions.*335 \"Nor is this all. In several States, agricultural extension services, supported by Federal funds, maintain racially segregated offices for Negroes and whites. . . .\" . . . Vocational training courses, supported with Federal funds, are given in segregated schools and institutions and often limit Negroes to training in less skilled occupations. In particular localities it is reported that Negroes have been cut off from relief rolls, or denied surplus agricultural commodities, or otherwise deprived of the benefit of federally assisted programs, in retaliation for their participation in voter registration drives, sit-in demonstrations and the like.\" Id., at 6543-6544.See also the remarks of Senator Pastore (id., at 7054-7055); Senator Ribicoff (id., at 7064-7065); Senator Clark (id., at 5243, 9086); Senator Javits (id., at 6050, 7102).[12]\n\nThe conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing is clear. Congress recognized that Negroes, in some cases with congressional acquiescence, were being discriminated against in the administration of programs and denied the full benefits of activities receiving federal financial support. It was aware that there were many federally funded programs and institutions which discriminated against minorities in a manner inconsistent with the standards of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments but whose activities might not involve sufficient state or federal action so as to be in violation of these Amendments. Moreover, Congress believed that it was questionable whether the Executive Branch possessed legal authority to terminate the funding of activities on the ground that they discriminated racially against Negroes in a manner violative of the standards contained in the Fourteenth and Fifth *336 Amendments. Congress' solution was to end the Government's complicity in constitutionally forbidden racial discrimination by providing the Executive Branch with the authority and the obligation to terminate its financial support of any activity which employed racial criteria in a manner condemned by the Constitution.\n\nOf course, it might be argued that the Congress which enacted Title VI understood the Constitution to require strict racial neutrality or color blindness, and then enshrined that concept as a rule of statutory law. Later interpretation and clarification of the Constitution to permit remedial use of race would then not dislodge Title VI's prohibition of race-conscious action. But there are three compelling reasons to reject such a hypothesis.\n\nFirst, no decision of this Court has ever adopted the proposition that the Constitution must be colorblind. See infra, at 355-356.\n\nSecond, even if it could be argued in 1964 that the Constitution might conceivably require color blindness, Congress surely would not have chosen to codify such a view unless the Constitution clearly required it. The legislative history of Title VI, as well as the statute itself, reveals a desire to induce voluntary compliance with the requirement of nondiscriminatory treatment.[13] See  602 of the Act, 42 U. S. C.  2000d-1 (no funds shall be terminated unless and until it has been \"determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means\"); H. R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 25 (1963); 110 Cong Rec. 13700 (1964) (Sen. Pastore); id., at 6546 (Sen. Humphrey). It is inconceivable that Congress intended to encourage voluntary efforts to eliminate the evil of racial discrimination while at the same time forbidding the voluntary use of race-conscious remedies to cure acknowledged or obvious statutory violations. Yet a reading of Title VI as prohibiting all action predicated upon race which adversely *337 affects any individual would require recipients guilty of discrimination to await the imposition of such remedies by the Executive Branch. Indeed, such an interpretation of Title VI would prevent recipients of federal funds from taking race into account even when necessary to bring their programs into compliance with federal constitutional requirements. This would be a remarkable reading of a statute designed to eliminate constitutional violations, especially in light of judicial decisions holding that under certain circumstances the remedial use of racial criteria is not only permissible but is constitutionally required to eradicate constitutional violations. For example, in Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U. S. 43 (1971), the Court held that a statute forbidding the assignment of students on the basis of race was unconstitutional because it would hinder the implementation of remedies necessary to accomplish the desegregation of a school system: \"Just as the race of students must be considered in determining whether a constitutional violation has occurred, so also must race be considered in formulating a remedy.\" Id., at 46. Surely Congress did not intend to prohibit the use of racial criteria when constitutionally required or to terminate the funding of any entity which implemented such a remedy. It clearly desired to encourage all remedies, including the use of race, necessary to eliminate racial discrimination in violation of the Constitution rather than requiring the recipient to await a judicial adjudication of unconstitutionality and the judicial imposition of a racially oriented remedy.\n\nThird, the legislative history shows that Congress specifically eschewed any static definition of discrimination in favor of broad language that could be shaped by experience, administrative necessity, and evolving judicial doctrine. Although it is clear from the debates that the supporters of Title VI intended to ban uses of race prohibited by the Constitution and, more specifically, the maintenance of segregated *338 facilities, they never precisely defined the term \"discrimination,\" or what constituted an exclusion from participation or a denial of benefits on the ground of race. This failure was not lost upon its opponents. Senator Ervin complained:\"The word `discrimination,' as used in this reference, has no contextual explanation whatever, other than the provision that the discrimination `is to be against' individuals participating in or benefiting from federally assisted programs and activities on the ground specified. With this context, the discrimination condemned by this reference occurs only when an individual is treated unequally or unfairly because of his race, color, religion, or national origin. What constitutes unequal or unfair treatment? Section 601 and section 602 of title VI do not say. They leave the determination of that question to the executive department or agencies administering each program, without any guideline whatever to point out what is the congressional intent.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 5612 (1964).See also remarks of Representative Abernethy (id., at 1619); Representative Dowdy (id., at 1632); Senator Talmadge (id., at 5251); Senator Sparkman (id., at 6052). Despite these criticisms, the legislation's supporters refused to include in the statute or even provide in debate a more explicit definition of what Title VI prohibited.\n\nThe explanation for this failure is clear. Specific definitions were undesirable, in the views of the legislation's principal backers, because Title VI's standard was that of the Constitution and one that could and should be administratively and judicially applied. See remarks of Senator Humphrey (id., at 5253, 6553); Senator Ribicoff (id., at 7057, 13333); Senator Pastore (id., at 7057); Senator Javits (id., at 5606-5607, 6050).[14] Indeed, there was a strong emphasis throughout *339 Congress' consideration of Title VI on providing the Executive Branch with considerable flexibility in interpreting and applying the prohibition against racial discrimination. Attorney General Robert Kennedy testified that regulations had not been written into the legislation itself because the rules and regulations defining discrimination might differ from one program to another so that the term would assume different meanings in different contexts.[15] This determination to preserve flexibility in the administration of Title VI was shared by the legislation's supporters. When Senator Johnston offered an amendment that would have expressly authorized federal grantees to take race into account in placing children in adoptive and foster homes, Senator Pastore opposed the amendment, which was ultimately defeated by a 56-29 vote, on the ground that federal administrators could be trusted to act reasonably and that there was no danger that they would prohibit the use of racial criteria under such circumstances. Id., at 13695.\n\nCongress' resolve not to incorporate a static definition of discrimination into Title VI is not surprising. In 1963 and 1964, when Title VI was drafted and debated, the courts had only recently applied the Equal Protection Clause to strike down public racial discrimination in America, and the scope of that Clause's nondiscrimination principle was in a state of flux and rapid evolution. Many questions, such as whether the Fourteenth Amendment barred only de jure discrimination or in at least some circumstances reached de facto discrimination, had not yet received an authoritative judicial resolution. The congressional debate reflects an awareness of the evolutionary *340 change that constitutional law in the area of racial discrimination was undergoing in 1964.[16]\n\nIn sum, Congress' equating of Title VI's prohibition with the commands of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, its refusal precisely to define that racial discrimination which it intended to prohibit, and its expectation that the statute would be administered in a flexible manner, compel the conclusion that Congress intended the meaning of the statute's prohibition to evolve with the interpretation of the commands of the Constitution. Thus, any claim that the use of racial criteria is barred by the plain language of the statute must fail in light of the remedial purpose of Title VI and its legislative history. The cryptic nature of the language employed in Title VI merely reflects Congress' concern with the then-prevalent use of racial standards as a means of excluding or disadvantaging Negroes and its determination to prohibit absolutely such discrimination. We have recently held that \"`[w]hen aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no \"rule of law\" which forbids its use, however clear the words may appear on \"superficial examination.\"'\" Train v. Colorado Public Interest Research Group, 426 U. S. 1, 10 (1976), quoting United States v. American Trucking Assns., 310 U. S. 534, 543-544 (1940). This is especially so when, as is the case here, the literal application of what is believed to be the plain language of the statute, assuming that it is so plain, would lead to results in direct conflict with Congress' unequivocally expressed legislative purpose.[17]B*341\nSection 602 of Title VI, 42 U. S. C.  2000d-1, instructs federal agencies to promulgate regulations interpreting Title *342 VI. These regulations, which, under the terms of the statute, require Presidential approval, are entitled to considerable deference in construing Title VI. See, e. g., Lau v. Nichols, *343 414 U. S. 563 (1974); Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U. S. 356, 369 (1973); Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 381 (1969). Consequently, it is most significant that the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), which provides much of the federal assistance to institutions of higher education, has adopted regulations requiring affirmative measures designed to enable racial minorities which have been previously discriminated against by a federally funded institution or program to overcome the effects of such actions and authorizing the voluntary undertaking of affirmative-action programs by federally funded institutions that have not been guilty of prior discrimination in order to overcome the effects of conditions which have adversely affected the degree of participation by persons of a particular race.\n\nTitle 45 CFR  80.3 (b) (6) (i) (1977) provides:\"In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.\"Title 45 CFR  80.5 (i) (1977) elaborates upon this requirement:\"In some situations, even though past discriminatory practices attributable to a recipient or applicant have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under  80.6 (d), to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity and the rights of beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary under the requirement stated in (i) of  80.3 (b) (6) for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits *344 fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subject to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.\"These regulations clearly establish that where there is a need to overcome the effects of past racially discriminatory or exclusionary practices engaged in by a federally funded institution, race-conscious action is not only permitted but required to accomplish the remedial objectives of Title VI.[18] Of course, there is no evidence that the Medical School has been guilty of past discrimination and consequently these regulations would not compel it to employ a program of preferential admissions in behalf of racial minorities. It would be difficult to explain from the language of Title VI, however, much less from its legislative history, why the statute compels race-conscious remedies where a recipient institution has engaged in past discrimination but prohibits such remedial action where racial minorities, as a result of the effects of past discrimination imposed by entities other than the recipient, are excluded from the benefits of federally funded programs. HEW was fully aware of the incongruous nature of such an interpretation of Title VI.\n\nTitle 45 CFR  80.3 (b) (6) (ii) (1977) provides:\"Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted *345 in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin.\"An explanatory regulation explicitly states that the affirmative action which  80.3 (b) (6) (ii) contemplates includes the use of racial preferences:\"Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances, an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.\" 45 CFR  80.5 (j) (1977).This interpretation of Title VI is fully consistent with the statute's emphasis upon voluntary remedial action and reflects the views of an agency[19] responsible for achieving its objectives.[20]*346 The Court has recognized that the construction of a statute by those charged with its execution is particularly deserving of respect where Congress has directed its attention to the administrative construction and left it unaltered. Cf. Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S., at 381; Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1965). Congress recently took just this kind of action when it considered an amendment to the Departments of Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare appropriation bill for 1978, which would have restricted significantly the remedial use of race in programs funded by the appropriation. The amendment, as originally submitted by Representative Ashbrook, provided that \"[n]one of the funds appropriated in this Act may be used to initiate, carry out or enforce any program of affirmative action or any other system of quotas or goals in regard to admission policies or employment practices which encourage or require any discrimination on the basis of race, creed, religion, sex or age.\" 123 Cong. *347 Rec. 19715 (1977). In support of the measure, Representative Ashbrook argued that the 1964 Civil Rights Act never authorized the imposition of affirmative action and that this was a creation of the bureaucracy. Id., at 19722. He explicitly stated, however, that he favored permitting universities to adopt affirmative-action programs giving consideration to racial identity but opposed the imposition of such programs by the Government. Id., at 19715. His amendment was itself amended to reflect this position by only barring the imposition of race-conscious remedies by HEW:\"None of the funds appropriated in this Act may be obligated or expended in connection with the issuance, implementation, or enforcement of any rule, regulation, standard, guideline, recommendation, or order issued by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare which for purposes of compliance with any ratio, quota, or other numerical requirement related to race, creed, color, national origin, or sex requires any individual or entity to take any action with respect to (1) the hiring or promotion policies or practices of such individual or entity, or (2) the admissions policies or practices of such individual or entity.\" Id., at 19722.This amendment was adopted by the House. Ibid. The Senate bill, however, contained no such restriction upon HEW's authority to impose race-conscious remedies and the Conference Committee, upon the urging of the Secretary of HEW, deleted the House provision from the bill.[21] More significant for present purposes, however, is the fact that even the proponents of imposing limitations upon HEW's implementation of Title VI did not challenge the right of federally funded educational institutions voluntarily to extend preferences to racial minorities.\n\n*348 Finally, congressional action subsequent to the passage of Title VI eliminates any possible doubt about Congress' views concerning the permissibility of racial preferences for the purpose of assisting disadvantaged racial minorities. It confirms that Congress did not intend to prohibit and does not now believe that Title VI prohibits the consideration of race as part of a remedy for societal discrimination even where there is no showing that the institution extending the preference has been guilty of past discrimination nor any judicial finding that the particular beneficiaries of the racial preference have been adversely affected by societal discrimination.\n\nJust last year Congress enacted legislation[22] explicitly requiring that no grants shall be made \"for any local public works project unless the applicant gives satisfactory assurance to the Secretary [of Commerce] that at least 10 per centum of the amount of each grant shall be expended for minority business enterprises.\" The statute defines the term \"minority business enterprise\" as \"a business, at least 50 per centum of which is owned by minority group members or, in case of a publicly owned business, at least 51 per centum of the stock of which is owned by minority group members.\" The term \"minority group members\" is defined in explicitly racial terms: \"citizens of the United States who are Negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts.\" Although the statute contains an exemption from this requirement \"to the extent that the Secretary determines otherwise,\" this escape clause was provided only to deal with the possibility that certain areas of the country might not contain sufficient qualified \"minority business enterprises\" to permit compliance with the quota provisions of the legislation.[23]\n\nThe legislative history of this race-conscious legislation reveals that it represents a deliberate attempt to deal with *349 the excessive rate of unemployment among minority citizens and to encourage the development of viable minority controlled enterprises.[24] It was believed that such a \"set-aside\" was required in order to enable minorities, still \"new on the scene\" and \"relatively small,\" to compete with larger and more established companies which would always be successful in underbidding minority enterprises. 123 Cong. Rec. 5327 (1977) (Rep. Mitchell). What is most significant about the congressional consideration of the measure is that although the use of a racial quota or \"set-aside\" by a recipient of federal funds would constitute a direct violation of Title VI if that statute were read to prohibit race-conscious action, no mention was made during the debates in either the House or the Senate of even the possibility that the quota provisions for minority contractors might in any way conflict with or modify Title VI. It is inconceivable that such a purported conflict would have escaped congressional attention through an inadvertent failure to recognize the relevance of Title VI. Indeed, the Act of which this affirmative-action provision is a part also contains a provision barring discrimination on the basis of sex which states that this prohibition \"will be enforced through agency provisions and rules similar to those already established, with respect to racial and other discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" 42 U. S. C.  6709 (1976 ed.). Thus Congress was fully aware of the applicability of Title VI to the funding of public works projects. Under these circumstances, the enactment of the 10% \"set-aside\" for minority enterprises reflects a congressional judgment that the remedial use of race is permissible under Title VI. We have repeatedly recognized that subsequent legislation reflecting an interpretation of an earlier Act is entitled to great weight in determining the meaning of the earlier statute. Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S., at 380-381; *350 Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U. S. 239, 243-244 (1972). See also United States v. Stewart, 311 U. S. 60, 64-65 (1940).[25]CPrior decisions of this Court also strongly suggest that Title VI does not prohibit the remedial use of race where such action is constitutionally permissible. In Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563 (1974), the Court held that the failure of the San *351 Francisco school system to provide English-language instruction to students of Chinese ancestry who do not speak English, or to provide them with instruction in Chinese, constituted a violation of Title VI. The Court relied upon an HEW regulation which stipulates that a recipient of federal funds \"may not . . . utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination\" or have \"the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.\" 45 CFR  80.3 (b) (2) (1977). It interpreted this regulation as requiring San Francisco to extend the same educational benefits to Chinese-speaking students as to English-speaking students, even though there was no finding or allegation that the city's failure to do so was a result of a purposeful design to discriminate on the basis of race.\n\nLau is significant in two related respects. First, it indicates that in at least some circumstances agencies responsible for the administration of Title VI may require recipients who have not been guilty of any constitutional violations to depart from a policy of color blindness and to be cognizant of the impact of their actions upon racial minorities. Secondly, Lau clearly requires that institutions receiving federal funds be accorded considerable latitude in voluntarily undertaking race-conscious action designed to remedy the exclusion of significant numbers *352 of minorities from the benefits of federally funded programs. Although this Court has not yet considered the question, presumably, by analogy to our decisions construing Title VII, a medical school would not be in violation of Title VI under Lau because of the serious under representation of racial minorities in its student body as long as it could demonstrate that its entrance requirements correlated sufficiently with the performance of minority students in medical school and the medical profession.[26] It would be inconsistent with Lau and the emphasis of Title VI and the HEW regulations on voluntary action, however, to require that an institution wait to be adjudicated to be in violation of the law before being permitted to voluntarily undertake corrective action based upon a good-faith and reasonable belief that the failure of certain racial minorities to satisfy entrance requirements is not a measure of their ultimate performance as doctors but a result of the lingering effects of past societal discrimination.\n\nWe recognize that Lau, especially when read in light of our subsequent decision in Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976), which rejected the general proposition that governmental action is unconstitutional solely because it has a racially disproportionate impact, may be read as being predicated upon the view that, at least under some circumstances, Title VI proscribes conduct which might not be prohibited by the Constitution. Since we are now of the opinion, for the reasons set forth above, that Title VI's standard, applicable alike to public and private recipients of federal funds, is no broader than the Constitution's, we have serious doubts concerning the correctness of what appears to be the premise of that decision. However, even accepting Lau's implication that impact alone is in some contexts sufficient to establish a prima facie violation of Title VI, contrary to our view that Title VI's definition of racial discrimination is absolutely coextensive with the Constitution's, this would not assist the respondent *353 in the least. First, for the reasons discussed supra, at 336-350, regardless of whether Title VI's prohibitions extend beyond the Constitution's the evidence fails to establish, and, indeed, compels the rejection of, the proposition that Congress intended to prohibit recipients of federal funds from voluntarily employing race-conscious measures to eliminate the effects of past societal discrimination against racial minorities such as Negroes. Secondly, Lau itself, for the reasons set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, strongly supports the view that voluntary race-conscious remedial action is permissible under Title VI. If discriminatory racial impact alone is enough to demonstrate at least a prima facie Title VI violation, it is difficult to believe that the Title would forbid the Medical School from attempting to correct the racially exclusionary effects of its initial admissions policy during the first two years of the School's operation.\n\nThe Court has also declined to adopt a \"colorblind\" interpretation of other statutes containing nondiscrimination provisions similar to that contained in Title VI. We have held under Title VII that where employment requirements have a disproportionate impact upon racial minorities they constitute a statutory violation, even in the absence of discriminatory intent, unless the employer is able to demonstrate that the requirements are sufficiently related to the needs of the job.[27] More significantly, the Court has required that preferences be given by employers to members of racial minorities as a remedy for past violations of Title VII, even where there has been no finding that the employer has acted with a discriminatory intent.[28] Finally, we have construed the Voting *354 Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C.  1973 et seq. (1970 ed. and Supp. V), which contains a provision barring any voting procedure or qualification that denies or abridges \"the right of *355 any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color,\" as permitting States to voluntarily take race into account in a way that fairly represents the voting strengths of different racial groups in order to comply with the commands of the statute, even where the result is a gain for one racial group at the expense of others.[29]\n\nThese prior decisions are indicative of the Court's unwillingness to construe remedial statutes designed to eliminate discrimination against racial minorities in a manner which would impede efforts to attain this objective. There is no justification for departing from this course in the case of Title VI and frustrating the clear judgment of Congress that race-conscious remedial action is permissible.\n\nWe turn, therefore, to our analysis of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.IIIAThe assertion of human equality is closely associated with the proposition that differences in color or creed, birth or status, are neither significant nor relevant to the way in which persons should be treated. Nonetheless, the position that such factors must be \"constitutionally an irrelevance,\" Edwards v. California, 314 U. S. 160, 185 (1941) (Jackson, J., concurring), summed up by the shorthand phrase \"[o]ur Constitution is color-blind,\" Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting), has never been adopted by this Court as the proper meaning of the Equal Protection Clause. Indeed, *356 we have expressly rejected this proposition on a number of occasions.\n\nOur cases have always implied that an \"overriding statutory purpose,\" McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184, 192 (1964), could be found that would justify racial classifications. See, e. g., ibid.; Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 11 (1967); Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214, 216 (1944); Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 100-101 (1943). More recently, in McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U. S. 39 (1971), this Court unanimously reversed the Georgia Supreme Court which had held that a desegregation plan voluntarily adopted by a local school board, which assigned students on the basis of race, was per se invalid because it was not colorblind. And in North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann we held, again unanimously, that a statute mandating colorblind school-assignment plans could not stand \"against the background of segregation,\" since such a limit on remedies would \"render illusory the promise of Brown [I].\" 402 U. S., at 45-46.\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that racial classifications are not per se invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, we turn to the problem of articulating what our role should be in reviewing state action that expressly classifies by race.BRespondent argues that racial classifications are always suspect and, consequently, that this Court should weigh the importance of the objectives served by Davis' special admissions program to see if they are compelling. In addition, he asserts that this Court must inquire whether, in its judgment, there are alternatives to racial classifications which would suit Davis' purposes. Petitioner, on the other hand, states that our proper role is simply to accept petitioner's determination that the racial classifications used by its program are reasonably related to what it tells us are its benign *357 purposes. We reject petitioner's view, but, because our prior cases are in many respects in apposite to that before us now, we find it necessary to define with precision the meaning of that inexact term, \"strict scrutiny.\"\n\nUnquestionably we have held that a government practice or statute which restricts \"fundamental rights\" or which contains \"suspect classifications\" is to be subjected to \"strict scrutiny\" and can be justified only if it furthers a compelling government purpose and, even then, only if no less restrictive alternative is available.[30] See, e. g., San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 16-17 (1973); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330 (1972). But no fundamental right is involved here. See San Antonio, supra, at 29-36. Nor do whites as a class have any of the \"traditional indicia of suspectness: the class is not saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.\" Id., at 28; see United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152 n. 4 (1938).[31]\n\nMoreover, if the University's representations are credited, this is not a case where racial classifications are \"irrelevant and therefore prohibited.\" Hirabayashi, supra, at 100. Nor has anyone suggested that the University's purposes contravene the cardinal principle that racial classifications that stigmatize because they are drawn on the presumption that one race is inferior to another or because they put the weight of government *358 behind racial hatred and separatismare invalid without more. See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 374 (1886);[32] accord, Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 308 (1880); Korematsu v. United States, supra, at 223; Oyama v. California, 332 U. S. 633, 663 (1948) (Murphy, J., concurring); Brown I, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); McLaughlin v. Florida, supra, at 191-192; Loving v. Virginia, supra, at 11-12; Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U. S. 369, 375-376 (1967); United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144, 165 (1977) (UJO) (opinion of WHITE, J., joined by REHNQUIST and STEVENS, JJ.); id., at 169 (opinion concurring in part).[33]\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that this case does not fit neatly into our prior analytic framework for race cases does not mean that it should be analyzed by applying the very loose rational-basis standard of review that is the very least that is always applied in equal protection cases.[34] \"`[T]he mere recitation of a benign, compensatory purpose is not an automatic shield *359 which protects against any inquiry into the actual purposes underlying a statutory scheme.'\" Califano v. Webster, 430 U. S. 313, 317 (1977), quoting Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 648 (1975). Instead, a number of considerations developed in gender-discrimination cases but which carry even more force when applied to racial classificationslead us to conclude that racial classifications designed to further remedial purposes \"`must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.'\" Califano v. Webster, supra, at 317, quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197 (1976).[35]*360 First, race, like, \"gender-based classifications too often [has] been inexcusably utilized to stereotype and stigmatize politically powerless segments of society.\" Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351, 357 (1974) (dissenting opinion). While a carefully tailored statute designed to remedy past discrimination could avoid these vices, see Califano v. Webster, supra; Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498 (1975); Kahn v. Shevin, supra, we nonetheless have recognized that the line between honest and thoughtful appraisal of the effects of past discrimination and paternalistic stereotyping is not so clear and that a statute based on the latter is patently capable of stigmatizing all women with a badge of inferiority. Cf. Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra, at 508; UJO, supra, at 174, and n. 3 (opinion concurring in part); Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 223 (1977) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). See also Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7, 14-15 (1975). State programs designed ostensibly to ameliorate the effects of past racial discrimination obviously create the same hazard of stigma, since they may promote racial separatism and reinforce the views of those who believe that members of racial minorities are inherently incapable of succeeding on their own. See UJO, supra, at 172 (opinion concurring in part); ante, at 298 (opinion of POWELL, J.).\n\nSecond, race, like gender and illegitimacy, see Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164 (1972), is an immutable characteristic which its possessors are powerless to escape or set aside. While a classification is not per se invalid because it divides classes on the basis of an immutable characteristic, see supra, at 355-356, it is nevertheless true that such divisions are contrary to our deep belief that \"legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility or *361 wrongdoing,\" Weber, supra, at 175; Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 686 (1973) (opinion of BRENNAN, WHITE, and MARSHALL, JJ.), and that advancement sanctioned, sponsored, or approved by the State should ideally be based on individual merit or achievement, or at the least on factors within the control of an individual. See UJO, 430 U. S., at 173 (opinion concurring in part); Kotch v. Board of River Port Pilot Comm'rs, 330 U. S. 552, 566 (1947) (Rutledge, J., dissenting).\n\nBecause this principle is so deeply rooted it might be supposed that it would be considered in the legislative process and weighed against the benefits of programs preferring individuals because of their race. But this is not necessarily so: The \"natural consequence of our governing processes [may well be] that the most `discrete and insular' of whites . . . will be called upon to bear the immediate, direct costs of benign discrimination.\" UJO, supra, at 174 (opinion concurring in part). Moreover, it is clear from our cases that there are limits beyond which majorities may not go when they classify on the basis of immutable characteristics. See, e. g., Weber, supra. Thus, even if the concern for individualism is weighed by the political process, that weighing cannot waive the personal rights of individuals under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Lucas v. Colorado General Assembly, 377 U. S. 713, 736 (1964).\n\nIn sum, because of the significant risk that racial classifications established for ostensibly benign purposes can be misused, causing effects not unlike those created by invidious classifications, it is inappropriate to inquire only whether there is any conceivable basis that might sustain such a classification. Instead, to justify such a classification an important and articulated purpose for its use must be shown. In addition, any statute must be stricken that stigmatizes any group or that singles out those least well represented in the political process to bear the brunt of a benign program. Thus, our review under the Fourteenth Amendment should be *362 strictnot \"`strict' in theory and fatal in fact,\"[36] because it is stigma that causes fatalitybut strict and searching nonetheless.IVDavis' articulated purpose of remedying the effects of past societal discrimination is, under our cases, sufficiently important to justify the use of race-conscious admissions programs where there is a sound basis for concluding that minority underrepresentation is substantial and chronic, and that the handicap of past discrimination is impeding access of minorities to the Medical School.AAt least since Green v. County School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (1968), it has been clear that a public body which has itself been adjudged to have engaged in racial discrimination cannot bring itself into compliance with the Equal Protection Clause simply by ending its unlawful acts and adopting a neutral stance. Three years later, Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1 (1971), and its companion cases, Davis v. School Comm'rs of Mobile County, 402 U. S. 33 (1971); McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U. S. 39 (1971); and North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U. S. 43 (1971), reiterated that racially neutral remedies for past discrimination were inadequate where consequences of past discriminatory acts influence or control present decisions. See, e. g., Charlotte-Mecklenburg, supra, at 28. And the Court further held both that courts could enter desegregation orders which assigned students and faculty by reference to race, Charlotte-Mecklenburg, supra; Davis, supra; United States v. Montgomery County Board of Ed., 395 U. S. 225 (1969), and that local school boards could voluntarily adopt desegregation *363 plans which made express reference to race if this was necessary to remedy the effects of past discrimination. McDaniel v. Barresi, supra. Moreover, we stated that school boards, even in the absence of a judicial finding of past discrimination, could voluntarily adopt plans which assigned students with the end of creating racial pluralism by establishing fixed ratios of black and white students in each school. Charlotte-Mecklenburg, supra, at 16. In each instance, the creation of unitary school systems, in which the effects of past discrimination had been \"eliminated root and branch,\" Green, supra, at 438, was recognized as a compelling social goal justifying the overt use of race.\n\nFinally, the conclusion that state educational institutions may constitutionally adopt admissions programs designed to avoid exclusion of historically disadvantaged minorities, even when such programs explicitly take race into account, finds direct support in our cases construing congressional legislation designed to overcome the present effects of past discrimination. Congress can and has outlawed actions which have a disproportionately adverse and unjustified impact upon members of racial minorities and has required or authorized race-conscious action to put individuals disadvantaged by such impact in the position they otherwise might have enjoyed. See Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747 (1976); Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324 (1977). Such relief does not require as a predicate proof that recipients of preferential advancement have been individually discriminated against; it is enough that each recipient is within a general class of persons likely to have been the victims of discrimination. See id., at 357-362. Nor is it an objection to such relief that preference for minorities will upset the settled expectations of nonminorities. See Franks, supra. In addition, we have held that Congress, to remove barriers to equal opportunity, can and has required employers to use test criteria that fairly reflect the qualifications of minority applicants *364 vis--vis nonminority applicants, even if this means interpreting the qualifications of an applicant in light of his race. See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 435 (1975).[37]\n\nThese cases cannot be distinguished simply by the presence of judicial findings of discrimination, for race-conscious remedies have been approved where such findings have not been made. McDaniel v. Barresi, supra; UJO; see Califano v. Webster, 430 U. S. 313 (1977); Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498 (1975); Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974). See also Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966). Indeed, the requirement of a judicial determination of a constitutional or statutory violation as a predicate for race-conscious remedial actions would be self-defeating. Such a requirement would severely undermine efforts to achieve voluntary compliance with the requirements of law. And our society and jurisprudence have always stressed the value of voluntary efforts to further the objectives of the law. Judicial intervention is a last resort to achieve cessation of illegal conduct or the remedying of its effects rather than a prerequisite to action.[38]*365 Nor can our cases be distinguished on the ground that the entity using explicit racial classifications itself had violated  1 of the Fourteenth Amendment or an antidiscrimination regulation, for again race-conscious remedies have been approved where this is not the case. See UJO, 430 U. S., at 157 (opinion of WHITE, J., joined by BRENNAN, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ.);[39]id., at 167 (opinion of WHITE, J., joined by REHNQUIST and STEVENS, JJ.);[40] cf. Califano v. Webster, supra, at 317; Kahn v. Shevin, supra. Moreover, the presence or absence of past discrimination by universities or employers is largely irrelevant to resolving respondent's constitutional claims. The claims of those burdened by the race-conscious actions of a university or employer who has never been adjudged in violation of an antidiscrimination law are not any more or less entitled to deference than the claims of the burdened nonminority workers in Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., supra, in which the employer had violated Title VII, for in each case the employees are innocent of past discrimination. And, although it might be argued that, where an employer has violated an antidiscrimination law, the expectations of nonminority workers are themselves products of discrimination and hence \"tainted,\" see Franks, supra, at 776, and therefore more easily upset, the same argument can be made with respect to respondent. If it was reasonable to concludeas we hold that it wasthat the failure of minorities to qualify for admission at Davis under regular procedures was due principally to the effects of past discrimination, than there is a reasonable likelihood that, but for pervasive racial discrimination, *366 respondent would have failed to qualify for admission even in the absence of Davis' special admissions program.[41]\n\nThus, our cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act have held that, in order to achieve minority participation in previously segregated areas of public life, Congress may require or authorize preferential treatment for those likely disadvantaged by societal racial discrimination. Such legislation has been sustained even without a requirement of findings of intentional racial discrimination by those required or authorized to accord preferential treatment, or a case-by-case determination that those to be benefited suffered from racial discrimination. These decisions compel the conclusion that States also may adopt race-conscious programs designed to overcome substantial, chronic minority under representation where there is reason to believe that the evil addressed is a product of past racial discrimination.[42]*367 Title VII was enacted pursuant to Congress' power under the Commerce Clause and  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. To the extent that Congress acted under the Commerce Clause power, it was restricted in the use of race in governmental decisionmaking by the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment precisely to the same extent as are the States by  1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.[43] Therefore, to the extent that Title VII rests on the Commerce Clause power, our decisions such as Franks and *368 Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324 (1977), implicitly recognize that the affirmative use of race is consistent with the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment and therefore with the Fourteenth Amendment. To the extent that Congress acted pursuant to  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, those cases impliedly recognize that Congress was empowered under that provision to accord preferential treatment to victims of past discrimination in order to overcome the effects of segregation, and we see no reason to conclude that the States cannot voluntarily accomplish under  1 of the Fourteenth Amendment what Congress under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment validly may authorize or compel either the States or private persons to do. A contrary position would conflict with the traditional understanding recognizing the competence of the States to initiate measures consistent with federal policy in the absence of congressional pre-emption of the subject matter. Nothing whatever in the legislative history of either the Fourteenth Amendment or the Civil Rights Acts even remotely suggests that the States are foreclosed from furthering the fundamental purpose of equal opportunity to which the Amendment and those Acts are addressed. Indeed, voluntary initiatives by the States to achieve the national goal of equal opportunity have been recognized to be essential to its attainment. \"To use the Fourteenth Amendment as a sword against such State power would stultify that Amendment.\" Railway Mail Assn. v. Corsi, 326 U. S. 88, 98 (1945) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).[44] We therefore *369 conclude that Davis' goal of admitting minority students disadvantaged by the effects of past discrimination is sufficiently important to justify use of race-conscious admissions criteria.BProperly construed, therefore, our prior cases unequivocally show that a state government may adopt race-conscious programs if the purpose of such programs is to remove the disparate racial impact its actions might otherwise have and if there is reason to believe that the disparate impact is itself the product of past discrimination, whether its own or that of society at large. There is no question that Davis' program is valid under this test.\n\nCertainly, on the basis of the undisputed factual submissions before this Court, Davis had a sound basis for believing that the problem of under representation of minorities was substantial and chronic and that the problem was attributable to handicaps imposed on minority applicants by past and present racial discrimination. Until at least 1973, the practice of medicine in this country was, in fact, if not in law, largely the prerogative of whites.[45] In 1950, for example, while Negroes *370 constituted 10% of the total population, Negro physicians constituted only 2.2% of the total number of physicians.[46] The overwhelming majority of these, moreover, were educated in two predominantly Negro medical schools, Howard and Meharry.[47] By 1970, the gap between the proportion of Negroes in medicine and their proportion in the population had widened: The number of Negroes employed in medicine remained frozen at 2.2%[48] while the Negro population had increased to 11.1%.[49] The number of Negro admittees to predominantly white medical schools, moreover, had declined in absolute numbers during the years 1955 to 1964. Odegaard 19.\n\nMoreover, Davis had very good reason to believe that the national pattern of underrepresentation of minorities in medicine would be perpetuated if it retained a single admissions standard. For example, the entering classes in 1968 and 1969, the years in which such a standard was used, included only 1 Chicano and 2 Negroes out of the 50 admittees for each year. Nor is there any relief from this pattern of underrepresentation in the statistics for the regular admissions program in later years.[50]\n\nDavis clearly could conclude that the serious and persistent underrepresentation of minorities in medicine depicted by these statistics is the result of handicaps under which minority applicants labor as a consequence of a background of deliberate, purposeful discrimination against minorities in education *371 and in society generally, as well as in the medical profession. From the inception of our national life, Negroes have been subjected to unique legal disabilities impairing access to equal educational opportunity. Under slavery, penal sanctions were imposed upon anyone attempting to educate Negroes.[51] After enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment the States continued to deny Negroes equal educational opportunity, enforcing a strict policy of segregation that itself stamped Negroes as inferior, Brown I, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), that relegated minorities to inferior educational institutions,[52] and that denied them intercourse in the mainstream of professional life necessary to advancement. See Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629 (1950). Segregation was not limited to public facilities, moreover, but was enforced by criminal penalties against private action as well. Thus, as late as 1908, this Court enforced a state criminal conviction against a private college for teaching Negroes together with whites. Berea College v. Kentucky, 211 U. S. 45. See also Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896).\n\nGreen v. County School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (1968), gave explicit recognition to the fact that the habit of discrimination and the cultural tradition of race prejudice cultivated by centuries of legal slavery and segregation were not immediately dissipated when Brown I, supra, announced the constitutional principle that equal educational opportunity and participation in all aspects of American life could not be denied on the basis of race. Rather, massive official and private resistance prevented, and to a lesser extent still prevents, attainment of equal opportunity in education at all levels and in the professions. The generation of minority students applying to Davis Medical School since it opened in 1968most of whom *372 were born before or about the time Brown I was decided clearly have been victims of this discrimination. Judicial decrees recognizing discrimination in public education in California testify to the fact of widespread discrimination suffered by California-born minority applicants;[53] many minority group members living in California, moreover, were born and reared in school districts in Southern States segregated by law.[54] Since separation of schoolchildren by race \"generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone,\" Brown I, supra, at 494, the conclusion is inescapable that applicants to medical school must be few indeed who endured the effects of de jure segregation, the resistance to Brown I, or the equally debilitating pervasive private discrimination fostered by our long history of official discrimination, cf. Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U. S. 369 (1967), and yet come to the starting line with an education equal to whites.[55]\n\nMoreover, we need not rest solely on our own conclusion that Davis had sound reason to believe that the effects of past discrimination were handicapping minority applicants to the Medical School, because the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the expert agency charged by Congress with promulgating regulations enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see supra, at 341-343, has also reached the conclusion that race may be taken into account in situations *373 where a failure to do so would limit participation by minorities in federally funded programs, and regulations promulgated by the Department expressly contemplate that appropriate race-conscious programs may be adopted by universities to remedy unequal access to university programs caused by their own or by past societal discrimination. See supra, at 344-345, discussing 45 CFR  80.3 (b) (6) (ii) and 80.5 (j) (1977). It cannot be questioned that, in the absence of the special admissions program, access of minority students to the Medical School would be severely limited and, accordingly, race-conscious admissions would be deemed an appropriate response under these federal regulations. Moreover, the Department's regulatory policy is not one that has gone unnoticed by Congress. See supra, at 346-347. Indeed, although an amendment to an appropriations bill was introduced just last year that would have prevented the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from mandating race-conscious programs in university admissions, proponents of this measure, significantly, did not question the validity of voluntary implementation of race-conscious admissions criteria. See ibid. In these circumstances, the conclusion implicit in the regulationsthat the lingering effects of past discrimination continue to make race-conscious remedial programs appropriate means for ensuring equal educational opportunity in universitiesdeserves considerable judicial deference. See, e. g., Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966); UJO, 430 U. S., at 175-178 (opinion concurring in part).[56]CThe second prong of our testwhether the Davis program stigmatizes any discrete group or individual and whether race *374 is reasonably used in light of the program's objectivesis clearly satisfied by the Davis program.\n\nIt is not even claimed that Davis' program in any way operates to stigmatize or single out any discrete and insular, or even any identifiable, nonminority group. Nor will harm comparable to that imposed upon racial minorities by exclusion or separation on grounds of race be the likely result of the program. It does not, for example, establish an exclusive preserve for minority students apart from and exclusive of whites. Rather, its purpose is to overcome the effects of segregation by bringing the races together. True, whites are excluded from participation in the special admissions program, but this fact only operates to reduce the number of whites to be admitted in the regular admissions program in order to permit admission of a reasonable percentageless than their proportion of the California population[57]of otherwise underrepresented qualified minority applicants.[58]*375 Nor was Bakke in any sense stamped as inferior by the Medical School's rejection of him. Indeed, it is conceded by all that he satisfied those criteria regarded by the school as generally relevant to academic performance better than most of the minority members who were admitted. Moreover, there is absolutely no basis for concluding that Bakke's rejection as a result of Davis' use of racial preference will affect him throughout his life in the same way as the segregation of the Negro school children in Brown I would have affected them. Unlike discrimination against racial minorities, the use of racial preferences for remedial purposes does not inflict a pervasive injury upon individual whites in the sense that wherever they go or whatever they do there is a significant likelihood that they will be treated as second-class citizens because of their color. This distinction does not mean that the exclusion of a white resulting from the preferential use of race is not sufficiently serious to require justification; but it does mean that the injury inflicted by such a policy is not distinguishable from disadvantages caused by a wide range of government actions, none of which has ever been thought impermissible for that reason alone.\n\nIn addition, there is simply no evidence that the Davis program discriminates intentionally or unintentionally against any minority group which it purports to benefit. The program does not establish a quota in the invidious sense of a ceiling on the number of minority applicants to be admitted. Nor can the program reasonably be regarded as stigmatizing the program's beneficiaries or their race as inferior. The Davis program does not simply advance less qualified applicants; rather, it compensates applicants, who it is uncontested are fully qualified to study medicine, for educational disadvantages which it was reasonable to conclude were a product of *376 state-fostered discrimination. Once admitted, these students must satisfy the same degree requirements as regularly admitted students; they are taught by the same faculty in the same classes; and their performance is evaluated by the same standards by which regularly admitted students are judged. Under these circumstances, their performance and degrees must be regarded equally with the regularly admitted students with whom they compete for standing. Since minority graduates cannot justifiably be regarded as less well qualified than nonminority graduates by virtue of the special admissions program, there is no reasonable basis to conclude that minority graduates at schools using such programs would be stigmatized as inferior by the existence of such programs.DWe disagree with the lower courts' conclusion that the Davis program's use of race was unreasonable in light of its objectives. First, as petitioner argues, there are no practical means by which it could achieve its ends in the foreseeable future without the use of race-conscious measures. With respect to any factor (such as poverty or family educational background) that may be used as a substitute for race as an indicator of past discrimination, whites greatly outnumber racial minorities simply because whites make up a far larger percentage of the total population and therefore far outnumber minorities in absolute terms at every socio-economic level.[59] For example, of a class of recent medical school applicants from families with less than $10,000 income, at least 71% were white.[60] Of all 1970 families headed by a *377 person not a high school graduate which included related children under 18, 80% were white and 20% were racial minorities.[61] Moreover, while race is positively correlated with differences in GPA and MCAT scores, economic disadvantage is not. Thus, it appears that economically disadvantaged whites do not score less well than economically advantaged whites, while economically advantaged blacks score less well than do disadvantaged whites.[62] These statistics graphically illustrate that the University's purpose to integrate its classes by compensating for past discrimination could not be achieved by a general preference for the economically disadvantaged or the children of parents of limited education unless such groups were to make up the entire class.\n\nSecond, the Davis admissions program does not simply equate minority status with disadvantage. Rather, Davis considers on an individual basis each applicant's personal history to determine whether he or she has likely been disadvantaged by racial discrimination. The record makes clear that only minority applicants likely to have been isolated from the mainstream of American life are considered in the special program; other minority applicants are eligible only through the regular admissions program. True, the procedure by which disadvantage is detected is informal, but we have never insisted that educators conduct their affairs through adjudicatory proceedings, and such insistence here is misplaced. A case-by-case inquiry into the extent to which each individual applicant has been affected, either directly or indirectly, by racial discrimination, would seem to be, as a practical matter, virtually impossible, despite the fact that there are excellent reasons for concluding that such effects generally exist. When individual measurement is impossible or extremely impractical, there is nothing to prevent a State *378 from using categorical means to achieve its ends, at least where the category is closely related to the goal. Cf. Gaston County v. United States, 395 U. S. 285, 295-296 (1969); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966). And it is clear from our cases that specific proof that a person has been victimized by discrimination is not a necessary predicate to offering him relief where the probability of victimization is great. See Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324 (1977).EFinally, Davis' special admissions program cannot be said to violate the Constitution simply because it has set aside a predetermined number of places for qualified minority applicants rather than using minority status as a positive factor to be considered in evaluating the applications of disadvantaged minority applicants. For purposes of constitutional adjudication, there is no difference between the two approaches. In any admissions program which accords special consideration to disadvantaged racial minorities, a determination of the degree of preference to be given is unavoidable, and any given preference that results in the exclusion of a white candidate is no more or less constitutionally acceptable than a program such as that at Davis. Furthermore, the extent of the preference inevitably depends on how many minority applicants the particular school is seeking to admit in any particular year so long as the number of qualified minority applicants exceeds that number. There is no sensible, and certainly no constitutional, distinction between, for example, adding a set number of points to the admissions rating of disadvantaged minority applicants as an expression of the preference with the expectation that this will result in the admission of an approximately determined number of qualified minority applicants and setting a fixed number of places for such applicants as was done here.[63]*379 The \"Harvard\" program, see ante, at 316-318, as those employing it readily concede, openly and successfully employs a racial criterion for the purpose of ensuring that some of the scarce places in institutions of higher education are allocated to disadvantaged minority students. That the Harvard approach does not also make public the extent of the preference and the precise workings of the system while the Davis program employs a specific, openly stated number, does not condemn the latter plan for purposes of Fourteenth Amendment adjudication. It may be that the Harvard plan is more acceptable to the public than is the Davis \"quota.\" If it is, any State, including California, is free to adopt it in preference to a less acceptable alternative, just as it is generally free, as far as the Constitution is concerned, to abjure granting any racial preferences in its admissions program. But there is no basis for preferring a particular preference program simply because in achieving the same goals that the Davis Medical School is pursuing, it proceeds in a manner that is not immediately apparent to the public.VAccordingly, we would reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of California holding the Medical School's special admissions program unconstitutional and directing respondent's admission, as well as that portion of the judgment enjoining the Medical School from according any consideration to race in the admissions process.MR. JUSTICE WHITE.I write separately concerning the question of whether Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.  2000d et seq., provides for a private cause of action. Four Justices are apparently of the view that such a private cause of action *380 exists, and four Justices assume it for purposes of this case. I am unwilling merely to assume an affirmative answer. If in fact no private cause of action exists, this Court and the lower Courts as well are without jurisdiction to consider respondent's Title VI claim. As I see it, if we are not obliged to do so, it is at least advisable to address this threshold jurisdictional issue. See United States v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 226, 229 (1938).[1] Furthermore, just as it is inappropriate to address constitutional issues without determining whether statutory grounds urged before us are dispositive, it is at least questionable practice to adjudicate a novel and difficult statutory issue without first considering whether we have jurisdiction to decide it. Consequently, I address the question of whether respondent may bring suit under Title VI.\n\nA private cause of action under Title VI, in terms both of *381 the Civil Rights Act as a whole and that Title, would not be \"consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme\" and would be contrary to the legislative intent. Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66, 78 (1975). Title II, 42 U. S. C.  2000a et seq., dealing with public accommodations, and Title VII, 42 U. S. C.  2000e et seq. (1970 ed. and Supp. V), dealing with employment, proscribe private discriminatory conduct that as of 1964 neither the Constitution nor other federal statutes had been construed to forbid. Both Titles carefully provided for private actions as well as for official participation in enforcement. Title III, 42 U. S. C.  2000b et seq., and Title IV, 42 U. S. C.  2000c et seq. (1970 ed. and Supp. V), dealing with public facilities and public education, respectively, authorize suits by the Attorney General to eliminate racial discrimination in these areas. Because suits to end discrimination in public facilities and public education were already available under 42 U. S. C.  1983, it was, of course, unnecessary to provide for private actions under Titles III and IV. But each Title carefully provided that its provisions for public actions would not adversely affect pre-existing private remedies.  2000b-2 and 2000c-8.\n\nThe role of Title VI was to terminate federal financial support for public and private institutions or programs that discriminated on the basis of race. Section 601, 42 U. S. C.  2000d, imposed the proscription that no person, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, was to be excluded from or discriminated against under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. But there is no express provision for private actions to enforce Title VI, and it would be quite incredible if Congress, after so carefully attending to the matter of private actions in other Titles of the Act, intended silently to create a private cause of action to enforce Title VI.\n\nIt is also evident from the face of  602, 42 U. S. C.  2000d-1, that Congress intended the departments and agencies *382 to define and to refine, by rule or regulation, the general proscription of  601, subject only to judicial review of agency action in accordance with established procedures. Section 602 provides for enforcement: Every federal department or agency furnishing financial support is to implement the proscription by appropriate rule or regulation, each of which requires approval by the President. Termination of funding as a sanction for noncompliance is authorized, but only after a hearing and after the failure of voluntary means to secure compliance. Moreover, termination may not take place until the department or agency involved files with the appropriate committees of the House and Senate a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action and 30 days have elapsed thereafter. Judicial review was provided, at least for actions terminating financial assistance.\n\nTermination of funding was regarded by Congress as a serious enforcement step, and the legislative history is replete with assurances that it would not occur until every possibility for conciliation had been exhausted.[2] To allow a private *383 individual to sue to cut off funds under Title VI would compromise these assurances and short circuit the procedural preconditions provided in Title VI. If the Federal Government may not cut off funds except pursuant to an agency rule, approved by the President, and presented to the appropriate committee of Congress for a layover period, and after voluntary means to achieve compliance have failed, it is inconceivable that Congress intended to permit individuals to circumvent these administrative prerequisites themselves.\n\nFurthermore, although Congress intended Title VI to end federal financial support for racially discriminatory policies of not only public but also private institutions and programs, it is extremely unlikely that Congress, without a word indicating that it intended to do so, contemplated creating an independent, private statutory cause of action against all private as well as public agencies that might be in violation of the section. There is no doubt that Congress regarded private litigation as an important tool to attack discriminatory practices. It does not at all follow, however, that Congress anticipated new private actions under Title VI itself. Wherever a discriminatory program was a public undertaking, such as a public school, private remedies were already available under other statutes, and a private remedy under Title VI was *384 unnecessary. Congress was well aware of this fact. Significantly, there was frequent reference to Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, 323 F. 2d 959 (CA4 1963), cert. denied, 376 U. S. 938 (1964), throughout the congressional deliberations. See, e. g., 110 Cong. Rec. 6544 (1964) (Sen. Humphrey). Simkins held that under appropriate circumstances, the operation of a private hospital with \"massive use of public funds and extensive state-federal sharing in the common plan\" constituted \"state action\" for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. 323 F. 2d, at 967. It was unnecessary, of course, to create a Title VI private action against private discriminators where they were already within the reach of existing private remedies. But when they were notand Simkins carefully disclaimed holding that \"every subvention by the federal or state government automatically involves the beneficiary in `state action,'\" ibid.[3]it is difficult *385 to believe that Congress silently created a private remedy to terminate conduct that previously had been entirely beyond the reach of federal law.\n\nFor those who believe, contrary to my views, that Title VI was intended to create a stricter standard of color blindness than the Constitution itself requires, the result of no private cause of action follows even more readily. In that case Congress must be seen to have banned degrees of discrimination, as well as types of discriminators, not previously reached by law. A Congress careful enough to provide that existing private causes of action would be preserved (in Titles III and IV) would not leave for inference a vast new extension of private enforcement power. And a Congress so exceptionally concerned with the satisfaction of procedural preliminaries before confronting fund recipients with the choice of a cutoff or of stopping discriminating would not permit private parties to pose precisely that same dilemma in a greatly widened category of cases with no procedural requirements whatsoever.\n\nSignificantly, in at least three instances legislators who played a major role in the passage of Title VI explicitly stated that a private right of action under Title VI does not exist.[4]*386 As an \"indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one,\" Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S., at 78, clearer statements cannot be imagined, and under Cort, \"an explicit purpose to deny such cause of action [is] controlling.\" Id., at 82. Senator Keating, for example, proposed a private \"right to sue\" for the \"person suffering from discrimination\"; but the Department of Justice refused to include it, and the Senator acquiesced.[5] These are not neutral, ambiguous statements. They indicate the absence of a legislative intent to create a private remedy. Nor do any of these statements make nice distinctions between a private cause of action to enjoin discrimination and one to cut off funds, as MR. JUSTICE STEVENS and the three Justices who join his opinion apparently would. See post, at 419-420, n. 26. Indeed, it would be odd if they did, since the practical effect of either type of private cause of action would be identical. If private suits to enjoin conduct allegedly violative of  601 were permitted, recipients of federal funds would be presented with the choice of either ending what the court, rather than the agency, determined to be a discriminatory practice within the meaning of Title VI or refusing federal funds and thereby escaping from the statute's jurisdictional predicate.[6] This is precisely the same choice as would confront recipients if suit were brought to cut off funds. Both types of actions would equally jeopardize the administrative processes so carefully structured into the law.\n\n*387 This Court has always required \"that the inference of such a private cause of action not otherwise authorized by the statute must be consistent with the evident legislative intent and, of course, with the effectuation of the purposes intended to be served by the Act.\" National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers, 414 U. S. 453, 458 (1974). See also Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Barbour, 421 U. S. 412, 418-420 (1975). A private cause of action under Title VI is unable to satisfy either prong of this test.\n\nBecause each of my colleagues either has a different view or assumes a private cause of action, however, the merits of the Title VI issue must be addressed. My views in that regard, as well as my views with respect to the equal protection issue, are included in the joint opinion that my Brothers BRENNAN, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN and I have filed.[7]MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL.I agree with the judgment of the Court only insofar as it permits a university to consider the race of an applicant in making admissions decisions. I do not agree that petitioner's admissions program violates the Constitution. For it must be remembered that, during most of the past 200 years, the Constitution as interpreted by this Court did not prohibit the most ingenious and pervasive forms of discrimination against the Negro. Now, when a state acts to remedy the effects of that legacy of discrimination, I cannot believe that this same Constitution stands as a barrier.IAThree hundred and fifty years ago, the Negro was dragged to this country in chains to be sold into slavery. Uprooted from his homeland and thrust into bondage for forced labor, *388 the slave was deprived of all legal rights. It was unlawful to teach him to read; he could be sold away from his family and friends at the whim of his master; and killing or maiming him was not a crime. The system of slavery brutalized and dehumanized both master and slave.[1]\n\nThe denial of human rights was etched into the American Colonies' first attempts at establishing self-government. When the colonists determined to seek their independence from England, they drafted a unique document cataloguing their grievances against the King and proclaiming as \"self-evident\" that \"all men are created equal\" and are endowed \"with certain unalienable Rights,\" including those to \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The self-evident truths and the unalienable rights were intended, however, to apply only to white men. An earlier draft of the Declaration of Independence, submitted by Thomas Jefferson to the Continental Congress, had included among the charges against the King that\"[h]e has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither.\" Franklin 88.The Southern delegation insisted that the charge be deleted; the colonists themselves were implicated in the slave trade, and inclusion of this claim might have made it more difficult to justify the continuation of slavery once the ties to England were severed. Thus, even as the colonists embarked on a *389 course to secure their own freedom and equality, they ensured perpetuation of the system that deprived a whole race of those rights.\n\nThe implicit protection of slavery embodied in the Declaration of Independence was made explicit in the Constitution, which treated a slave as being equivalent to three-fifths of a person for purposes of apportioning representatives and taxes among the States. Art. I,  2. The Constitution also contained a clause ensuring that the \"Migration or Importation\" of slaves into the existing States would be legal until at least 1808, Art. I,  9, and a fugitive slave clause requiring that when a slave escaped to another State, he must be returned on the claim of the master, Art. IV,  2. In their declaration of the principles that were to provide the cornerstone of the new Nation, therefore, the Framers made it plain that \"we the people,\" for whose protection the Constitution was designed, did not include those whose skins were the wrong color. As Professor John Hope Franklin has observed, Americans \"proudly accepted the challenge and responsibility of their new political freedom by establishing the machinery and safeguards that insured the continued enslavement of blacks.\" Franklin 100.\n\nThe individual States likewise established the machinery to protect the system of slavery through the promulgation of the Slave Codes, which were designed primarily to defend the property interest of the owner in his slave. The position of the Negro slave as mere property was confirmed by this Court in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), holding that the Missouri Compromisewhich prohibited slavery in the portion of the Louisiana Purchase Territory north of Missouri was unconstitutional because it deprived slave owners of their property without due process. The Court declared that under the Constitution a slave was property, and \"[t]he right to traffic in it, like an ordinary article of merchandise and property, was guarantied to the citizens of the United *390 States . . . .\" Id., at 451. The Court further concluded that Negroes were not intended to be included as citizens under the Constitution but were \"regarded as beings of an inferior order . . . altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect . . . .\" Id., at 407.BThe status of the Negro as property was officially erased by his emancipation at the end of the Civil War. But the long-awaited emancipation, while freeing the Negro from slavery, did not bring him citizenship or equality in any meaningful way. Slavery was replaced by a system of \"laws which imposed upon the colored race onerous disabilities and burdens, and curtailed their rights in the pursuit of life, liberty, and property to such an extent that their freedom was of little value.\" Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 70 (1873). Despite the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, the Negro was systematically denied the rights those Amendments were supposed to secure. The combined actions and inactions of the State and Federal Governments maintained Negroes in a position of legal inferiority for another century after the Civil War.\n\nThe Southern States took the first steps to re-enslave the Negroes. Immediately following the end of the Civil War, many of the provisional legislatures passed Black Codes, similar to the Slave Codes, which, among other things, limited the rights of Negroes to own or rent property and permitted imprisonment for breach of employment contracts. Over the next several decades, the South managed to disenfranchise the Negroes in spite of the Fifteenth Amendment by various techniques, including poll taxes, deliberately complicated balloting processes, property and literacy qualifications, and finally the white primary.\n\nCongress responded to the legal disabilities being imposed *391 in the Southern States by passing the Reconstruction Acts and the Civil Rights Acts. Congress also responded to the needs of the Negroes at the end of the Civil War by establishing the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, better known as the Freedmen's Bureau, to supply food, hospitals, land, and education to the newly freed slaves. Thus, for a time it seemed as if the Negro might be protected from the continued denial of his civil rights and might be relieved of the disabilities that prevented him from taking his place as a free and equal citizen.\n\nThat time, however, was short-lived. Reconstruction came to a close, and, with the assistance of this Court, the Negro was rapidly stripped of his new civil rights. In the words of C. Vann Woodward: \"By narrow and ingenious interpretation [the Supreme Court's] decisions over a period of years had whittled away a great part of the authority presumably given the government for protection of civil rights.\" Woodward 139.\n\nThe Court began by interpreting the Civil War Amendments in a manner that sharply curtailed their substantive protections. See, e. g., Slaughter-House Cases, supra; United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214 (1876); United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542 (1876). Then in the notorious Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883), the Court strangled Congress' efforts to use its power to promote racial equality. In those cases the Court invalidated sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 that made it a crime to deny equal access to \"inns, public conveyances, theaters and other places of public amusement.\" Id., at 10. According to the Court, the Fourteenth Amendment gave Congress the power to proscribe only discriminatory action by the State. The Court ruled that the Negroes who were excluded from public places suffered only an invasion of their social rights at the hands of private individuals, and Congress had no power to remedy that. Id., at 24-25. \"When a man has emerged from slavery, and by the aid of beneficent legislation has shaken off the inseparable concomitants of that *392 state,\" the Court concluded, \"there must be some stage in the progress of his elevation when he takes the rank of a mere citizen, and ceases to be the special favorite of the laws . . . .\" Id., at 25. As Mr. Justice Harlan noted in dissent, however, the Civil War Amendments and Civil Rights Acts did not make the Negroes the \"special favorite\" of the laws but instead \"sought to accomplish in reference to that race . . .what had already been done in every State of the Union for the white raceto secure and protect rights belonging to them as freemen and citizens; nothing more.\" Id., at 61.\n\nThe Court's ultimate blow to the Civil War Amendments and to the equality of Negroes came in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896). In upholding a Louisiana law that required railway companies to provide \"equal but separate\" accommodations for whites and Negroes, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended \"to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political equality, or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either.\" Id., at 544. Ignoring totally the realities of the positions of the two races, the Court remarked:\"We consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it.\" Id., at 551.Mr. Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion recognized the bankruptcy of the Court's reasoning. He noted that the \"real meaning\" of the legislation was \"that colored citizens are so inferior and degraded that they cannot be allowed to sit in public coaches occupied by white citizens.\" Id., at 560. He expressed his fear that if like laws were enacted in other *393 States, \"the effect would be in the highest degree mischievous.\" Id., at 563. Although slavery would have disappeared, the States would retain the power \"to interfere with the full enjoyment of the blessings of freedom; to regulate civil rights, common to all citizens, upon the basis of race; and to place in a condition of legal inferiority a large body of American citizens . . . .\" Ibid.\n\nThe fears of Mr. Justice Harlan were soon to be realized. In the wake of Plessy, many States expanded their Jim Crow laws, which had up until that time been limited primarily to passenger trains and schools. The segregation of the races was extended to residential areas, parks, hospitals, theaters, waiting rooms, and bathrooms. There were even statutes and ordinances which authorized separate phone booths for Negroes and whites, which required that textbooks used by children of one race be kept separate from those used by the other, and which required that Negro and white prostitutes be kept in separate districts. In 1898, after Plessy, the Charlestown News and Courier printed a parody of Jim Crow laws:\"`If there must be Jim Crow cars on the railroads, there should be Jim Crow cars on the street railways. Also on all passenger boats. . . . If there are to be Jim Crow cars, moreover, there should be Jim Crow waiting saloons at all stations, and Jim Crow eating houses. . . . There should be Jim Crow sections of the jury box, and a separate Jim Crow dock and witness stand in every court and a Jim Crow Bible for colored witnesses to kiss.'\" Woodward 68.The irony is that before many years had passed, with the exception of the Jim Crow witness stand, \"all the improbable applications of the principle suggested by the editor in derision had been put into practicedown to and including the Jim Crow Bible.\" Id., at 69.\n\nNor were the laws restricting the rights of Negroes limited *394 solely to the Southern States. In many of the Northern States, the Negro was denied the right to vote, prevented from serving on juries, and excluded from theaters, restaurants, hotels, and inns. Under President Wilson, the Federal Government began to require segregation in Government buildings; desks of Negro employees were curtained off; separate bathrooms and separate tables in the cafeterias were provided; and even the galleries of the Congress were segregated. When his segregationist policies were attacked, President Wilson responded that segregation was \"`not humiliating but a benefit'\" and that he was \"`rendering [the Negroes] more safe in their possession of office and less likely to be discriminated against.'\" Kluger 91.\n\nThe enforced segregation of the races continued into the middle of the 20th century. In both World Wars, Negroes were for the most part confined to separate military units; it was not until 1948 that an end to segregation in the military was ordered by President Truman. And the history of the exclusion of Negro children from white public schools is too well known and recent to require repeating here. That Negroes were deliberately excluded from public graduate and professional schoolsand thereby denied the opportunity to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, and the likeis also well established. It is of course true that some of the Jim Crow laws (which the decisions of this Court had helped to foster) were struck down by this Court in a series of decisions leading up to Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954). See, e. g., Morgan v. Virginia, 328 U. S. 373 (1946); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629 (1950); McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U. S. 637 (1950). Those decisions, however, did not automatically end segregation, nor did they move Negroes from a position of legal inferiority to one of equality. The legacy of years of slavery and of years of second-class citizenship in the wake of emancipation could not be so easily eliminated.II*395\nThe position of the Negro today in America is the tragic but inevitable consequence of centuries of unequal treatment. Measured by any benchmark of comfort or achievement, meaningful equality remains a distant dream for the Negro.\n\nA Negro child today has a life expectancy which is shorter by more than five years than that of a white child.[2] The Negro child's mother is over three times more likely to die of complications in childbirth,[3] and the infant mortality rate for Negroes is nearly twice that for whites.[4] The median income of the Negro family is only 60% that of the median of a white family,[5] and the percentage of Negroes who live in families with incomes below the poverty line is nearly four times greater than that of whites.[6]\n\nWhen the Negro child reaches working age, he finds that America offers him significantly less than it offers his white counterpart. For Negro adults, the unemployment rate is twice that of whites,[7] and the unemployment rate for Negro teenagers is nearly three times that of white teenagers.[8] A Negro male who completes four years of college can expect a median annual income of merely $110 more than a white male who has only a high school diploma.[9] Although Negroes *396 represent 11.5% of the population,[10] they are only 1.2% of the lawyers and judges, 2% of the physicians, 2.3% of the dentists, 1.1% of the engineers and 2.6% of the college and university professors.[11]\n\nThe relationship between those figures and the history of unequal treatment afforded to the Negro cannot be denied. At every point from birth to death the impact of the past is reflected in the still disfavored position of the Negro.\n\nIn light of the sorry history of discrimination and its devastating impact on the lives of Negroes, bringing the Negro into the mainstream of American life should be a state interest of the highest order. To fail to do so is to ensure that America will forever remain a divided society.IIII do not believe that the Fourteenth Amendment requires us to accept that fate. Neither its history nor our past cases lend any support to the conclusion that a university may not remedy the cumulative effects of society's discrimination by giving consideration to race in an effort to increase the number and percentage of Negro doctors.AThis Court long ago remarked that\"in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these [Civil War] amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy . . . .\" Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall., at 72.It is plain that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended to prohibit measures designed to remedy the effects of the *397 Nation's past treatment of Negroes. The Congress that passed the Fourteenth Amendment is the same Congress that passed the 1866 Freedmen's Bureau Act, an Act that provided many of its benefits only to Negroes. Act of July 16, 1866, ch. 200, 14 Stat. 173; see supra, at 391. Although the Freedmen's Bureau legislation provided aid for refugees, thereby including white persons within some of the relief measures, 14 Stat. 174; see also Act of Mar. 3, 1865, ch. 90, 13 Stat. 507, the bill was regarded, to the dismay of many Congressmen, as \"solely and entirely for the freedmen, and to the exclusion of all other persons . . . .\" Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 544 (1866) (remarks of Rep. Taylor). See also id., at 634-635 (remarks of Rep. Ritter); id., at App. 78, 80-81 (remarks of Rep. Chanler). Indeed, the bill was bitterly opposed on the ground that it \"undertakes to make the negro in some respects . . . superior . . . and gives them favors that the poor white boy in the North cannot get.\" Id., at 401 (remarks of Sen. McDougall). See also id., at 319 (remarks of Sen. Hendricks); id., at 362 (remarks of Sen. Saulsbury); id., at 397 (remarks of Sen. Willey); id., at 544 (remarks of Rep. Taylor). The bill's supporters defended itnot by rebutting the claim of special treatmentbut by pointing to the need for such treatment:\"The very discrimination it makes between `destitute and suffering' negroes, and destitute and suffering white paupers, proceeds upon the distinction that, in the omitted case, civil rights and immunities are already sufficiently protected by the possession of political power, the absence of which in the case provided for necessitates governmental protection.\" Id., at App. 75 (remarks of Rep. Phelps).Despite the objection to the special treatment the bill would provide for Negroes, it was passed by Congress. Id., at 421, 688. President Johnson vetoed this bill and also a subsequent bill that contained some modifications; one of his principal *398 objections to both bills was that they gave special benefits to Negroes. 8 Messages and Papers of the Presidents 3596, 3599, 3620, 3623 (1897). Rejecting the concerns of the President and the bill's opponents, Congress overrode the President's second veto. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 3842, 3850 (1866).\n\nSince the Congress that considered and rejected the objections to the 1866 Freedmen's Bureau Act concerning special relief to Negroes also proposed the Fourteenth Amendment, it is inconceivable that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to prohibit all race-conscious relief measures. It \"would be a distortion of the policy manifested in that amendment, which was adopted to prevent state legislation designed to perpetuate discrimination on the basis of race or color,\" Railway Mail Assn. v. Corsi, 326 U. S. 88, 94 (1945), to hold that it barred state action to remedy the effects of that discrimination. Such a result would pervert the intent of the Framers by substituting abstract equality for the genuine equality the Amendment was intended to achieve.BAs has been demonstrated in our joint opinion, this Court's past cases establish the constitutionality of race-conscious remedial measures. Beginning with the school desegregation cases, we recognized that even absent a judicial or legislative finding of constitutional violation, a school board constitutionally could consider the race of students in making school-assignment decisions. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1, 16 (1971); McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U. S. 39, 41 (1971). We noted, moreover, that a\"flat prohibition against assignment of students for the purpose of creating a racial balance must inevitably conflict with the duty of school authorities to disestablish dual school systems. As we have held in Swann, the Constitution does not compel any particular degree of *399 racial balance or mixing, but when past and continuing constitutional violations are found, some ratios are likely to be useful as starting points in shaping a remedy. An absolute prohibition against use of such a deviceeven as a starting pointcontravenes the implicit command of Green v. Country School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (1968), that all reasonable methods be available to formulate an effective remedy.\" Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U. S. 43, 46 (1971).As we have observed, \"[a]ny other approach would freeze the status quo that is the very target of all desegregation processes.\" McDaniel v. Barresi, supra, at 41.\n\nOnly last Term, in United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144 (1977), we upheld a New York reapportionment plan that was deliberately drawn on the basis of race to enhance the electoral power of Negroes and Puerto Ricans; the plan had the effect of diluting the electoral strength of the Hasidic Jewish community. We were willing in UJO to sanction the remedial use of a racial classification even though it disadvantaged otherwise \"innocent\" individuals. In another case last Term, Califano v. Webster, 430 U. S. 313 (1977), the Court upheld a provision in the Social Security laws that discriminated against men because its purpose was \" `the permissible one of redressing our society's longstanding disparate treatment of women.' \" Id., at 317, quoting Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 209 n. 8 (1977) (plurality opinion). We thus recognized the permissibility of remedying past societal discrimination through the use of otherwise disfavored classifications.\n\nNothing in those cases suggests that a university cannot similarly act to remedy past discrimination.[12] It is true that *400 in both UJO and Webster the use of the disfavored classification was predicated on legislative or administrative action, but in neither case had those bodies made findings that there had been constitutional violations or that the specific individuals to be benefited had actually been the victims of discrimination. Rather, the classification in each of those cases was based on a determination that the group was in need of the remedy because of some type of past discrimination. There is thus ample support for the conclusion that a university can employ race-conscious measures to remedy past societal discrimination, without the need for a finding that those benefited were actually victims of that discrimination.IVWhile I applaud the judgment of the Court that a university may consider race in its admissions process, it is more than a little ironic that, after several hundred years of class-based discrimination against Negroes, the Court is unwilling to hold that a class-based remedy for that discrimination is permissible. In declining to so hold, today's judgment ignores the fact that for several hundred years Negroes have been discriminated against, not as individuals, but rather solely because of the color of their skins. It is unnecessary in 20th-century America to have individual Negroes demonstrate that they have been victims of racial discrimination; the racism of our society has been so pervasive that none, regardless of wealth or position, has managed to escape its impact. The experience of Negroes in America has been different in kind, not just in degree, from that of other ethnic groups. It is not merely the history of slavery alone but also that a whole people were marked as inferior by the law. And that mark has endured. The dream of America as the great melting pot has *401 not been realized for the Negro; because of his skin color he never even made it into the pot.\n\nThese differences in the experience of the Negro make it difficult for me to accept that Negroes cannot be afforded greater protection under the Fourteenth Amendment where it is necessary to remedy the effects of past discrimination. In the Civil Rights Cases, supra, the Court wrote that the Negro emerging from slavery must cease \"to be the special favorite of the laws.\" 109 U. S., at 25; see supra, at 392. We cannot in light of the history of the last century yield to that view. Had the Court in that decision and others been willing to \"do for human liberty and the fundamental rights of American citizenship, what it did . . . for the protection of slavery and the rights of the masters of fugitive slaves,\" 109 U. S., at 53 (Harlan, J., dissenting), we would not need now to permit the recognition of any \"special wards.\"\n\nMost importantly, had the Court been willing in 1896, in Plessy v. Ferguson, to hold that the Equal Protection Clause forbids differences in treatment based on race, we would not be faced with this dilemma in 1978. We must remember, however, that the principle that the \"Constitution is color-blind\" appeared only in the opinion of the lone dissenter. 163 U. S., at 559. The majority of the Court rejected the principle of color blindness, and for the next 60 years, from Plessy to Brown v. Board of Education, ours was a Nation where, by law, an individual could be given \"special\" treatment based on the color of his skin.\n\nIt is because of a legacy of unequal treatment that we now must permit the institutions of this society to give consideration to race in making decisions about who will hold the positions of influence, affluence, and prestige in America. For far too long, the doors to those positions have been shut to Negroes. If we are ever to become a fully integrated society, one in which the color of a person's skin will not determine the opportunities available to him or her, we must be willing *402 to take steps to open those doors. I do not believe that anyone can truly look into America's past and still find that a remedy for the effects of that past is impermissible.\n\nIt has been said that this case involves only the individual, Bakke, and this University. I doubt, however, that there is a computer capable of determining the number of persons and institutions that may be affected by the decision in this case. For example, we are told by the Attorney General of the United States that at least 27 federal agencies have adopted regulations requiring recipients of federal funds to take \" `affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation . . . by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin.' \" Supplemental Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16 (emphasis added). I cannot even guess the number of state and local governments that have set up affirmative-action programs, which may be affected by today's decision.\n\nI fear that we have come full circle. After the Civil War our Government started several \"affirmative action\" programs. This Court in the Civil Rights Cases and Plessy v. Ferguson destroyed the movement toward complete equality. For almost a century no action was taken, and this nonaction was with the tacit approval of the courts. Then we had Brown v. Board of Education and the Civil Rights Acts of Congress, followed by numerous affirmative-action programs. Now, we have this Court again stepping in, this time to stop affirmative-action programs of the type used by the University of California.MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN.I participate fully, of course, in the opinion, ante, p. 324, that bears the names of my Brothers BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, and myself. I add only some general observations that hold particular significance for me, and then a few comments on equal protection. I*403\nAt least until the early 1970's, apparently only a very small number, less than 2%, of the physicians, attorneys, and medical and law students in the United States were members of what we now refer to as minority groups. In addition, approximately three-fourths of our Negro physicians were trained at only two medical schools. If ways are not found to remedy that situation, the country can never achieve its professed goal of a society that is not race conscious.\n\nI yield to no one in my earnest hope that the time will come when an \"affirmative action\" program is unnecessary and is, in truth, only a relic of the past. I would hope that we could reach this stage within a decade at the most. But the story of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), decided almost a quarter of a century ago, suggests that that hope is a slim one. At some time, however, beyond any period of what some would claim is only transitional inequality, the United States must and will reach a stage of maturity where action along this line is no longer necessary. Then persons will be regarded as persons, and discrimination of the type we address today will be an ugly feature of history that is instructive but that is behind us.\n\nThe number of qualified, indeed highly qualified, applicants for admission to existing medical schools in the United States far exceeds the number of places available. Wholly apart from racial and ethnic considerations, therefore, the selection process inevitably results in the denial of admission to many qualified persons, indeed, to far more than the number of those who are granted admission. Obviously, it is a denial to the deserving. This inescapable fact is brought into sharp focus here because Allan Bakke is not himself charged with discrimination and yet is the one who is disadvantaged, and because the Medical School of the University of California at Davis itself is not charged with historical discrimination.\n\nOne theoretical solution to the need for more minority *404 members in higher education would be to enlarge our graduate schools. Then all who desired and were qualified could enter, and talk of discrimination would vanish. Unfortunately, this is neither feasible nor realistic. The vast resources that apparently would be required simply are not available. And the need for more professional graduates, in the strict numerical sense, perhaps has not been demonstrated at all.\n\nThere is no particular or real significance in the 84-16 division at Davis. The same theoretical, philosophical, social, legal, and constitutional considerations would necessarily apply to the case if Davis' special admissions program had focused on any lesser number, that is, on 12 or 8 or 4 places or, indeed, on only 1.\n\nIt is somewhat ironic to have us so deeply disturbed over a program where race is an element of consciousness, and yet to be aware of the fact, as we are, that institutions of higher learning, albeit more on the undergraduate than the graduate level, have given conceded preferences up to a point to those possessed of athletic skills, to the children of alumni, to the affluent who may bestow their largess on the institutions, and to those having connections with celebrities, the famous, and the powerful.\n\nPrograms of admission to institutions of higher learning are basically a responsibility for academicians and for administrators and the specialists they employ. The judiciary, in contrast, is ill-equipped and poorly trained for this. The administration and management of educational institutions are beyond the competence of judges and are within the special competence of educators, provided always that the educators perform within legal and constitutional bounds. For me, therefore, interference by the judiciary must be the rare exception and not the rule.III, of course, accept the propositions that (a) Fourteenth Amendment rights are personal; (b) racial and ethnic distinctions *405 where they are stereotypes are inherently suspect and call for exacting judicial scrutiny; (c) academic freedom is a special concern of the First Amendment; and (d) the Fourteenth Amendment has expanded beyond its original 1868 concept and now is recognized to have reached a point where, as MR. JUSTICE POWELL states, ante, at 293, quoting from the Court's opinion in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U. S. 273, 296 (1976), it embraces a \"broader principle.\"\n\nThis enlargement does not mean for me, however, that the Fourteenth Amendment has broken away from its moorings and its original intended purposes. Those original aims persist. And that, in a distinct sense, is what \"affirmative action,\" in the face of proper facts, is all about. If this conflicts with idealistic equality, that tension is original Fourteenth Amendment tension, constitutionally conceived and constitutionally imposed, and it is part of the Amendment's very nature until complete equality is achieved in the area. In this sense, constitutional equal protection is a shield.\n\nI emphasize in particular that the decided cases are not easily to be brushed aside. Many, of course, are not precisely on point, but neither are they off point. Racial factors have been given consideration in the school desegregation cases, in the employment cases, in Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563 (1974), and in United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144 (1977). To be sure, some of these may be \"distinguished\" on the ground that victimization was directly present. But who is to say that victimization is not present for some members of today's minority groups, although it is of a lesser and perhaps different degree. The petitioners in United Jewish Organizations certainly complained bitterly of their reapportionment treatment, and I rather doubt that they regard the \"remedy\" there imposed as one that was \"to improve\" the group's ability to participate, as MR. JUSTICE POWELL describes it, ante, at 305. And surely in Lau v. Nichols we looked to ethnicity.\n\n*406 I am not convinced, as MR. JUSTICE POWELL seems to be, that the difference between the Davis program and the one employed by Harvard is very profound or constitutionally significant. The line between the two is a thin and indistinct one. In each, subjective application is at work. Because of my conviction that admission programs are primarily for the educators, I am willing to accept the representation that the Harvard program is one where good faith in its administration is practiced as well as professed. I agree that such a program, where race or ethnic background is only one of many factors, is a program better formulated than Davis' two-track system. The cynical, of course, may say that under a program such as Harvard's one may accomplish covertly what Davis concedes it does openly. I need not go that far, for despite its two-track aspect, the Davis program, for me, is within constitutional bounds, though perhaps barely so. It is surely free of stigma, and, as in United Jewish Organizations, I am not willing to infer a constitutional violation.\n\nIt is worth noting, perhaps, that governmental preference has not been a stranger to our legal life. We see it in veterans' preferences. We see it in the aid-to-the-handicapped programs. We see it in the progressive income tax. We see it in the Indian programs. We may excuse some of these on the ground that they have specific constitutional protection or, as with Indians, that those benefited are wards of the Government. Nevertheless, these preferences exist and may not be ignored. And in the admissions field, as I have indicated, educational institutions have always used geography, athletic ability, anticipated financial largess, alumni pressure, and other factors of that kind.\n\nI add these only as additional components on the edges of the central question as to which I join my Brothers BRENNAN, WHITE, and MARSHALL in our more general approach. It is gratifying to know that the Court at least finds it constitutional for an academic institution to take race and ethnic background into consideration as one factor, among many, in *407 the administration of its admissions program. I presume that that factor always has been there, though perhaps not conceded or even admitted. It is a fact of life, however, and a part of the real world of which we are all a part. The sooner we get down the road toward accepting and being a part of the real world, and not shutting it out and away from us, the sooner will these difficulties vanish from the scene.\n\nI suspect that it would be impossible to arrange an affirmative-action program in a racially neutral way and have it successful. To ask that this be so is to demand the impossible. In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently. We cannotwe dare notlet the Equal Protection Clause perpetuate racial supremacy.\n\nSo the ultimate question, as it was at the beginning of this litigation, is: Among the qualified, how does one choose?\n\nA long time ago, as time is measured for this Nation, a Chief Justice, both wise and farsighted, said:\"In considering this question, then, we must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding.\" McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407 (1819) (emphasis in original).In the same opinion, the Great Chief Justice further observed:\"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\" Id., at 421.More recently, one destined to become a Justice of this Court observed:\"The great generalities of the constitution have a content and a significance that vary from age to age.\" B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 17 (1921).*408 And an educator who became a President of the United States said:\"But the Constitution of the United States is not a mere lawyers' document: it is a vehicle of life, and its spirit is always the spirit of the age.\" W. Wilson, Constitutional Government in the United States 69 (1911).These percepts of breadth and flexibility and ever-present modernity are basic to our constitutional law. Today, again, we are expounding a Constitution. The same principles that governed McCulloch's case in 1819 govern Bakke's case in 1978. There can be no other answer.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.\n\nIt is always important at the outset to focus precisely on the controversy before the Court.[1] It is particularly important to do so in this case because correct identification of the issues will determine whether it is necessary or appropriate to express any opinion about the legal status of any admissions program other than petitioner's.IThis is not a class action. The controversy is between two specific litigants. Allan Bakke challenged petitioner's special admissions program, claiming that it denied him a place in medical school because of his race in violation of the Federal and California Constitutions and of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.  2000d et seq. The California Supreme Court upheld his challenge and ordered him admitted. If the *409 state court was correct in its view that the University's special program was illegal, and that Bakke was therefore unlawfully excluded from the Medical School because of his race, we should affirm its judgment, regardless of our views about the legality of admissions programs that are not now before the Court.\n\nThe judgment as originally entered by the trial court contained four separate paragraphs, two of which are of critical importance.[2] Paragraph 3 declared that the University's special admissions program violated the Fourteenth Amendment, the State Constitution, and Title VI. The trial court did not order the University to admit Bakke because it concluded that Bakke had not shown that he would have been admitted if there had been no special program. Instead, in paragraph 2 of its judgment it ordered the University to consider Bakke's application for admission without regard to his race or the race of any other applicant. The order did not include any broad *410 prohibition against any use of race in the admissions process; its terms were clearly limited to the University's consideration of Bakke's application.[3] Because the University has since been ordered to admit Bakke, paragraph 2 of the trial court's order no longer has any significance.\n\nThe California Supreme Court, in a holding that is not challenged, ruled that the trial court incorrectly placed the burden on Bakke of showing that he would have been admitted in the absence of discrimination. The University then conceded \"that it [could] not meet the burden of proving that the special admissions program did not result in Mr. Bakke's failure to be admitted.\"[4] Accordingly, the California Supreme Court directed the trial court to enter judgment ordering Bakke's admission.[5] Since that order superseded paragraph *411 2 of the trial court's judgment, there is no outstanding injunction forbidding any consideration of racial criteria in processing applications.\n\nIt is therefore perfectly clear that the question whether race can ever be used as a factor in an admissions decision is not an issue in this case, and that discussion of that issue is inappropriate.[6]IIBoth petitioner and respondent have asked us to determine the legality of the University's special admissions program by reference to the Constitution. Our settled practice, however, is to avoid the decision of a constitutional issue if a case can be fairly decided on a statutory ground. \"If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality . . . unless such adjudication is unavoidable.\" Spector Motor Co. v. McLaughlin, 323 U. S. 101, 105.[7] The more important the issue, the more force *412 there is to this doctrine.[8] In this case, we are presented with a constitutional question of undoubted and unusual importance. Since, however, a dispositive statutory claim was raised at the very inception of this case, and squarely decided in the portion of the trial court judgment affirmed by the California Supreme Court, it is our plain duty to confront it. Only if petitioner should prevail on the statutory issue would it be necessary to decide whether the University's admissions program violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.IIISection 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C.  2000d, provides:\"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"The University, through its special admissions policy, excluded Bakke from participation in its program of medical education because of his race. The University also acknowledges that it was, and still is, receiving federal financial assistance.[9] The plain language of the statute therefore requires affirmance of the judgment below. A different result *413 cannot be justified unless that language misstates the actual intent of the Congress that enacted the statute or the statute is not enforceable in a private action. Neither conclusion is warranted.\n\nTitle VI is an integral part of the far-reaching Civil Rights Act of 1964. No doubt, when this legislation was being debated, Congress was not directly concerned with the legality of \"reverse discrimination\" or \"affirmative action\" programs. Its attention was focused on the problem at hand, the \"glaring . . . discrimination against Negroes which exists throughout our Nation,\"[10] and, with respect to Title VI, the federal funding of segregated facilities.[11] The genesis of the legislation, however, did not limit the breadth of the solution adopted. Just as Congress responded to the problem of employment discrimination by enacting a provision that protects all races, see McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U. S. 273, 279,[12] so, too, its answer to the problem of federally funding of segregated facilities stands as a broad prohibition against the exclusion of any individual from a federally funded program \"on the ground of race.\" In the words of the House Report, Title VI stands for \"the general principle that no person . . . be excluded from participation . . . on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" H. R. Rep. No. 914, 88th *414 Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 25 (1963) (emphasis added). This same broad view of Title VI and  601 was echoed throughout the congressional debate and was stressed by every one of the major spokesmen for the Act.[13]\n\nPetitioner contends, however, that exclusion of applicants on the basis of race does not violate Title VI if the exclusion carries with it no racial stigma. No such qualification or limitation of  601's categorical prohibition of \"exclusion\" is justified by the statute or its history. The language of the entire section is perfectly clear; the words that follow \"excluded from\" do not modify or qualify the explicit outlawing of any exclusion on the stated grounds.\n\nThe legislative history reinforces this reading. The only suggestion that  601 would allow exclusion of non minority applicants came from opponents of the legislation and then only by way of a discussion of the meaning of the word \"discrimination.\"[14] The opponents feared that the term \"discrimination\" *415 would be read as mandating racial quotas and \"racially balanced\" colleges and universities, and they pressed for a specific definition of the term in order to avoid this possibility.[15] In response, the proponents of the legislation gave repeated assurances that the Act would be \"colorblind\" in its application.[16] Senator Humphrey, the Senate floor manager for the Act, expressed this position as follows:\"[T]he word `discrimination' has been used in many a court case. What it really means in the bill is a distinction in treatment . . . given to different individuals because of their different race, religion or national origin. . . .\"The answer to this question [what was meant by `discrimination'] is that if race is not a factor, we do not have to worry about discrimination because of race. . . . The Internal Revenue Code does not provide that colored people do not have to pay taxes, or that they can pay their taxes 6 months later than everyone else.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 5864 (1964).\"[I]f we started to treat Americans as Americans, not as fat ones, thin ones, short ones, tall ones, brown ones, green ones, yellow ones, or white ones, but as Americans. If we did that we would not need to worry about discrimination.\" Id., at 5866.*416 In giving answers such as these, it seems clear that the proponents of Title VI assumed that the Constitution itself required a colorblind standard on the part of government,[17] but that does not mean that the legislation only codifies an existing constitutional prohibition. The statutory prohibition against discrimination in federally funded projects contained in  601 is more than a simple paraphrasing of what the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment would require. The Act's proponents plainly considered Title VI consistent with their view of the Constitution and they sought to provide an effective weapon to implement that view.[18] As a distillation of what the supporters of the Act believed the Constitution demanded of State and Federal Governments,  601 has independent force, with language and emphasis in addition to that found in the Constitution.[19]*417 As with other provisions of the Civil Rights Act, Congress' expression of its policy to end racial discrimination may independently proscribe conduct that the Constitution does not.[20] However, we need not decide the Congruenceor lack of congruenceof the controlling statute and the Constitution *418 since the meaning of the Title VI ban on exclusion is crystal clear: Race cannot be the basis of excluding anyone from participation in a federally funded program.\n\nIn short, nothing in the legislative history justifies the conclusion that the broad language of  601 should not be given its natural meaning. We are dealing with a distinct statutory prohibition, enacted at a particular time with particular concerns in mind; neither its language nor any prior interpretation suggests that its place in the Civil Rights Act, won after long debate, is simply that of a constitutional appendage.[21] In unmistakable terms the Act prohibits the exclusion of individuals from federally funded programs because of their race.[22] As succinctly phrased during the Senate debate, under Title VI it is not \"permissible to say `yes' to one person; but to say `no' to another person, only because of the color of his skin.\"[23]\n\nBelatedly, however, petitioner argues that Title VI cannot be enforced by a private litigant. The claim is unpersuasive in the context of this case. Bakke requested injunctive and declaratory relief under Title VI; petitioner itself then joined *419 issue on the question of the legality of its program under Title VI by asking for a declaratory judgment that it was in compliance with the statue.[24] Its view during state-court litigation was that a private cause of action does exist under Title VI. Because petitioner questions the availability of a private cause of action for the first time in this Court, the question is not properly before us. See McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430, 434, Even if it were, petitioner's original assumption is in accord with the federal courts' consistent interpretation of the Act. To date, the courts, including this Court, have unanimously concluded or assumed that a private action may be maintained under Title VI.[25] The United States has taken the same position; in its amicus curiae brief directed to this specific issue, it concluded that such a remedy is clearly available,[26]*420 and Congress has repeatedly enacted legislation predicated on the assumption that Title VI may be enforced in a private action.[27] The conclusion that an individual may maintain a private cause of action is amply supported in the legislative history of Title VI itself.[28] In short, a fair consideration of *421 petitioner's tardy attack on the propriety of Bakke's suit under Title VI requires that it be rejected.\n\nThe University's special admissions program violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by excluding Bakke from the Medical School because of his race. It is therefore our duty to affirm the judgment ordering Bakke admitted to the University.\n\nAccordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment insofar as it affirms the judgment of the Supreme Court of California. To the extent that it purports to do anything else, I respectfully dissent.NOTES[\u2020]  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS views the judgment of the California court as limited to prohibiting the consideration of race only in passing upon Bakke's application. Post, at 408-411. It must be remembered, however, that petitioner here cross-complained in the trial court for a declaratory judgment that its special program was constitutional and it lost. The trial court's judgment that the special program was unlawful was affirmed by the California Supreme Court in an opinion which left no doubt that the reason for its holding was petitioner's use of race in consideration of any candidate's application. Moreover, in explaining the scope of its holding, the court quite clearly stated that petitioner was prohibited from taking race into account in any way in making admissions decisions:In addition, the University may properly as it in fact does, consider other factors in evaluating an applicant, such as the personal interview, recommendations, character, and matters relating to the needs of the profession and society, such as an applicant's professional goals. In short, the standards for admission employed by the University are not constitutionally infirm except to the extent that they are utilized in a racially discriminatory manner. Disadvantaged applicants of all races must be eligible for sympathetic consideration, and no applicant may be rejected because of his race, in favor of another who is less qualified, as measured by standards applied without regard to race. We reiterate, in view of the dissent's misinterpretation, that we do not compel the University to utilize only `the highest objective academic credentials' as the criterion for admission.\" 18 Cal. 3d 34, 54-55, 553 P. 2d 1152, 1166 (1976) (footnote omitted).This explicit statement makes it unreasonable to assume that the reach of the California court's judgment can be limited in the manner suggested by MR. JUSTICE STEVENS.\n\n[\u2020\u2020]  MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN join Parts I and V-C of this opinion. MR. JUSTICE WHITE also joins Part III-A of this opinion.\n\n[1]  Material distributed to applicants for the class entering in 1973 described the special admissions program as follows:A special subcommittee of the Admissions Committee, made up of faculty and medical students from minority groups, evaluates applications from economically and/or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. The applicant may designate on the application form that he or she requests such an evaluation. Ethnic minorities are not categorically considered under the Task Force Program unless they are from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our goals are: 1) A short range goal in the identification and recruitment of potential candidates for admission to medical school in the near future, and 2) Our long-range goal is to stimulate career interest in health professions among junior high and high school students.\n\n\"After receiving all pertinent information selected applicants will receive a letter inviting them to our School of Medicine in Davis for an interview. The interviews are conducted by at least one faculty member and one student member of the Task Force Committee. Recommendations are then made to the Admissions Committee of the medical school. Some of the Task Force Faculty are also members of the Admissions Committee.\n\n\"Long-range goals will be approached by meeting with counselors and students of schools with large minority populations, as well as with local youth and adult community groups.\n\n\"Applications for financial aid are available only after the applicant has been accepted and can only be awarded after registration. Financial aid is available to students in the form of scholarships and loans. In addition to the Regents' Scholarships and President's Scholarship programs, the medical school participates in the Health Professions Scholarship Program, which makes funds available to students who otherwise might not be able to pursue a medical education. Other scholarships and awards are available to students who meet special eligibility qualifications. Medical students are also eligible to participate in the Federally Insured Student Loan Program and the American Medical Association Education and Research Foundation Loan Program.\n\n\"Applications for Admission are available from:\n\"Admissions OfficeSchool of Medicine\nUniversity of California\nDavis, California 95616\"\nRecord 195. The letter distributed the following year was virtually identical, except that the third paragraph was omitted.\n\n[2]  For the 1973 entering class of 100 seats, the Davis Medical School received 2,464 applications. Id., at 117. For the 1974 entering class, 3,737 applications were submitted. Id., at 289.\n\n[3]  That is, applications were considered and acted upon as they were received, so that the process of filling the class took place over a period of months, with later applications being considered against those still on file from earlier in the year. Id., at 64.\n\n[4]  The chairman normally checked to see if, among other things, the applicant had been granted a waiver of the school's application fee, which required a means test; whether the applicant had worked during college or interrupted his education to support himself or his family; and whether the applicant was a member of a minority group. Id., at 65-66.\n\n[5]  For the class entering in 1973, the total number of special applicants was 297, of whom 73 were white. In 1974, 628 persons applied to the special committee, of whom 172 were white.

Storandt, Assistant to the Dean of Admissions at the Davis Medical School. Id., at 259-269. Storandt expressed sympathy for Bakke's position and offered advice on litigation strategy. Several amici imply that these discussions render Bakke's suit \"collusive.\" There is no indication, however, that Storandt's views were those of the Medical School or that anyone else at the school even was aware of Storandt's correspondence and conversations with Bakke. Storandt is no longer with the University.\n\n[9]  \"[N]or shall any State . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\n[10]  \"No special privileges or immunities shall ever be granted which may not be altered, revoked, or repealed by the Legislature; nor shall any citizen, or class of citizens, be granted privileges or immunities which, upon the same terms, shall not be granted to all citizens.\"\n\nThis section was recently repealed and its provisions added to Art. I,  7, of the State Constitution.\n\n[11]  Section 601 of Title VI, 78 Stat. 252, provides as follows:\n\nNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\n\n[12]  Indeed, the University did not challenge the finding that applicants who were not members of a minority group were excluded from consideration in the special admissions process. 18 Cal. 3d, at 44, 553 P. 2d, at 1159.\n\n[13]  Petitioner has not challenged this aspect of the decision. The issue of the proper placement of the burden of proof, then, is not before us.\n\n[14]  Several amici suggest that Bakke lacks standing, arguing that he never showed that his injuryexclusion from the Medical Schoolwill be redressed by a favorable decision, and that the petitioner \"fabricated\" jurisdiction by conceding its inability to meet its burden of proof. Petitioner does not object to Bakke's standing, but inasmuch as this charge concerns our jurisdiction under Art. III, it must be considered and rejected. First, there appears to be no reason to question the petitioner's concession. It was not an attempt to stipulate to a conclusion of law or to disguise actual facts of record. Cf. Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley R. Co., 243 U. S. 281 (1917).\n\nSecond, even if Bakke had been unable to prove that he would have been admitted in the absence of the special program, it would not follow that he lacked standing. The constitutional element of standing is plaintiff's demonstration of any injury to himself that is likely to be redressed by favorable decision of his claim. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498 (1975). The trial court found such an injury, apart from failure to be admitted, in the University's decision not to permit Bakke to compete for all 100 places in the class, simply because of his race. Record 323. Hence the constitutional requirements of Art. III were met. The question of Bakke's admission vel non is merely one of relief.\n\nNor is it fatal to Bakke's standing that he was not a \"disadvantaged\" applicant. Despite the program's purported emphasis on disadvantage, it was a minority enrollment program with a secondary disadvantage element. White disadvantaged students were never considered under the special program, and the University acknowledges that its goal in devising the program was to increase minority enrollment.\n\n[15]  See, e. g., 110 Cong. Rec. 5255 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Case).\n\n[16]  E. g., Bossier Parish School Board v. Lemon, 370 F. 2d 847, 851-852 (CA5), cert. denied, 388 U. S. 911 (1967); Natonabah v. Board of Education, 355 F. Supp. 716, 724 (NM 1973); cf. Lloyd v. Regional Transportation Authority, 548 F. 2d 1277, 1284-1287 (CA7 1977) (Title V of Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U. S.

(1976 ed.)).\n\n[17]  Section 602, as set forth in 42 U. S. C.  2000d-1, reads as follows:\n\n\"Each Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to any program or activity, by way of grant, loan, or contract other than a contract of insurance or guaranty, is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of section 2000d of this title with respect to such program or activity by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability which shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the financial assistance in connection with which the action is taken. No such rule, regulation, or order shall become effective unless and until approved by the President. Compliance with any requirement adopted pursuant to this section may be effected (1) by the termination of or refusal to grant or to continue assistance under such program or activity to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with such requirement, but such termination or refusal shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and, shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found, or (2) by any other means authorized by law: Provided, however, That no such action shall be taken until the department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means. In the case of any action terminating, or refusing to grant or continue, assistance because of failure to comply with a requirement imposed pursuant to this section, the head of the Federal department or agency shall file with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. No such action shall become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report.\"\n\n[18]  Several comments in the debates cast doubt on the existence of any intent to create a private right of action. For example, Representative Gill stated that no private right of action was contemplated:\n\n\"Nowhere in this section do you find a comparable right of legal action for a person who feels he has been denied his rights to participate in the benefits of Federal funds. Nowhere. Only those who have been cut off can go to court and present their claim.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 2467 (1964).\n\nAccord, id., at 7065 (remarks of Sen. Keating); 6562 (remarks of Sen.

See, e. g., Ely, The Constitutionality of Reverse Racial Discrimination, 41 U. Chi. L.

Rev. 285 (1977).\n\n[26]  Petitioner defines \"quota\" as a requirement which must be met but can never be exceeded, regardless of the quality of the minority applicants. Petitioner declares that there is no \"floor\" under the total number of minority students admitted; completely unqualified students will not be admitted simply to meet a \"quota.\" Neither is there a \"ceiling,\" since an unlimited number could be admitted through the general admissions process. On this basis the special admissions program does not meet petitioner's definition of a quota.\n\nThe court below foundand petitioner does not denythat white applicants could not compete for the 16 places reserved solely for the special admissions program. 18 Cal. 3d, at 44, 553 P. 2d, at 1159. Both courts below characterized this as a \"quota\" system.\n\n[27]  Moreover, the University's special admissions program involves a purposeful, acknowledged use of racial criteria. This is not a situation in which the classification on its face is racially neutral, but has a disproportionate racial impact. In that situation, plaintiff must establish an intent to discriminate. Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 264-265 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 242 (1976); see Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.

Roberts, supra n. 31, at 75; G. Abbott, supra n. 31, at 270-271. See generally n. 31, supra.\n\n[34]  In the view of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, the pliable notion of \"stigma\" is the crucial element in analyzing racial classifications. See, e. g., post, at 361, 362. The Equal Protection Clause is not framed in terms of \"stigma.\" Certainly the word has no clearly defined constitutional meaning. It reflects a subjective judgment that is standardless. All state-imposed classifications that rearrange burdens and benefits on the basis of race are likely to be viewed with deep resentment by the individuals burdened. The denial to innocent persons of equal rights and opportunities may outrage those so deprived and therefore may be perceived as invidious. These individuals are likely to find little comfort in the notion that the deprivation they are asked to endure is merely the price of membership in the dominant majority and that its imposition is inspired by the supposedly benign purpose of aiding others. One should not lightly dismiss the inherent unfairness of, and the perception of mistreatment that accompanies, a system of allocating benefits and privileges on the basis of skin color and ethnic origin. Moreover, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN offer no principle for deciding whether preferential classifications reflect a benign remedial purpose or a malevolent stigmatic classification, since they are willing in this case to accept mere post hoc declarations by an isolated state entitya medical school facultyunadorned by particularized findings of past discrimination, to establish such a remedial purpose.\n\n[35]  Professor Bickel noted the self-contradiction of that view:\n\n\"The lesson of the great decisions of the Supreme Court and the lesson of contemporary history have been the same for at least a generation: discrimination on the basis of race is illegal, immoral, unconstitutional, inherently wrong, and destructive of democratic society. Now this is to be unlearned and we are told that this is not a matter of fundamental principle but only a matter of whose ox is gored. Those for whom racial equality was demanded are to be more equal than others. Having found support in the Constitution for equality, they now claim support for inequality under the same Constitution.\" A. Bickel, The Morality of Consent 133 (1975).\n\n[36]  As I am in agreement with the view that race may be taken into account as a factor in an admissions program, I agree with my Brothers BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN that the portion of the judgment that would proscribe all consideration of race must be reversed. See Part V, infra. But I disagree with much that is said in their opinion.\n\nThey would require as a justification for a program such as petitioner's, only two findings: (i) that there has been some form of discrimination against the preferred minority groups by \"society at large,\" post, at 369 (it being conceded that petitioner had no history of discrimination), and (ii) that \"there is reason to believe\" that the disparate impact sought to be rectified by the program is the \"product\" of such discrimination:\n\n\"If it was reasonable to concludeas we hold that it wasthat the failure of minorities to qualify for admission at Davis under regular procedures was due principally to the effects of past discrimination, then there is a reasonable likelihood that, but for pervasive racial discrimination, respondent would have failed to qualify for admission even in the absence of Davis' special admissions program.\" Post, at 365-366.\n\nThe breadth of this hypothesis is unprecedented in our constitutional system. The first step is easily taken. No one denies the regrettable fact that there has been societal discrimination in this country against various racial and ethnic groups. The second step, however, involves a speculative leap: but for this discrimination by society at large, Bakke \"would have failed to qualify for admission\" because Negro applicantsnothing is said about Asians, cf., e. g., post, at 374 n. 57would have made better scores. Not one word in the record supports this conclusion, and the authors of the opinion offer no standard for courts to use in applying such a presumption of causation to other racial or ethnic classifications. This failure is a grave one, since if it may be concluded on this record that each of the minority groups preferred by the petitioner's special program is entitled to the benefit of the presumption, it would seem difficult to determine that any of the dozens of minority groups that have suffered \"societal discrimination\" cannot also claim it, in any area of social intercourse. See Part IV-B, infra.\n\n[37]  Mr. Justice Douglas has noted the problems associated with such inquiries:\n\n\"The reservation of a proportion of the law school class for members of selected minority groups is fraught with . . . dangers, for one must immediately determine which groups are to receive such favored treatment and which are to be excluded, the proportions of the class that are to be allocated to each, and even the criteria by which to determine whether an individual is a member of a favored group. [Cf. Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 549, 552 (1896).] There is no assurance that a common agreement can be reached, and first the schools, and then the courts, will be buffeted with the competing claims. The University of Washington included Filipinos, but excluded Chinese and Japanese; another school may limit its program to blacks, or to blacks and Chicanos. Once the Court sanctioned racial preferences such as these, it could not then wash its hands of the matter, leaving it entirely in the discretion of the school, for then we would have effectively overruled Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629, and allowed imposition of a `zero' allocation. But what standard is the Court to apply when a rejected applicant of Japanese ancestry brings suit to require the University of Washington to extend the same privileges to his group? The Committee might conclude that the population of Washington is now 2% Japanese, and that Japanese also constitute 2% of the Bar, but that had they not been handicapped by a history of discrimination, Japanese would now constitute 5% of the Bar, or 20%. Or, alternatively, the Court could attempt to assess how grievously each group has suffered from discrimination, and allocate proportions accordingly; if that were the standard the current University of Washington policy would almost surely fall, for there is no Western State which can claim that it has always treated Japanese and Chinese in a fair and evenhanded manner. See, e. g., Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356; Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U. S. 197; Oyama v. California, 332 U. S. 633. This Court has not sustained a racial classification since the wartime cases of Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214, and Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, involving curfews and relocations imposed upon Japanese-Americans.\n\n\"Nor obviously will the problem be solved if next year the Law School included only Japanese and Chinese, for then Norwegians and Swedes, Poles and Italians, Puerto Ricans and Hungarians, and all other groups which form this diverse Nation would have just complaints.\" DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312, 337-340 (1974) (dissenting opinion) (footnotes omitted).\n\n[38]  R. Dahl, A Preface to Democratic Theory (1956); Posner, supra n. 25, at 27.\n\n[39]  Petitioner cites three lower court decisions allegedly deviating from this general rule in school desegregation cases: Offermann v. Nitkowski, 378 F. 2d 22 (CA2 1967); Wanner v. County School Board, 357 F. 2d 452 (CA4 1966); Springfield School Committee v. Barksdale, 348 F. 2d 261 (CA1 1965). Of these, Wanner involved a school system held to have been de jure segregated and enjoined from maintaining segregation; racial districting was deemed necessary. 357 F. 2d, at 454. Cf. United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144 (1977). In Barksdale and Offermann, courts did approve voluntary districting designed to eliminate discriminatory attendance patterns. In neither, however, was there any showing that the school board planned extensive pupil transportation that might threaten liberty or privacy interests. See Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U. S. 189, 240-250 (1973) (POWELL, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Nor were white students deprived of an equal opportunity for education.\n\nRespondent's position is wholly dissimilar to that of a pupil bused from his neighborhood school to a comparable school in another neighborhood in compliance with a desegregation decree. Petitioner did not arrange for respondent to attend a different medical school in order to desegregate Davis Medical School; instead, it denied him admission and may have deprived him altogether of a medical education.\n\n[40]  Every decision upholding the requirement of preferential hiring under the authority of Exec. Order No. 11246, 3 CFR 339 (1964-1965 Comp.), has emphasized the existence of previous discrimination as a predicate for the imposition of a preferential remedy. Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania; Southern Illinois Builders Assn. v. Ogilvie, 471 F. 2d 680 (CA7 1972); Joyce v. McCrane, 320 F. Supp. 1284 (NJ 1970); Weiner v. Cuyahoga Community College District, 19 Ohio St. 2d 35, 249 N. E. 2d 907, cert. denied, 396 U. S. 1004 (1970). See also Rosetti Contracting Co. v. Brennan, 508 F. 2d 1039, 1041 (CA7 1975); Associated General Contractors of Massachusetts, Inc. v. Altshuler, 490 F. 2d 9 (CA1 1973), cert. denied, 416 U. S. 957 (1974); Northeast Constr. Co. v. Romney, 157 U. S. App. D. C. 381, 383, 390, 485 F. 2d 752, 754, 761 (1973).\n\n[41]  This case does not call into question congressionally authorized administrative actions, such as consent decrees under Title VII or approval of reapportionment plans under  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C.  1973c (1970 ed., Supp. V). In such cases, there has been detailed legislative consideration of the various indicia of previous constitutional or statutory violations, e. g., South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308-310 (1966) ( 5), and particular administrative bodies have been charged with monitoring various activities in order to detect such violations and formulate appropriate remedies. See Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 103 (1976).\n\nFurthermore, we are not here presented with an occasion to review legislation by Congress pursuant to its powers under  2 of the Thirteenth Amendment and  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to remedy the effects of prior discrimination. Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966); Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409 (1968). We have previously recognized the special competence of Congress to make findings with respect to the effects of identified past discrimination and its discretionary authority to take appropriate remedial measures.\n\n[42]  Petitioner also cites our decision in Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535 (1974), for the proposition that the State may prefer members of traditionally disadvantaged groups. In Mancari, we approved a hiring preference for qualified Indians in the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior (BIA). We observed in that case, however, that the legal status of the BIA is sui generis. Id., at 554. Indeed, we found that the preference was not racial at all, but \"an employment criterion reasonably designed to further the cause of Indian self-government and to make the BIA more responsive to . . . groups . . . whose lives and activities are governed by the BIA in a unique fashion.\" Ibid.\n\n[43]  A number of distinct subgoals have been advanced as falling under the rubric of \"compensation for past discrimination.\" For example, it is said that preferences for Negro applicants may compensate for harm done them personally, or serve to place them at economic levels they might have attained but for discrimination against their forebears. Greenawalt, supra n. 25, at 581-586. Another view of the \"compensation\" goal is that it serves as a form of reparation by the \"majority\" to a victimized group as a whole. B. Bittker, The Case for Black Reparations (1973). That justification for racial or ethnic preference has been subjected to much criticism. E. g., Greenawalt, supra n. 25, at 581; Posner, supra n. 25, at 16-17, and n. 33. Finally, it has been argued that ethnic preferences \"compensate\" the group by providing examples of success whom other members of the group will emulate, thereby advancing the group's interest and society's interest in encouraging new generations to overcome the barriers and frustrations of the past. Redish, supra n. 25, at 391. For purposes of analysis these subgoals need not be considered separately.\n\nRacial classifications in admissions conceivably could serve a fifth purpose, one which petitioner does not articulate: fair appraisal of each individual's academic promise in the light of some cultural bias in grading or testing procedures. To the extent that race and ethnic background were considered only to the extent of curing established inaccuracies in predicting academic performance, it might be argued that there is no \"preference\" at all. Nothing in this record, however, suggests either that any of the quantitative factors considered by the Medical School were culturally biased or that petitioner's special admissions program was formulated to correct for any such biases. Furthermore, if race or ethnic background were used solely to arrive at an unbiased prediction of academic success, the reservation of fixed numbers of seats would be inexplicable.\n\n[44]  MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN misconceive the scope of this Court's holdings under Title VII when they suggest that \"disparate impact\" alone is sufficient to establish a violation of that statute and, by analogy, other civil rights measures. See post, at 363-366, and n. 42. That this was not the meaning of Title VII was made quite clear in the seminal decision in this area, Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971):\n\n\"Discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what Congress has proscribed. What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification.\" Id., at 431 (emphasis added).\n\nThus, disparate impact is a basis for relief under Title VII only if the practice in question is not founded on \"business necessity,\" ibid., or lacks \"a manifest relationship to the employment in question,\" id., at 432. See also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 802-803, 805-806 (1973). Nothing in this recordas opposed to some of the general literature cited by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUNeven remotely suggests that the disparate impact of the general admissions program at Davis Medical School, resulting primarily from the sort of disparate test scores and grades set forth in n. 7, supra, is without educational justification.\n\nMoreover, the presumption in Griggsthat disparate impact without any showing of business justification established the existence of discrimination in violation of the statutewas based on legislative determinations, wholly absent here, that past discrimination had handicapped various minority groups to such an extent that disparate impact could be traced to identifiable instances of past discrimination:\n\n\"[Congress sought] to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other employees. Under the Act, practices, procedures, or tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot be maintained if they operate to `freeze' the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.\" Griggs, supra, at 429-430. See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, p. 26 (1963) (\"Testimony supporting the fact of discrimination in employment is overwhelming\"). See generally Vaas, Title VII: The Legislative History, 7 B. C. Ind. & Com. L. Rev. 431 (1966). The Court emphasized that \"the Act does not command that any person be hired simply because he was formerly the subject of discrimination, or because he is a member of a minority group.\" 401 U. S., at 430-431. Indeed,  703 (j) of the Act makes it clear that preferential treatment for an individual or minority group to correct an existing \"imbalance\" may not be required under Title VII. 42 U. S. C.  2000e-2 (j). Thus, Title VII principles support the proposition that findings of identified discrimination must precede the fashioning of remedial measures embodying racial classifications.\n\n[45]  For example, the University is unable to explain its selection of only the four favored groupsNegroes, Mexican-Americans, American Indians, and Asiansfor preferential treatment. The inclusion of the last group is especially curious in light of the substantial numbers of Asians admitted through the regular admissions process. See also n. 37, supra.\n\n[46]  The only evidence in the record with respect to such underservice is a newspaper article. Record 473.\n\n[47]  It is not clear that petitioner's two-track system, even if adopted throughout the country, would substantially increase representation of blacks in the medical profession. That is the finding of a recent study by Sleeth & Mishell, Black Under-Representation in United States Medical Schools, 297 New England J. of Med. 1146 (1977). Those authors maintain that the cause of black underrepresentation lies in the small size of the national pool of qualified black applicants. In their view, this problem is traceable to the poor premedical experiences of black under-graduates, and can be remedied effectively only by developing remedial programs for black students before they enter college.\n\n[48]  The president of Princeton University has described some of the benefits derived from a diverse student body:\n\n\"[A] great deal of learning occurs informally. It occurs through interactions among students of both sexes; of different races, religions, and backgrounds; who come from cities and rural areas, from various states and countries; who have a wide variety of interests, talents, and perspectives; and who are able, directly or indirectly, to learn from their differences and to stimulate one another to reexamine even their most deeply held assumptions about themselves and their world. As a wise graduate of ours observed in commenting on this aspect of the educational process, `People do not learn very much when they are surrounded only by the likes of themselves.'\n\n.....\n\n\"In the nature of things, it is hard to know how, and when, and even if, this informal `learning through diversity' actually occurs. It does not occur for everyone. For many, however, the unplanned, casual encounters with roommates, fellow sufferers in an organic chemistry class, student workers in the library, teammates on a basketball squad, or other participants in class affairs or student government can be subtle and yet powerful sources of improved understanding and personal growth.\" Bowen, Admissions and the Relevance of Race, Princeton Alumni Weekly 7, 9 (Sept. 26, 1977).\n\n[49]  Graduate admissions decisions, like those at the undergraduate level, are concerned with \"assessing the potential contributions to the society of each individual candidate following his or her graduationcontributions defined in the broadest way to include the doctor and the poet, the most active participant in business or government affairs and the keenest critic of all things organized, the solitary scholar and the concerned parent.\" Id., at 10.\n\n[50]  See Manning, The Pursuit of Fairness in Admissions to Higher Education, in Carnegie Council on Policy Studies in Higher Education, Selective Admissions in Higher Education 19, 57-59 (1977).\n\n[51]  The admissions program at Princeton has been described in similar terms:\n\n\"While race is not in and of itself a consideration in determining basic qualifications, and while there are obviously significant differences in background and experience among applicants of every race, in some situations race can be helpful information in enabling the admission officer to understand more fully what a particular candidate has accomplishedand against what odds. Similarly, such factors as family circumstances and previous educational opportunities may be relevant, either in conjunction with race or ethnic background (with which they may be associated) or on their own.\" Bowen, supra n. 48, at 8-9.\n\nFor an illuminating discussion of such flexible admissions systems, see Manning, supra n. 50, at 57-59.\n\n[52]  The denial to respondent of this right to individualized consideration without regard to his race is the principal evil of petitioner's special admissions program. Nowhere in the opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN is this denial even addressed.\n\n[53]  Universities, like the prosecutor in Swain, may make individualized decisions, in which ethnic background plays a part, under a presumption of legality and legitimate educational purpose. So long as the university proceeds on an individualized, case-by-case basis, there is no warrant for judicial interference in the academic process. If an applicant can establish that the institution does not adhere to a policy of individual comparisons, or can show that a systematic exclusion of certain groups results, the presumption of legality might be overcome, creating the necessity of proving legitimate educational purpose.\n\nThere also are strong policy reasons that correspond to the constitutional distinction between petitioner's preference program and one that assures a measure of competition among all applicants. Petitioner's program will be viewed as inherently unfair by the public generally as well as by applicants for admission to state universities. Fairness in individual competition for opportunities, especially those provided by the State, is a widely cherished American ethic. Indeed, in a broader sense, an underlying assumption of the rule of law is the worthiness of a system of justice based on fairness to the individual. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter declared in another connection, \"[j]ustice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\" Offutt v. United States, 348 U. S. 11, 14 (1954).\n\n[54]  There is no occasion for remanding the case to permit petitioner to reconstruct what might have happened if it had been operating the type of program described as legitimate in Part V, supra. Cf. Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 284-287 (1977). In Mt. Healthy, there was considerable doubt whether protected First Amendment activity had been the \"but for\" cause of Doyle's protested discharge. Here, in contrast, there is no question as to the sole reason for respondent's rejectionpurposeful racial discrimination in the form of the special admissions program. Having injured respondent solely on the basis of an unlawful classification, petitioner cannot now hypothesize that it might have\n\nemployed lawful means of achieving the same result. See Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U. S., at 265-266. No one can say howor even ifpetitioner would have operated its admissions process if it had known that legitimate alternatives were available. Nor is there a record revealing that legitimate alternative grounds for the decision existed, as there was in Mt. Healthy. In sum, a remand would result in fictitious recasting of past conduct.\n\n[55]  This statement appears in the Appendix to the Brief for Columbia University, Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of Pennsylvania, as Amici Curiae.BRENNAN CONCURRENCE/DISSENT FOOTNOTES[1]  We also agree with MR. JUSTICE POWELL that a plan like the \"Harvard\" plan, see ante, at 316-318, is constitutional under our approach, at least so long as the use of race to achieve an integrated student body is necessitated by the lingering effects of past discrimination.\n\n[2]  See Plessy v.

S. C.  2000d.\n\n[8]  MR. JUSTICE WHITE believes we should address the private-right-of-action issue. Accordingly, he has filed a separate opinion stating his view that there is no private right of action under Title VI. See post, p. 379.\n\n[9]  \"Simple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers of all races contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes or results in racial discrimination. Direct discrimination by Federal, State or local governments is prohibited by the Constitution. But indirect discrimination, through the use of Federal funds, is just as invidious; and it should not be necessary to resort to the courts to prevent each individual violation. Congress and the Executive have their responsibilities to uphold the Constitution also . . . .\n\n\"Many statutes providing Federal financial assistance, however, define with such precision both the Administrator's role and the conditions upon which specified amounts shall be given to designated recipients that the amount of administrative discretion remainingwhich might be used to withhold funds if discrimination were not endedis at best questionable. No administrator has the unlimited authority to invoke the Constitution in opposition to the mandate of the Congress. Nor would it always be helpful to require unconditionallyas is often proposedthe withdrawal of all Federal funds from programs urgently needed by Negroes as well as whites; for this may only penalize those who least deserve it without ending discrimination.\n\n\"Instead of permitting this issue to become a political device often exploited by those opposed to social or economic progress, it would be better at this time to pass a single comprehensive provision making it clear that the Federal Government is not required, under any statute, to furnish any kind of financial assistanceby way of grant, loan, contract, guaranty, insurance, or otherwiseto any program or activity in which racial discrimination occurs. This would not permit the Federal Government to cut off all Federal aid of all kinds as a means of punishing an area for the discrimination occurring thereinbut it would clarify the authority of any administrator with respect to Federal funds or financial assistance and discriminatory practices.\" 109 Cong. Rec. 11161 (1963).\n\n[10]  See, e. g., 110 Cong. Rec. 2732 (1964) (Rep. Dawson); id., at 2481-2482 (Rep. Ryan); id., at 2766 (Rep. Matsunaga); id., at 2595 (Rep. Donahue).\n\n[11]  There is also language in 42 U. S. C.  2000d-5, enacted in 1966, which supports the conclusion that Title VI's standard is that of the Constitution. Section 2000d-5 provides that \"for the purpose of determining whether a local educational agency is in compliance with [Title VI], compliance by such agency with a final order or judgment of a Federal court for the desegregation of the school or school system operated by such agency shall be deemed to be compliance with [Title VI], insofar as the matters covered in the order or judgment are concerned.\" This provision was clearly intended to avoid subjecting local educational agencies simultaneously to the jurisdiction of the federal courts and the federal administrative agencies in connection with the imposition of remedial measures designed to end school segregation. Its inclusion reflects the congressional judgment that the requirements imposed by Title VI are identical to those imposed by the Constitution as interpreted by the federal courts.\n\n[12]  As has already been seen, the proponents of Title VI in the House were motivated by the identical concern. See remarks of Representative Celler (110 Cong. Rec. 2467 (1964)); Representative Ryan (id., at 1643, 2481-2482); H. R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, Additional Views of Seven Representatives 24-25 (1963).\n\n[13]  See separate opinion of MR. JUSTICE WHITE, post, at 382-383, n. 2.\n\n[14]  These remarks also reflect the expectations of Title VI's proponents that the application of the Constitution to the conduct at the core of their concernthe segregation of Negroes in federally funded programs and their exclusion from the full benefits of such programswas clear. See supra, at 333-336; infra, at 340-342, n. 17.\n\n[15]  Testimony of Attorney General Kennedy in Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on S. 1731 and S. 1750, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 398-399 (1963).\n\n[16]  See, e. g., 110 Cong. Rec. 6544, 13820 (1964) (Sen. Humphrey); id., at 6050 (Sen. Javits); id., at 12677 (Sen. Allott).\n\n[17]  Our Brother STEVENS finds support for a colorblind theory of Title VI in its legislative history, but his interpretation gives undue weight to a few isolated passages from among the thousands of pages of the legislative history of Title VI. See id., at 6547 (Sen. Humphrey); id., at 6047, 7055 (Sen. Pastore); id., at 12675 (Sen. Allott); id., at 6561 (Sen. Kuchel). These fragmentary comments fall far short of supporting a congressional intent to prohibit a racially conscious admissions program designed to assist those who are likely to have suffered injuries from the effects of past discrimination. In the first place, these statements must be read in the context in which they were made. The concern of the speakers was far removed from the incidental injuries which may be inflicted upon non-minorities by the use of racial preferences. It was rather with the evil of the segregation of Negroes in federally financed programs and, in some cases, their arbitrary exclusion on account of race from the benefits of such programs. Indeed, in this context there can be no doubt that the Fourteenth Amendment does command color blindness and forbids the use of racial criteria. No consideration was given by these legislators, however, to the permissibility of racial preference designed to redress the effects of injuries suffered as a result of one's color. Significantly one of the legislators, Senator Pastore, and perhaps also Senator Kuchel, who described Title VI as proscribing decisionmaking based upon skin color, also made it clear that Title VI does not outlaw the use of racial criteria in all circumstances. See supra, at 339-340; 110 Cong. Rec. 6562 (1964). See also id., at 2494 (Rep. Celler). Moreover, there are many statements in the legislative history explicitly indicating that Congress intended neither to require nor to prohibit the remedial use of racial preferences where not otherwise required or prohibited by the Constitution. Representative MacGregor addressed directly the problem of preferential treatment:\n\n\"Your mail and mine, your contacts and mine with our constituents, indicates a great degree of misunderstanding about this bill. People complain about racial `balancing' in the public schools, about open occupancy in housing, about preferential treatment or quotas in employment. There is a mistaken belief that Congress is legislating in these areas in this bill. When we drafted this bill we excluded these issues largely because the problems raised by these controversial questions are more properly handled at a governmental level close to the American people and by communities and individuals themselves. The Senate has spelled out our intentions more specifically.\" Id., at 15893.\n\nOther legislators explained that the achievement of racial balance in elementary and secondary schools where there had been no segregation by law was not compelled by Title VI but was rather left to the judgment of state and local communities. See, e. g., id., at 10920 (Sen. Javits); id., at 5807, 5266 (Sen. Keating); id., at 13821 (Sens. Humphrey and Saltonstall). See also, id., at 6562 (Sen. Kuchel); id., at 13695 (Sen. Pastore).\n\nMuch the same can be said of the scattered remarks to be found in the legislative history of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.  2000e et seq. (1970 ed. and Supp. V), which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race in terms somewhat similar to those contained in Title VI, see 42 U. S. C.  2000e-2 (a) (1) (unlawful \"to fail or refuse to hire\" any applicant \"because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin . . . .\"), to the effect that any deliberate attempt by an employer to maintain a racial balance is not required by the statute and might in fact violate it. See, e. g., 110 Cong. Rec. 7214 (1964) (Sens. Clark and Case); id., at 6549 (Sen. Humphrey); id., at 2560 (Rep. Goodell). Once again, there is no indication that Congress intended to bar the voluntary use of racial preferences to assist minorities to surmount the obstacles imposed by the remnants of past discrimination. Even assuming that Title VII prohibits employers from deliberately maintaining a particular racial composition in their work force as an end in itself, this does not imply, in the absence of any consideration of the question, that Congress intended to bar the use of racial preferences as a tool for achieving the objective of remedying past discrimination or other compelling ends. The former may well be contrary to the requirements of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment (where state action is involved), while the latter presents very different constitutional considerations. Indeed, as discussed infra, at 353, this Court has construed Title VII as requiring the use of racial preferences for the purpose of hiring and advancing those who have been adversely affected by past discriminatory employment practices, even at the expense of other employees innocent of discrimination. Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747, 767-768 (1976). Although Title VII clearly does not require employers to take action to remedy the disadvantages imposed upon racial minorities by hands other than their own, such an objective is perfectly consistent with the remedial goals of the statute. See id., at 762-770; Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 418 (1975). There is no more indication in the legislative history of Title VII than in that of Title VI that Congress desired to prohibit such affirmative action to the extent that it is permitted by the Constitution, yet judicial decisions as well as subsequent executive and congressional action clearly establish that Title VII does not forbid race-conscious remedial action. See infra, at 353-355, and n. 28.\n\n[18]  HEW has stated that the purpose of these regulations is \"to specify that affirmative steps to make services more equitably available are not prohibited and that such steps are required when necessary to overcome the consequences of prior discrimination.\" 36 Fed. Reg. 23494 (1971). Other federal agencies which provide financial assistance pursuant to Title VI have adopted similar regulations. See Supplemental Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16 n. 14.\n\n[19]  Moreover, the President has delegated to the Attorney General responsibility for coordinating the enforcement of Title VI by federal departments and agencies and has directed him to \"assist the departments and agencies in accomplishing effective implementation.\" Exec. Order No. 11764, 3 CFR 849 (1971-1975 Comp.). Accordingly, the views of the Solicitor General, as well as those of HEW, that the use of racial preferences for remedial purposes is consistent with Title VI are entitled to considerable respect.\n\n[20]  HEW administers at least two explicitly race-conscious programs. Details concerning them may be found in the Office of Management and Budget, 1977 Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance 205-206, 401-402. The first program, No. 13.375, \"Minority Biomedical Support,\" has as its objectives:\n\n\"To increase the number of ethnic minority faculty, students, and investigators engaged in biomedical research. To broaden the opportunities for participation in biomedical research of ethnic minority faculty, students, and investigators by providing support for biomedical research programs at eligible institutions.\"\n\nEligibility for grants under this program is limited to (1) four-year colleges, universities, and health professional schools with over 50% minority enrollments; (2) four-year institutions with significant but not necessarily over 50% minority enrollment provided they have a history of encouragement and assistance to minorities; (3) two-year colleges with 50% minority enrollment; and (4) American Indian Tribal Councils. Grants made pursuant to this program are estimated to total $9,711,000 for 1977.\n\nThe second program, No. 13.880, entitled \"Minority Access To Research Careers,\" has as its objective to \"assist minority institutions to train greater numbers of scientists and teachers in health related fields.\" Grants under this program are made directly to individuals and to institutions for the purpose of enabling them to make grants to individuals.\n\n[21]  H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-538, p. 22 (1977); 123 Cong. Rec. 26188 (1977). See H. J. Res. 662, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977); Pub. L. 95-205, 91 Stat. 1460.\n\n[22]  91 Stat. 117, 42 U. S. C.  6705 (f) (2) (1976 ed.).\n\n[23]  123 Cong. Rec. 7156 (1977); id., at 5327-5330.\n\n[24]  See id., at 7156 (Sen. Brooke).\n\n[25]  In addition to the enactment of the 10% quota provision discussed supra, Congress has also passed other Acts mandating race-conscious measures to overcome disadvantages experienced by racial minorities. Although these statutes have less direct bearing upon the meaning of Title VI, they do demonstrate that Congress believes race-conscious remedial measures to be both permissible and desirable under at least some circumstances. This in turn undercuts the likelihood that Congress intended to limit voluntary efforts to implement similar measures. For example,  7 (a) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act, 1977, provides:\n\n\"The Director of the National Science Foundation shall initiate an intensive search for qualified women, members of minority groups, and handicapped individuals to fill executive level positions in the National Science Foundation. In carrying out the requirement of this subsection, the Director shall work closely with organizations which have been active in seeking greater recognition and utilization of the scientific and technical capabilities of minorities, women, and handicapped individuals. The Director shall improve the representation of minorities, women, and handicapped individuals on advisory committees, review panels, and all other mechanisms by which the scientific community provides assistance to the Foundation.\" 90 Stat. 2056, note following 42 U. S. C.  1873 (1976 ed.). Perhaps more importantly, the Act also authorizes the funding of Minority Centers for Graduate Education. Section 7 (c) (2) of the Act, 90 Stat. 2056, requires that these Centers:\n\n\"(A) have substantial minority student enrollment;\n\n\"(B) are geographically located near minority population centers;\n\n\"(C) demonstrate a commitment to encouraging and assisting minority students, researchers, and faculty;\n\n.....\n\n\"(F) will serve as a regional resource in science and engineering for the minority community which the Center is designed to serve; and\n\n\"(G) will develop joint educational programs with nearby undergraduate institutions of higher education which have a substantial minority student enrollment.\"\n\nOnce again, there is no indication in the legislative history of this Act or elsewhere that Congress saw any inconsistency between the race-conscious nature of such legislation and the meaning of Title VI. And, once again, it is unlikely in the extreme that a Congress which believed that it had commanded recipients of federal funds to be absolutely colorblind would itself expend federal funds in such a race-conscious manner. See also the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, 45 U. S. C.  801 et seq. (1976 ed.), 49 U. S. C.  1657a et seq. (1976 ed.); the Emergency School Aid Act, 20 U. S. C.  1601 et seq. (1976 ed.).\n\n[26]  Cf. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971).\n\n[27]  Ibid.; Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405 (1975).\n\n[28]  Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747 (1976); Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324 (1977). Executive, judicial, and congressional action subsequent to the passage of Title VII conclusively established that the Title did not bar the remedial use of race. Prior to the 1972 amendments to Title VII (Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 103) a number of Courts of Appeals approved race-conscious action to remedy the effects of employment discrimination. See, e. g., Heat & Frost Insulators & Asbestos Workers v. Vogler, 407 F. 2d 1047 (CA5 1969); United States v. Electrical Workers, 428 F. 2d 144, 149-150 (CA6), cert. denied, 400 U. S. 943 (1970); United States v. Sheetmetal Workers, 416 F. 2d 123 (CA8 1969). In 1965, the President issued Exec. Order No. 11246, 3 CFR 339 (1964-1965 Comp.), which as amended by Exec. Order No. 11375, 3 CFR 684 (1966-1970 Comp.), required federal contractors to take affirmative action to remedy the disproportionately low employment of racial minorities in the construction industry. The Attorney General issued an opinion concluding that the race consciousness required by Exec. Order No. 11246 did not conflict with Title VII:\n\n\"It is not correct to say that Title VII prohibits employers from making race or national origin a factor for consideration at any stage in the process of obtaining employees. The legal definition of discrimination is an evolving one, but it is now well recognized in judicial opinions that the obligation of nondiscrimination, whether imposed by statute or by the Constitution, does not require and, in some circumstances, may not permit obliviousness or indifference to the racial consequences of alternative courses of action which involve the application of outwardly neutral criteria.\" 42 Op. Atty. Gen. 405, 411 (1969).\n\nThe federal courts agreed. See, e. g., Contractors Assn. of Eastern Pa. v. Secretary of Labor, 442 F. 2d 159 (CA3), cert. denied, 404 U. S. 854 (1971) (which also held, 442 F. 2d, at 173, that race-conscious affirmative action was permissible under Title VI); Southern Illinois Builders Assn. v. Ogilvie, 471 F. 2d 680 (CA7 1972). Moreover, Congress, in enacting the 1972 amendments to Title VII, explicitly considered and rejected proposals to alter Exec. Order No. 11246 and the prevailing judicial interpretations of Title VII as permitting, and in some circumstances requiring, race-conscious action. See Comment, The Philadelphia Plan: A Study in the Dynamics of Executive Power, 39 U. Chi. L. Rev. 723, 747-757 (1972). The section-by-section analysis of the 1972 amendments to Title VII undertaken by the Conference Committee Report on H. R. 1746 reveals a resolve to accept the then (as now) prevailing judicial interpretations of the scope of Title VII:\n\n\"In any area where the new law does not address itself, or in any areas where a specific contrary intent is not indicated, it was assumed that the present case law as developed by the courts would continue to govern the applicability and construction of Title VII.\" Legislative History of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, p. 1844 (Comm. Print 1972).\n\n[29]  United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144 (1977). See also id., at 167-168 (opinion of WHITE, J.).\n\n[30]  We do not pause to debate whether our cases establish a \"two-tier\" analysis, a \"sliding scale\" analysis, or something else altogether. It is enough for present purposes that strict scrutiny is applied at least in some cases.\n\n[31]  Of course, the fact that whites constitute a political majority in our Nation does not necessarily mean that active judicial scrutiny of racial classifications that disadvantage whites is inappropriate. Cf. Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U. S. 482, 499-500 (1977); id., at 501 (MARSHALL, J., concurring).\n\n[32]  \"[T]he conclusion cannot be resisted, that no reason for [the refusal to issue permits to Chinese] exists except hostility to the race and nationality to which the petitioners belong . . . . The discrimination is, therefore, illegal . . . .\"\n\n[33]  Indeed, even in Plessy v. Ferguson the Court recognized that a classification by race that presumed one race to be inferior to another would have to be condemned. See 163 U. S., at 544-551.\n\n[34]  Paradoxically, petitioner's argument is supported by the cases generally thought to establish the \"strict scrutiny\" standard in race cases, Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81 (1943), and Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944). In Hirabayashi, for example, the Court, responding to a claim that a racial classification was rational, sustained a racial classification solely on the basis of a conclusion in the double negative that it could not say that facts which might have been available \"could afford no ground for differentiating citizens of Japanese ancestry from other groups in the United States.\" 320 U. S., at 101. A similar mode of analysis was followed in Korematsu, see 323 U. S., at 224, even though the Court stated there that racial classifications were \"immediately suspect\" and should be subject to \"the most rigid scrutiny.\" Id., at 216.\n\n[35]  We disagree with our Brother POWELL's suggestion, ante, at 303, that the presence of \"rival groups which can claim that they, too, are entitled to preferential treatment\" distinguishes the gender cases or is relevant to the question of scope of judicial review of race classifications. We are not asked to determine whether groups other than those favored by the Davis program should similarly be favored. All we are asked to do is to pronounce the constitutionality of what Davis has done.\n\nBut, were we asked to decide whether any given rival groupGerman-Americans for examplemust constitutionally be accorded preferential treatment, we do have a \"principled basis,\" ante, at 296, for deciding this question, one that is well established in our cases: The Davis program expressly sets out four classes which receive preferred status. Ante, at 274. The program clearly distinguishes whites, but one cannot reason from this a conclusion that German-Americans, as a national group, are singled out for invidious treatment. And even if the Davis program had a differential impact on German-Americans, they would have no constitutional claim unless they could prove that Davis intended invidiously to discriminate against German-Americans. See Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 264-265 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 238-241 (1976). If this could not be shown, then \"the principle that calls for the closest scrutiny of distinctions in laws denying fundamental rights . . . is inapplicable,\" Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641, 657 (1966), and the only question is whether it was rational for Davis to conclude that the groups it preferred had a greater claim to compensation than the groups it excluded. See ibid.; San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 38-39 (1973) (applying Katzenbach test to state action intended to remove discrimination in educational opportunity). Thus, claims of rival groups, although they may create thorny political problems, create relatively simple problems for the courts.\n\n[36]  Gunther, The Supreme Court, 1971 TermForeword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for a Newer Equal Protection, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 8 (1972).\n\n[37]  In Albemarle, we approved \"differential validation\" of employment tests. See 422 U. S., at 435. That procedure requires that an employer must ensure that a test score of, for example, 50 for a minority job applicant means the same thing as a score of 50 for a nonminority applicant. By implication, were it determined that a test score of 50 for a minority corresponded in \"potential for employment\" to a 60 for whites, the test could not be used consistently with Title VII unless the employer hired minorities with scores of 50 even though he might not hire nonminority applicants with scores above 50 but below 60. Thus, it is clear that employers, to ensure equal opportunity, may have to adopt race-conscious hiring practices.\n\n[38]  Indeed, Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 put great emphasis on voluntarism in remedial action. See supra, at 336-338. And, significantly, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has recently proposed guidelines authorizing employers to adopt racial preferences as a remedial measure where they have a reasonable basis for believing that they might otherwise be held in violation of Title VII. See 42 Fed. Reg. 64826 (1977).\n\n[39]  \"[T]he [Voting Rights] Act's prohibition . . . is not dependent upon proving past unconstitutional apportionments . . . .\"\n\n[40]  \"[T]he State is [not] powerless to minimize the consequences of racial discrimination by voters when it is regularly practiced at the polls.\"\n\n[41]  Our cases cannot be distinguished by suggesting, as our Brother POWELL does, that in none of them was anyone deprived of \"the relevant benefit.\" Ante, at 304. Our school cases have deprived whites of the neighborhood school of their choice; our Title VII cases have deprived nondiscriminating employees of their settled seniority expectations; and UJO deprived the Hassidim of bloc-voting strength. Each of these injuries was constitutionally cognizable as is respondent's here.\n\n[42]  We do not understand MR. JUSTICE POWELL to disagree that providing a remedy for past racial prejudice can constitute a compelling purpose sufficient to meet strict scrutiny. See ante, at 305. Yet, because petitioner is a corporation administering a university, he would not allow it to exercise such power in the absence of \"judicial, legislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or statutory violations.\" Ante, at 307. While we agree that reversal in this case would follow a fortiori had Davis been guilty of invidious racial discrimination or if a federal statute mandated that universities refrain from applying any admissions policy that had a disparate and unjustified racial impact, see, e. g., McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U. S. 39 (1971); Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747 (1976), we do not think it of constitutional significance that Davis has not been so adjudged.\n\nGenerally, the manner in which a State chooses to delegate governmental functions is for it to decide. Cf. Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 256 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result). California, by constitutional provision, has chosen to place authority over the operation of the University of California in the Board of Regents. See Cal. Const., Art. 9,  9 (a). Control over the University is to be found not in the legislature, but rather in the Regents who have been vested with full legislative (including policymaking), administrative, and adjudicative powers by the citizens of California. See ibid.; Ishimatsu v. Regents, 266 Cal. App. 2d 854, 863-864, 72 Cal. Rptr. 756, 762-763 (1968); Goldberg v. Regents, 248 Cal. App. 2d 867, 874, 57 Cal. Rptr. 463, 468 (1967); 30 Op. Cal. Atty. Gen. 162, 166 (1957) (\"The Regents, not the legislature, have the general rule-making or policy-making power in regard to the University\"). This is certainly a permissible choice, see Sweezy, supra, and we, unlike our Brother POWELL, find nothing in the Equal Protection Clause that requires us to depart from established principle by limiting the scope of power the Regents may exercise more narrowly than the powers that may constitutionally be wielded by the Assembly.\n\nBecause the Regents can exercise plenary legislative and administrative power, it elevates form over substance to insist that Davis could not use race-conscious remedial programs until it had been adjudged in violation of the Constitution or an antidiscrimination statute. For, if the Equal Protection Clause required such a violation as a predicate, the Regents could simply have promulgated a regulation prohibiting disparate treatment not justified by the need to admit only qualified students, and could have declared Davis to have been in violation of such a regulation on the basis of the exclusionary effect of the admissions policy applied during the first two years of its operation. See infra, at 370.\n\n[43]  \"Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 93 (1976) (per curiam), citing Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 638 n. 2 (1975).\n\n[44]  Railway Mail Assn. held that a state statute forbidding racial discrimination by certain labor organizations did not abridge the Association's due process rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment because that result \"would be a distortion of the policy manifested in that amendment, which was adopted to prevent state legislation designed to perpetuate discrimination on the basis of race or color.\" 326 U. S., at 94. That case thus established the principle that a State voluntarily could go beyond what the Fourteenth Amendment required in eliminating private racial discrimination.\n\n[45]  According to 89 schools responding to a questionnaire sent to 112 medical schools (all of the then-accredited medical schools in the United States except Howard and Meharry), substantial efforts to admit minority students did not begin until 1968. That year was the earliest year of involvement for 34% of the schools; an additional 66% became involved during the years 1969 to 1973. See C. Odegaard, Minorities in Medicine: From Receptive Passivity to Positive Action, 1966-1976, p. 19 (1977) (hereinafter Odegaard). These efforts were reflected in a significant increase in the percentage of minority M. D. graduates. The number of American Negro graduates increased from 2.2% in 1970 to 3.3% in 1973 and 5.0% in 1975. Significant percentage increases in the number of Mexican-American, American Indian, and mainland Puerto Rican graduates were also recorded during those years. Id., at 40.\n\nThe statistical information cited in this and the following notes was compiled by Government officials or medical educators, and has been brought to our attention in many of the briefs. Neither the parties nor the amici challenge the validity of the statistics alluded to in our discussion.\n\n[46]  D. Reitzes, Negroes and Medicine, pp. xxvii, 3 (1958).\n\n[47]  Between 1955 and 1964, for example, the percentage of Negro physicians graduated in the United States who were trained at these schools ranged from 69.0% to 75.8%.

Wollenberg, All Deliberate Speed: Segregation and Exclusion in California Schools, 1855-1975, pp. 136-177 (1976).\n\n[54]  For example, over 40% of American-born Negro males aged 20 to 24 residing in California in 1970 were born in the South, and the statistic for females was over 48%. These statistics were computed from data contained in Census, supra n. 49, pt. 6, California, Tables 139, 140.\n\n[55]  See, e. g., O'Neil, Preferential Admissions: Equalizing the Access of Minority Groups to Higher Education, 80 Yale L. J. 699, 729-731 (1971).\n\n[56]  Congress and the Executive have also adopted a series of race-conscious programs, each predicated on an understanding that equal opportunity cannot be achieved by neutrality because of the effects of past and present discrimination. See supra, at 348-349.\n\n[57]  Negroes and Chicanos alone constitute approximately 22% of California's population. This percentage was computed from data contained in Census, supra n. 49, pt. 6, California, sec. 1, 6-4, and Table 139.\n\n[58]  The constitutionality of the special admissions program is buttressed by its restriction to only 16% of the positions in the Medical School, a percentage less than that of the minority population in California, see ibid., and to those minority applicants deemed qualified for admission and deemed likely to contribute to the Medical School and the medical profession. Record 67. This is consistent with the goal of putting minority applicants in the position they would have been in if not for the evil of racial discrimination. Accordingly, this case does not raise the question whether even a remedial use of race would be unconstitutional if it admitted unqualified minority applicants in preference to qualified applicants or admitted, as a result of preferential consideration, racial minorities in numbers significantly in excess of their proportional representation in the relevant population. Such programs might well be inadequately justified by the legitimate remedial objectives. Our allusion to the proportional percentage of minorities in the population of the State administering the program is not intended to establish either that figure or that population universe as a constitutional benchmark. In this case, even respondent, as we understand him, does not argue that, if the special admissions program is otherwise constitutional, the allotment of 16 places in each entering class for special admittees is unconstitutionally high.\n\n[59]  See Census, supra n. 49, Sources and Structure of Family Income, pp. 1-12.\n\n[60]  This percentage was computed from data presented in B. Waldman, Economic and Racial Disadvantage as Reflected in Traditional Medical School Selection Factors: A Study of 1976 Applicants to U. S. Medical Schools 34 (Table A-15), 42 (Table A-23) (Association of American Medical Colleges 1977).\n\n[61]  This figure was computed from data contained in Census, supra n. 49, pt. 1, United States Summary, Table 209.\n\n[62]  See Waldman, supra n. 60, at 10-14 (Figures 1-5).\n\n[63]  The excluded white applicant, despite MR. JUSTICE POWELL's contention to the contrary, ante, at 318 n. 52, receives no more or less \"individualized consideration\" under our approach than under his.WHITE CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES[1]  It is also clear from Griffin that \"lack of jurisdiction . . . touching the subject matter of the litigation cannot be waived by the parties . . . .\" 303 U. S., at 229. See also Mount Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 278 (1977); Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152 (1908); Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 382 (1884).\n\nIn Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563 (1974), we did adjudicate a Title VI claim brought by a class of individuals. But the existence of a private cause of action was not at issue. In addition, the understanding of MR. JUSTICE STEWART'S concurring opinion, which observed that standing was not being contested, was that the standing alleged by petitioners was as third-party beneficiaries of the funding contract between the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the San Francisco United School District, a theory not alleged by the present respondent. Id., at 571 n. 2. Furthermore, the plaintiffs in Lau alleged jurisdiction under 42 U. S. C.  1983 rather than directly under the provisions of Title VI, as does the plaintiff in this case. Although the Court undoubtedly had an obligation to consider the jurisdictional question, this is surely not the first instance in which the Court has bypassed a jurisdictional problem not presented by the parties. Certainly the Court's silence on the jurisdictional question, when considered in the context of the indifference of the litigants to it and the fact that jurisdiction was alleged under  1983, does not foreclose a reasoned conclusion that Title VI affords no private cause of action.\n\n[2]  \"Yet, before that principle [that `Federal funds are not to be used to support racial discrimination'] is implemented to the detriment of any person, agency, or State, regulations giving notice of what conduct is required must be drawn up by the agency administering the program. . . . Before such regulations become effective, they must be submitted to and approved by the President.\n\n\"Once having become effective, there is still a long road to travel before any sanction whatsoever is imposed. Formal action to compel compliance can only take place after the following has occurred: first, there must be an unsuccessful attempt to obtain voluntary compliance; second, there must be an administrative hearing; third, a written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action must be filed with the appropriate committees of the House and Senate; and fourth, 30 days must have elapsed between such filing and the action denying benefits under a Federal program. Finally, even that action is by no means final because it is subject to judicial review and can be further postponed by judicial action granting temporary relief pending review in order to avoid irreparable injury. It would be difficult indeed to concoct any additional safeguards to incorporate in such a procedure.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 6749 (1964) (Sen. Moss).\n\n\"[T]he authority to cut off funds is hedged about with a number of procedural restrictions. . . . [There follow details of the preliminary steps.]\n\n\"In short, title VI is a reasonable, moderate, cautious, carefully worked out solution to a situation that clearly calls for legislative action.\" Id., at 6544 (Sen. Humphrey). \"Actually, no action whatsoever can be taken against anyone until the Federal agency involved has advised the appropriate person of his failure to comply with nondiscrimination requirements and until voluntary efforts to secure compliance have failed.\" Id., at 1519 (Rep. Celler) (emphasis added). See also remarks of Sen. Ribicoff (id., at 7066-7067); Sen. Proxmire (id., at 8345); Sen. Kuchel (id., at 6562). These safeguards were incorporated into 42 U. S. C.  2000d-1.\n\n[3]  This Court has never held that the mere receipt of federal or state funds is sufficient to make the recipient a federal or state actor. In Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U. S. 455 (1973), private schools that received state aid were held subject to the Fourteenth Amendment's ban on discrimination, but the Court's test required \"tangible financial aid\" with a \"significant tendency to facilitate, reinforce, and support private discrimination.\" Id., at 466. The mandate of Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U. S. 715, 722 (1961), to sift facts and weigh circumstances of governmental support in each case to determine whether private or state action was involved, has not been abandoned for an automatic rule based on receipt of funds.\n\nContemporaneous with the congressional debates on the Civil Rights Act was this Court's decision in Griffin v. School Board, 377 U. S. 218 (1964). Tuition grants and tax concessions were provided for parents of students in private schools, which discriminated racially. The Court found sufficient state action, but carefully limited its holding to the circumstances presented: \"[C]losing the Prince Edward schools and meanwhile contributing to the support of the private segregated white schools that took their place denied petitioners the equal protection of the laws.\" Id., at 232.\n\nHence, neither at the time of the enactment of Title VI, nor at the present time to the extent this Court has spoken, has mere receipt of state funds created state action. Moreover, Simkins has not met with universal approval among the United States Courts of Appeals. See cases cited in Greco v. Orange Memorial Hospital Corp., 423 U. S. 1000, 1004 (1975) (WHITE, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).\n\n[4]  \"Nowhere in this section do you find a comparable right of legal action for a person who feels he has been denied his rights to participate in the benefits of Federal funds. Nowhere. Only those who have been cut off can go to court and present their claim.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 2467 (1964) (Rep. Gill).\n\n\"[A] good case could be made that a remedy is provided for the State or local official who is practicing discrimination, but none is provided for the victim of the discrimination.\" Id., at 6562 (Sen. Kuchel).\n\n\"Parenthetically, while we favored the inclusion of the right to sue on the part of the agency, the State, or the facility which was deprived of Federal funds, we also favored the inclusion of a provision granting the right to sue to the person suffering from discrimination. This was not included in the bill. However, both the Senator from Connecticut and I are grateful that our other suggestions were adopted by the Justice Department.\" Id., at 7065 (Sen. Keating).\n\n[5]  Ibid.\n\n[6]  As Senator Ribicoff stated: \"Sometimes those eligible for Federal assistance may elect to reject such aid, unwilling to agree to a nondiscrimination requirement. If they choose that course, the responsibility is theirs.\" Id., at 7067.\n\n[7]  I also join Parts I, III-A, and V-C of MR. JUSTICE POWELL'S opinion.MARSHALL CONCURRENCE/DISSENT FOOTNOTES[1]  The history recounted here is perhaps too well known to require documentation.

See opinion of JUSTICES BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, ante, at 324-325. It is hardly necessary to state that only a majority can speak for the Court or determine what is the \"central meaning\" of any judgment of the Court.\n\n[2]  The judgment first entered by the trial court read, in its entirety, as follows:\n\n\"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED:\n\n\"1. Defendant, the Regents of the University of California, have judgment against plaintiff, Allan Bakke, denying the mandatory injunction requested by plaintiff ordering his admission to the University of California at Davis Medical School;\n\n\"2. That plaintiff is entitled to have his application for admission to the medical school considered without regard to his race or the race of any other applicant, and defendants are hereby restrained and enjoined from considering plaintiff's race or the race of any other applicant in passing upon his application for admission;\n\n\"3. Cross-defendant Allan Bakke have judgment against cross-complainant, the Regents of the University of California, declaring that the special admissions program at the University of California at Davis Medical School violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Article 1, Section 21 of the California Constitution, and the Federal Civil Rights Act [42 U. S. C.  2000d];\n\n\"4. That plaintiff have and recover his court costs incurred herein in the sum of $217.35.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a.\n\n[3]  In paragraph 2 the trial court ordered that \"plaintiff [Bakke] is entitled to have his application for admission to the medical school considered without regard to his race or the race of any other applicant, and defendants are hereby restrained and enjoined from considering plaintiff's race or the race of any other applicant in passing upon his application for admission.\" See n. 2, supra (emphasis added). The only way in which this order can be broadly read as prohibiting any use of race in the admissions process, apart from Bakke's application, is if the final \"his\" refers to \"any other applicant.\" But the consistent use of the pronoun throughout the paragraph to refer to Bakke makes such a reading entirely unpersuasive, as does the failure of the trial court to suggest that it was issuing relief to applicants who were not parties to the suit.\n\n[4]  Appendix B to Application for Stay A19-A20.\n\n[5]  18 Cal. 3d 34, 64, 553 P. 2d 1152, 1172 (1976). The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of California affirms only paragraph 3 of the trial court's judgment. The Supreme Court's judgment reads as follows:\n\n\"IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED by the Court that the judgment of the Superior Court[,] County of Yolo[,] in the above-entitled cause, is hereby affirmed insofar as it determines that the special admission program is invalid; the judgment is reversed insofar as it denies Bakke an injunction ordering that he be admitted to the University, and the trial court is directed to enter judgment ordering Bakke to be admitted.\n\n\"Bakke shall recover his costs on these appeals.\"\n\n[6]  \"This Court . . . reviews judgments, not statements in opinions.\" Black v. Cutter Laboratories, 351 U. S. 292, 297.\n\n[7]  \"From Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409, to Alma Motor Co. v. Timken-Detroit Axle Co. [,329 U. S. 129,] and the Hatch Act case [United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75] decided this term, this Court has followed a policy of strict necessity in disposing of constitutional issues. The earliest exemplifications, too well known for repeating the history here, arose in the Court's refusal to render advisory opinions and in applications of the related jurisdictional policy drawn from the case and controversy limitation. U. S. Const., Art. III. . . .\n\n\"The policy, however, has not been limited to jurisdictional determinations. For, in addition, `the Court [has] developed, for its own governance in the cases confessedly within its jurisdiction, a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision.' Thus, as those rules were listed in support of the statement quoted, constitutional issues affecting legislation will not be determined in friendly, nonadversary proceedings; in advance of the necessity of deciding them; in broader terms than are required by the precise facts to which the ruling is to be applied; if the record presents some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of; at the instance of one who fails to show that he is injured by the statute's operation, or who has availed himself of its benefits; or if a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\" Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U. S. 549, 568-569 (footnotes omitted). See also Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346-348 (Brandeis, J., concurring).\n\n[8]  The doctrine reflects both our respect for the Constitution as an enduring set of principles and the deference we owe to the Legislative and Executive Branches of Government in developing solutions to complex social problems. See A. Bickel, The Least Dangerous Branch 131 (1962).\n\n[9]  Record 29.\n\n[10]  H. R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 18 (1963).\n\n[11]  It is apparent from the legislative history that the immediate object of Title VI was to prevent federal funding of segregated facilities. See, e. g., 110 Cong. Rec. 1521 (1964) (remarks of Rep. Celler); id., at 6544 (remarks of Sen. Humphrey).\n\n[12]  In McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., the Court held that \"Title VII prohibits racial discrimination against . . . white petitioners . . . upon the same standards as would be applicable were they Negroes . . . .\" 427 U. S., at 280. Quoting from our earlier decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, 431, the Court reaffirmed the principle that the statute \"prohibit[s] `[d]iscriminatory preference for any [racial] group, minority or majority.' \" 427 U. S., at 279 (emphasis in original).\n\n[13]  See, e. g., 110 Cong. Rec. 1520 (1964) (remarks of Rep. Celler); id., at 5864 (remarks of Sen. Humphrey); id., at 6561 (remarks of Sen. Kuchel); id., at 7055 (remarks of Sen. Pastore). (Representative Celler and Senators Humphrey and Kuchel were the House and Senate floor managers for the entire Civil Rights Act, and Senator Pastore was the majority Senate floor manager for Title VI.)\n\n[14]  Representative Abernethy's comments were typical:\n\n\"Title VI has been aptly described as the most harsh and unprecedented proposal contained in the bill . . . .\n\n\"It is aimed toward eliminating discrimination in federally assisted programs. It contains no guideposts and no yardsticks as to what might constitute discrimination in carrying out federally aided programs and projects. . . .\n\n.....\n\n\"Presumably the college would have to have a `racially balanced' staff from the dean's office to the cafeteria. . . .\n\n\"The effect of this title, if enacted into law, will interject race as a factor in every decision involving the selection of an individual . . . . The concept of `racial imbalance' would hover like a black cloud over every transaction . . . .\" Id., at 1619. See also, e. g., id., at 5611-5613 (remarks of Sen. Ervin); id., at 9083 (remarks of Sen. Gore).\n\n[15]  E. g., id., at 5863, 5874 (remarks of Sen. Eastland).\n\n[16]  See, e. g., id., at 8346 (remarks of Sen. Proxmire) (\"Taxes are collected from whites and Negroes, and they should be expended without discrimination\"); id., at 7055 (remarks of Sen. Pastore) (\"[Title VI] will guarantee that the money collected by colorblind tax collectors will be distributed by Federal and State administrators who are equally colorblind\"); and id., at 6543 (remarks of Sen. Humphrey) (\" `Simple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers of all races contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes, or results in racial discrimination' \") (quoting from President Kennedy's Message to Congress, June 19, 1963).\n\n[17]  See, e. g., 110 Cong. Rec. 5253 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey); and id., at 7102 (remarks of Sen. Javits). The parallel between the prohibitions of Title VI and those of the Constitution was clearest with respect to the immediate goal of the Actan end to federal funding of \"separate but equal\" facilities.\n\n[18]  \"As in Monroe [v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167], we have no occasion here to `reach the constitutional question whether Congress has the power to make municipalities liable for acts of its officers that violate the civil rights of individuals.' 365 U. S., at 191. For in interpreting the statute it is not our task to consider whether Congress was mistaken in 1871 in its view of the limits of its power over municipalities; rather, we must construe the statute in light of the impressions under which Congress did in fact act, see Ries v. Lynskey, 452 F. 2d, at 175.\" Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 709.\n\n[19]  Both Title VI and Title VII express Congress' belief that, in the long struggle to eliminate social prejudice and the effects of prejudice, the principle of individual equality, without regard to race or religion, was one on which there could be a \"meeting of the minds\" among all races and a common national purpose. See Los Angeles Dept. of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, 709 (\"[T]he basic policy of the statute [Title VII] requires that we focus on fairness to individuals rather than fairness to classes\"). This same principle of individual fairness is embodied in Title VI.\n\n\"The basic fairness of title VI is so clear that I find it difficult to understand why it should create any opposition. . . .\n\n.....\n\n\"Private prejudices, to be sure, cannot be eliminated overnight. However, there is one area where no room at all exists for private prejudices. That is the area of governmental conduct. As the first Mr. Justice Harlan said in his prophetic dissenting opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559:\n\n\" `Our Constitution is color-blind.'\n\n\"SoI say to Senatorsmust be our Government. . . .\n\n\"Title VI closes the gap between our purposes as a democracy and our prejudices as individuals. The cuts of prejudice need healing. The costs of prejudice need understanding. We cannot have hostility between two great parts of our people without tragic loss in our human values . . . .\n\n\"Title VI offers a place for the meeting of our minds as to Federal money.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 7063-7064 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Pastore).\n\nOf course, one of the reasons marshaled in support of the conclusion that Title VI was \"noncontroversial\" was that its prohibition was already reflected in the law. See ibid. (remarks of Sen. Pell and Sen. Pastore).\n\n[20]  For example, private employers now under duties imposed by Title VII were wholly free from the restraints imposed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments which are directed only to governmental action.\n\nIn Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563, the Government's brief stressed that \"the applicability of Title VI . . . does not depend upon the outcome of the equal protection analysis. . . . [T]he statute independently proscribes the conduct challenged by petitioners and provides a discrete basis for injunctive relief.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae, O. T. 1973, No. 72-6520, p. 15. The Court, in turn, rested its decision on Title VI. MR. JUSTICE POWELL takes pains to distinguish Lau from the case at hand because the Lau decision \"rested solely on the statute.\" Ante, at 304. See also Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 238-239; Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 588 (Harlan, J., concurring and dissenting).\n\n[21]  As explained by Senator Humphrey,  601 expresses a principle imbedded in the constitutional and moral understanding of the times.\n\n\"The purpose of title VI is to make sure that funds of the United States are not used to support racial discrimination. In many instances the practices of segregation or discrimination, which title VI seeks to end, are unconstitutional. . . . In all cases, such discrimination is contrary to national policy, and to the moral sense of the Nation. Thus, title VI is simply designed to insure that Federal funds are spent in accordance with the Constitution and the moral sense of the Nation.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 6544 (1964) (emphasis added).\n\n[22]  Petitioner's attempt to rely on regulations issued by HEW for a contrary reading of the statute is unpersuasive. Where no discriminatory policy was in effect, HEW's example of permissible \"affirmative action\" refers to \"special recruitment policies.\" 45 CFR  80.5 (j) (1977). This regulation, which was adopted in 1973, sheds no light on the legality of the admissions program that excluded Bakke in this case.\n\n[23]  110 Cong. Rec. 6047 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Pastore).\n\n[24]  Record 30-31.\n\n[25]  See, e. g., Lau v. Nichols, supra; Bossier Parish School Board v. Lemon, 370 F. 2d 847 (CA5 1967), cert. denied, 388 U. S. 911; Uzzell v. Friday, 547 F. 2d 801 (CA4 1977), opinion on rehearing en bane, 558 F. 2d 727, cert. pending, No. 77-635; Serna v. Portales, 499 F. 2d 1147 (CA10 1974); cf. Chambers v. Omaha Public School District, 536 F. 2d 222, 225 n. 2 (CA8 1976) (indicating doubt over whether a money judgment can be obtained under Title VI). Indeed, the Government's brief in Lau v. Nichols, supra, succinctly expressed this common assumption: \"It is settled that petitioners . . . have standing to enforce Section 601 . . . .\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Lau v. Nichols, O. T. 1973, No. 72-6520, p. 13 n. 5.\n\n[26]  Supplemental Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24-34. The Government's supplemental brief also suggests that there may be a difference between a private cause of action brought to end a particular discriminatory practice and such an action brought to cut off federal funds. Id., at 28-30. Section 601 is specifically addressed to personal rights, while  602the fund cutoff provisionestablishes \"an elaborate mechanism for governmental enforcement by federal agencies.\" Supplemental Brief, supra, at 28 (emphasis added). Arguably, private enforcement of this \"elaborate mechanism\" would not fit within the congressional scheme, see separate opinion of MR. JUSTICE WHITE, ante, at 380-383. But Bakke did not seek to cut off the University's federal funding; he sought admission to medical school. The difference between these two courses of action is clear and significant. As the Government itself states:\n\n\"[T]he grant of an injunction or a declaratory judgment in a private action would not be inconsistent with the administrative program established by Section 602 . . . . A declaratory judgment or injunction against future discrimination would not raise the possibility that funds would be terminated, and it would not involve bringing the forces of the Executive Branch to bear on state programs; it therefore would not implicate the concern that led to the limitations contained in Section 602.\" Supplemental Brief, supra, at 30 n. 25.\n\nThe notion that a private action seeking injunctive or declaratory judgment relief is inconsistent with a federal statute that authorizes termination of funds has clearly been rejected by this Court in prior cases. See Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397, 420.\n\n[27]  See 29 U. S. C.  794 (1976 ed.) (the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) (in particular, the legislative history discussed in Lloyd v. Regional Transportation Authority, 548 F. 2d 1277, 1285-1286 (CA7 1977)); 20 U. S. C.  1617 (1976 ed.) (attorney fees under the Emergency School Aid Act); and 31 U. S. C.  1244 (1976 ed.) (private action under the Financial Assistance Act). Of course, none of these subsequent legislative enactments is necessarily reliable evidence of Congress' intent in 1964 in enacting Title VI, and the legislation was not intended to change the existing status of Title VI.\n\n[28]  Framing the analysis in terms of the four-part Cort v. Ash test, see 422 U. S. 66, 78, it is clear that all four parts of the test are satisfied. (1) Bakke's status as a potential beneficiary of a federally funded program definitely brings him within the \" `class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted,' \" ibid. (emphasis in original). (2) A cause of action based on race discrimination has not been \"traditionally relegated to state law.\" Ibid. (3) While a few excerpts from the voluminous legislative history suggest that Congress did not intend to create a private cause of action, see opinion of MR. JUSTICE POWELL, ante, at 283 n. 18, an examination of the entire legislative history makes it clear that Congress had no intention to foreclose a private right of action. (4) There is ample evidence that Congress considered private causes of action to be consistent with, if not essential to, the legislative scheme. See, e. g., remarks of Senator Ribicoff:\n\n\"We come then to the crux of the disputehow this right [to participate in federally funded programs without discrimination] should be protected. And even this issue becomes clear upon the most elementary analysis. If Federal funds are to be dispensed on a nondiscriminatory basis, the only possible remedies must fall into one of two categories: First, action to end discrimination; or second, action to end the payment of funds. Obviously action to end discrimination is preferable since that reaches the objective of extending the funds on a nondiscriminatory basis. But if the discrimination persists and cannot be effectively terminated, how else can the principle of nondiscrimination be vindicated except by nonpayment of funds?\" 110 Cong. Rec. 7065 (1964). See also id., at 5090, 6543, 6544 (remarks of Sen. Humphrey); id., at 7103, 12719 (remarks of Sen. Javits); id., at 7062, 7063 (remarks of Sen. Pastore).\n\nThe congressional debates thus show a clear understanding that the principle embodied in  601 involves personal federal rights that administrative procedures would not, for the most part, be able to protect. The analogy to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C.  1973 et seq. (1970 ed. and Supp. V), is clear. Both that Act and Title VI are broadly phrased in terms of personal rights (\"no person shall be denied . . .\"); both Acts were drafted with broad remedial purposes in mind; and the effectiveness of both Acts would be \"severely hampered\" without the existence of a private remedy to supplement administrative procedures. See Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 556. In Allen, of course, this Court found a private right of action under the Voting Rights Act.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/830777", "artist_names": "Martha

been the same, no\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI promise to wait, my love, right here till you return\nWith arms that want you, baby, & flames that forever burn\nI cry for your tender love & ever-lovin' kiss\nAnd

MANHATTAN ISLAND - DAY\n\nA high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty\nprominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the\nBattery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY\n\nA car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is\nhaving a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.\nDANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full\nbags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The\nbuilding superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to\nnotice.\n\nDANA\n(exasperated)\nFrank, do you think you could give me a hand\nwith these bags?\n\nFRANK\nI'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett. I'm a\nbuilding superintendent.\n\nDANA\nYou're also a human being, Frank.\n\nFRANK\n(reluctantly going to help)\nOkay, okay. It's not my job, but what the\nhell. I'll do you a favor. He takes the\ngrocery bags from her.\n\nDANA\n(setting the wheel brakes on\nthe buggy)\nThank you, Frank. I'll get the hang of this\neventually.\nShe continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and\nmakes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.\n\nFRANK\n(to the baby)\nHiya, Oscar. What do you say, slugger?\n\nFRANK\n(to Dana)\nThat's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms.\nBarrett.\n\nDANA\n(finding her keys)\nThank you, Frank. Oh, are you ever going to\nfix the radiator in my bedroom? I asked you\nlast week.\n\nFRANK\nDidn't I do it?\n\nBABY BUGGY\n\nIt starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY\nHe GURGLES with delight at the movement.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY\n\nNeither of them notice the movement of the carriage.\n\nDANA\nNo, you didn't, Frank.\n\nFRANK\nOkay, that's no problem.\n\nDANA\nThat's exactly what you said last week.\n\nBUGGY WHEELS\n\nThe brakes unlock themselves.\n\nDANA\n\nShe reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward\njust out of her reach and stops. Surprised by the movement, she reaches\nfor the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even\nfurther. Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps\nrolling down the street at ever increasing speed.\n\nSIDEWALK\n\nDana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians\nfor help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy\nswerves and continues unchecked.\n\nINTERSECTION\n\nCars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races\ntoward the corner.\n\nDANA\n\nShe puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY\n\nA city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy.\n\nBUGGY\n\nIt careens toward the corner.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY\n\nIts eyes are wide open with excitement.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY\n\nBus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and\ninto the crosswalk.\n\nBUS\n\nThe bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the\nintersection at high speed.\n\nBUGGY\n\nIt comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street. The bus\ncontinues missing the buggy by inches.\n\nINTERSECTION\n\nCars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the\nintersection and snatches up the baby. She hugs it close, deeply\nrelieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the\nsupernatural has re-entered her life.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. UPPER WEST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY STREET - GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO - DAY\n\nTHEME MUSIC kicks in strongly as we see the familiar \"No Ghosts\" symbol\nand PULL BACK to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the\nGhostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the\nUpper West Side. RAY STANTZ is driving and WINSTON ZEDDEMORE is riding\nshotgun.\n\nEXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)\n\nThe Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone.\nStantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump\nout of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the\nhouse.\n\nINT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nA WOMAN greets them and leads them through the expensively-furnished\nhouse.\n\nSTANTZ\n(all business)\nHow many of them are there, ma'am?\n\nWOMAN\nFourteen. They're in the back. I hope you can\nhandle them. It's been like a nightmare.\n\nWINSTON\nHow big are they?\n\nShe holds her hand out indicating about four feet.\n\nWINSTON\n(resolute)\nWe'll do our best, ma'am.\n\nWOMAN\nThey're right out here.\n\nShe leads them to a set of French doors that open into another room.\nStantz and Winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment.\n\nSTANTZ\nReady?\n\nWINSTON\nI'm ready.\n\nSTANTZ\nThen let's do it.\n\nHe pushes through the French doors and they step into the room.\n\nINT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nThey are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming KIDS\nbetween the ages of seven and ten.\n\nKIDS\n(disappointed)\nGhostbusters!! Boooo!!\n\nTables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the\nroom is strewn with discarded toys and games. A couple of weary parents\nsink onto lawn chairs as Stantz and Winston take over the party.\n\nWINSTON\n(trying his best)\nHow you doin', kids?\n\nLITTLE BOY\n(nasty)\nI though we were having He-Man.\n\nSTANTZ\nHe-Man couldn't make it today. That's why\nwe're here.\n\nBOY\nMy dad says you're full of crap.\n\nSTANTZ\n(stopped cold)\nWell, a lot of people have trouble believing\nin the paranormal.\n\nBOY\nNo, he just says you're full of crap and that's\nwhy you went out of business.\n\nHe kicks Stantz in the leg. Stantz grabs him by the shirtfront.\n\nSTANTZ\n(low and menacing)\nI'm watching you.\n(to Winston)\nSong.\n\nWinston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the\nGhostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing\n\nSTANTZ AND WINSTON\n'There's something wrong in the neighborhood.\nWho you gonna call?'\n\nKIDS\n(all together)\nHe-Man!!\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)\n\nStantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile.\n\nWINSTON\nThat's it, Ray. I've had it. No more parties.\nI'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged\nnine-year-olds.\n\nSTANTZ\nCome on, Winston. We can't quit now. The\nholidays are coming up. It's our best season.\n\nThey get in the car\n\nINT. ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nStantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.\n\nWINSTON\nGive it up, Ray. You're living in the past.\nGhostbusters doesn't exist anymore. In a year\nthese kids won't even remember who we are.\n\nSTANTZ\n(tries to start the car again)\nUngrateful little Yuppie larvae. After all we\ndid for this city.\n\nWINSTON\nYeah, what did we do, Ray? The last real job\nwe had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow\nman and blew the top three floors off an uptown\nhighrise.\n\nSTANTZ\nYeah, but what a ride. You can't make a\nhamburger without chopping up a cow.\n\nHe turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and\nCLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits\nof metal onto the pavement. Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty\nexhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies. Frustrated, Stantz\nbangs his head lightly on the steering wheel\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)\n\nA bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR,\nChannel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title\ncard and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and\nwe return to the show in progress: \"World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter\nVenkman.\" There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and\nsitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat\ninfamous ex-Ghostbuster.\n\nVENKMAN\n\nHe turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone,\nunderstated and intimate.\n\nVENKMAN\nHi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,'\nI'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest,\nauthor, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton\nAnglund.\n(to his guest)\nMilt, your new book is called The End of the\nWorld. Isn't that kind of like writing about\ngum disease. Yes, it could happen, but do you\nthink anybody wants to read a book about it?\n\nMILTON\nWell, I think it's important for people to know\nthat the world is in danger.\n\nVENKMAN\nOkay, so can you tell us when it's going to\nhappen or do we have to buy the book?\n\nMILTON\nI predict that the world will end at the\nstroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.\n\nVENKMAN\nThis year? That's cutting it a little close,\nisn't it? I mean, just from a sales point of\nview, the book just came out, right? So you're\nnot even looking at the paperback release for\nmaybe a year. And it's going to be at least\nanother year after that if the thing has\nmovie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.\nYou would have been better off predicting 1992\nor even '94 just to be safe.\n\nMILTON\n(irritated)\nThis is not just some money-making scheme! I\ndidn't just make up the date. I have a strong\npsychic belief that the world will end on New\nYear's Eve.\n\nVENKMAN\n(placating)\nWell, for your sake, I hope you're right. But\nI think my other guest may disagree with you.\nElaine, you had another date in mind?\n\nThe CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey\nhousewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman.\n\nELAINE\nAccording to my sources, the world will end\non February 14, in the year 2016.\n\nVENKMAN\nValentine's Day. That's got to be a bummer.\nWhere did you get that date, Elaine?\n\nELAINE\nI received this information from an alien. I\nwas at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having\na drink in the bar when he approached me and\nstarted talking. Then he must have used some\nsort of ray or a mind control device because\nhe made me follow him to his room and that's\nwhere he told me about the end of the world.\n\nVENKMAN\nYour alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?\n\nELAINE\nIt may have been a room on the spacecraft made\nup to look like a room in the Holiday Inn. I\ncan't be sure, Peter.\n\nVENKMAN\n(humoring her)\nNo, you can't, and I think that's the whole\nproblem with aliens; you just can't trust them.\nYou may get some nice ones occasionally like\nStarman or E.T., but most of them turn out to\nbe some kind of lizard. Anyway, we're just\nabout out of time.\n(does his wrap-up right TO\nthe CAMERA)\nNext week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless\npets.\n(holds up a hairless cat)\nUntil then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...\n(puts a finger to his temple\nand sends out a though to his\nviewers)\n... Good night.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)\n\nVenkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a\nwell-meaning young incompetent.\n\nVENKMAN\nWhere do you find these people? I thought\nwe were having the telekinetic guy who bends\nthe spoons?\n\nNORMAN\nA lot of the better psychics won't come on the\nshow. They think you're too skeptical.\n\nVENKMAN\nSkeptical! Norman, I'm a pushover. I think\nprofessional wrestling is real.\n\nThere is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come\nout of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Norman)\nWhat's all this?\n\nNORMAN\nThey just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.'\n\nVENKMAN\nThe Mayor! He's a friend of mine.\n\nVenkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK\nHARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio.\n\nVENKMAN\n(calling to the Mayor)\nLenny!\n\nThe Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know\nhim.\n\nVENKMAN\n(starts to follow him)\nLenny! It's Pete Venkman!\n\nThe plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand\nagainst Venkman's chest.\n\nHARDEMEYER\n(snide)\nCan I help you?\n\nVENKMAN\n(dangerous)\nYeah, you can get your hand off my chest.\n\nHardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.\n\nHARDEMEYER\nI'm Jack Hardemeyer. I'm the mayor's assistant.\nWhat can I do for you?\n\nVENKMAN\nI'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just\nwant to say hello to him.\n\nHARDEMEYER\n(scornful)\nI know who you are, Doctor Venkman. Busting\nany ghosts lately?\n\nVENKMAN\nNo, that's what I want to talk to the mayor\nabout. We did a little job for the city a\nwhile back and we ended up getting sued,\nscrewed and tattooed by deskworms like you.\n\nHARDEMEYER\n(bristling)\nLook, you stay away from the mayor. Next fall,\nbarring a disaster, he's going to be elected\ngovernor of this state and the last thing we\nneed is for him to be associated with two-bit\nfrauds and publicity hounds like you and your\nfriends. You read me?\n\nHardemeyer walks off with the two cops.\n\nVENKMAN\nOkay, I get it. But I want you to tell Lenny\nthat, because of you, I'm not voting for him.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY\n\nThe broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and\nvisitors. Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and\nenters the museum.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)\n\nWe are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO\nTHE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an\nincredibly powerful evil presence. Then we PULL BACK to reveal the\nstudio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit\nby large skylights in the ceiling. Working on the Vigo painting is\nJANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the\ndepartment, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy. Janosz is staring\nlongingly across the room at Dana.\n\nDANA\n\nShe is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still\npreoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy. Janosz\nwatches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her\nshoulder.\n\nJANOSZ\n(with an East European accent)\nStill working on the Turner?\n\nDana jumps, startled by the intrusion.\n\nDANA\nOh, yes, I got in a little late this morning,\nJanosz.\n\nJANOSZ\nYou know, you are really doing very good work\nhere. I think soon you may be ready to assist\nme in some of the more important restorations.\n\nDANA\nThank you, Janosz. I've learned a lot here,\nbut now that my baby's a little older, I was\nhoping to rejoin the orchestra.\n\nVIGO PAINTING\n\nAt the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his\n\nhead and looks at Dana.\n\nJANOSZ AND DANA\n\nNeither of them notice the movement in the painting.\n\nJANOSZ\n(disappointed)\nWe'll be very sorry to lose you. Perhaps I\ncould take you to lunch today?\n\nDANA\nActually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have\nan appointment.\n(looks at her watch)\nIn fact, I'd better go.\n\nShe starts gathering up her things.\n\nJANOSZ\nEvery day I ask you, and every day you've got\nsomething else to do. Do I have bad breath\nor something?\n\nDANA\n(trying to brush him off)\nI'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.\n\nJANOSZ\nOkay, I'll take a raincheck on that.\n\nJanosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.\n\nJANOSZ\n(to himself)\nI think she likes me.\n\nHe switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the\nphrases as he resumes working.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY\n\nDana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building. A sign\nidentifies it as \"The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research.\"\n\nINT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)\n\nDana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly\nintellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an\nexperiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom\nare Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. The device he is testing is a black\nbox about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic\ndisplays.\n\nDANA\n... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped\ndead in the middle of the street\n\nSPENGLER\n\nDid anyone else see this happen?\n\nDANA\nHundreds of people. Believe me, I didn't\nimagine this.\n\nSPENGLER\nI'm not saying you did. In science we always\nlook for the simplest explanation.\n\nAn ASSISTANT interrupts.\n\nASSISTANT\nWe're ready, Dr. Spengler\n\nSPENGLER\n(to the Assistant)\nWe'll start with the negative calibration.\n\nHe picks up the device and prepares to test it.\n\nDANA\n(curious)\nWhat are you working on, Egon?\n\nSPENGLER\nI'm trying to determine whether human\nemotional states have a measurable effect on\nthe psychomagnetheric energy field. It's a\ntheory Ray and I were working on when we had\nto dissolve Ghostbusters.\n\nAn assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually\na two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room. Inside the\nwaiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated\narguement.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to Dana)\nThey think they're here for marriage\ncounseling. We've kept them waiting for two\nhours and we've been gradually increasing the\ntemperature in the room.\n(checking a heat sensor)\nIt's up to 95 degrees at the moment. Now my\nassistant is going to enter and ask them if\nthey'd mind waiting another half-hour.\n\nAs Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the\nwaiting room and tells the couple about the new delay. They explode\nwith anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them\nthrough the glass. After recording his readings, he returns to his\nAssistant.\n\nSPENGLER\nWe'll do the happiness index next.\n(to Dana)\nI'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if\nit's all right with you.\n\nDANA\nOkay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.\n\nSPENGLER\nOh no.\n\nDANA\n(affectedly casual)\nDo you ever see him?\n\nSPENGLER\nOccasionally\n\nDANA\nHow is he these days?\n\nSPENGLER\nVenkman? I think he was borderline for a\nwhile there. Then he crossed the border.\n\nDANA\nDoes he ever mention me?\n\nSPENGLER\nNo. Not that I can recall.\n\nThey move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely\nlittle girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.\n\nDANA\n(slightly disappointed)\nWell, we didn't part on very good terms and\nwe sort of lost track of each other when I\ngot married.\n\nThe Assistant interrupts again.\n\nASSISTANT\nWe're ready for the affection test.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to the assistant)\nGood. Send in the puppy.\n\nDANA\n(continuing)\nI thought of calling him after my marriage\nended, but --. Anyway, I appreciate you're\ndoing this, Egon\n\nThey watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable\nCocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl. Spengler monitors\nher as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.\n\nDANA\n(handing him a card)\nThis is my address and telephone number.\nWill you call me?\n\nSPENGLER\nCertainly.\n\nDANA\nEgon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of\nthis to Peter if you don't mind.\n\nSPENGLER\nI won't.\n\nDANA\nThank you.\n\nShe shakes his hand and exits.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to his assistant)\nNow let's see how she reacts when we take\naway the puppy\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER)\n\nIt's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in\nGreenwich Village. The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old\nbooks full of arcane metaphysical lore. The TELEPHONE RINGS.\n\nSTANTZ\n(v.o., answering the phone)\nRay's Occult.\n\nINT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal.\nRay sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan\nsweater over a T-shirt. He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews\non a battered, reeking pipe. As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup\nof herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.\n\nSTANTZ\n(on the phone)\nYeah ... mmhmm ... What do you need? ... What\nhave I got? I've got alchemy, astrology,\napparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon\nintercession, U.F.O. abductions, psychic\nsurgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie\nsightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, I've\ngot it all -- what are you looking for? ...\nDon't have any. Try the stockyards.\n\nHe hangs up.\n\nSPENGLER\nWho was that?\n\nSTANTZ\nSome crank. Looking for goat hooves. Come\nup with anything?\n\nSPENGLER\n(referring to the book)\nThis one's interesting. Berlin, 1939, a\nflower cart took off by itself and rolled\napproximately half a kilometer over level\nground. Three hundred eyewitnesses.\n\nSTANTZ\nYou might want to check those Duke University\nmean averaging studies on controlled\npsychokinesis.\n\nSPENGLER\n(going to the stacks)\nGood idea.\n\nThe bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop.\n\nVENKMAN\nOh, hello, perhaps you could help me. I'm\nlooking for an aerosol love potion I could\nspray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would\nmake her unconditionally submit to an unusual\npersonal request.\n\nSTANTZ\nOh, hiya, Pete.\n\nVENKMAN\nSo, no goat hooves, huh?\n\nSTANTZ\n(strung)\nI knew that voice sounded familiar. What's\nup? How's it going?\n\nVENKMAN\nNowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and\nbuy me a sub?\n\nSTANTZ\n(slightly evasive)\nUh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something.\n\nSpengler steps out of the stacks.\n\nVENKMAN\nEgon!\n\nSPENGLER\nHello, Venkman.\n\nVENKMAN\nHow've you been? How's teaching? I bet\nthose science chicks really dig that big\ncranium of yours, huh?\n\nSPENGLER\nI think they're more interested in my\nepididymis.\n\nVENKMAN\nI don't even want to know where that is.\n\nVenkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge.\n\nSTANTZ\nOh, your book came in, Venkman. Magical\nPaths to Fortune and Power.\n\nHe hands Venkman the book.\n\nVENKMAN\nGreat.\n(reading the contents)\nSo what are you guys working on?\n\nSTANTZ\nOh, just checking something for an old friend.\n\nVENKMAN\nWho?\n\nSTANTZ\n(at a loss)\nWho? Just -- someone we know.\n\nVENKMAN\nOh, Ray --\n\nHe grabs Stantz by both ears and pulls up.\n\nVENKMAN\nWho? Who? Who?\n\nSTANTZ\nAaah! Nobody! I can't tell you!\n\nVENKMAN\nWho, Ray?\n\nSTANTZ\n(giving in)\nDana! Dana Barrett!\n\nVenkman lets go of his ears and smiles. Spengler looks at Stantz and shakes his head.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. DANA'S APARTMENT - DAY (LATER)\n\nThe apartment is old and creatively furnished with a comfortable mix of\nmodern and traditional pieces. Maria, a young Hispanic woman who does\nday care for Dana, is feeding the baby in the kitchen when the DOORBELL\nRINGS.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nDana enters from the bedroom and crosses to the front door. She opens\nit and admits Ray and Egon.\n\nDANA\n(hugging Ray)\nHi, Ray. It's good to see you. Thanks for\ncoming.\n\nSTANTZ\nNo problem. Always glad to help -- and hug.\n\nDANA\n(to Spengler)\nHi, Egon.\n\nShe shakes his hand and is about to close the door when Venkman appears\nin the doorway.\n\nVENKMAN\nHi, Dana.\n\nDana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance.\n\nVENKMAN\nI knew you'd come crawling back to me.\n\nShe regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his\npresumptuousness.\n\nDANA\nHello, Peter.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Dana)\nYou know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you\ndidn't call me first. I'm still into all\nthis stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen\nmy show?\n\nDANA\nI have. That's why I didn't call you first.\n\nVENKMAN\nI can see that you're still very bitter about\nus, but in the interest of science, I'm going\nto give it my best shot. Let's go to work,\nboys.\n\nStantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on\nthe baby and the immediate physical environment.\n\nVENKMAN AND DANA\n\nVenkman starts nosing around the apartment. Dana follows him.\n\nVENKMAN\nSo what happened to Mr. Right? I hear he\nditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.\n\nDANA\nHe didn't \"ditch\" me. We had some problems,\nhe got a good offer from an orchestra in\nEngland and he took it.\n\nVENKMAN\nHe ditched you. You should've married me,\nyou know.\n\nDANA\nYou never asked me, and every time I brought\nit up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.\n\nVENKMAN\nMen are very sensitive, you know. We need to\nfeel loved and desired, too.\n\nDANA\nWell, when you started introducing me as \"the\nold ball and chain,\" that's when I left.\n\nVENKMAN\nI may have a few personal problems but one thing\nI am is a total professional.\n\nHe leaves her and crosses to Spengler.\n\nSPENGLER\n\nHe's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby\nwith a tape measure and calipers.\n\nVENKMAN\nWhat are you going to do, Egon? Knit him a\nsnowsuit?\n\nSpengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar.\n\nSPENGLER\nI'd like to have a stool specimen\n\nVENKMAN\nYeah, you would. Is that for personal or\nprofessional reasons?\n\nVENKMAN\n(picking up the baby)\nOkay, kid. Up you go.\n\nHe starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing\nhis nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking\nhim.\n\nVENKMAN\nHelp! Please somebody help me! Get him off!\nQuickly! He's gone completely berserk!\n\nDana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby.\n\nDANA\nWhat do you think?\n\nVENKMAN\nThere's no doubt about it. He's got his\nfather's looks. The kid is ugly -- extremely\nugly. And smelly.\n(resumes playing with the baby)\nYou stink! It's just horrible. You are the\nstinkiest baby I ever smelled.\n(to Dana)\nWhat's his name?\n\nDANA\nHis name is Oscar.\n\nVENKMAN\nOscar! You poor kid!\n\nDANA\n(losing patience)\nPeter, this is serious. I need to know if you\nthink there's anything unusual about him.\n\nVENKMAN\nUnusual?\n(holds up the baby and\nscrutinizes him)\nI don't know. I haven't had a lot of\nexperience with babies.\n\nHe looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper\noff.\n\nDANA\n(taking the specimen jar)\nI'll do it.\n\nVENKMAN\nI'll supervise.\n\nINT.

If anything\nwas going on it's totally subdued now.\n\nSpengler enters.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Spengler)\nWhat now, Brainiac?\n\nSPENGLER\nI think we should see if we can find\nanything abnormal on the street.\n\nVENKMAN\nFinding something abnormal on the street\nshouldn't be too hard.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT.

And the dry\ncleaners we used to go to. And the old\nvideo store.\n(he wipes away an imaginary\ntear)\nWe really had some good times, didn't we?\n\nDANA\nWe definitely had a moment or two.\n\nDana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.\n\nDANA\nThat's where the buggy stopped.\n\nVENKMAN\nOkay, let's take a look.\n\nVenkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely\noblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning\nlike a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill. Then he signals\nfor Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.\n\nSTANTZ\n(reading the PKE meter)\nIs this the spot?\n\nDANA\nA little to the left. Right there! That's\nwhere it stopped.\n\nStantz reads the PKE meter.\n\nSTANTZ\nNothing. Not a trace.\n\nSPENGLER\nWhy don't we try the Giga-meter?\n\nVENKMAN\nWhat's that?\n\nSTANTZ\nEgon and I have been working on a gauge to\nmeasure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -\ngiga electron volts.\n\nSPENGLER\nThat's a thousand million electron volts.\n\nVENKMAN\nI knew that.\n\nSpengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the\nlab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped.\nThe indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING\nWILDLY.\n\nSTANTZ\nI think we hit the honeypot, boys. There's\nsomething brewing under the street.\n\nDANA\n(worried, to Venkman)\nPeter, do you think maybe I have some genetic\nproblem or something that makes me vulnerable\nto these supernatural things.\n\nVENKMAN\nYou mean like the time you got possessed and\nturned into a monster terror dog? No, not\na chance. Total coincidence.\n(to Stantz and Spengler)\nAm I right?\n\nStantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the\ncoincidence theory.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.

Are you nuts?\nIf anybody found out about this we'd be in\nserious trouble. The judge couldn't have\nbeen clearer - no ghostbusting.\n\nVENKMAN\nRelax. We're going to keep this whole thing\nnice and quiet, low key, no profile.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nSpengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the\nstreet. Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is\nlit by strong work lights.\n\nPOLICE CAR\n\nIt turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift\nworksite and stops. The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler\ndoesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.\nFinally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.\n\nFIRST COP\nHow ya doing?\n\nSPENGLER\n(reeking with guilt)\nFine! It's cutting fine now.\n\nFIRST COP\n(curious)\nWhy are you cutting?\n\nSPENGLER\n(looking for one of the\nothers)\nWhy are we cutting? Uh - boss!\n\nVenkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a\ngood imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman.\n\nFIRST COP\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nVENKMAN\n(belligerent)\nWhat the hell's it look like we're doing?\nWe're bustin out asses over here cause\nsome douchebag downtown ain't got nothin'\nbetter to do than make idiots like us work\nlate on a Friday night, right?\n(looks to Spengler for\nagreement)\n\nSPENGLER\n(with a \"right on\" fist)\nYo.\n\nThe cops seem satisfied by the explanation.\n\nFIRST COP\nOkay, boys, take it easy.\n\nThey drive off. Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts\nrubbing his sore shoulders.\n\nSPENGLER\nYou were supposed to help me with this.\n\nVENKMAN\nYou need the exercise.\n\nStantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the\nrubble from the hole. Suddenly he hits metal. They clear away\ngenerations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.\nThe manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.\n\nSTANTZ\n(examing it)\nNYPRR. What the hell -- ? Help me lift\nthis.\n\nThey prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and\nvery deep abyss.\n\nSTANTZ\n(shining a flashlight into\nthe hole)\nWow! It's an old airshaft. It just goes\nforever.\n\nSpengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now.\n\nSPENGLER\nVery intense. We need a deeper reading.\nSomebody has to go down there.\n\nVenkman and Spengler both look at Ray.\n\nSTANTZ\nThanks, boys.\n\nThey snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong\ncable attached to a winch. Ray calls out orders to them as he descends\ndeeper and deeper.\n\nSTANTZ (O.S.)\n(his voice echoing in the\nairshaft)\nKeep going -- more -- more --\n\nINT.

A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE\nSTATION.\n\nSTANTZ\n\nHe pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework,\nand speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie.\n\nSTANTZ\n(reverently)\nThis is it, boys, the end of the line. Van\nHorne Station. The old New York Pneumatic.\nIt's still here.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nVenkman has no idea what he's talking about.\n\nSPENGLER\n(explaining)\nThe New York Pneumatic Railway. It was an\nexperimental subway system. Fan-forced\nair-trains, built around 1870.\n\nSTANTZ\n(over the walkie-talkie)\nThis is about as deep as you can go under\nManhattan without digging your own hole.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to Stantz)\nWhat's the reading?\n\nINT. VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nStantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely\nhigh reading.\n\nSTANTZ\n(on the radio)\nOff the top of the scale. This place is\nreally hot. Lower me to the floor.\n\nAs Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable, he pans his flashlight\ndown the wall of the station, then onto the floor.\n\nSTANTZ\n(shouts)\nHold it!! Stop!! Whoa!!\n\nINT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - FLOOR - NIGHT\n\nBelow him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable\ntorrent of disgusting ooze.\n\nAs he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely\namplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in\nthe bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING\nthrough ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC,\nand mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain\n-- VOICES SHOUTING in anger, SCREAMING in fear, GROANING in pain, a sad\nand eerie symphony.\n\nINT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ - NIGHT\n\nSTANTZ\n(ranting on the radio)\nOh, my God! It's a seething, bubbling,\npsychic cess! Interlocked tubes of plasm,\ncrackling with negative GEVs! It's glowing\nand moving! It's -- it's a river of slime!!\n\nSTANTZ\n\nHe dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he\ncan. He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on\nit, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end.\nReaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting\nthe pole.\n\nSLIME\n\nSuddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of\nthe slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet. He jerks his legs up\nas several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.\n\nSTANTZ\n(on the radio)\nHaul me up, Venkman! Now!\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nVenkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's\ncar drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier. A\nburly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two\ncops.\n\nSUPERVISOR\n(no nonsense)\nOkay, what's the story here?\n\nVenkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the\nbelligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex\nhardhat.\n\nVENKMAN\nWhat, I got time for this? We got three\nthousand phones out in the Village and about\neight million miles of cable to check.\n\nSUPERVISOR\n(not buying it)\nThe phone lines are over there.\n(points to the curb)\n\nVenkman pops Spengler on the head.\n\nVENKMAN\nI told ya!\n\nStantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie.\n\nSTANTZ (O.S.)\n(filtered)\nHelp! Help! Pull me up! It's alive! It's\neating my boots.\n\nVenkman switches off the walkie-talkie.\n\nFIRST COP\nYou ain't with Con Ed or the phone company.\nWe checked. Tell me another one.\n\nVenkman stares at the Cop for a long moment.\n\nVENKMAN\nGas leak?\n\nINT.

Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for\ninformation about the blackout. She listens to a special news report\nfor a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby.\nShe crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door\nand looks in. Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.\nLeaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz\nstanding in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of\nthe hallway. He looks slightly dazed and even creepier.\n\nDANA\n(surprised)\nJanosz?\n\nJANOSZ\nHello, Dana. I happened to be in the\nneighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to\nsee if everything's all right with you --\nyou know, with the blackout and everything?\nAre you okay?

She is frightened but conceals it\nfrom him.\n\nDANA\n(mechanically and cautiously)\nWe're fine, Janosz.\n\nHe tires to look around her into the apartment.\n\nJANOSZ\nDo you need anything? You want me to come\nin?\n\nDANA\nNo, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks\nanyway.\n\nJANOSZ\nOkay, just thought I'd check. Good night,\nDana. Sleep well.

The law does not recognize\nthe existence of ghosts, and I don't believe\nin them either, so I don't want to hear a\nlot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and\ndemons. We're going to stick to the facts\nin this case and save the ghost stories for\nthe kiddies.

Louis is desperately paging\nthrough a mountain of legal textbooks.\n\nLOUIS\n(nervous)\nI think you're making a big mistake here,\nfellas. I do mostly tax law and some probate\nstuff occasionally.

We got arrested at night.\n\nSPECTATORS' GALLERY\n\nVenkman is talking to Dana at the wooden rail in front of the gallery.\n\nDANA\nI wish I could stay.

Why were\nyou digging the hole? And please remember\nthat you're under oath.\n\nVENKMAN\nI had my fingers crossed when they swore me\nin, but I'm going to tell you the truth.\nThere are things in this world that go way\nbeyond human understanding, things that\ncan't be explained and that most people don't\nwant to know about anyway. That's where we\ncome in.\n\nPROSECUTOR\nSo what are you saying? That the world of\nthe supernatural is your special province?\n\nVENKMAN\nNo, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens\nand somebody has to deal with it.\n\nThe spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order.\n\nWIPE TO:\n\nINT.

The Judge calls on Louis to make his\nsummation.\n\nJUDGE\nDoes the counsel for the defense wish to\nmake any final arguements?\n\nLouis rises.\n\nLOUIS\nYour honor, may I approach the bench?\n\nJUDGE\n(impatient)\nYes.\n\nLouis crosses to the judge's bench.\n\nLOUIS\n(to the judge)\nCan I have some of your water?\n\nJUDGE\nGet on with it, counselor!\n\nLOUIS\n(scared)\nYour honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --\n(he remembers there's no\njury)\naudience. I don't think it's fair to call\nmy clients frauds. Okay, the blackout was\na big problem for everybody. I was stuck in\nan elevator for about three hours and I had\nto go to the bathroom the whole time, but I\ndon't blame them because once I turned into\na dog and they helped me. Thank you.\n\nHe goes back to the defense table and sits down. Stantz and Spengler\nhang their heads. Venkman pats Louis on the back.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to Louis)\nWay to go. Concise and to the point.\n\nJUDGE\n\nHe stares at Louis, astonished at his summation.\n\nJUDGE\nThat's it? That's all you have to say?\n\nLOUIS\nDid I forget something?\n\nHe searches through a disorderly pile of notes.\n\nJUDGE\nThat was unquestionably the worst\npresentation of a case I've ever heard in a\ncourt of law! I ought to cite you for\ncontempt and have you disbarred. As for\nyour clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz\nand Egon Spengler, on the charges of\nconspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction\nof public property, I find you guilty on all\ncounts. I order you to pay fines in the\namount of $25,000 each and I sentence you to\neighteen months in the city correctional\nfacility at Ryker's Island.\n\nSTANTZ\n\nHe sees the activity in the jar\n\nSTANTZ\nUh-oh, she's twitchin'.\n\nTHE BENCH\n\nThe Judge continues\n\nJUDGE\nAnd on a more personal note, let me go on\nrecord as saying that there is no place in\ndecent society for fakes, charlatans and\ntricksters like you who prey on the\ngullibility of innocent people. You're\nbeneath the contempt of this court. And\nbelieve me, if my hands were not tied by the\nunalterable fetters of the law, a law which\nhas become in my view far too permissive and\ninadequate in it's standards of punishment,\nI would invoke the tradition of our\nillustrious forebearers, reach back to a\nsterner, purer justice and have you burned\nat the stake!\n\nHe hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily. Then\nhe feels a LOW RUMBLING TREMOR in the courtroom.\n\nSPECIMEN JAR\n\nThe slime starts to pulse and swell, pushing up the lid on the jar.\n\nDEFENSE TABLE\n\nStantz anticipates big trouble.\n\nSTANTZ\nUnder the table, boys!\n\nThe Ghostbusters duck under the defense table.\n\nLOUIS\n\nHe stands up and looks around fearfully.\n\nINT. COURTROOM - GHOST BATTLE - DAY\n\nEverybody is silent now as the rumbling increases. All eyes turn to the\nexhibit table. Then suddenly all Hell breaks loose as TWO FULL-TORSO\nAPPARITIONS explode out of the specimen jar.\n\nJUDGE\n\nHe looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and\nrecognizes them immediately.\n\nJUDGE\n(in horror)\nOh, my God! The Scoleri Brothers!\n\nSCOLERI BROTHERS\n\nBig in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten\nfeet tall. They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are\nmetal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still\nattached. Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their\nbodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to\nget at the Judge.\n\nJUDGE\n\nHolding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense\ntable where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the\nspectral intruders.\n\nJUDGE\n(terrified)\nYou've got to do something!\n\nVENKMAN\nWho are they?\n\nJUDGE\nThey're the Scoleri Brothers. I tried them\nfor murder. They were electrocuted up at\nOssining in '48. Now they want to kill me.\n\nVENKMAN\nMaybe they just want to appeal.\n\nSCOLERI BROTHERS\n\nThey break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense\ntable and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING.\n\nPROSECUTOR\n\nShe sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers.\n\nGHOSTBUSTERS\n\nThey jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge\nwith them.\n\nVENKMAN\nThese boys aren't playing around.\n\nJUDGE\n(desperately)\nYou've got to stop them. Please!\n\nLOUIS\n(thinking like a lawyer)\nViolating a judicial restraining order could\nexpose my clients to serious criminal\npenalties. As their attorney I'd have to\nadvise them against it.\n\nSCOLERI BROTHERS\n\nThey start punching through the jury box.\n\nJUDGE\n\nHe is just about hysterical with fear.\n\nJUDGE\nAll right! All right! I'm recinding the\norder. Case dismissed!!\n(he pounds his gavel on\nthe floor)\nNow do something!\n\nSTANTZ\nLet's go to work, boys.\n\nWith that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash\nacross the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were\nbeing displayed as evidence. They strap them on hastily as the Brothers\ncontinue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.\n\nVENKMAN\n(slinging the pack onto\nhis back)\nGeez, I forgot how heavy these things are.\n\nSTANTZ\n(grabbing other gear)\nOkay, let's heat 'em up!\n\nThey flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle\nthrowers.\n\nSTANTZ\nAll right, throwers. Set for full neutronas\non stream.\n\nThey switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.\n\nSCOLERI BROTHERS\n\nThey are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts\nthem.\n\nVENKMAN\nHey! Why don't you pick on someone your own\nsize?\n\nThe towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot\nlightning at their new adversaries.\n\nSTANTZ\n(to the others)\nOn my signal, boys. Open 'em up -- Now!\n\nThey all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible\npowerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom.\n\nVENKMAN\nSpengs, take the door. Ray, let's try and\nwork them down and into the corner.\n\nWorking as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the\nstreams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on\nthe floor.\n\nSTANTZ\nWatch it! I'm coming under you, Pete.\n\nThey circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while\nducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers. Finally, Ray\nsees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of\nlight energy.\n\nSTANTZ\nSteady -- watch your streams -- easy now --\nVenky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him\ndown -- trapping -- trapping -- now!\n\nHe stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the\ntraps which snap shut.\n\nINT.

Reporters and spectators get back on\ntheir feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation.\n\nPROSECUTOR\n\nShe's lying on the floor, attended to by the Bailiff and the Court Clerk.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to the Prosecutor)\nBrilliant summation.\nGHOSTBUSTERS\n\nThey break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of\nthem standing in the wrecked courtroom.\n\nVENKMAN\nCase closed, boys.

BEDROOM SET (TV COMMERCIAL - FULL SCREEN VIDEO) - NIGHT\n\nA man and his wife are lying in bed reading. The man is played by Louis\nTully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist,\nis playing his wife. They are both terrible actors. Suddenly, a ghost,\nactually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom. Janine\nsees it and screams.\n\nLOUIS\nWhat is it, honey?\n\nJANINE\nIt's that darn ghost again! I don't know\nwhat to do anymore. He just won't leave us\nalone. I guess we'll just have to move.\n\nLOUIS\nDon't worry. We're not moving.

It's a self-portrait\nof Prince Vigo, the Carpathian. He ruled\nmost of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th\nCentury.\n\nVENKMAN\n(staring at the painting)\nToo bad for the Moldavians.\n\nJANOSZ\n(defensive)\n\nHe was a very powerful magician.

I've felt very\nuncomfortable since they brought it up from\nstorage.\n\nVENKMAN\nYeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want\nto hang in the rec room. You know what it\nneeds?\n(picking up a brush)\nA fluffy little white kitten in the corner.\n\nVenkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand.\n\nJANOSZ\n(with forced good will)\nWe don't go around altering valuable\npaintings, Dr. Venkman.\n\nVENKMAN\nWell, I'd make an exception in this case if\nI were you.\n\nDana looks disapprovingly at Venkman.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Janosz)\nI'll let you get back to it.

I think we got more food on\nyour shirt than we got in your mouth.\n\nBATHTUB\n\nThe water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the\nbottom of the tub. Dana reaches over and turns off the water without\nlooking into the tub. When she turns away, both taps start to spin by\nthemselves and the tub flexes and bulges.\n\nDANA\n\nStill unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath\ninto the tub.\n\nBATHTUB\n\nThe rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the\nbubble bath.\n\nDANA\nShe picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub.\nShe is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to\nclose up around the baby like a hugh mouth.

But coming from you,\nI can't honestly say I'm surprised.\n\nDANA\nI must be losing my mind. At the museum\ntoday I could have sworn that terrible\npainting of Vigo looked right at me.\n\nVENKMAN\nWho could blame him? Were you wearing this\nnightgown?\n\nDANA\n(distraught)\nI don't know what to do anymore.\n\nVENKMAN\nI'll get Ray and Egon to check out the\nbathtub. You better stay here.\n\nHe exits to the bathroom. She looks around the loft, amazed at the\ndisorder. Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and\ntakes Oscar from her.\n\nVENKMAN\nNow this kid has a serious nudity problem.\n\nHe spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts\ntying it around him like a diaper.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to the baby)\nThis is Joe Namath's old number, you know.\nYou could get a lot of chicks with this.\nJust don't pee in it.\n\nDANA\nPeter, what about the bathtub?\n\nVENKMAN\n(grabs the phone and dials)\nWe'll take care of that.\n(on the phone)\nRay, Pete.

They're here now ...\nRight ... Let me know.\n\nHe hangs up.\n\nVENKMAN\nThey're going over there right now. You\nmight as well make yourself at home. Let\nme show you around.\n(he crosses to the kitchen area)\nThis is the cuisine de maison --\n\nIt's an incredible mess. The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the\ncounters are littered with all sorts of food trash. He grabs a big open\nHefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.\n\nVENKMAN\n(looking at the sink)\nWe may have to wash some of these if you get\nhungry --\n(he looks in the fridge)\n-- but there's no food anyway so forget\nabout it. I have all kinds of carry-out\nmenus if you feel like ordering.\n\nHe opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then\ncrosses to the bathroom.\n\nVENKMAN\nBathroom's right here -- let me just tidy\nup a few things.\n\nDANA\nPeter, this is very nice, but you don't have\nto do any of this, you know.\n\nHe goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING, the TOILET FLUSHING\nand more items going into the Hefty bag.\n\nVENKMAN (O.S.)\nThe shower works but it's a little tricky.\nThey're both marked \"Hot.\" It takes a little\npractice, but at least this one won't try\nand eat you.\n\nHe comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his\nshoulder.\n\nVENKMAN\nBe careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter.\nBut the bed's good and I just changed the\nsheets so if you get tired, feel free. In\nfact, I think you should definitely plan on\nspending the night here.\n\nDANA\nReally? And how would we handle the sleeping\narrangements?\n\nVENKMAN\nFor me it's best if I sleep on my side and\nyou spoon up right behind me with your arms\naround me. If we go the other way I'm\nafraid your hair will be getting in my face\nall night.\n\nDANA\nHow about you on the sofa and me in bed with\nthe baby.\n\nVENKMAN\nOr we could do that.\n\nDANA\nThank you.\n(she picks up Oscar)\nPoor baby. I think I should put him down\nnow.\n\nVENKMAN\nI'll put him down for you.\n(taking the baby)\nYou are way too short! And your belly-button\nsticks out! You're nothing but a burden to\nyour poor mother!\n\nVenkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living\nroom, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)\n\nVenkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and\nStantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.\n\nVENKMAN\nDid you find anything at Dana's?\n\nSTANTZ\nNothing. Just some mood-slime residue in\nand around the bathtub. But we did turn up\nsome interesting stuff on this Vigo character\nyou mentioned. I found the name Vigo the\nCarpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,\nMartyrs and Madmen. Listen to this:\n\nSPENGLER\n(reads from xerox of entry)\n\"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --\"\n\nVENKMAN\nA hundred and five years? He really hung\non, didn't he.\n\nSTANTZ\nAnd he didn't die of old age either. He was\npoisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,\ndisemboweled, drawn and quartered.\n\nWINSTON\nI guess he wasn't too popular at the end\nthere.\n\nSPENGLER\nNo, not exactly a man of the people.\n(reads)\n\"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the\nTorturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the\nUnholy.\"\n\nSTANTZ\nThis guy was a bad monkey. He dabbled in\nall the Black Arts, and listen to this\nprophecy. Just before his head died, his\nlast words were, \"Death is but a door, time\nis but a window. I'll be back.\"\n\nVENKMAN\nThat's it? \"I'll be back?\"\n\nSPENGLER\nIt's a rough translation from the Moldavian.\n\nThey enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - SECURITY DESK - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nRudy the guard looks up in surprise as the Ghostbusters enter.\n\nRUDY\nHey, Dr. Venkman. What's going on?\n\nVENKMAN\nWe're just going up to Restorations for a\nminute.\n\nRUDY\nOh, I can't let you do that. Mr. Poha told\nme not to let you up there anymore.\n\nVENKMAN\n(with mock seriousness)\nOkay, we were trying to keep this quiet but\nI think you can be trusted. Tell him, Ray.\n\nSTANTZ\n(very official)\nMister, you have an Ecto-paritic,\nsubfusionary flux in this building.\n\nRUDY\nWe got a flux?\n\nWINSTON\nYou got a flux and a half.\n\nSTANTZ\nNow if you don't want to be the --\n(he counts)\n-- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock\nfrom a planar rift, I suggest you get down\nbehind that desk and don't move until we\ngive you the signal \"Stabilize -- All Clear.\"\n\nRudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters\nhead upstairs.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)\n\nJanosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter. He\nrushes over and stops them at the door.\n\nJANOSZ\nDr. Venkman? Dana is not here.\n\nVENKMAN\nI know.\n\nJANOSZ\nThen why have you come?\n\nVENKMAN\nWe got a major creep alert and we're just\ngoing down the list. Your name was first.\n\nSTANTZ\n(to Spengler and Winston)\nLet's sweep it, boys.\n\nThey deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Janosz)\nYou know, I never got to ask you. Where you\nfrom, Johnny?\n\nJANOSZ\n(nervous)\nThe Upper West Side.\n\nSPENGLER\n(consulting his PKE meter)\nThis entire room is extremely hot, Peter.\n\nJANOSZ\nWhat exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman?\n\nVENKMAN\nWe'll know when we find it. You just sit\ntight. This won't take long.\n\nSTANTZ\n\nUsing the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to\nthe painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio. Venkman\ncomes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels.\n\nVENKMAN\nThis is the one that looked at Dana.\n\nJANOSZ\nIt must be the chemical fumes in the studio.\nPeople start imagining things --\n\nVENKMAN\n(interrupts)\nI'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing\ntheory. If she says it looked at her, it\nlooked at her.\n(to Vigo)\nHey, you! Vigie! Look at me. I'm talking\nto you. Hey! Look at me when I'm talking\nto you.\n\nThey watch the painting for any sign of movement.\n\nVIGO\n\nHis eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.\n\nSTANTZ AND VENKMAN\n\nVenkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Vigo)\nBeautiful, beautiful. Work with me, baby.\nJust have fun with it.\n(to Stantz)\nOkay, he's playing it cool. Let's finish\nup and get out of here.\n\nSTANTZ\nI'll get one more reading.\n\nVenkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting. Stantz scans\nthe painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.\n\nVIGO\n\nHis eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul.\n\nSTANTZ\n\nHe stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle\ntransformation occurs within him. Winston comes up behind him and breaks\nthe spell.\n\nWINSTON\n(looking at the painting)\nNow that's one ugly dude.\n\nSTANTZ\n(coming back to his senses)\nHuh? What?\n\nWINSTON\nYou finished here?\n\nSTANTZ\n(distracted)\nWhat? Yeah.\n\nWINSTON\nAre you all right? You coming down with\nsomething?\n\nSTANTZ\nNo, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for\na second there. Let's go.\n\nThey head for the door.\n\nJANOSZ\n\nHe escorts the Ghostbusters to the door.\n\nJANOSZ\nSo you see, everything is in order, is it\nnot?\n\nVENKMAN\nNot. Don't leave town and report any change\nin your address to the proper authorities.\nWe'll be back.\n\nThey exit.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)\n\nThe Ghostbusters cross to ECTO-2.\n\nSPENGLER\nThere's definitely something going on in\nthat studio. The PKE levels were max-plus\nand the Giga-meter was showing all red.\n\nWINSTON\nI'd put my money on that Vigo character.\n\nVENKMAN\nYeah, that's a safe bet.\n(to Stantz)\nYou and Spengman see what else you can dig\nup on Vigo and this little weasel Poha.\nThose two were made for each other.\n\nINT. ECTO-2 - DAY (LATER)\n\nThe Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse. Stantz is at the\nwheel. His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense. Stantz\nswerves suddenly and HONKS the horn angrily.\n\nSTANTZ\n(to another driver)\nIdiot!\n(honking)\nMove it, you jerk!\n\nVenkman and Winston exchange surprised looks.\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nStantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously\nthrough traffic.\n\nINT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nWinston looks at Ray, concerned.\n\nWINSTON\nGoing a little fast, aren't we, Ray?\n\nStantz turns on him.\n\nSTANTZ\n(viciously)\nAre you telling me how to drive?\n\nWINSTON\nNo, I just thought --\n\nSTANTZ\nWell don't think!\n\nHe HONKS again and tromps hard on the accelerator.\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS)\n\nEcto-2 is now barreling down the avenue. Pedestrians leap to safety as\nStantz runs a red light.\n\nINT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nThey hang on to the safety straps as Stantz continues his maniacal ride.\n\nWINSTON\n(to Stantz, really worried\nnow)\nAre you crazy, man? You're going to kill\nsomebody!\n\nStantz looks at him and smile demonically.\n\nSTANTZ\nNo, I'm going to kill everybody!\n\nHe swerves off the road.\n\nEXT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nThe car heads right for a big tree.\n\nINT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nAt the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel\nand steps across to stomp on the brakes.\n\nEXT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nThe car skids into the tree and stops. The Ghostbusters stumble out\ndazed and shaken, but unhurt. Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the\nothers, completely at a loss.\n\nSTANTZ\n(himself again)\nWhat happened?\n\nVENKMAN\nYou just picked up three penalty points on\nyour driver's license.\n\nWINSTON\nAre you all right?\n\nSTANTZ\nYeah, I guess so. It was the strangest\nthing. I knew what I was doing but I\ncouldn't stop. This really terrible feeling\ncame over me and -- I don't know -- I just\nfelt like driving into that tree and ending\nit all. Whew! Sorry, boys.\n\nThey inspect the damage to the car.\n\nVENKMAN\n(confidentially, to\nSpengler)\nWatch him, Egon. Don't even let him shave.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER)\n\nThere's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman\nenters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small\nsuitcase of Dana's.\n\nVENKMAN\n(calls out)\nI'm home!\n\nHe looks around the large open loft.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to himself)\nI knew it. She cleaned.\n\nHe hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom. The door is\nhalf-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through\nthe transparent vinyl curtain. He closes the bathroom door and looks at\nthe baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling\noff. Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the\nbathroom wrapped in a towel. She jumps back into the bathroom.\n\nShe comes out again, this time wearing a robe.\n\nVENKMAN\nAre you all squeaky clean now?\n\nDANA\n(humoring him)\nYes, I'm very clean. Did they find anything\nat my apartment?\n\nShe squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.\n\nVENKMAN\n(through the door)\nNothing. They stayed there all night, went\nthrough your personal stuff, made a bunch of\nlong-distance phone calls and cleaned out\nyour refrigerator. And didn't find anything.\n\nDana opens the bedroom door.\n\nDANA\nThey didn't find anything? In the bathtub\n... the pink ooze ... nothing? So, what do\nI do now?\n\nVENKMAN\nNow you get dressed and we go out. I got a\nbabysitter and everything. Trust me, you\nneed it.\n\nDANA\nI'm not here to date. I can't leave Oscar\nin a strange place with someone I don't know.\n\nVENKMAN\nIt's Janine Melnitz, from my staff. She's\none of my most valuable employees.\n\nDANA\nDoes she know anything about babies?\n\nVENKMAN\nJanine Melnitz, are you kidding?\n(handing her the flowers)\nDo I have a vase? I brought some of your\nclothes. Wear something intriguing. I\nbrought along some interesting possibilities.\n\nDANA\nOkay, but it's not a date. It's a dinner.\n\nShe smiles and closes the door again. He opens the closet and starts\nlooking for his good suit.\n\nVENKMAN\nDid you happen to see some shirts on the\nfloor in here?\n\nDANA (O.S.)\nI put them in your hamper. I thought they\nwere dirty.\n\nVENKMAN\n(shaking his head)\nI have a hamper? Next time ask me first,\nokay. I have more than two grades of\nlaundry. There're lots of subtle levels\nbetween clean and dirty.\n\nHe pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them.\n\nVENKMAN\nThese aren't so bad yet. You just hang them\nup for a while and they're fine.\n\nCUT TO:\nINT. FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING\n\nJanine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights.\nThen she notices that the lights are still on upstairs. She starts\nprimping and freshening up her makeup.\n\nINT. FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME\n\nLouis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once\nand for all. He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband.\n\nLOUIS\n(to himself)\nOkay, Stinky, this is it. Showdown time.\nYou and me, pal. You think you're smarter\nthan I am? We'll see about that.\n(loud)\nOh, hello, Pizza Man! Oh, two larges! I\nonly ordered one. Oh, pepperoni and\npineapple. My absolute favorite. I guess\nI'll have to eat these both by myself.\n\nTHE CEILING\n\nSlimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging\nupside down.\n\nLOUIS\n\nHe spots Slimer through the rearview mirror.\n\nLOUIS\n(quietly)\nOkay, let's boogie!\n\nHe whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a\ngash across the ceiling.\n\nTHE STAIRS\n\nJanine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and\nstrikes the wall behind her. Slimer disappears.\n\nLOUIS\n(embarrassed and apologetic)\nOh migod! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do\nthat. It was an accident.\n\nJANINE\nWhat are you doing up here?\n\nLOUIS\nI was trying to get that smelly green thing.\nThe guys asked me to help out. I'm like the\nfifth Ghostbuster.\n\nJANINE\nWhy would you want to be a Ghostbuster if\nyou're already an accountant?\n\nLOUIS\nOh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls\nin sick or gets hurt.\n\nLouis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down.\n\nJANINE\nHave you made any plans yet? You know\ntomorrow is New Year's Eve.\n\nLOUIS\nNo, I celebrate at the beginning of my\ncorporate tax year which is March first.\nThat way I beat the crowds.\n\nJANINE\nThat's very practical. I hate going out on\nNew Year's Eve, too.\n\nThere is an awkward silence between them and Janine starts to leave.\n\nJANINE\nWell, good night, Louis.\n\nLOUIS\n(on an impulse)\nJanine, do you feel like maybe getting\nsomething to eat on the way home?\n\nJANINE\nI'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd\nbabysit.\n(seductively)\nDo you want to babysit with me?\n\nLOUIS\nOh, sure, that sounds great.\n\nThey exit.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)\n\nThere is a KNOCK at the door and Venkman goes to answer it. He's dressed\nfor the evening and looking very dapper.\n\nINT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\nVenkman opens the door and finds Stantz, Spengler and Winston standing\nthere wearing over-the-hip rubberized waders, firemen's slickers, and\nminers' helmets, carrying tons of sensing devices, meters, collection\njars and photographic equipment. They look like they're rigged out for a\nmajor spelunking expedition.\n\nVENKMAN\n(ushering them in)\nDon't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat\nbarbecue rib night at the Sizzler?\n\nSTANTZ\nWe're going down into the sewer system to\nsee if we can trace the source of the\npsycho-reactive slime flow. We thought you\nmight want to come along.\n\nVENKMAN\nDarn it! I wish I'd known you were going.\nI'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.\n\nSPENGLER\nYou know, animals and lower life forms often\nanticipate major disasters. Given the new\nmagnetheric readings we could see a tremendous\nbreeding surge in the cockroach population.\n\nVENKMAN\nRoach breeding? Sounds better and better.\n(calls out)\nDana? The boys are going down under the\nsewers tonight to look for slime. Egon\nthinks there might even be some kind of big\nroach-breeding surge. Should we forget about\ndinner and go with them instead?\n\nDana steps into the living room looking very beautiful.\n\nSTANTZ\nWow.\n\nDana looks curiously at their outfits.\n\nDANA\nHi.\n\nThey nod and wave back.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Ray and Egon)\nI think we're going to have to pass on the\nsewer trip, boys. Let me know what you find\nout.\n\nSTANTZ\n(on his exit)\nOkay, but you're missing all the fun.\n\nINT. VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (LATER)\n\nStantz, Spengler and Winston come down the stairs into the station,\nguided by a very old map of the underground city.\n\nSTANTZ\nThis is it. Van Horne Station. Right where\nthe old transit map said it would be.\n\nThey cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime.\n\nSTANTZ\nLet's get a sounding on the depth of that\nflow.\n\nStantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of\nit attached to his utility belt.\n\nSTANTZ\nStand back.\n\nHe takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and\ncasts it out into the middle of the flow. The plumb bob sinks and\nSpengler reads the depth.\n\nSPENGLER\nSix feet -- seven -- eight --\n\nSTANTZ\nThat's it. It's on the bottom.\n\nSPENGLER\nNine feet -- ten --\n\nWINSTON\nIs the line sinking?\n\nSPENGLER\nNo, the slime is rising.\n\nStantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the\nplatform and around his boots.\n\nSTANTZ\n(alarmed)\nLet's get out of here, boys.\n\nHe starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck.\n\nSpengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger\nthan all three of them. As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and\ncloser to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his\nbelt but finally just unhooks the whole belt. Spengler lets go in time\nbut Winston doesn't. He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow.\nStantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in\nafter him.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)\n\nDana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling\ncaviar and toasting with very expensive champagne.\n\nVENKMAN\n(very intimate)\nHere's to -- us.\n\nShe sighs and drinks.\n\nVENKMAN\nSo -- are you making any New Year's\nresolutions?\n\nDANA\nI want to stop getting involved with men who\naren't good for me.\n\nVENKMAN\nDoes that start exactly at midnight tomorrow,\nor could you hold off for a few days maybe?\n\nDANA\nFor one night in your life, do you think\nit's possible for us to be completely real?\n\nVENKMAN\nAll right, you want to be real? So tell me\nwhy did you dump me?\n\nDANA\nOh, Peter, I didn't dump you. I just had\nto protect myself. You really weren't very\ngood for me, you know.\n\nVENKMAN\nI'm not even good for me.\n\nDANA\nWhy do you say things like that? You're so\nmuch better than you know.\n\nVENKMAN\nThank you. If I had that kind of support\non a daily basis, I could definitely shape\nup by the turn of the century.\n\nDANA\n(already feeling the\neffects of the champagne)\nSo why don't you give me a jingle in the\nyear 2000?\n\nVENKMAN\nLet me jingle you right now.\n\nHe leans over to kiss her.\n\nDANA\nMaybe I should call Janine.\n\nVENKMAN\nDon't worry. Janine has a very special way\nwith children.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)\n\nJanine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby.\n\nJANINE\n(looking around)\nI can't believe a person could actually live\nlike this.\n\nLOUIS\n(to the baby)\nSo these dwarfs had a limited partnership in\na small mining operation and then one day a\nbeautiful princess came to live with them.\n\nJANINE\nIt's really not a bad place. It just needs\na woman's touch.\n\nLOUIS\n(continuing)\nSo they bartered room and board in exchange\nfor housekeeping services, which was a good\ndeal for all of them because then they didn't\nhave to withhold tax and social security,\nwhich I'm not saying is right but it's just\na story, so I guess it's all right. I can\nfinish this later if you're tired.\n\nLouis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down.\n\nJANINE\nYou're really good with children, Louis. I\ncan tell.\n(as he returns)\nWhy don't you come here and sit with me?\n\nLOUIS\nOkay.\n\nHe sits stiffly beside her on the sofa.\n\nJANINE\n(getting close)\nMotherhood is a very natural instinct for\nme. I'd like to have a baby myself.\nWouldn't you?\n\nLOUIS\n(gulps)\nTonight?\n\nEXT. STREET - MANHOLE COVER - NIGHT (SAME TIME)\n\nA manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below. It slides away,\nand Winston crawls out of the manhole followed by Stantz and Spengler.\nThey are exhausted and covered with slime.\n\nWINSTON\n(uncharacteristically\nangry)\nNice going, Ray! What were you trying to\ndo -- drown me?\n\nSTANTZ\n(unusually mean)\nLook, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were\ntoo stupid to drop that line.\n\nWINSTON\n(shoves him)\nYou better watch your mouth, man, or I'll\npunch your lights out.\n\nSTANTZ\nOh yeah? Anytime, anytime. Just go ahead\nand try it.\n\nSpengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression.\n\nSPENGLER\nIf you two are looking for a fight, you got\none.\n(putting up his fists)\nWho wants it first? Come on, Ray. Try me,\nsucker.\n\nSTANTZ\n(squaring off)\nButt out, you pencil-necked geek. I've had\nit with you.\n\nThey grab each other and start to tussle. Suddenly Spengler comes to his\nsenses and pulls them apart.\n\nSPENGLER\n(forcefully)\nStrip! Right now! Get out of those clothes!\n\nHe starts yanking off his slicker and waders. Bewildered, Stantz and\nWinston start doing the same. Spengler helps pull off their clothes and\nthrows them into the open manhole. Now wearing only long underwear, they\nseem to return to normal.\n\nWINSTON\nWhat are we doing? Ray, I was ready to kill\nyou.\n\nSTANTZ\nDon't you see? It's the slime. That stuff\nis like pure, concentrated evil.\n\nStantz looks around and sees that they are standing right in front of the\nmuseum.\n\nSPENGLER\nAnd it's all flowing right to this spot.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. ARMAND RESTAURANT ENTRANCE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nThe MAITRE D' looks up in surprise as Stantz, Spengler and Winston enter\nthe restaurant wearing only long underwear.\n\nMAITRE D'\n(intercepting them)\nCan I help you?\n\nStantz looks around and spots Venkman.\n\nSTANTZ\nThat's all right, I see him.\n\nThey blow right by the Maitre d' who jumps back in horror as they pass.\n\nVENKMAN\n\nHe's just about to pour more champagne when he sees Ray, Egon and Winston\ncoming toward him through the restaurant.\n\nSTANTZ\n(very excited)\nYou should've been there, Venkman.\nAbsolutely incredible!\n\nVENKMAN\nYeah, sorry I missed it.\n(noting their attire)\nI guess you guys didn't know about the dress\ncode here. It's really kind of a coat and\ntie place.\n\nSTANTZ\nIt's all over the city, Pete -- well, under\nit actually.\n\nWINSTON\nRivers of the stuff!\n\nSPENGLER\nAnd it's all flowing toward the museum.\n\nHe gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and\nlands on a well-dressed diner.\n\nSTANTZ\n(calls out)\nSorry!\n\nDANA\nMaybe we should discuss this somewhere else.\n\nVenkman notes the look of alarm on Dana's face and pulls his colleagues\naside.\n\nVENKMAN\n(confidentially)\nBoys, listen. You're scaring the straights.\nLet's save this until tomorrow, okay?\n\nSPENGLER\n(to Venkman)\nThis won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman.\nIt's hot and it's ready to pop.\n\nMAITRE D'\n\nHe hurries through the restaurant with two city COPS right behind him and\nmakes straight for Venkman's table.\n\nMAITRE D'\nArrest these men.\n\nCOP\n(recognizing them)\nHey! It's the Ghostbusters. You're out of\nuniform, gentlemen\n\nStantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look.\n\nSTANTZ\n(self-conscious)\nUh -- well -- we had a little accident, but\nforget that. We have to see the mayor as\nsoon as possible.\n\nCOP\nLook, Doc, why don't you just go home.\nYou'll get a good night's sleep and then you\ncan give the mayor a call in the morning.\nCome on.\n\nHe takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists.\n\nSTANTZ\nWe're not going anywhere with you. I told\nyou we have to see the mayor now.\n\nCOP\n(grabbing Stantz)\nI'm warning you. You can come along\npeaceably or --\n\nVENKMAN\n(grabs the Cop)\nHey, don't be an idiot.

It looks like they're on the bridge\nof an ocean liner, then the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the head of the\nstatue.\n\nSTANTZ\n\nHe plugs the main cable lead into a transformer.\n\nSTANTZ\nIt's all yours, Pete.\n(checks his watch)\nThere's not much time left.\n\nVenkman plugs the speaker cable into a Walkman and gives a downbeat.\n\nVENKMAN\n(giving the downbeat)\nOkay, one, two, three, four --\n\nHe hits \"Play\" on the Walkman and \"HIGHER AND HIGHER\" BOOMS from the huge\nSPEAKERS, amplified by the statue's vast hollow interior.\n\nINT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nThe head of the statue lurches suddenly, but the Ghostbusters cling to\nthe rail and manage to keep their feet.\n\nSTANTZ\nShe's moving!\n\nWINSTON\nI've lived in New York all my life and I\nnever visited the Statue of Liberty. Now I\nfinally get here and we're taking her out\nfor a walk.\n\nSPENGLER\n(reading the Giga-meter)\nWe've got full power.\n\nStantz picks up a Nintendo control paddle from a home video game and\nstarts pushing the buttons.\n\nVENKMAN\n(into a microphone)\nOkay, Libby. Let's get it in gear.\n\nThey feel a strong vibration and the statue starts to move.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT.

OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nWinston looks out apprehensively.\n\nWINSTON\nHow deep does it get? That water's cold and\nI can't swim.\n\nVENKMAN\nIt's okay. I have my Senior Lifesaving card.\n\nSPENGLER\nWith a water temperature of forty degrees\nwe'd survive approximately fifteen minutes.\n\nStantz studies a maritime navigational chart.\n\nSTANTZ\nI'll keep to the middle of the channel.\nWe're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go\nashore and take First Avenue to 79th.\n\nVENKMAN\nAre you kidding? We'll hit all that bridge\ntraffic at 59th. I'm going to take 72nd\nstraight up to Fifth. Trust me, I used to\ndrive a cab.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT.

Soon it will be\nmidnight and the city will be mine -- and\nVigo's. Well, mainly Vigo's. But we have\na spectacular opportunity to make the best\nof our relationship.\n\nDANA\nWe don't have a relationship.\n\nJANOSZ\nI know. Marry me, Dana, and together we\nwill raise Vigo as our son. There are many\nperks that come with being the mother of a\nliving god. I'm sure he will supply for us\na magnificent apartment. And perhaps a car\nand free parking.\n\nDANA\nI hate and despise you and everything you\nstand for with all my heart and soul. I\ncould never forgive what you've done to me\nand my child.\n\nJANOSZ\nMany marriages begin with a certain amount\nof distance, but after a while I believe we\ncould learn to love each other.

BROADWAY - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nThe Statue of Liberty is walking up Broadway approaching 42nd Street,\nwith \"Higher and Higher\" BOOMING from the SPEAKERS inside.

STATUE OF LIBERTY OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n\nSpengler reads the Giga-meter.\n\nSPENGLER\nIt's working.

FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT (LATER)\n\nThe avenue has been closed to traffic and barricades placed, blocking all\nthe side streets. A squadron of police motorcycles comes speeding around\nthe corner at 72nd Street and proceeds up Fifth Avenue in the direction\nof the museum. Then MUSIC is heard BOOMING in the distance, the ground\nshakes and the Statue of Liberty comes walking around the corner onto\nFifth Avenue followed by a wildly cheering throng.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.

As the light moves onto his\nface, Vigo spreads his arms wide and his upper body starts to emerge from\nthe canvas.\n\nVIGO\nSoon my life begins. Then woe to the weak,\nall power to me, the world is mine.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - JANOSZ - NIGHT\n\nThe baby's body begins to glow as Vigo reaches out for it. Then suddenly\na dark shadow falls across the skylight. Janosz looks up.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - JANOSZ'S POV - SKYLIGHT - NIGHT\n\nThe Statue of Liberty is looming over the skylight looking down on Janosz\nwith an expression of righteous anger on it's face.\n\nEXT.

RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nJanosz retreats from the shower of broken glass as the Ghostbusters come\nsliding down ropes into the studio and confront Janosz with their new\nweapons.

Feel free to try something stupid.\n\nJanosz sneers, trusting the invincibility of Vigo.\n\nJANOSZ\nYou pitiful, miserable creatures! You dare\nto challenge the power of darkness? Don't\nyou realize what you are dealing with? He's\nVigo! You are like the buzzing of flies to\nhim.\n\nVENKMAN\n(sighs)\nOh, Johnny. Did you back the wrong horse.\n\nWith that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from\nhead to toe, blowing him into the corner. Then they turn to Vigo.\n\nVIGO\n\nHe is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the\nknees down. He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash\nhis magic powers.\n\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\n\nThey stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been\nneutralized by the good will of the people.\n\nSTANTZ\nVigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad\nlittle monkey.\n\nVENKMAN\nThe whole city's together on this one. We\ntook a vote. Everybody's down on you, you\nknow.\n\nWINSTON\n(arming his slime-blower)\nSay goodnight now.\n\nSuddenly Vigo grabs Stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield.\n\nSPENGLER\nDon't shoot!

I've never felt better in my life.\n\nVENKMAN\nOh, no. We've got to live with this?\n\nThey pull him to his feet.\n\nSTANTZ\nI love you guys. You're the best friends\nI've ever had.\n\nHe hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well. Venkman recoils\nin disgust.\n\nVENKMAN\nHey, I just had this suit cleaned.\n(indicating Janosz)\nTake care of the wiggler, will you.\n\nVenkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby. She hugs Venkman.\n\nVENKMAN\nWhat is this -- a love in?\n(notes the symbols painted\non the baby's body)\nHey, sailor. I think the tattoos are a\nlittle much, don't you?\n\nHe picks up the baby.\n\nDANA\n(to Venkman)\nI think he likes you. I think I do too.\n\nVENKMAN\nFinally came to your senses, huh?\n\nThey hug and kiss.\n\nSPENGLER, WINSTON AND STANTZ\n\nThey help Janosz to his feet. He's dazed but unhurt.\n\nJANOSZ\n(restored to normalcy)\nWhat happened?\n\nSTANTZ\n(calmly)\nSir, you had a violent, prolonged,\ntransformative psychic episode. But it's\nover now. Want a coffee?\n\nJANOSZ\n(extremely nice)\nThat's very kind of you.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to Stantz)\nHe's fine, Ray. Physically intact,\npsychomagnetherically neutral.\n\nJANOSZ\nIs that good?\n\nWINSTON\nIt's where you want to be.\n\nAs they exit they stop to examine the painting that was concealed by\nVigo's self-portrait.\n\nSPENGLER\nLate Renaissance, I think. Caravaggio or\nBrunelleschi.\n\nWINSTON\n(staring at it)\nThere's something very familiar about this\npainting.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - NEW PAINTING - NIGHT\n\nIt's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four\narchangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby. One holds a harp,\none, an olive branch, the third, a book, and the last, a sword. Most\nremarkably, their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to Venkman, Stantz,\nSpengler and Winston.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT.

The Mayor looks nearly suicidal.\nThe Ghostbusters stand beside him commiserating.\n\nVENKMAN\nShe's all right. She's just sleeping it off.\n\nMAYOR\n(stricken)\nWe just had it restored.\n\nVENKMAN\nThis probably isn't a good time to bring\nthis up, but the last time we did a job for\nthe city you stiffed us.\n\nSTANTZ\n(handing the Mayor an\ninvoice)\nThis is a bill for tonight's job.\n\nThe Mayor looks at it and gasps at the amount.\n\nMAYOR\nWhat! This is way too much.\n(hands the bill back to\nVenkman)\nWe won't pay.\n\nVenkman looks at the Statue.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Stantz)\nI think she looks pretty good here, don't\nyou?\n\nSTANTZ\nYeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.\n\nRealizing he has no alternative, the Mayor sighs and takes the bill back.\n\nMAYOR\nAll right, all right.

I've been there. Good party town.\n\nSTANTZ\n(in a similarly reflective\nmood)\nMy great-grandparents were Swiss. I still\nhave the pictures they took of the statue\nfrom the boat when they arrived.\n\nVENKMAN\nOh, right, you told me that. They came to\nAmerica seeking other kinds of cheese, as I\nrecall. How about you, Winston?\n\nWINSTON\nMy people weren't taking any pictures from\nthose slave ships, man. And there wasn't\nany Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome\nthem, either. What are you, Dana?\n\nVENKMAN\nMiss Blue Blood? Her family's been here\nsince the year 12.\n\nDANA\nThat's not true. It was 1620.\n\nVENKMAN\nSame difference.\n\nSTANTZ\nWhat's your story, Pete?\n\nVENKMAN\nMe? I'm a little of everything. Some Irish,\nsome German, some French, Dutch -- the women\nin my family slept around. And that's what\nmade this country great.\n\nDANA\nThat's a terrible thing to say.\n\nVENKMAN\nSo what?

IV: \u201cComposition of the Troupe\u201d Lyrics(VOLUME III: MARIUS; BOOK VII:  PATRON MINETTE)\n\nThese four ruffians formed a sort of Proteus, winding like a serpent among the police, and striving to escape Vidocq's indiscreet glances \"under divers forms, tree, flame, fountain,\" lending each other their names and their traps, hiding in their own shadows, boxes with secret compartments and refuges for each other, stripping off their personalities, as one removes his false nose at a masked ball, sometimes simplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one individual, sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that Coco-Latour himself took them for a whole throng.\nThese four men were not four men; they were a sort of mysterious robber with four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris; they were that monstrous polyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt of society.\nThanks to their ramifications, and to the network underlying their relations, Babet, Gueulemer, Claquesous, and Montparnasse were charged with the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department of the Seine. The inventors of ideas of that nature, men with nocturnal imaginations, applied to them to have their ideas executed. They furnished the canvas to the four rascals, and the latter undertook the preparation of the scenery. They labored at the stage setting. They were always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder, and which were sufficiently lucrative. When a crime was in quest of arms, they under-let their accomplices. They kept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition of all underground tragedies.\nThey were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour when they woke up, on the plains which adjoin the Salpetriere. There they held their conferences. They had twelve black hours before them; they regulated their employment accordingly.\nPatron-Minette,\u2014such was the name which was bestowed in the subterranean circulation on the association of these four men. In the fantastic, ancient, popular parlance, which is vanishing day by day, Patron-Minette signifies the morning, the same as entre chien et loup\u2014between dog and wolf\u2014signifies the evening. This appellation, Patron-Minette, was probably derived from the hour at which their work ended, the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the separation of ruffians. These four men were known under this title. When the Pr\u00e9sident of the Assizes visited Lacenaire in his prison, and questioned him concerning a misdeed which Lacenaire denied, \"Who did it?\" demanded the Pr\u00e9sident. Lacenaire made this response, enigmatical so far as the magistrate was concerned, but clear to the police: \"Perhaps it was Patron-Minette.\"\nA piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages; in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians composing it. Here are the appellations to which the principal members of Patron-Minette answered,\u2014for the names have survived in special memoirs.\nPanchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille.\nBrujon. [There was a Brujon dynasty; we cannot refrain from interpolating this word.]\nBoulatruelle, the road-mender already introduced.\nLaveuve.\nFinistere.\nHomere-Hogu, a negro.\nMardisoir. (Tuesday evening.)\nDepeche. (Make haste.)\nFauntleroy, alias Bouquetiere (the Flower Girl).\nGlorieux, a discharged convict.\nBarrecarrosse (Stop-carriage), called Monsieur Dupont.\nL'Esplanade-du-Sud.\nPoussagrive.\nCarmagnolet.\nKruideniers, called Bizarro.\nMangedentelle. (Lace-eater.)\nLes-pieds-en-l'Air. (Feet in the air.)\nDemi-Liard, called Deux-Milliards.\nEtc., etc.\nWe pass over some, and not the worst of them. These names have faces attached. They do not express merely beings, but species. Each one of these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the under side of civilization.\nThose beings, who were not very lavish with their countenances, were not among the men whom one sees passing along the streets. Fatigued by the wild nights which they passed, they went off by day to sleep, sometimes in the lime-kilns, sometimes in the abandoned quarries of Montmatre or Montrouge, sometimes in the sewers. They ran to earth.\nWhat became of these men? They still exist. They have always existed. Horace speaks of them: Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopolae, mendici, mimae; and so long as society remains what it is, they will remain what they are. Beneath the obscure roof of their cavern, they are continually born again from the social ooze. They return, spectres, but always identical; only, they no longer bear the same names and they are no longer in the same skins. The individuals extirpated, the tribe subsists.\nThey always have the same faculties. From the vagrant to the tramp, the race is maintained in its purity. They divine purses in pockets, they scent out watches in fobs. Gold and silver possess an odor for them. There exist ingenuous bourgeois, of whom it might be said, that they have a \"stealable\" air. These men patiently pursue these bourgeois. They experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of a man from the country.\nThese men are terrible, when one encounters them, or catches a glimpse of them, towards midnight, on a deserted boulevard. They do not seem to be men but forms composed of living mists; one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the shadows, that they are in no wise distinct from them, that they possess no other soul than the darkness, and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living for a few minutes a monstrous life, that they have separated from the night.\nWhat is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish? Light. Light in floods. Not a single bat can resist the dawn.

Album | Romanization | English Translation\n'Hot Sauce' is a cohesive yet diverse album. The title track encapsulates this very well with the Spanish vocal sample (+the distorted version used in verses) as well as the rapid pace and the chanting on the second refrain. It kind of (albeit very subtly) reminded me of Hitchhiker-produced tracks like 127's \"MAD DOG.\" It's followed by \"Diggity,\" which combines hard, punchy, and experimental el\u0435ments with DREAM's cute aesth\u0435tic - making it a fan favorite among many.  \"Dive Into You\" is one of my two personal preferred songs out of all the B-sides. The strong bassline brings power to the rap verses and drops off for harmonic, melody-driven pre-chorus, only to come back bigger immediately after. The soft slowdown at the end perfectly leads into \"My Youth.\" \"Rocket\" gives me the vibe that I'm literally blasting off to space and, at some points, feels like I'm riding a Ferris wheel or doing something of the sort at an amusement park. My second preferred song out of the tracklist is \"Countdown (3, 2, 1).\" The best part is the final verse that comes back unexpectedly after the chorus to bring back the track's punchy energy. It definitely did a good job of giving the impression that something big was about to happen. \"ANL\" makes me feel like it's just rained and the sun is coming back out from the clouds (and also brings me a strange sense of nostalgia). \"Irreplaceable,\" tells the story of an energizing love with a forever lover - and you don't even need to understand a word to know that. And, finally, \"Be There For You\" and \"Rainbow\" are heartfelt ballads that sound like they could fit right into an OST.  Overall, there wasn't a miss on NCT DREAM's latest fully-new release and I'll happily listen to the whole thing over again many times. It was even followed by the 'Hello Future' repackage.\n\n\u2014ckrQuerencia - CHUNG HAOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nThis being CHUNG HA's first studio album, it was expected to exceed expectations! And oh, it did! The album explored a long list of genres thanks to the album's separation into four \"sides\" (NOBLE, SAVAGE, UNKNOWN and PLEASURES). Each side gives off different vibes and rhythms, taking the audience on a rollercoaster of emotions! As for the concept, Querencia (an abstract concept in Spanish) is referring to a place where one can be one\u2019s true self/or to desire. The album truly does justice to the concept of where you can be your true self with the wide range of meaning into the tracks, making it an album that suits every mood. In some instances, the difficulties of a relationship, that \"it\u2019s OK not to be fine\", to show empowerment and confidence, to pick yourself up and come back stronger than those who have betrayed you. At first, I was skeptical of the 21 tracks but I was just blown away! Of course, never doubt Chungha! With hardly any tracks to skip, the album contains everything that fans have come to love about the soloist. I would say my favorite track of the album would be \"Demente ft. Guaynaa\" (including the Spanish Version). The melody and lyrics, just awesome! It is an album to remember and revisit no matter how you are feeling because it has something for everyone!\n\n\u2014HobschiskeWhimsical - Jung Jin HyeongOriginal Album\nI have been well aware of Jung Jin Hyeong\u2019s musical talent for a while, but with the artist\u2019s first full-length album Whimsical, Jin Hyeong undeniably solidifies his place within the South Korean R&B scene. With all of the songs written and composed by the singer himself and each and every one of them being extremely enjoyable, Jung Jin Hyeong\u2019s debut album is a whirlwind of exquisitely performed R&B songs with hints of hip-hop; starting with the title track \u201cBack\u201d and its groovy sound that is followed by marvelous electric guitar notes\u2014a first for the South Korean artist\u2014that makes a strong start for the album. The participation of crewmates Theo and Blase is requested in \u201cNo time\u201d and \u201cDrive\u201d respectively, adding an unexpected edge to each song; the former is a darker track led by its slow beat and acoustic guitar sound, the latter being an upbeat disco-inspired song that vaguely reminds me of electronic music legends Daft Punk, which instantly makes it one of my favorites in the album. But my absolute favorite track is presented in the form of \u201cDowntown,\u201d a Latin-inspired groovy conveyance of a song that urges people to stand up and dance. Jin Hyeong\u2019s charms are further extended to \u201cDrunken texts,\u201d \u201cHours,\u201d and \u201cAlarm,\u201d all different yet equally delightful, with creative lyrics entrusted by the singer\u2019s characteristic sweet and mellow vocals. The final song, a pre-released single featuring hip-hop geniuses pH-1 and Sik-K carrying the name of \u201cLies,\u201d is the perfect closure to an album like Whimsical, with its catchy chorus and the rappers\u2019 additional charisma. It is worth mentioning and recognizing the work of Vangdale, producer of all of the songs in the album, as he was able to seamlessly and flawlessly create different worlds within each song. That being said, Jung Jin Hyeong\u2019s debut album, Whimsical, is an assertive piece of work, as it ensures that the listener will be drawn by the artist\u2019s witty lyrical work and incredible musical sense.\n\u2014loveholicGUESS WHO - ITZYOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nITZY's 'Guess Who' does a good job communicating a broad theme revolving around the rebellious nature of outlaws. The title track, \"\ub9c8.\ud53c.\uc544. (MAFIA) IN THE MORNING,\" appears to narrate a sly and cunning woman in love - stealing a heart and using her so-called trickery to get what she wants. The slick (almost eerie) sound of the instrumental towards the beginning perfectly builds upon this. \"Sorry Not Sorry\" is an anthem of confidence in their abilities and decisions. There's also clearly a thirst to overachieve, fly past all obstacles, and stop at nothing. The heavy guitar strums really top this one-off. Following is \"KIDDING ME,\" which communicates taking a stand against a partner who isn't as committed as you are. The chopped and harsh yet somehow smooth sample that comes in during the chorus communicates strong words and a new beginning perfectly. \"Wild Wild West\" communicates the mean side that one may take in a relationship  (thorns) with a lover that is willing to be there unconditionally even knowing that fact. Some people love a little danger - that's what makes the wild west so appealing. \"SHOOT!\" is about shooting your shot with someone you love deeply, but staying true to yourself and not bending to fit their desires. It alludes to the film Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs - the attractive allure that Red Shoes had when she put them on. In my opinion, this instrumental is by far the funkiest on the album and the creative use of vocal tuning helps a lot to create the feel. Finally, \"TENNIS (0:0)\" is a soft, cozy tone change that acts as a send-off for the project. The acoustic and bass sounds build this well. Overall, 'Guess Who' screams healthy confidence with a bit of vulnerability when needed. I'd definitely listen to it again!\n\n\u2014ckrThe Chaos Chapter: FREEZE - TOMORROW X TOGETHEROriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nLeaders of the fourth generation of K-Pop are back with their third full-length album\u2014The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE. The album is very strong in terms of music, and at the same time, the group freely tries different musical genres and styles, which gives a very natural, pleasant-to-the-ear effect. The subject of the songs still oscillates around the highs and lows of their boy lives on the verge of being teens and young adults. It is also significant that all the members were actively involved in the creation of the album, which makes it even more personal\u2014they all wrote the lyrics, and HUENINGKAI co-produced one of the songs (\"Dear Sputnik.\") The main point of the album is the title track, an emo-rock song \"0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You)\" featuring South Korean R&B singer, Seori. The song is followed by the band's first English song, an upbeat, funky \"Magic,\" which perfectly emphasizes the dancing abilities of the group during performances. When talking about the best songs from the album, it is impossible not to mention \"Anti-Romantic,\" the soft synth-pop ballad that works as the album opener, shows youth's intense feelings of falling in and out of love. The album debuted at No. 5 on Billboard 200 albums chart (a weekly ranking of the most popular albums in the United States) making TXT the third K-Pop group in history to chart multiple albums on the chart in the same year, placing them in the company of BTS and TWICE.\n\n\u2014SiannveSummer Queen - Brave GirlsOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nAs a fan of Brave Girls when \"We Ride\" was released even and before \"Rollin'\" gained the huge success, I was really excited to see what other concepts that the current lineup could show since there wasn't really much information about them then. Summer Queen was the perfect example of what I would've been looking for. A mini-album that you could listen to while you're having fun outdoors, or just chilling by yourself during summer! The first track \"\uce58\ub9db\ubc14\ub78c (Chi Mat Ba Ram)\" is an upbeat song that showcases their unique voices, especially in the chorus. In my opinion, the English version of the song gives off a stronger feeling. Overall, it was a really memorable song and Yuna's line \"Now I'm fearless\" has been stuck in my head since forever. The album has a promotional b-side called \"Pool Party\" which I love a lot because of the retro vibe I get from it. Perfect song if you're going out rollerskating or to a pool party! My favorite on the album \"\ub098 \ud63c\uc790 \uc5ec\ub984 (Summer by myself)\" is all I could ask for a summer song. Smooth producer tag intro? Check. Memorable lyrics and melody? Check. A catchy verse that Eunji and Yujeong participate in? Check! Now on to \"FEVER\". I love this song a lot, of course! It's one of the most chill songs I've ever listened to in my life and in the most positive way ever. I feel like listening to this song if I ever get a fever honestly. If you're a fan of girl groups that know how to make a variety of good summer songs, I suggest you try Brave Girls out!\n\n\u2014seokyoungTaste Of Love - TWICEOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nServing as the tenth mini-album from TWICE, Taste Of Love expresses the girl group\u2019s maturation as they move away from prior \u201cgirlish\u201d concepts and find themselves confronting intense emotions to coincidental encounters. Notably, it even features writing credits from four out of the nine members: Jihyo, Dahyun, Sana and Nayeon. Beginning with a metaphor for being drunk on love, \u201cAlcohol-Free\u201d instantaneously sets the summer theme off by its incorporation of elements derived from Bossa nova style of samba. I\u2019d say it\u2019d be the understatement of the year to admit I\u2019m a *little* obsessed with Dahyun and Chaeyoung\u2019s rap; their flow is as cool as a \u201cmojito with lime\u201d on a hot summer\u2019s day and I wish it were longer! With \u201cFirst Time,\u201d I think we can all relate to the butterflies felt when realizing you\u2019re falling in love with somebody. Seductively, the bass guitar allows amplifying these electrifying feelings. I also believe the post-chorus is undeniably catchy with the shouts of \u201chey!\u201d In retrospect, the one thing that stood out to me was those heavenly falsettos. Furthermore, Jade Thirwall from Little Mix aided the songwriting on this track, helping to encapsulate the feeling of the one language we\u2019re all fluent in: love. Moving on\u2026 did Chaeyoungs\u2019s whispers catch you off-guard? \u2018Cause, they sure did for me! The continuation of the groovy guitar pickings in \u201cScandal,\u201d this time paired with powerful piano chords, demonstrate TWICE's newfound confidence when exploring a riskier, more flirtatious side of love. In turn, \u201cConversation\u201d ventures forwards into a mellow, laidback sound at first. The bubby synth keys help to assist this approach, but when the chorus is reached, we\u2019re introduced to a ritzy bassline. Personally, this is my favorite song on the album - albeit the shortest track, standing at just under 2 minutes and 30 seconds, it takes nothing away from the elegance and sensuality TWICE showcase. \u201cBaby Blue Love\u201d is a real dance-pop vibe, a call-back to the retro 70s/80s shimmering disco-era. Honestly, the urge to get up and dance is almost irresistible. From the title itself, the color baby blue connotes making free-spirited, carefree memories. Finally, \u201cSOS\u201d is precisely the ending we needed to this saga of infatuation. Closing off with more light-hearted fun and thrills, the girls savoring each and every moment spent with their lover, I didn\u2019t think it was possible for TWICE to make a summer-themed album where every track evoked a similar atmosphere, yet was diverse in the manner it was brought out and sung about. Over the years, TWICE have perfected their mellifluous vocals and have been more eager to experiment. If anything, this album is an exquisite example of that, and I am very much excited to create my own memories this summer!\n\n\u2014ZealotOfStockholmRedd - Whee In Original Album | Romanization | English Translation\nAs a big fan of MAMAMOO's R&B vocals and sassy rap verses, I was very excited to check out Whee In's Redd. Starting with the catchy title track \"watercolor,\" she gives an empowering message about self-improvement: It's okay to be selfish if it means you're following your dreams and you're staying true to yourself. Then we have \"Trash,\" featuring rapper pH-1. The intimate track is about showing the pretty and ugly parts of yourself to the person you love. While that may be scary at first, the undeniable passion ends up winning. Contrasting the previous piece, \"OHOO\" is a laid-down love song, perfect to listen to when the sun is setting or when it's raining. If you came for soulful R&B, \"Butterfly\" will be your favorite, featuring the great GSoul. The beautiful and calming melodies create a story about finding 'the one' in your dreams and learning to let go so you can wake up from the fantasy. My highlight is the ending, where both vocalists harmonize and create a new atmosphere together. \"\ubd04\uc774 \ub108\uc5d0\uac8c (Springtime)\" is a cute love letter to Whee In's fans, where she thanks them for always being there for her and brightening her days. Finally, we have my favorite track off the mini-album, \"NO THANKS.\" I tend to love lyrically angsty songs that sound happy, even while tracks like \"Trash\" or \"OHOO\" are more relatable than ever for me right now.  With Redd, Whee In tells an engaging narrative about learning to know your worth so you can experience the love you deserve at last.\n\n\u2014EleventhCassetteLilac - IUOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nActing as a bridge between her 20s and 30s, LILAC is a cathartic album by the Korean singer-songwriter, IU. Running with her theme of age-related projects, the singer brings comfort to her fans on this album. Containing extremely relatable lyrics, at least relatable to me and most people I know, LILAC had a track for every moment. Sonically, the album is a perfect modern pop album, from 2000s R&B to 80s disco-pop to soaring orchestral ballads, IU shares every aspect of herself that we have grown to love. While the lead single is an explosion of springtime excitement like the blossoming of lilacs, I think the album\u2019s real gems lie in the B-side tracks like \u201cTroll\u201d featuring R&B artist DEAN (side note I need new music from DEAN), the bubblegum-pop, \u201c\uc5b4\ud478 (Ah puh),\u201d \u201cCoin,\u201d \"\uc544\uc774\uc640 \ub098\uc758 \ubc14\ub2e4 (My sea)\" and \u201cFlu.\u201d One thing I love about IU's albums is the incredible songwriting collaborations. It shows that she can fit into any style possible, LILAC's credits contain several prominent Korean songwriters including Lee Chan Hyuk, PENOMECO, JUNNY, Sumin, and hitmaker Ryan S. Jhun. IU amplifies her relatable personality through her music and lyrics and LILAC is the perfect example of it.\n\n\u2014ssaa10decSTAYDOM - STAYCOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nAfter the powerful entrance STAYC made to the K-Pop genre in late 2020, making them my favorite girl group debut of the year, the group\u2019s much-anticipated first mini-album STAYDOM was released in April of 2021. Compelled of four songs, this delivery emphasizes the group\u2019s intention of making an impact and gaining their own place in the industry. With unmatched vocals and fun choreography, the lead single \u201cASAP\u201d is an infectious and bubbly refreshing song that positively assures the group\u2019s duality, compared to debut song \u201cSO BAD.\u201d Though based on my taste, their B-side tracks are what shines the most. The confidence-inducing track with a catchy and melodic tune \u201cSO WHAT\u201d encourages the listener to be their own self, regardless of other people\u2019s opinions. My preferred track, \u201c\uc0ac\ub791\uc740 \uc6d0\ub798 \uc774\ub807\uac8c \uc544\ud508 \uac74\uac00\uc694 (LOVE FOOL)\u201d is an easy-to-listen and sweet slow-paced mixture of the members\u2019 diverse vocal colors and meaningful lyrics. Both songs reach their peak during the bridge, both unique yet addicting in the same kind of way. Ending with a remix of \u201cSO BAD,\u201d TAK lends his artistic abilities that make for a song perfect for performances. To say I am excited about STAYC\u2019s future releases is very little compared to the relentless anticipation I have as I look forward to the undeniable success that STAYC will face as they dive more into their talent.\n\n\u2014loveholicEpik High Is Here \u4e0a - EPIK HIGHOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nThe calm, the storm, and the duality of the butterfly meet on Epik High is Here \u4e0a. As an ARMY, I've always been aware of the group, but not so much of their music. But just like how the doors open and close as the pandemic progresses for better or for worse, Epik High proves to be a meaningful catch of hope and ambition in spite of the gloomy future. I would like to recap some of my favorite moments of the album. 'Lesson 0\", a sentimental song driven by piano chords, describes the search for an answer that might not exist. Ending on a perfect resolution, the song suggests that some solution has been proposed. Coming up right after, \"Rosario\" plays with the duality of the butterfly; the song is as \"mellow\" as hearing gunshots in close distance. Ambitious and aggressive, and featuring other A-listers in the game, the song is a rose with pointy thorns. The classical instrumental of \"\ub0b4 \uc598\uae30 \uac19\uc544 (Based on a True Story)\" is as intricate as real love stories themselves. The group wonders why they are reacting so personally to fictional romance; and how ironically, they can only answer with words similar to \"I don't know nan molla.\" \"\uc218\uc0c1\uc18c\uac10 (Acceptance Speech)\" accepts the pressure of fame; it accepts that just like how \"Black clouds are still clouds,\" gold chains are still chains. \"True Crime\" is the song with the EDM-infused chorus, the calm before the storm\u2014when you're driving down a peaceful tunnel that you hope is endless. \"Social Distancing 16\" is short and telling about the music industry within 16 bars; the flow is immaculate despite switching between Tablo and Mithra Jin. Tablo's opening rap verse in \"End of the World\" is as smooth and delightful as sliding into a diner booth, only then to be served with the truth in his verse.\n\n\u2014ANC613WATERFALL - B.IOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nI was going to choose \u201cNumb\u201d to be featured in the Songs List, however, it is quite impossible to single out one song to represent the album. I will admit, I am a fairly new fan of Hanbin. I always knew of him as a songwriter, but I never paid attention to his lyrics on a deeper level. Hanbin\u2019s ability to share a heartbreaking and depressing story through his lyrics but still make the track sound like a summer bop is perfectly on display on WATERFALL. Hanbin also known as B.I professionally expertly hides his pain in the album\u2019s lyrics. Some of the highlights on the album include previously mentioned rock ballad, \u201cNumb,\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d \u201cIllusion,\u201d \"Help Me\" and \u201cDaydream\u201d which also features longtime friend, Lee Hi. Storytelling takes center stage on the album, considering the public scrutiny the artist has faced in the past. Being his first full-length album, WATERFALL becomes an outlet for Hanbin to share his truth. While the production is simple and minimalistic, B.I still incorporates rock, hip-hop, funk, pop, jazz, and ballad sounds in the album. One of my favorite things is when a rapper sings and sounds phenomenal and we hear it once again on the album. The album contains some of B.I\u2019s best vocal deliveries and amidst the heartbreak and darkness, Hanbin manages to find hope and light on WATERFALL which is what makes this album one of the best of the year.\n\n\u2014ssaa10decFragile - eAeonOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\neAeon, the Korean singer-songwriter, also known for being the leader of indie band \ubabb (Mot), returned after nine years with his solo album, Fragile. The release is a very interestingly working mixture of synth-pop and lo-fi, with very honest, vulnerable lyrics and 'love' as a metaphor to talk about fragility throughout the whole album. One of the most interesting songs are \"\uc65c\uc77c\uae4c (I Wonder),\" which creates the vibe that could easily be the soundtrack to the film, probably some dark drama or a spy movie, and \"\uc5b4\uca4c\uba74 (Maybe),\" one of the singles released prior the album, that will make you think about changes, and impact other people make in our lives. For this album, eAeon also collaborated with a R&B singer Jclef (\"Null\"), rapper Swervy (\"Mad Tea Party\"), and rapper-songwriter-composer RM (\"\uadf8\ub7ec\uc9c0 \ub9c8 (Don't)\"). The latter is probably the most known off the album (deservedly). \"\uadf8\ub7ec\uc9c0 \ub9c8 (Don't),\" the story of the relationship gradually falling apart, is not their first collaboration, and once again they created a very unique piece, as both artists share a similar musical sensitivity, and they hold great respect for each other, which translates into the results of their joint work. That being said, despite the rather gloomy subject of the lyrics, the whole album is oddly comforting and definitely worth listening to as we all have the fragility to embrace.\n\n\u2014SiannveTHE FIRST STEP : TREASURE EFFECT - TREASUREOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nTREASURE's first full-length project, THE FIRST STEP : TREASURE EFFECT, showcases the rookies' potential across a multitude of styles. The project includes their first single albums, and I was worried this mesh of drastically different genres would take away from the listening experience. However, the album's musical diversity allows anyone to experience the full treasure effect. TREASURE's first few releases (tracks 4-7) all followed a YG-style EDM approach, making their mark as YG's newest boy group. Their debut \"BOY\" is honestly quite reminiscent of \"DDU-DU DDU-DU\" in terms of sound and structure. Though they formed this EDM image, it didn't restrict them from exploring other genres. \"\uc74c (MMM)\" threw in a hip-hop twist, showcasing more rap than anywhere else on the album. The title track \"MY TREASURE\" is a youthful song with an uplifting message, one that fits their group name TREASURE \u2013 encouraging listeners to keep their heads high on gloomy days and learn to \"treasure\" what they have (themselves). The other B-side tracks on the album also have a bit of everything: \"\ubbf8\uccd0\uac00\ub124 (GOING CRAZY)\" is a house track reminiscent of BIGBANG-era K-Pop while \"\ub098\ub791 \uc788\uc790 (BE WITH ME)\" is a guitar-based acoustic song with a bit of bass and a whistle hook-line. Members' diverse talents are showcased as well, with Asahi co-producing the ballad \"\uc624\ub80c\uc9c0 (Orange)\" and Hyunsuk, Haruto and Yoshi writing most of their raps for the album. They also have strong vocals: Jeongwoo and Jihoon showcased their vocal potential on \"\uc0ac\ub791\ud574 (I Love You)\" and \"B.L.T (BLING LIKE THIS),\" and you can really hear Yedam and his vocals throughout the album; He's finally singing on his own songs. The tracklist is topped off by the Lee Chan Hyuk-penned \"SLOWMOTION,\" a slow song dedicated to the group's journey so far. I can't wait to hear what musical direction TREASURE take in the future. This project is diverse, but remember, it's only the first step.\n\n\u2014PlanNine16Instinct Part 1 - OnlyOneOfOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nThis rookie almost obscure boy group made a lot of buzz this spring with their unique (risque) concept. OnlyOneOf who debuted in 2019 has always incorporated unique themes and concepts in their releases. For fans of the group, it came as no surprise that the group was once again looking towards combining philosophy, art, and music to create thought-provoking songs. Instinct Part 1 is the group\u2019s third mini-album and takes inspiration from Sigmund Freud\u2019s theories of mind. Supported by the title track, \u201clibidO,\u201d Instinct Part 1 explores the themes of intimacy that humans crave especially teenagers. Despite garnering much attention due to its sexy and sensual choreography and visuals, I think it is also important to appreciate the depth in the concept of this album. In a year where most of us were confined to our homes and many times all alone, we all craved intimacy at different levels and in different ways. OnlyOneOf beautifully explored this subconscious drive that we all have on B-side tracks \u201cinstinct/\ubcf8\ub2a5\u201d and \"byredO\". They also talk about the repercussions of the instinct, both when it becomes overbearing or when it is suppressed. Featuring instrumental interludes, Instinct Part 1 is masterfully crafted making it one of the standout albums of 2021 so far. I truly believe that OnlyOneOf has a bright future credited to their unique discography amplified by their immense talent in the studio and on stage.\n\n\u2014ssaa10decYellow - Kang DanielOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nAt 1 AM, I dive straight into this project with no prior knowledge of who KANG DANIEL is and with no familiarity with his music. Now, typically yellow is a vibrant color, symbolizing happiness and joy. However, it seems something dark lurks beneath the surface of this color\u2019s pretense - \u201cyellow\u201d has lost sight of its color and its purpose. What is left is a story that begins with \u201cDigital,\u201d an astounding intro that gives off The Weeknd-esque vibes. Although it has an upbeat feel, it details the troubles of social media and \u2013 thanks to some handy research - specifically the false rumors surrounding Kang before he went on hiatus in November 2019. Moving onto \u201cPARANOIA,\u201d the heavy strums of the bass guitar combined with the distorted synth sounds link to his fragmented state of mind. No wonder it was released as a single - it scratches the surface of his darkness, preparing us to venture deeper into his mind. Though melancholy, Kang never shies away from drawing from personal experiences, ensuring his songs are relatable to listeners. \u201cMisunderstood\u201d does exactly that, whilst also marking his first collaboration with rapper Omega Sapien from Balming Tiger, whose voice meshes remarkably well with Kang\u2019s. Personally, \u201cAntidote\u201d is my favorite track. Utilizing a perfect amount of autotune, Kang desperately holds out faith and hope for better days, no matter how hard life treats him. Furthermore, it was written at what Kang cites as \u201crock bottom,\u201d making it all the more heartfelt for the fans he never stopped thinking about. Finally, \u201cSave U\u201d is a beautifully, optimistic end to the color trilogy. The song, aided by rapper Wonstein, puts into perspective the universal struggles faced both in and out of the spotlight. Overall, the album is vehement, yet eloquent. Truthfully, it is mesmerizing without being enigmatic; its somber mood allows us to focus on the messages Kang succeeds to convey, without any word being lost in translation. Finally, I hope Kang knows how loved he is by his worldwide fans and continues to share his story with such passion!\n\u2014ZealotOfStockholm[&] - LOONAOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nI will admit, I'm a fairly new Orbit. But from the moment I saw the music video for \"Why Not?\", I immediately fell in love with LOONA. And with their newest comeback, [&], my opinion of them only increases. Starting from the intro track, \"&\", the album immediately kicks off with an intense electronic sound. Reusing some elements from the lead single, it's powerful, bold, and sharp. Next is the lead single, \"PTT (Paint The Town)\". With influence from Indian culture and music, this track is has a very intense dance hip-hop sound. LOONA sings about not caring what other people think about you and showing your true colors shamelessly. Showcasing an amazing pre-chorus, and a captivating bridge, with LOONA's vocals, it's an absolutely gorgeous track. After that, we have \"WOW\". A bouncy, upbeat track, LOONA encourages every girl to be proud of who they are, and be themselves without shame. Then, it's \"Be Honest\", my favorite song on the album. A refreshing bop, it's about being honest to yourself and expressing your feelings. In my opinion, LOONA's vocals really shine here, with great melodies and lively raps. Next is the fully English song \"Dance On My Own\". Opening with a simple acoustic guitar, LOONA's vocals have a really nice feel in this song. Then, we have \"A Different Night\" - an emotional ballad with a dreamy, sentimental sound. The ad-libs throughout the song enhance the effect nicely. The album ends with \"U R\", a soft R&B song with lo-fi influence. It's a really good song for chilling in your house at night! Overall, this album transitions very nicely - opening with an intense, powerful intro, and ending with a warm, cozy sound. This is definitely one of my favorite albums, everyone should give it a listen! You'll definitely like at least one track on it!\n\n\u2014crystallized_starstimeabout, - YukikaOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nLet's get one thing out of the way first, Japanese K-pop idol Yukika is my all-time favorite solo artist. She mainly makes city pop songs, a genre inspired by Japanese music made usually in the 1980s. 'timeabout,' is her first mini-album, and in my opinion one of the best mini albums ever released. I'm a sucker for city pop so there was already no way I would've disliked anything on the album. It starts with a synth intro called \"Leap forward\" which makes me feel like I'm time traveling. Then, it leads on to the title track called \"Insomnia\". The song is a groovy and retro track that you would listen to when you're studying. It makes you feel nostalgic and remember memories. \"Lovemonth\" follows after \"Insomnia,\" immediately catching your attention from the addictive and upbeat start and leads you on to the addicting chorus. \"TIME TRAVEL\" has her signature city pop sound on it, a jazzy-ish chorus with sharp vocals. \"Secret\" includes unique melodies that are so unique that it's addicting to listen to. My favorite track on the album, \"PUNG!\" is an easy-to-listen-to song with vocals and an instrumental brought from heaven. It's calm and memorable and I personally love everything about it. When you listen to it with headphones on, it feels like you're floating on clouds. There isn't any reason not to check her out! If you've never listened to city pop before, I promise you that it can easily become your favorite genre. Yukika is a great city pop artist to start off with.\n\n\u2014seokyoungUNNATURAL - WJSNOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nFrom somebody who never listened to WJSN, you might wonder what I listened to, to get into them? It was all because of this album. It all began when my friend recommended this album and shortly, it became one of my favorite albums of all time. This album has many upbeat songs and along with a ballad called \"REWIND\"\u201d. The title song \"UNNATURAL\"\" is a flashy song and has a catchy and fun hook. The second track called \"Last dance\" has an impressive intro with a captivating pizzicato. I personally love the chorus for it as it was stuck in my head for a few days. Moving on to \"SUPER MOON\" is another track with an exciting hook. Member Exy took part in writing the rap lyrics which makes it more exciting to listen to. The fourth track in the album titled \"New Me\" has to be my favorite track on there. With an ambitious message, It\u2019s an extremely captivating retro track that you can never get bored of. I really like retro songs therefore I really loved it. Members Seola and Exy participated in the making of the song. Moving on to the fifth track in the album \"YALLA\" once again, member Exy wrote AND composed this song. What a talented girl! Another one of my favorite tracks on the album, \"YALLA,\" is an electronic pop song with a hard-hitting drop in its chorus. The last song on the album which is \"REWIND\" is a great ballad. Containing the lyrics \"We will be together forever\" it is a very meaningful song. Both promoted tracks, \"UNNATURAL\" and \"Last Dance\" also have beautiful choreographies. In general, the whole album is really fun with memorable hooks and lyrics. So whenever you\u2019re planning on having a party or doing karaoke, you should try playing this album. I really recommend that you listen to this album if you haven't already as you would definitely be impressed.\n\n\u2014WongkaheiDUALITY - I.MOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nYes, he served us looks, a fiery flow, and some questionable lyrics, but underneath all that, I.M of MONSTA X delivered some of the most vulnerable moments on his mixtape, DUALITY. Sticking to the theme of the project, Changkyun shares how there are always two sides to a story. He expresses how every emotion whether good or bad has multiple sides to it. The mixtape was promoted with the smooth hip-hop lead single, \u201cGod Damn.\u201d In line with the concept, I.M masterfully cloaks the song with explicit lyrics and sexual innuendos but also manages to add deeper self-reflective layers to it. \u201cHowlin\u2019\u201d finds I.M once again dealing with conflicting feelings about being alone. Known as a sexy R&B crooner, I.M takes a much darker route on \u201cBurn\u201d and \u201cHappy To Die\u201d talking about mental health and the toll that his glamorous idol life takes on him. The album\u2019s resident melodic rap ballad, \u201c\uc2dc\ub4e0 \uaf43 (Flower-ed)\u201d is a somber track written from the perspective of the person left behind after a relationship withers away. With DUALITY, I.M shows a different side to himself. The mixtape highlights his strengths as a rapper and a songwriter. Oftentimes, I.M\u2019s sincerity is lost behind their hard-hitting verses in MONSTA X songs, which is why DUALITY is an even more special project because it allowed him to open himself up to his fans and audience and put himself in a different light.\n\n\u2014ssaa10decNOIR - U-KNOW Original Album | Romanization | English Translation\nI\u2019m a big TVXQ! fan, my IQ on both TVXQ! & TOHOSHINKI is over 3000, that aside I really love this album. I love the robotic feeling of the opening track Time Machine and his harmonization with those \u201cAh-a-a-a-a-a-ah\u201d make his robotic voice pop. Up comes most likely my favorite track off the album Thank U first off I love the MV with the elevator fight scene, him slashing everyone and the border falling, the One-In-The-Chamber scene and how cinematic the whole vibe is. The song is also great, I like the first part of the instrumental where it\u2019s gloomy and it sounds amazing. As well as the dynamic in his voice where he is singing then he\u2019s sounds more further away and more sad. Also the solo sax part is just ear candy. Onto the next track Eeny Meeny is a really good pace changer, from being quite tense to being playful and the instrumental after the second chorus is my favorite part and goes back to the normal instrumental seamlessly. Eeny Meeny made one thing strong a fun vibe and Loco House Party made that theme much more clearer. Having a tropical and fun vibe is honestly great but there is no standout moment in the track. You know the theme that Eeny Meeny made and Loco House Party expanded on? Being upbeat and fun? Need You Right Now just throws that out the window but It\u2019s a nice track and is a good ballad-ishy song. But the track suffers from the same flaw as the last one, no stand out moments. The theme Need You Right Now stopped it actually made another being ballad-ish sounding songs or sounding more sad with La Rosa but the last 3 tracks all suffer from the same thing \u201cNot Having A Standout Moment.\u201d And that\u2019s a big flaw no track is bad mind you but the first 3 make a really good start but then has a bit of a slump. But the biggest flaw is that there\u2019s no theme throughout the whole album. . . But it is my favorite K-Pop album of the year so\u2026 A+\n\n-OKRA233Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/161885", "artist_names": "Thomas Carlyle", "full_title": "Heroes and Hero Worship (Chap. 2) by\u00a0Thomas\u00a0Carlyle", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e280476fa186a00d41aba3160cbdeff7.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e280476fa186a00d41aba3160cbdeff7.300x300x1.jpg", "id": 161885, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 225680, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": null, "path": "/Thomas-carlyle-heroes-and-hero-worship-chap-2-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Thomas-carlyle-heroes-and-hero-worship-chap-2-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1840, "month": 5, "day": 8}, "release_date_for_display": "May 8, 1840", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "May. 8, 1840", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e280476fa186a00d41aba3160cbdeff7.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e280476fa186a00d41aba3160cbdeff7.300x300x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Heroes and Hero Worship (Chap. 2)", "title_with_featured": "Heroes and Hero Worship (Chap. 2)", "updated_by_human_at": 1555832747, "url": "https://genius.com/Thomas-carlyle-heroes-and-hero-worship-chap-2-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/53691", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2b8a537f7da9edf18e4ed50578eaf158.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 53691, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2b8a537f7da9edf18e4ed50578eaf158.600x600x1.jpg", "index_character": "t", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Thomas Carlyle", "slug": "Thomas-carlyle", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Thomas-carlyle"}, "artist": "Thomas Carlyle", "lyrics": "Heroes and Hero Worship (Chap. 2) LyricsThe Hero As Prophet. Mahomet: Islam\n[May 8, 1840.]\n\nFrom the first rude times of Paganism among the Scandinavians in the North, we advance to a very different epoch of religion, among a very different people: Mahometanism among the Arabs. A great change; what a change and progress is indicated here, in the universal condition and thoughts of men!\n\nThe Hero is not now regarded as a God among his fellowmen; but as one God-inspired, as a Prophet. It is the second phasis of Hero-worship: the first or oldest, we may say, has passed away without return; in the history of the world there will not again be any man, never so great, whom his fellowmen will take for a god. Nay we might rationally ask, Did any set of human beings ever really think the man they saw there standing beside them a god, the maker of this world? Perhaps not: it was usually some man they remembered, or had seen. But neither can this any more be. The Great Man is not recognized henceforth as a god any more.\n\nIt was a rude gross error, that of counting the Great Man a god. Yet let us say that it is at all times difficult to know what he is, or how to account of him and receive him! The most significant feature in the history of an epoch is the manner it has of welcoming a Great Man. Ever, to the true instincts of men, there is something godlike in him. Whether they shall take him to be a god, to be a prophet, or what they shall take him to be? that is ever a grand question; by their way of answering that, we shall see, as through a little window, into the very heart of these men's spiritual condition. For at bottom the Great Man, as he comes from the hand of Nature, is ever the same kind of thing: Odin, Luther, Johnson, Burns; I hope to make it appear that these are all originally of one stuff; that only by the world's reception of them, and the shapes they assume, are they so immeasurably diverse. The worship of Odin astonishes us,\u2014to fall prostrate before the Great Man, into deliquium of love and wonder over him, and feel in their hearts that he was a denizen of the skies, a god! This was imperfect enough: but to welcome, for example, a Burns as we did, was that what we can call perfect? The most precious gift that Heaven can give to the Earth; a man of \u201cgenius\u201d as we call it; the Soul of a Man actually sent down from the skies with a God's-message to us,\u2014this we waste away as an idle artificial firework, sent to amuse us a little, and sink it into ashes, wreck and ineffectuality: such reception of a Great Man I do not call very perfect either! Looking into the heart of the thing, one may perhaps call that of Burns a still uglier phenomenon, betokening still sadder imperfections in mankind's ways, than the Scandinavian method itself! To fall into mere unreasoning deliquium of love and admiration, was not good; but such unreasoning, nay irrational supercilious no-love at all is perhaps still worse!\u2014It is a thing forever changing, this of Hero-worship: different in each age, difficult to do well in any age. Indeed, the heart of the whole business of the age, one may say, is to do it well.\n\nWe have chosen Mahomet not as the most eminent Prophet; but as the one we are freest to speak of. He is by no means the truest of Prophets; but I do esteem him a true one. Farther, as there is no danger of our becoming, any of us, Mahometans, I mean to say all the good of him I justly can. It is the way to get at his secret: let us try to understand what he meant with the world; what the world meant and means with him, will then be a more answerable question. Our current hypothesis about Mahomet, that he was a scheming Impostor, a Falsehood incarnate, that his religion is a mere mass of quackery and fatuity, begins really to be now untenable to any one. The lies, which well-meaning zeal has heaped round this man, are disgraceful to ourselves only. When Pococke inquired of Grotius, Where the proof was of that story of the pigeon, trained to pick peas from Mahomet's ear, and pass for an angel dictating to him? Grotius answered that there was no proof! It is really time to dismiss all that. The word this man spoke has been the life-guidance now of a hundred and eighty millions of men these twelve hundred years. These hundred and eighty millions were made by God as well as we. A greater number of God's creatures believe in Mahomet's word at this hour, than in any other word whatever. Are we to suppose that it was a miserable piece of spiritual legerdemain, this which so many creatures of the Almighty have lived by and died by? I, for my part, cannot form any such supposition. I will believe most things sooner than that. One would be entirely at a loss what to think of this world at all, if quackery so grew and were sanctioned here.\nAlas, such theories are very lamentable. If we would attain to knowledge of anything in God's true Creation, let us disbelieve them wholly! They are the product of an Age of Scepticism: they indicate the saddest spiritual paralysis, and mere death-life of the souls of men: more godless theory, I think, was never promulgated in this Earth. A false man found a religion? Why, a false man cannot build a brick house! If he do not know and follow truly the properties of mortar, burnt clay and what else be works in, it is no house that he makes, but a rubbish-heap. It will not stand for twelve centuries, to lodge a hundred and eighty millions; it will fall straightway. A man must conform himself to Nature's laws, be verily in communion with Nature and the truth of things, or Nature will answer him, No, not at all! Speciosities are specious\u2014ah me!\u2014a Cagliostro, many Cagliostros, prominent world-leaders, do prosper by their quackery, for a day. It is like a forged bank-note; they get it passed out of their worthless hands: others, not they, have to smart for it. Nature bursts up in fire-flames, French Revolutions and such like, proclaiming with terrible veracity that forged notes are forged.\n\nBut of a Great Man especially, of him I will venture to assert that it is incredible he should have been other than true. It seems to me the primary foundation of him, and of all that can lie in him, this. No Mirabeau, Napoleon, Burns, Cromwell, no man adequate to do anything, but is first of all in right earnest about it; what I call a sincere man. I should say sincerity, a deep, great, genuine sincerity, is the first characteristic of all men in any way heroic. Not the sincerity that calls itself sincere; ah no, that is a very poor matter indeed;\u2014a shallow braggart conscious sincerity; oftenest self-conceit mainly. The Great Man's sincerity is of the kind he cannot speak of, is not conscious of: nay, I suppose, he is conscious rather of insincerity; for what man can walk accurately by the law of truth for one day? No, the Great Man does not boast himself sincere, far from that; perhaps does not ask himself if he is so: I would say rather, his sincerity does not depend on himself; he cannot help being sincere! The great Fact of Existence is great to him. Fly as he will, he cannot get out of the awful presence of this Reality. His mind is so made; he is great by that, first of all. Fearful and wonderful, real as Life, real as Death, is this Universe to him. Though all men should forget its truth, and walk in a vain show, he cannot. At all moments the Flame-image glares in upon him; undeniable, there, there!\u2014I wish you to take this as my primary definition of a Great Man. A little man may have this, it is competent to all men that God has made: but a Great Man cannot be without it.\n\nSuch a man is what we call an original man; he comes to us at first-hand. A messenger he, sent from the Infinite Unknown with tidings to us. We may call him Poet, Prophet, God;\u2014in one way or other, we all feel that the words he utters are as no other man's words. Direct from the Inner Fact of things;\u2014he lives, and has to live, in daily communion with that. Hearsays cannot hide it from him; he is blind, homeless, miserable, following hearsays; it glares in upon him. Really his utterances, are they not a kind of \u201crevelation;\u201d\u2014what we must call such for want of some other name? It is from the heart of the world that he comes; he is portion of the primal reality of things. God has made many revelations: but this man too, has not God made him, the latest and newest of all? The \u201cinspiration of the Almighty giveth him understanding:\u201d we must listen before all to him.\n\nThis Mahomet, then, we will in no wise consider as an Inanity and Theatricality, a poor conscious ambitious schemer; we cannot conceive him so. The rude message he delivered was a real one withal; an earnest confused voice from the unknown Deep. The man's words were not false, nor his workings here below; no Inanity and Simulacrum; a fiery mass of Life cast up from the great bosom of Nature herself. To kindle the world; the world's Maker had ordered it so. Neither can the faults, imperfections, insincerities even, of Mahomet, if such were never so well proved against him, shake this primary fact about him.\n\nOn the whole, we make too much of faults; the details of the business hide the real centre of it. Faults? The greatest of faults, I should say, is to be conscious of none. Readers of the Bible above all, one would think, might know better. Who is called there \u201cthe man according to God's own heart\u201d? David, the Hebrew King, had fallen into sins enough; blackest crimes; there was no want of sins. And thereupon the unbelievers sneer and ask, Is this your man according to God's heart? The sneer, I must say, seems to me but a shallow one. What are faults, what are the outward details of a life; if the inner secret of it, the remorse, temptations, true, often-baffled, never-ended struggle of it, be forgotten? \u201cIt is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.\u201d Of all acts, is not, for a man, repentance the most divine? The deadliest sin, I say, were that same supercilious consciousness of no sin;\u2014that is death; the heart so conscious is divorced from sincerity, humility and fact; is dead: it is \u201cpure\u201d as dead dry sand is pure. David's life and history, as written for us in those Psalms of his, I consider to be the truest emblem ever given of a man's moral progress and warfare here below. All earnest souls will ever discern in it the faithful struggle of an earnest human soul towards what is good and best. Struggle often baffled, sore baffled, down as into entire wreck; yet a struggle never ended; ever, with tears, repentance, true unconquerable purpose, begun anew. Poor human nature! Is not a man's walking, in truth, always that: \u201ca succession of falls\u201d? Man can do no other. In this wild element of a Life, he has to struggle onwards; now fallen, deep-abased; and ever, with tears, repentance, with bleeding heart, he has to rise again, struggle again still onwards. That his struggle be a faithful unconquerable one: that is the question of questions. We will put up with many sad details, if the soul of it were true. Details by themselves will never teach us what it is. I believe we misestimate Mahomet's faults even as faults: but the secret of him will never be got by dwelling there. We will leave all this behind us; and assuring ourselves that he did mean some true thing, ask candidly what it was or might be.\n\nThese Arabs Mahomet was born among are certainly a notable people. Their country itself is notable; the fit habitation for such a race. Savage inaccessible rock-mountains, great grim deserts, alternating with beautiful strips of verdure: wherever water is, there is greenness, beauty; odoriferous balm-shrubs, date-trees, frankincense-trees. Consider that wide waste horizon of sand, empty, silent, like a sand-sea, dividing habitable place from habitable. You are all alone there, left alone with the Universe; by day a fierce sun blazing down on it with intolerable radiance; by night the great deep Heaven with its stars. Such a country is fit for a swift-handed, deep-hearted race of men. There is something most agile, active, and yet most meditative, enthusiastic in the Arab character. The Persians are called the French of the East; we will call the Arabs Oriental Italians. A gifted noble people; a people of wild strong feelings, and of iron restraint over these: the characteristic of noble-mindedness, of genius. The wild Bedouin welcomes the stranger to his tent, as one having right to all that is there; were it his worst enemy, he will slay his foal to treat him, will serve him with sacred hospitality for three days, will set him fairly on his way;\u2014and then, by another law as sacred, kill him if he can. In words too as in action. They are not a loquacious people, taciturn rather; but eloquent, gifted when they do speak. An earnest, truthful kind of men. They are, as we know, of Jewish kindred: but with that deadly terrible earnestness of the Jews they seem to combine something graceful, brilliant, which is not Jewish. They had \u201cPoetic contests\u201d among them before the time of Mahomet. Sale says, at Ocadh, in the South of Arabia, there were yearly fairs, and there, when the merchandising was done, Poets sang for prizes:\u2014the wild people gathered to hear that.\n\nOne Jewish quality these Arabs manifest; the outcome of many or of all high qualities: what we may call religiosity. From of old they had been zealous worshippers, according to their light. They worshipped the stars, as Sabeans; worshipped many natural objects,\u2014recognized them as symbols, immediate manifestations, of the Maker of Nature. It was wrong; and yet not wholly wrong. All God's works are still in a sense symbols of God. Do we not, as I urged, still account it a merit to recognize a certain inexhaustible significance, \u201cpoetic beauty\u201d as we name it, in all natural objects whatsoever? A man is a poet, and honored, for doing that, and speaking or singing it,\u2014a kind of diluted worship. They had many Prophets, these Arabs; Teachers each to his tribe, each according to the light he had. But indeed, have we not from of old the noblest of proofs, still palpable to every one of us, of what devoutness and noble-mindedness had dwelt in these rustic thoughtful peoples? Biblical critics seem agreed that our own Book of Job was written in that region of the world. I call that, apart from all theories about it, one of the grandest things ever written with pen. One feels, indeed, as if it were not Hebrew; such a noble universality, different from noble patriotism or sectarianism, reigns in it. A noble Book; all men's Book! It is our first, oldest statement of the never-ending Problem,\u2014man's destiny, and God's ways with him here in this earth. And all in such free flowing outlines; grand in its sincerity, in its simplicity; in its epic melody, and repose of reconcilement. There is the seeing eye, the mildly understanding heart. So true every way; true eyesight and vision for all things; material things no less than spiritual: the Horse,\u2014\u201dhast thou clothed his neck with thunder?\u201d\u2014he \u201claughs at the shaking of the spear!\u201d Such living likenesses were never since drawn. Sublime sorrow, sublime reconciliation; oldest choral melody as of the heart of mankind;\u2014so soft, and great; as the summer midnight, as the world with its seas and stars! There is nothing written, I think, in the Bible or out of it, of equal literary merit.\u2014\n\nTo the idolatrous Arabs one of the most ancient universal objects of worship was that Black Stone, still kept in the building called Caabah, at Mecca. Diodorus Siculus mentions this Caabah in a way not to be mistaken, as the oldest, most honored temple in his time; that is, some half-century before our Era. Silvestre de Sacy says there is some likelihood that the Black Stone is an aerolite. In that case, some man might see it fall out of Heaven! It stands now beside the Well Zemzem; the Caabah is built over both. A Well is in all places a beautiful affecting object, gushing out like life from the hard earth;\u2014still more so in those hot dry countries, where it is the first condition of being. The Well Zemzem has its name from the bubbling sound of the waters, zem-zem; they think it is the Well which Hagar found with her little Ishmael in the wilderness: the aerolite and it have been sacred now, and had a Caabah over them, for thousands of years. A curious object, that Caabah! There it stands at this hour, in the black cloth-covering the Sultan sends it yearly; \u201ctwenty-seven cubits high;\u201d with circuit, with double circuit of pillars, with festoon-rows of lamps and quaint ornaments: the lamps will be lighted again this night,\u2014to glitter again under the stars. An authentic fragment of the oldest Past. It is the Keblah of all Moslem: from Delhi all onwards to Morocco, the eyes of innumerable praying men are turned towards it, five times, this day and all days: one of the notablest centres in the Habitation of Men.\n\nIt had been from the sacredness attached to this Caabah Stone and Hagar's Well, from the pilgrimings of all tribes of Arabs thither, that Mecca took its rise as a Town. A great town once, though much decayed now. It has no natural advantage for a town; stands in a sandy hollow amid bare barren hills, at a distance from the sea; its provisions, its very bread, have to be imported. But so many pilgrims needed lodgings: and then all places of pilgrimage do, from the first, become places of trade. The first day pilgrims meet, merchants have also met: where men see themselves assembled for one object, they find that they can accomplish other objects which depend on meeting together. Mecca became the Fair of all Arabia. And thereby indeed the chief staple and warehouse of whatever Commerce there was between the Indian and the Western countries, Syria, Egypt, even Italy. It had at one time a population of 100,000; buyers, forwarders of those Eastern and Western products; importers for their own behoof of provisions and corn. The government was a kind of irregular aristocratic republic, not without a touch of theocracy. Ten Men of a chief tribe, chosen in some rough way, were Governors of Mecca, and Keepers of the Caabah. The Koreish were the chief tribe in Mahomet's time; his own family was of that tribe. The rest of the Nation, fractioned and cut asunder by deserts, lived under similar rude patriarchal governments by one or several: herdsmen, carriers, traders, generally robbers too; being oftenest at war one with another, or with all: held together by no open bond, if it were not this meeting at the Caabah, where all forms of Arab Idolatry assembled in common adoration;\u2014held mainly by the inward indissoluble bond of a common blood and language. In this way had the Arabs lived for long ages, unnoticed by the world; a people of great qualities, unconsciously waiting for the day when they should become notable to all the world. Their Idolatries appear to have been in a tottering state; much was getting into confusion and fermentation among them. Obscure tidings of the most important Event ever transacted in this world, the Life and Death of the Divine Man in Judea, at once the symptom and cause of immeasurable change to all people in the world, had in the course of centuries reached into Arabia too; and could not but, of itself, have produced fermentation there.\n\nIt was among this Arab people, so circumstanced, in the year 570 of our Era, that the man Mahomet was born. He was of the family of Hashem, of the Koreish tribe as we said; though poor, connected with the chief persons of his country. Almost at his birth he lost his Father; at the age of six years his Mother too, a woman noted for her beauty, her worth and sense: he fell to the charge of his Grandfather, an old man, a hundred years old. A good old man: Mahomet's Father, Abdallah, had been his youngest favorite son. He saw in Mahomet, with his old life-worn eyes, a century old, the lost Abdallah come back again, all that was left of Abdallah. He loved the little orphan Boy greatly; used to say, They must take care of that beautiful little Boy, nothing in their kindred was more precious than he. At his death, while the boy was still but two years old, he left him in charge to Abu Thaleb the eldest of the Uncles, as to him that now was head of the house. By this Uncle, a just and rational man as everything betokens, Mahomet was brought up in the best Arab way.\n\nMahomet, as he grew up, accompanied his Uncle on trading journeys and such like; in his eighteenth year one finds him a fighter following his Uncle in war. But perhaps the most significant of all his journeys is one we find noted as of some years' earlier date: a journey to the Fairs of Syria. The young man here first came in contact with a quite foreign world,\u2014with one foreign element of endless moment to him: the Christian Religion. I know not what to make of that \u201cSergius, the Nestorian Monk,\u201d whom Abu Thaleb and he are said to have lodged with; or how much any monk could have taught one still so young. Probably enough it is greatly exaggerated, this of the Nestorian Monk. Mahomet was only fourteen; had no language but his own: much in Syria must have been a strange unintelligible whirlpool to him. But the eyes of the lad were open; glimpses of many things would doubtless be taken in, and lie very enigmatic as yet, which were to ripen in a strange way into views, into beliefs and insights one day. These journeys to Syria were probably the beginning of much to Mahomet.\n\nOne other circumstance we must not forget: that he had no school-learning; of the thing we call school-learning none at all. The art of writing was but just introduced into Arabia; it seems to be the true opinion that Mahomet never could write! Life in the Desert, with its experiences, was all his education. What of this infinite Universe he, from his dim place, with his own eyes and thoughts, could take in, so much and no more of it was he to know. Curious, if we will reflect on it, this of having no books. Except by what he could see for himself, or hear of by uncertain rumor of speech in the obscure Arabian Desert, he could know nothing. The wisdom that had been before him or at a distance from him in the world, was in a manner as good as not there for him. Of the great brother souls, flame-beacons through so many lands and times, no one directly communicates with this great soul. He is alone there, deep down in the bosom of the Wilderness; has to grow up so,\u2014alone with Nature and his own Thoughts.\n\nBut, from an early age, he had been remarked as a thoughtful man. His companions named him \u201cAl Amin, The Faithful.\u201d A man of truth and fidelity; true in what he did, in what he spake and thought. They noted that he always meant something. A man rather taciturn in speech; silent when there was nothing to be said; but pertinent, wise, sincere, when he did speak; always throwing light on the matter. This is the only sort of speech worth speaking! Through life we find him to have been regarded as an altogether solid, brotherly, genuine man. A serious, sincere character; yet amiable, cordial, companionable, jocose even;\u2014a good laugh in him withal: there are men whose laugh is as untrue as anything about them; who cannot laugh. One hears of Mahomet's beauty: his fine sagacious honest face, brown florid complexion, beaming black eyes;\u2014I somehow like too that vein on the brow, which swelled up black when he was in anger: like the \u201chorseshoe vein\u201d in Scott's Redgauntlet. It was a kind of feature in the Hashem family, this black swelling vein in the brow; Mahomet had it prominent, as would appear. A spontaneous, passionate, yet just, true-meaning man! Full of wild faculty, fire and light; of wild worth, all uncultured; working out his life-task in the depths of the Desert there.\nHow he was placed with Kadijah, a rich Widow, as her Steward, and travelled in her business, again to the Fairs of Syria; how he managed all, as one can well understand, with fidelity, adroitness; how her gratitude, her regard for him grew: the story of their marriage is altogether a graceful intelligible one, as told us by the Arab authors. He was twenty-five; she forty, though still beautiful. He seems to have lived in a most affectionate, peaceable, wholesome way with this wedded benefactress; loving her truly, and her alone. It goes greatly against the impostor theory, the fact that he lived in this entirely unexceptionable, entirely quiet and commonplace way, till the heat of his years was done. He was forty before he talked of any mission from Heaven. All his irregularities, real and supposed, date from after his fiftieth year, when the good Kadijah died. All his \u201cambition,\u201d seemingly, had been, hitherto, to live an honest life; his \u201cfame,\u201d the mere good opinion of neighbors that knew him, had been sufficient hitherto. Not till he was already getting old, the prurient heat of his life all burnt out, and peace growing to be the chief thing this world could give him, did he start on the \u201ccareer of ambition;\u201d and, belying all his past character and existence, set up as a wretched empty charlatan to acquire what he could now no longer enjoy! For my share, I have no faith whatever in that.\n\nAh no: this deep-hearted Son of the Wilderness, with his beaming black eyes and open social deep soul, had other thoughts in him than ambition. A silent great soul; he was one of those who cannot but be in earnest; whom Nature herself has appointed to be sincere. While others walk in formulas and hearsays, contented enough to dwell there, this man could not screen himself in formulas; he was alone with his own soul and the reality of things. The great Mystery of Existence, as I said, glared in upon him, with its terrors, with its splendors; no hearsays could hide that unspeakable fact, \u201cHere am I!\u201d Such sincerity, as we named it, has in very truth something of divine. The word of such a man is a Voice direct from Nature's own Heart. Men do and must listen to that as to nothing else;\u2014all else is wind in comparison. From of old, a thousand thoughts, in his pilgrimings and wanderings, had been in this man: What am I? What is this unfathomable Thing I live in, which men name Universe? What is Life; what is Death? What am I to believe? What am I to do? The grim rocks of Mount Hara, of Mount Sinai, the stern sandy solitudes answered not. The great Heaven rolling silent overhead, with its blue-glancing stars, answered not. There was no answer. The man's own soul, and what of God's inspiration dwelt there, had to answer!\n\nIt is the thing which all men have to ask themselves; which we too have to ask, and answer. This wild man felt it to be of infinite moment; all other things of no moment whatever in comparison. The jargon of argumentative Greek Sects, vague traditions of Jews, the stupid routine of Arab Idolatry: there was no answer in these. A Hero, as I repeat, has this first distinction, which indeed we may call first and last, the Alpha and Omega of his whole Heroism, That he looks through the shows of things into things. Use and wont, respectable hearsay, respectable formula: all these are good, or are not good. There is something behind and beyond all these, which all these must correspond with, be the image of, or they are\u2014Idolatries; \u201cbits of black wood pretending to be God;\u201d to the earnest soul a mockery and abomination. Idolatries never so gilded, waited on by heads of the Koreish, will do nothing for this man. Though all men walk by them, what good is it? The great Reality stands glaring there upon him. He there has to answer it, or perish miserably. Now, even now, or else through all Eternity never! Answer it; thou must find an answer.\u2014Ambition? What could all Arabia do for this man; with the crown of Greek Heraclius, of Persian Chosroes, and all crowns in the Earth;\u2014what could they all do for him? It was not of the Earth he wanted to hear tell; it was of the Heaven above and of the Hell beneath. All crowns and sovereignties whatsoever, where would they in a few brief years be? To be Sheik of Mecca or Arabia, and have a bit of gilt wood put into your hand,\u2014will that be one's salvation? I decidedly think, not. We will leave it altogether, this impostor hypothesis, as not credible; not very tolerable even, worthy chiefly of dismissal by us.\n\nMahomet had been wont to retire yearly, during the month Ramadhan, into solitude and silence; as indeed was the Arab custom; a praiseworthy custom, which such a man, above all, would find natural and useful. Communing with his own heart, in the silence of the mountains; himself silent; open to the \u201csmall still voices:\u201d it was a right natural custom! Mahomet was in his fortieth year, when having withdrawn to a cavern in Mount Hara, near Mecca, during this Ramadhan, to pass the month in prayer, and meditation on those great questions, he one day told his wife Kadijah, who with his household was with him or near him this year, That by the unspeakable special favor of Heaven he had now found it all out; was in doubt and darkness no longer, but saw it all. That all these Idols and Formulas were nothing, miserable bits of wood; that there was One God in and over all; and we must leave all Idols, and look to Him. That God is great; and that there is nothing else great! He is the Reality. Wooden Idols are not real; He is real. He made us at first, sustains us yet; we and all things are but the shadow of Him; a transitory garment veiling the Eternal Splendor. \u201cAllah akbar, God is great;\u201d\u2014and then also \u201cIslam,\u201d That we must submit to God. That our whole strength lies in resigned submission to Him, whatsoever He do to us. For this world, and for the other! The thing He sends to us, were it death and worse than death, shall be good, shall be best; we resign ourselves to God.\u2014\u201dIf this be Islam,\u201d says Goethe, \u201cdo we not all live in Islam?\u201d Yes, all of us that have any moral life; we all live so. It has ever been held the highest wisdom for a man not merely to submit to Necessity,\u2014Necessity will make him submit,\u2014but to know and believe well that the stern thing which Necessity had ordered was the wisest, the best, the thing wanted there. To cease his frantic pretension of scanning this great God's-World in his small fraction of a brain; to know that it had verily, though deep beyond his soundings, a Just Law, that the soul of it was Good;\u2014that his part in it was to conform to the Law of the Whole, and in devout silence follow that; not questioning it, obeying it as unquestionable.\n\nI say, this is yet the only true morality known. A man is right and invincible, virtuous and on the road towards sure conquest, precisely while he joins himself to the great deep Law of the World, in spite of all superficial laws, temporary appearances, profit-and-loss calculations; he is victorious while he co-operates with that great central Law, not victorious otherwise:\u2014and surely his first chance of co-operating with it, or getting into the course of it, is to know with his whole soul that it is; that it is good, and alone good! This is the soul of Islam; it is properly the soul of Christianity;\u2014for Islam is definable as a confused form of Christianity; had Christianity not been, neither had it been. Christianity also commands us, before all, to be resigned to God. We are to take no counsel with flesh and blood; give ear to no vain cavils, vain sorrows and wishes: to know that we know nothing; that the worst and cruelest to our eyes is not what it seems; that we have to receive whatsoever befalls us as sent from God above, and say, It is good and wise, God is great! \u201cThough He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.\u201d Islam means in its way Denial of Self, Annihilation of Self. This is yet the highest Wisdom that Heaven has revealed to our Earth.\n\nSuch light had come, as it could, to illuminate the darkness of this wild Arab soul. A confused dazzling splendor as of life and Heaven, in the great darkness which threatened to be death: he called it revelation and the angel Gabriel;\u2014who of us yet can know what to call it? It is the \u201cinspiration of the Almighty\u201d that giveth us understanding. To know; to get into the truth of anything, is ever a mystic act,\u2014of which the best Logics can but babble on the surface. \u201cIs not Belief the true god-announcing Miracle?\u201d says Novalis.\u2014That Mahomet's whole soul, set in flame with this grand Truth vouchsafed him, should feel as if it were important and the only important thing, was very natural. That Providence had unspeakably honored him by revealing it, saving him from death and darkness; that he therefore was bound to make known the same to all creatures: this is what was meant by \u201cMahomet is the Prophet of God;\u201d this too is not without its true meaning.\u2014\n\nThe good Kadijah, we can fancy, listened to him with wonder, with doubt: at length she answered: Yes, it was true this that he said. One can fancy too the boundless gratitude of Mahomet; and how of all the kindnesses she had done him, this of believing the earnest struggling word he now spoke was the greatest. \u201cIt is certain,\u201d says Novalis, \u201cmy Conviction gains infinitely, the moment another soul will believe in it.\u201d It is a boundless favor.\u2014He never forgot this good Kadijah. Long afterwards, Ayesha his young favorite wife, a woman who indeed distinguished herself among the Moslem, by all manner of qualities, through her whole long life; this young brilliant Ayesha was, one day, questioning him: \u201cNow am not I better than Kadijah? She was a widow; old, and had lost her looks: you love me better than you did her?\u201d\u2014\u201dNo, by Allah!\u201d answered Mahomet: \u201cNo, by Allah! She believed in me when none else would believe. In the whole world I had but one friend, and she was that!\u201d\u2014Seid, his Slave, also believed in him; these with his young Cousin Ali, Abu Thaleb's son, were his first converts.\n\nHe spoke of his Doctrine to this man and that; but the most treated it with ridicule, with indifference; in three years, I think, he had gained but thirteen followers. His progress was slow enough. His encouragement to go on, was altogether the usual encouragement that such a man in such a case meets. After some three years of small success, he invited forty of his chief kindred to an entertainment; and there stood up and told them what his pretension was: that he had this thing to promulgate abroad to all men; that it was the highest thing, the one thing: which of them would second him in that? Amid the doubt and silence of all, young Ali, as yet a lad of sixteen, impatient of the silence, started up, and exclaimed in passionate fierce language, That he would! The assembly, among whom was Abu Thaleb, Ali's Father, could not be unfriendly to Mahomet; yet the sight there, of one unlettered elderly man, with a lad of sixteen, deciding on such an enterprise against all mankind, appeared ridiculous to them; the assembly broke up in laughter. Nevertheless it proved not a laughable thing; it was a very serious thing! As for this young Ali, one cannot but like him. A noble-minded creature, as he shows himself, now and always afterwards; full of affection, of fiery daring. Something chivalrous in him; brave as a lion; yet with a grace, a truth and affection worthy of Christian knighthood. He died by assassination in the Mosque at Bagdad; a death occasioned by his own generous fairness, confidence in the fairness of others: he said, If the wound proved not unto death, they must pardon the Assassin; but if it did, then they must slay him straightway, that so they two in the same hour might appear before God, and see which side of that quarrel was the just one!\n\nMahomet naturally gave offence to the Koreish, Keepers of the Caabah, superintendents of the Idols. One or two men of influence had joined him: the thing spread slowly, but it was spreading. Naturally he gave offence to everybody: Who is this that pretends to be wiser than we all; that rebukes us all, as mere fools and worshippers of wood! Abu Thaleb the good Uncle spoke with him: Could he not be silent about all that; believe it all for himself, and not trouble others, anger the chief men, endanger himself and them all, talking of it? Mahomet answered: If the Sun stood on his right hand and the Moon on his left, ordering him to hold his peace, he could not obey! No: there was something in this Truth he had got which was of Nature herself; equal in rank to Sun, or Moon, or whatsoever thing Nature had made. It would speak itself there, so long as the Almighty allowed it, in spite of Sun and Moon, and all Koreish and all men and things. It must do that, and could do no other. Mahomet answered so; and, they say, \u201cburst into tears.\u201d Burst into tears: he felt that Abu Thaleb was good to him; that the task he had got was no soft, but a stern and great one.\n\nHe went on speaking to who would listen to him; publishing his Doctrine among the pilgrims as they came to Mecca; gaining adherents in this place and that. Continual contradiction, hatred, open or secret danger attended him. His powerful relations protected Mahomet himself; but by and by, on his own advice, all his adherents had to quit Mecca, and seek refuge in Abyssinia over the sea. The Koreish grew ever angrier; laid plots, and swore oaths among them, to put Mahomet to death with their own hands. Abu Thaleb was dead, the good Kadijah was dead. Mahomet is not solicitous of sympathy from us; but his outlook at this time was one of the dismalest. He had to hide in caverns, escape in disguise; fly hither and thither; homeless, in continual peril of his life. More than once it seemed all over with him; more than once it turned on a straw, some rider's horse taking fright or the like, whether Mahomet and his Doctrine had not ended there, and not been heard of at all. But it was not to end so.\n\nIn the thirteenth year of his mission, finding his enemies all banded against him, forty sworn men, one out of every tribe, waiting to take his life, and no continuance possible at Mecca for him any longer, Mahomet fled to the place then called Yathreb, where he had gained some adherents; the place they now call Medina, or \u201cMedinat al Nabi, the City of the Prophet,\u201d from that circumstance. It lay some two hundred miles off, through rocks and deserts; not without great difficulty, in such mood as we may fancy, he escaped thither, and found welcome. The whole East dates its era from this Flight, hegira as they name it: the Year 1 of this Hegira is 622 of our Era, the fifty-third of Mahomet's life. He was now becoming an old man; his friends sinking round him one by one; his path desolate, encompassed with danger: unless he could find hope in his own heart, the outward face of things was but hopeless for him. It is so with all men in the like case. Hitherto Mahomet had professed to publish his Religion by the way of preaching and persuasion alone. But now, driven foully out of his native country, since unjust men had not only given no ear to his earnest Heaven's-message, the deep cry of his heart, but would not even let him live if he kept speaking it,\u2014the wild Son of the Desert resolved to defend himself, like a man and Arab. If the Koreish will have it so, they shall have it. Tidings, felt to be of infinite moment to them and all men, they would not listen to these; would trample them down by sheer violence, steel and murder: well, let steel try it then! Ten years more this Mahomet had; all of fighting of breathless impetuous toil and struggle; with what result we know.\n\nMuch has been said of Mahomet's propagating his Religion by the sword. It is no doubt far nobler what we have to boast of the Christian Religion, that it propagated itself peaceably in the way of preaching and conviction. Yet withal, if we take this for an argument of the truth or falsehood of a religion, there is a radical mistake in it. The sword indeed: but where will you get your sword! Every new opinion, at its starting, is precisely in a minority of one. In one man's head alone, there it dwells as yet. One man alone of the whole world believes it; there is one man against all men. That he take a sword, and try to propagate with that, will do little for him. You must first get your sword! On the whole, a thing will propagate itself as it can. We do not find, of the Christian Religion either, that it always disdained the sword, when once it had got one. Charlemagne's conversion of the Saxons was not by preaching. I care little about the sword: I will allow a thing to struggle for itself in this world, with any sword or tongue or implement it has, or can lay hold of. We will let it preach, and pamphleteer, and fight, and to the uttermost bestir itself, and do, beak and claws, whatsoever is in it; very sure that it will, in the long-run, conquer nothing which does not deserve to be conquered. What is better than itself, it cannot put away, but only what is worse. In this great Duel, Nature herself is umpire, and can do no wrong: the thing which is deepest-rooted in Nature, what we call truest, that thing and not the other will be found growing at last.\n\nHere however, in reference to much that there is in Mahomet and his success, we are to remember what an umpire Nature is; what a greatness, composure of depth and tolerance there is in her. You take wheat to cast into the Earth's bosom; your wheat may be mixed with chaff, chopped straw, barn-sweepings, dust and all imaginable rubbish; no matter: you cast it into the kind just Earth; she grows the wheat,\u2014the whole rubbish she silently absorbs, shrouds it in, says nothing of the rubbish. The yellow wheat is growing there; the good Earth is silent about all the rest,\u2014has silently turned all the rest to some benefit too, and makes no complaint about it! So everywhere in Nature! She is true and not a lie; and yet so great, and just, and motherly in her truth. She requires of a thing only that it be genuine of heart; she will protect it if so; will not, if not so. There is a soul of truth in all the things she ever gave harbor to. Alas, is not this the history of all highest Truth that comes or ever came into the world? The body of them all is imperfection, an element of light in darkness: to us they have to come embodied in mere Logic, in some merely scientific Theorem of the Universe; which cannot be complete; which cannot but be found, one day, incomplete, erroneous, and so die and disappear. The body of all Truth dies; and yet in all, I say, there is a soul which never dies; which in new and ever-nobler embodiment lives immortal as man himself! It is the way with Nature. The genuine essence of Truth never dies. That it be genuine, a voice from the great Deep of Nature, there is the point at Nature's judgment-seat. What we call pure or impure, is not with her the final question. Not how much chaff is in you; but whether you have any wheat. Pure? I might say to many a man: Yes, you are pure; pure enough; but you are chaff,\u2014insincere hypothesis, hearsay, formality; you never were in contact with the great heart of the Universe at all; you are properly neither pure nor impure; you are nothing, Nature has no business with you.\nMahomet's Creed we called a kind of Christianity; and really, if we look at the wild rapt earnestness with which it was believed and laid to heart, I should say a better kind than that of those miserable Syrian Sects, with their vain janglings about Homoiousion and Homoousion, the head full of worthless noise, the heart empty and dead! The truth of it is embedded in portentous error and falsehood; but the truth of it makes it be believed, not the falsehood: it succeeded by its truth. A bastard kind of Christianity, but a living kind; with a heart-life in it; not dead, chopping barren logic merely! Out of all that rubbish of Arab idolatries, argumentative theologies, traditions, subtleties, rumors and hypotheses of Greeks and Jews, with their idle wire-drawings, this wild man of the Desert, with his wild sincere heart, earnest as death and life, with his great flashing natural eyesight, had seen into the kernel of the matter. Idolatry is nothing: these Wooden Idols of yours, \u201cye rub them with oil and wax, and the flies stick on them,\u201d\u2014these are wood, I tell you! They can do nothing for you; they are an impotent blasphemous presence; a horror and abomination, if ye knew them. God alone is; God alone has power; He made us, He can kill us and keep us alive: \u201cAllah akbar, God is great.\u201d Understand that His will is the best for you; that howsoever sore to flesh and blood, you will find it the wisest, best: you are bound to take it so; in this world and in the next, you have no other thing that you can do!\n\nAnd now if the wild idolatrous men did believe this, and with their fiery hearts lay hold of it to do it, in what form soever it came to them, I say it was well worthy of being believed. In one form or the other, I say it is still the one thing worthy of being believed by all men. Man does hereby become the high-priest of this Temple of a World. He is in harmony with the Decrees of the Author of this World; cooperating with them, not vainly withstanding them: I know, to this day, no better definition of Duty than that same. All that is right includes itself in this of co-operating with the real Tendency of the World: you succeed by this (the World's Tendency will succeed), you are good, and in the right course there. Homoiousion, Homoousion, vain logical jangle, then or before or at any time, may jangle itself out, and go whither and how it likes: this is the thing it all struggles to mean, if it would mean anything. If it do not succeed in meaning this, it means nothing. Not that Abstractions, logical Propositions, be correctly worded or incorrectly; but that living concrete Sons of Adam do lay this to heart: that is the important point. Islam devoured all these vain jangling Sects; and I think had right to do so. It was a Reality, direct from the great Heart of Nature once more. Arab idolatries, Syrian formulas, whatsoever was not equally real, had to go up in flame,\u2014mere dead fuel, in various senses, for this which was fire.\n\nIt was during these wild warfarings and strugglings, especially after the Flight to Mecca, that Mahomet dictated at intervals his Sacred Book, which they name Koran, or Reading, \u201cThing to be read.\u201d This is the Work he and his disciples made so much of, asking all the world, Is not that a miracle? The Mahometans regard their Koran with a reverence which few Christians pay even to their Bible. It is admitted every where as the standard of all law and all practice; the thing to be gone upon in speculation and life; the message sent direct out of Heaven, which this Earth has to conform to, and walk by; the thing to be read. Their Judges decide by it; all Moslem are bound to study it, seek in it for the light of their life. They have mosques where it is all read daily; thirty relays of priests take it up in succession, get through the whole each day. There, for twelve hundred years, has the voice of this Book, at all moments, kept sounding through the ears and the hearts of so many men. We hear of Mahometan Doctors that had read it seventy thousand times!\n\nVery curious: if one sought for \u201cdiscrepancies of national taste,\u201d here surely were the most eminent instance of that! We also can read the Koran; our Translation of it, by Sale, is known to be a very fair one. I must say, it is as toilsome reading as I ever undertook. A wearisome confused jumble, crude, incondite; endless iterations, long-windedness, entanglement; most crude, incondite;\u2014insupportable stupidity, in short! Nothing but a sense of duty could carry any European through the Koran. We read in it, as we might in the State-Paper Office, unreadable masses of lumber, that perhaps we may get some glimpses of a remarkable man. It is true we have it under disadvantages: the Arabs see more method in it than we. Mahomet's followers found the Koran lying all in fractions, as it had been written down at first promulgation; much of it, they say, on shoulder-blades of mutton, flung pell-mell into a chest: and they published it, without any discoverable order as to time or otherwise;\u2014merely trying, as would seem, and this not very strictly, to put the longest chapters first. The real beginning of it, in that way, lies almost at the end: for the earliest portions were the shortest. Read in its historical sequence it perhaps would not be so bad. Much of it, too, they say, is rhythmic; a kind of wild chanting song, in the original. This may be a great point; much perhaps has been lost in the Translation here. Yet with every allowance, one feels it difficult to see how any mortal ever could consider this Koran as a Book written in Heaven, too good for the Earth; as a well-written book, or indeed as a book at all; and not a bewildered rhapsody; written, so far as writing goes, as badly as almost any book ever was! So much for national discrepancies, and the standard of taste.\n\nYet I should say, it was not unintelligible how the Arabs might so love it. When once you get this confused coil of a Koran fairly off your hands, and have it behind you at a distance, the essential type of it begins to disclose itself; and in this there is a merit quite other than the literary one. If a book come from the heart, it will contrive to reach other hearts; all art and author-craft are of small amount to that. One would say the primary character of the Koran is this of its genuineness, of its being a bona-fide book. Prideaux, I know, and others have represented it as a mere bundle of juggleries; chapter after chapter got up to excuse and varnish the author's successive sins, forward his ambitions and quackeries: but really it is time to dismiss all that. I do not assert Mahomet's continual sincerity: who is continually sincere? But I confess I can make nothing of the critic, in these times, who would accuse him of deceit prepense; of conscious deceit generally, or perhaps at all;\u2014still more, of living in a mere element of conscious deceit, and writing this Koran as a forger and juggler would have done! Every candid eye, I think, will read the Koran far otherwise than so. It is the confused ferment of a great rude human soul; rude, untutored, that cannot even read; but fervent, earnest, struggling vehemently to utter itself in words. With a kind of breathless intensity he strives to utter himself; the thoughts crowd on him pell-mell: for very multitude of things to say, he can get nothing said. The meaning that is in him shapes itself into no form of composition, is stated in no sequence, method, or coherence;\u2014they are not shaped at all, these thoughts of his; flung out unshaped, as they struggle and tumble there, in their chaotic inarticulate state. We said \u201cstupid:\u201d yet natural stupidity is by no means the character of Mahomet's Book; it is natural uncultivation rather. The man has not studied speaking; in the haste and pressure of continual fighting, has not time to mature himself into fit speech. The panting breathless haste and vehemence of a man struggling in the thick of battle for life and salvation; this is the mood he is in! A headlong haste; for very magnitude of meaning, he cannot get himself articulated into words. The successive utterances of a soul in that mood, colored by the various vicissitudes of three-and-twenty years; now well uttered, now worse: this is the Koran.\n\nFor we are to consider Mahomet, through these three-and-twenty years, as the centre of a world wholly in conflict. Battles with the Koreish and Heathen, quarrels among his own people, backslidings of his own wild heart; all this kept him in a perpetual whirl, his soul knowing rest no more. In wakeful nights, as one may fancy, the wild soul of the man, tossing amid these vortices, would hail any light of a decision for them as a veritable light from Heaven; any making-up of his mind, so blessed, indispensable for him there, would seem the inspiration of a Gabriel. Forger and juggler? No, no! This great fiery heart, seething, simmering like a great furnace of thoughts, was not a juggler's. His Life was a Fact to him; this God's Universe an awful Fact and Reality. He has faults enough. The man was an uncultured semi-barbarous Son of Nature, much of the Bedouin still clinging to him: we must take him for that. But for a wretched Simulacrum, a hungry Impostor without eyes or heart, practicing for a mess of pottage such blasphemous swindlery, forgery of celestial documents, continual high-treason against his Maker and Self, we will not and cannot take him.\n\nSincerity, in all senses, seems to me the merit of the Koran; what had rendered it precious to the wild Arab men. It is, after all, the first and last merit in a book; gives rise to merits of all kinds,\u2014nay, at bottom, it alone can give rise to merit of any kind. Curiously, through these incondite masses of tradition, vituperation, complaint, ejaculation in the Koran, a vein of true direct insight, of what we might almost call poetry, is found straggling. The body of the Book is made up of mere tradition, and as it were vehement enthusiastic extempore preaching. He returns forever to the old stories of the Prophets as they went current in the Arab memory: how Prophet after Prophet, the Prophet Abraham, the Prophet Hud, the Prophet Moses, Christian and other real and fabulous Prophets, had come to this Tribe and to that, warning men of their sin; and been received by them even as he Mahomet was,\u2014which is a great solace to him. These things he repeats ten, perhaps twenty times; again and ever again, with wearisome iteration; has never done repeating them. A brave Samuel Johnson, in his forlorn garret, might con over the Biographies of Authors in that way! This is the great staple of the Koran. But curiously, through all this, comes ever and anon some glance as of the real thinker and seer. He has actually an eye for the world, this Mahomet: with a certain directness and rugged vigor, he brings home still, to our heart, the thing his own heart has been opened to. I make but little of his praises of Allah, which many praise; they are borrowed I suppose mainly from the Hebrew, at least they are far surpassed there. But the eye that flashes direct into the heart of things, and sees the truth of them; this is to me a highly interesting object. Great Nature's own gift; which she bestows on all; but which only one in the thousand does not cast sorrowfully away: it is what I call sincerity of vision; the test of a sincere heart.\n\nMahomet can work no miracles; he often answers impatiently: I can work no miracles. I? \u201cI am a Public Preacher;\u201d appointed to preach this doctrine to all creatures. Yet the world, as we can see, had really from of old been all one great miracle to him. Look over the world, says he; is it not wonderful, the work of Allah; wholly \u201ca sign to you,\u201d if your eyes were open! This Earth, God made it for you; \u201cappointed paths in it;\u201d you can live in it, go to and fro on it.\u2014The clouds in the dry country of Arabia, to Mahomet they are very wonderful: Great clouds, he says, born in the deep bosom of the Upper Immensity, where do they come from! They hang there, the great black monsters; pour down their rain-deluges \u201cto revive a dead earth,\u201d and grass springs, and \u201ctall leafy palm-trees with their date-clusters hanging round. Is not that a sign?\u201d Your cattle too,\u2014Allah made them; serviceable dumb creatures; they change the grass into milk; you have your clothing from them, very strange creatures; they come ranking home at evening-time, \u201cand,\u201d adds he, \u201cand are a credit to you!\u201d Ships also,\u2014he talks often about ships: Huge moving mountains, they spread out their cloth wings, go bounding through the water there, Heaven's wind driving them; anon they lie motionless, God has withdrawn the wind, they lie dead, and cannot stir! Miracles? cries he: What miracle would you have? Are not you yourselves there? God made you, \u201cshaped you out of a little clay.\u201d Ye were small once; a few years ago ye were not at all. Ye have beauty, strength, thoughts, \u201cye have compassion on one another.\u201d Old age comes on you, and gray hairs; your strength fades into feebleness; ye sink down, and again are not. \u201cYe have compassion on one another:\u201d this struck me much: Allah might have made you having no compassion on one another,\u2014how had it been then! This is a great direct thought, a glance at first-hand into the very fact of things. Rude vestiges of poetic genius, of whatsoever is best and truest, are visible in this man. A strong untutored intellect; eyesight, heart: a strong wild man,\u2014might have shaped himself into Poet, King, Priest, any kind of Hero.\n\nTo his eyes it is forever clear that this world wholly is miraculous. He sees what, as we said once before, all great thinkers, the rude Scandinavians themselves, in one way or other, have contrived to see: That this so solid-looking material world is, at bottom, in very deed, Nothing; is a visual and factual Manifestation of God's power and presence,\u2014a shadow hung out by Him on the bosom of the void Infinite; nothing more. The mountains, he says, these great rock-mountains, they shall dissipate themselves \u201clike clouds;\u201d melt into the Blue as clouds do, and not be! He figures the Earth, in the Arab fashion, Sale tells us, as an immense Plain or flat Plate of ground, the mountains are set on that to steady it. At the Last Day they shall disappear \u201clike clouds;\u201d the whole Earth shall go spinning, whirl itself off into wreck, and as dust and vapor vanish in the Inane. Allah withdraws his hand from it, and it ceases to be. The universal empire of Allah, presence everywhere of an unspeakable Power, a Splendor, and a Terror not to be named, as the true force, essence and reality, in all things whatsoever, was continually clear to this man. What a modern talks of by the name, Forces of Nature, Laws of Nature; and does not figure as a divine thing; not even as one thing at all, but as a set of things, undivine enough,\u2014salable, curious, good for propelling steamships! With our Sciences and Cyclopaedias, we are apt to forget the divineness, in those laboratories of ours. We ought not to forget it! That once well forgotten, I know not what else were worth remembering. Most sciences, I think were then a very dead thing; withered, contentious, empty;\u2014a thistle in late autumn. The best science, without this, is but as the dead timber; it is not the growing tree and forest,\u2014which gives ever-new timber, among other things! Man cannot know either, unless he can worship in some way. His knowledge is a pedantry, and dead thistle, otherwise.\n\nMuch has been said and written about the sensuality of Mahomet's Religion; more than was just. The indulgences, criminal to us, which he permitted, were not of his appointment; he found them practiced, unquestioned from immemorial time in Arabia; what he did was to curtail them, restrict them, not on one but on many sides. His Religion is not an easy one: with rigorous fasts, lavations, strict complex formulas, prayers five times a day, and abstinence from wine, it did not \u201csucceed by being an easy religion.\u201d As if indeed any religion, or cause holding of religion, could succeed by that! It is a calumny on men to say that they are roused to heroic action by ease, hope of pleasure, recompense,\u2014sugar-plums of any kind, in this world or the next! In the meanest mortal there lies something nobler. The poor swearing soldier, hired to be shot, has his \u201chonor of a soldier,\u201d different from drill-regulations and the shilling a day. It is not to taste sweet things, but to do noble and true things, and vindicate himself under God's Heaven as a god-made Man, that the poorest son of Adam dimly longs. Show him the way of doing that, the dullest day-drudge kindles into a hero. They wrong man greatly who say he is to be seduced by ease. Difficulty, abnegation, martyrdom, death are the allurements that act on the heart of man. Kindle the inner genial life of him, you have a flame that burns up all lower considerations. Not happiness, but something higher: one sees this even in the frivolous classes, with their \u201cpoint of honor\u201d and the like. Not by flattering our appetites; no, by awakening the Heroic that slumbers in every heart, can any Religion gain followers.\n\nMahomet himself, after all that can be said about him, was not a sensual man. We shall err widely if we consider this man as a common voluptuary, intent mainly on base enjoyments,\u2014nay on enjoyments of any kind. His household was of the frugalest; his common diet barley-bread and water: sometimes for months there was not a fire once lighted on his hearth. They record with just pride that he would mend his own shoes, patch his own cloak. A poor, hard-toiling, ill-provided man; careless of what vulgar men toil for. Not a bad man, I should say; something better in him than hunger of any sort,\u2014or these wild Arab men, fighting and jostling three-and-twenty years at his hand, in close contact with him always, would not have reverenced him so! They were wild men, bursting ever and anon into quarrel, into all kinds of fierce sincerity; without right worth and manhood, no man could have commanded them. They called him Prophet, you say? Why, he stood there face to face with them; bare, not enshrined in any mystery; visibly clouting his own cloak, cobbling his own shoes; fighting, counselling, ordering in the midst of them: they must have seen what kind of a man he was, let him be called what you like! No emperor with his tiaras was obeyed as this man in a cloak of his own clouting. During three-and-twenty years of rough actual trial. I find something of a veritable Hero necessary for that, of itself.\n\nHis last words are a prayer; broken ejaculations of a heart struggling up, in trembling hope, towards its Maker. We cannot say that his religion made him worse; it made him better; good, not bad. Generous things are recorded of him: when he lost his Daughter, the thing he answers is, in his own dialect, every way sincere, and yet equivalent to that of Christians, \u201cThe Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; blessed be the name of the Lord.\u201d He answered in like manner of Seid, his emancipated well-beloved Slave, the second of the believers. Seid had fallen in the War of Tabuc, the first of Mahomet's fightings with the Greeks. Mahomet said, It was well; Seid had done his Master's work, Seid had now gone to his Master: it was all well with Seid. Yet Seid's daughter found him weeping over the body;\u2014the old gray-haired man melting in tears! \u201cWhat do I see?\u201d said she.\u2014\u201dYou see a friend weeping over his friend.\u201d\u2014He went out for the last time into the mosque, two days before his death; asked, If he had injured any man? Let his own back bear the stripes. If he owed any man? A voice answered, \u201cYes, me three drachms,\u201d borrowed on such an occasion. Mahomet ordered them to be paid: \u201cBetter be in shame now,\u201d said he, \u201cthan at the Day of Judgment.\u201d\u2014You remember Kadijah, and the \u201cNo, by Allah!\u201d Traits of that kind show us the genuine man, the brother of us all, brought visible through twelve centuries,\u2014the veritable Son of our common Mother.\n\nWithal I like Mahomet for his total freedom from cant. He is a rough self-helping son of the wilderness; does not pretend to be what he is not. There is no ostentatious pride in him; but neither does he go much upon humility: he is there as he can be, in cloak and shoes of his own clouting; speaks plainly to all manner of Persian Kings, Greek Emperors, what it is they are bound to do; knows well enough, about himself, \u201cthe respect due unto thee.\u201d In a life-and-death war with Bedouins, cruel things could not fail; but neither are acts of mercy, of noble natural pity and generosity wanting. Mahomet makes no apology for the one, no boast of the other. They were each the free dictate of his heart; each called for, there and then. Not a mealy-mouthed man! A candid ferocity, if the case call for it, is in him; he does not mince matters! The War of Tabuc is a thing he often speaks of: his men refused, many of them, to march on that occasion; pleaded the heat of the weather, the harvest, and so forth; he can never forget that. Your harvest? It lasts for a day. What will become of your harvest through all Eternity? Hot weather? Yes, it was hot; \u201cbut Hell will be hotter!\u201d Sometimes a rough sarcasm turns up: He says to the unbelievers, Ye shall have the just measure of your deeds at that Great Day. They will be weighed out to you; ye shall not have short weight!\u2014Everywhere he fixes the matter in his eye; he sees it: his heart, now and then, is as if struck dumb by the greatness of it. \u201cAssuredly,\u201d he says: that word, in the Koran, is written down sometimes as a sentence by itself: \u201cAssuredly.\u201d\n\nNo Dilettantism in this Mahomet; it is a business of Reprobation and Salvation with him, of Time and Eternity: he is in deadly earnest about it! Dilettantism, hypothesis, speculation, a kind of amateur-search for Truth, toying and coquetting with Truth: this is the sorest sin. The root of all other imaginable sins. It consists in the heart and soul of the man never having been open to Truth;\u2014\u201dliving in a vain show.\u201d Such a man not only utters and produces falsehoods, but is himself a falsehood. The rational moral principle, spark of the Divinity, is sunk deep in him, in quiet paralysis of life-death. The very falsehoods of Mahomet are truer than the truths of such a man. He is the insincere man: smooth-polished, respectable in some times and places; inoffensive, says nothing harsh to anybody; most cleanly,\u2014just as carbonic acid is, which is death and poison.\n\nWe will not praise Mahomet's moral precepts as always of the superfinest sort; yet it can be said that there is always a tendency to good in them; that they are the true dictates of a heart aiming towards what is just and true. The sublime forgiveness of Christianity, turning of the other cheek when the one has been smitten, is not here: you are to revenge yourself, but it is to be in measure, not overmuch, or beyond justice. On the other hand, Islam, like any great Faith, and insight into the essence of man, is a perfect equalizer of men: the soul of one believer outweighs all earthly kingships; all men, according to Islam too, are equal. Mahomet insists not on the propriety of giving alms, but on the necessity of it: he marks down by law how much you are to give, and it is at your peril if you neglect. The tenth part of a man's annual income, whatever that may be, is the property of the poor, of those that are afflicted and need help. Good all this: the natural voice of humanity, of pity and equity dwelling in the heart of this wild Son of Nature speaks so.\n\nMahomet's Paradise is sensual, his Hell sensual: true; in the one and the other there is enough that shocks all spiritual feeling in us. But we are to recollect that the Arabs already had it so; that Mahomet, in whatever he changed of it, softened and diminished all this. The worst sensualities, too, are the work of doctors, followers of his, not his work. In the Koran there is really very little said about the joys of Paradise; they are intimated rather than insisted on. Nor is it forgotten that the highest joys even there shall be spiritual; the pure Presence of the Highest, this shall infinitely transcend all other joys. He says, \u201cYour salutation shall be, Peace.\u201d Salam, Have Peace!\u2014the thing that all rational souls long for, and seek, vainly here below, as the one blessing. \u201cYe shall sit on seats, facing one another: all grudges shall be taken away out of your hearts.\u201d All grudges! Ye shall love one another freely; for each of you, in the eyes of his brothers, there will be Heaven enough!\n\nIn reference to this of the sensual Paradise and Mahomet's sensuality, the sorest chapter of all for us, there were many things to be said; which it is not convenient to enter upon here. Two remarks only I shall make, and therewith leave it to your candor. The first is furnished me by Goethe; it is a casual hint of his which seems well worth taking note of. In one of his Delineations, in Meister's Travels it is, the hero comes upon a Society of men with very strange ways, one of which was this: \u201cWe require,\u201d says the Master, \u201cthat each of our people shall restrict himself in one direction,\u201d shall go right against his desire in one matter, and make himself do the thing he does not wish, \u201cshould we allow him the greater latitude on all other sides.\u201d There seems to me a great justness in this. Enjoying things which are pleasant; that is not the evil: it is the reducing of our moral self to slavery by them that is. Let a man assert withal that he is king over his habitudes; that he could and would shake them off, on cause shown: this is an excellent law. The Month Ramadhan for the Moslem, much in Mahomet's Religion, much in his own Life, bears in that direction; if not by forethought, or clear purpose of moral improvement on his part, then by a certain healthy manful instinct, which is as good.\n\nBut there is another thing to be said about the Mahometan Heaven and Hell. This namely, that, however gross and material they may be, they are an emblem of an everlasting truth, not always so well remembered elsewhere. That gross sensual Paradise of his; that horrible flaming Hell; the great enormous Day of Judgment he perpetually insists on: what is all this but a rude shadow, in the rude Bedouin imagination, of that grand spiritual Fact, and Beginning of Facts, which it is ill for us too if we do not all know and feel: the Infinite Nature of Duty? That man's actions here are of infinite moment to him, and never die or end at all; that man, with his little life, reaches upwards high as Heaven, downwards low as Hell, and in his threescore years of Time holds an Eternity fearfully and wonderfully hidden: all this had burnt itself, as in flame-characters, into the wild Arab soul. As in flame and lightning, it stands written there; awful, unspeakable, ever present to him. With bursting earnestness, with a fierce savage sincerity, half-articulating, not able to articulate, he strives to speak it, bodies it forth in that Heaven and that Hell. Bodied forth in what way you will, it is the first of all truths. It is venerable under all embodiments. What is the chief end of man here below? Mahomet has answered this question, in a way that might put some of us to shame! He does not, like a Bentham, a Paley, take Right and Wrong, and calculate the profit and loss, ultimate pleasure of the one and of the other; and summing all up by addition and subtraction into a net result, ask you, Whether on the whole the Right does not preponderate considerably? No; it is not better to do the one than the other; the one is to the other as life is to death,\u2014as Heaven is to Hell. The one must in nowise be done, the other in nowise left undone. You shall not measure them; they are incommensurable: the one is death eternal to a man, the other is life eternal. Benthamee Utility, virtue by Profit and Loss; reducing this God's-world to a dead brute Steam-engine, the infinite celestial Soul of Man to a kind of Hay-balance for weighing hay and thistles on, pleasures and pains on:\u2014If you ask me which gives, Mahomet or they, the beggarlier and falser view of Man and his Destinies in this Universe, I will answer, it is not Mahomet\u2014!\n\nOn the whole, we will repeat that this Religion of Mahomet's is a kind of Christianity; has a genuine element of what is spiritually highest looking through it, not to be hidden by all its imperfections. The Scandinavian God Wish, the god of all rude men,\u2014this has been enlarged into a Heaven by Mahomet; but a Heaven symbolical of sacred Duty, and to be earned by faith and well-doing, by valiant action, and a divine patience which is still more valiant. It is Scandinavian Paganism, and a truly celestial element superadded to that. Call it not false; look not at the falsehood of it, look at the truth of it. For these twelve centuries, it has been the religion and life-guidance of the fifth part of the whole kindred of Mankind. Above all things, it has been a religion heartily believed. These Arabs believe their religion, and try to live by it! No Christians, since the early ages, or only perhaps the English Puritans in modern times, have ever stood by their Faith as the Moslem do by theirs,\u2014believing it wholly, fronting Time with it, and Eternity with it. This night the watchman on the streets of Cairo when he cries, \u201cWho goes?\u201d will hear from the passenger, along with his answer, \u201cThere is no God but God.\u201d Allah akbar, Islam, sounds through the souls, and whole daily existence, of these dusky millions. Zealous missionaries preach it abroad among Malays, black Papuans, brutal Idolaters;\u2014displacing what is worse, nothing that is better or good.\n\nTo the Arab Nation it was as a birth from darkness into light; Arabia first became alive by means of it. A poor shepherd people, roaming unnoticed in its deserts since the creation of the world: a Hero-Prophet was sent down to them with a word they could believe: see, the unnoticed becomes world-notable, the small has grown world-great; within one century afterwards, Arabia is at Grenada on this hand, at Delhi on that;\u2014glancing in valor and splendor and the light of genius, Arabia shines through long ages over a great section of the world. Belief is great, life-giving. The history of a Nation becomes fruitful, soul-elevating, great, so soon as it believes. These Arabs, the man Mahomet, and that one century,\u2014is it not as if a spark had fallen, one spark, on a world of what seemed black unnoticeable sand; but lo, the sand proves explosive powder, blazes heaven-high from Delhi to Grenada! I said, the Great Man was always as lightning out of Heaven; the rest of men waited for him like fuel, and then they too would flame.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

camped at the edge of town\nThe one who has the dancing bear\nThat follows him around\nAnd he lifts his big foot up\nPuts his big foot down\nThen bows..then twirls..\nThen dances round and round\n\nI found I was a cabin boy\nLast night as I did dream\nBound aboard a magic ship\nFor a land I'd never seen\n\nAnd the moon she filled our sails\nAnd the stars they steered our course\nAnd on..our bow..\nThere was a golden horse\n\nThe queen eats fruit and candy\nThe bishop nuts and cheese\nAnd when I am a grown man\nI'll taste just what i please\n\nThe honey from the bee\nThe shellfish from the sea\nThe earth, the wind, a girl\nSomeone to share these things with me\n\nI wouldn't want to be a chimney sweep\nAll black from head to foot\nFrom climbing in them chimneys\nAnd cleaning out that

are lucky, some are not\nBut just be thankful for what you've got\n\nMany times, it seems to me\nThere's someone else I'd rather be\nLiving in a world of make-believe\nTo stay in bed 'til nearly three\nWith nothing there to worry me\nWould seem to be the life I might achieve\n\nBut deep inside, I know I'm really lucky\nWith happiness I've never known before\nAnd just as long as you are there beside me\nI know that I could ask for nothing more\n\nThen living can start\nWith the love in your heart\nSo, with you all the time\nAll the treasures I've longed for are mine\nYou might also likeThe

feel ill at ease\nOne man's temper might rise\nWhile the other man's temper might freeze\nIn the days of long confessions, we cannot mock a soul\nAh, when there's too much of nothin' no one has control\n\n[Chorus]\nSay hello to Valerie, say hello to Marion\nSend them all my salary on the waters of oblivion\n[Verse 2]\nToo much of nothin' can make a man abuse a king\nHe can walk the streets and boast like most (Walk the streets)\nBut he don't know a thing\nIt's all been done before, it's all been written in the book (Now)\nBut when it's too much of nothin', nobody should look\n\n[Chorus]\nSay hello to Valerie, say hello to Marion\nSend them all my salary on the waters of oblivion\n\n[Verse 3]\nToo much of nothin' can turn a man into a liar\nIt can cause some man to sleep on nails\nAnother man to eat fire\nEverybody's doin' somethin', I heard it in a dream\nBut when it's too much of nothin', it just makes a fella mean\n\n[Chorus]\nSay hello to Valerie, say hello to Marion\nSend them all my salary on the waters of oblivionYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/852672", "artist_names": "Brenton Wood",

Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\n\nThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and oft were they won't to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name H.M.S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.\n\n\u2014Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of water.\n\nAnd baby prattled after her:\n\n\u2014A jink a jink a jawbo.\n\nCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.\nBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman's house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.\n\n\u2014Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.\n\nHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister's word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure. His little man-o'-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life's tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn't be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.\n\n\u2014Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.\n\nShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:\n\n\u2014What's your name? Butter and cream?\n\n\u2014Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your sweetheart?\n\n\u2014Nao, tearful Tommy said.\n\n\u2014Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.\n\n\u2014Nao, Tommy said.\n\n\u2014I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy's sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy's sweetheart.\n\n\u2014Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.\n\nCissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes.\nBut who was Gerty?\nGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch's female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she'd never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty's were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy's words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God's fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.\n\nFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers' quarrel. As per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn't go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.\n\nGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the Lady's Pictorial that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty's chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn't trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching the things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers' meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn't of a Friday.\n\nAnd yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in love, a woman's birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer's (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie's strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.\n\nAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn't like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap's lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery's summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.\n\nEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.\n\n\u2014You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It's my ball.\n\nBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.\n\n\u2014Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.\n\nAnd she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played here's the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.\n\n\u2014I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't say.\n\n\u2014On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.\nGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.\n\n\u2014Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I'd look at him.\n\nMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes. For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There was none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.\n\nAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ. It was the men's temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty's ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson's Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.\n\nAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee or My love and cottage near Rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for supper and when he sang The moon hath raised with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mother's birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn't even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby's cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.\n\nA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't like her mother's taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer's christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a story behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker's pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.\n\nThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty's skirt near the little pool by the rock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn't come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.\n\n\u2014If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.\n\nGerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.\n\nThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin's intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.\n\nThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn't the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.\n\n\u2014Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.\n\nAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.\n\n\u2014Haja ja ja haja.\n\nCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:\n\n\u2014Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.\n\nAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.\n\nGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer. She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retrouss\u00e9 from where he was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn't got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.\n\nRefuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. Ora pro nobis. Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin's sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O'Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature's laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours' adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.\n\nThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little monkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.\n\n\u2014Jacky! Tommy!\n\nNot they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she'd ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow long because it wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble. Tableau! That would have been a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness.\n\nQueen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn't because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O'Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the Tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the Tantumer gosa cramen tum. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow's of George's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.\n\nCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl's shoulders\u2014a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman's instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.\n\nEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said to Gerty:\n\n\u2014A penny for your thoughts.\n\n\u2014What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I was only wondering was it late.\n\nBecause she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.\n\n\u2014Wait, said Cissy, I'll run ask my uncle Peter over there what's the time by his conundrum.\n\nSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.\n\nCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.\n\nThen they sang the second verse of the Tantum ergo and Canon O'Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man's passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man's face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.\n\nEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out Panem de coelo praestitisti eis and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt\u2014O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was. Gerty's lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.\n\n\u2014O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year.\n\nHer words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss puny little Edy's countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.\n\nEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.\n\n\u2014O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.\n\nThe slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.\n\nGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O'Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.\n\nHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book The Lamplighter by Miss Cummins, author of Mabel Vaughan and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely's of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. Art thou real, my ideal? it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about twilight, wilt thou ever? and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it. But it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if\u2014what then? Would it make a very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl's honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understand him because men were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.\n\nCanon O'Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang Laudate Dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn't she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:\n\n\u2014O, look, Cissy!\n\nAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.\n\n\u2014It's fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.\n\nAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running.\n\n\u2014Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It's the bazaar fireworks.\n\nBut Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and call. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, pasion silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she'd never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn't do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors' photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.\n\nAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn't ashamed and he wasn't either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn't resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl's love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!\n\nThen all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl He was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don't tell.\n\nCissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried:\n\n\u2014Gerty! Gerty! We're going. Come on. We can see from farther up.\n\nGerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he's too far to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.\n\nSlowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because\u2014because Gerty MacDowell was...\n\nTight boots? No. She's lame! O!\n\nMr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That's why she's left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn't know it when she was on show. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn't mind. Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate. Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she. Something in the air. That's the moon. But then why don't all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends on the time they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of that. Damned glad I didn't do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this morning. That gouger M'Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for small mercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves. Their natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices. Reserve better. Don't want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O. Pity they can't see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy's hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? Lingerie does it. Felt for the curves inside her deshabill\u00e9. Excites them also when they're. I'm all clean come and dirty me. And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly's new blouse. At first. Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just changes when you're on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn't in a hurry either. Always off to a fellow when they are. They never forget an appointment. Out on spec probably. They believe in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each other's necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can't get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I'll write to you. Now won't you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon. Tableau! O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all? What have you been doing with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in each other's appearance. You're looking splendid. Sister souls. Showing their teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn't lend each other a pinch of salt.\n\nAh!\n\nDevils they are when that's coming on them. Dark devilish appearance. Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my foot. O that way! O, that's exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest once in a way. Wonder if it's bad to go with them then. Safe in one way. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she's a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt 1. When you feel like that you often meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn't let her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can't be so if Molly. Took off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair strong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly's combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not? All a prejudice. She's worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. What? I think so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? And the day I went to Drimmie's without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he's another. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use to clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?\n\nO, he did. Into her. She did. Done.\n\nAh!\n\nMr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant. Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don't care. Complimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies. Well, aren't they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. Amours of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives a man. That's the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn't have. Makes you want to sing after. Lacaus esant taratara. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you don't know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she's on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It's so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don't answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn't called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That's what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other chap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don't think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they change the venue when it's not what they like. Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.\n\nThere she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in mother's clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could whistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore in Jammet's wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling me the right time? I'll tell you the right time up a dark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.\n\nDidn't look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn't give that satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine eyes she had, clear. It's the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog's jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see them sit on a bench marked Wet Paint. Eyes all over them. Look under the bed for what's not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Typist going up Roger Greene's stairs two at a time to show her understandings. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman's eye on a mirror. And when I sent her for Molly's Paisley shawl to Prescott's by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries parcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you learn that from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don't they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly's dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.\n\nA monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks. Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling, I saw, your. I saw all.\n\nLord!\n\nDid me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. For this relief much thanks. In Hamlet, that is. Lord! It was all things combined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He's right. Might have made a worse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I will tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It couldn't be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin's barn a blind.\n\nHer maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.\n\nPlace made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw anything straight at school. Crooked as a ram's horn. Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa's pants will soon fit Willy and fuller's earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them out of harm's way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam. Children's hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. Oughtn't to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace. That young doctor O'Hare I noticed her brushing his coat. And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the husband. Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe the women's fault also. That's where Molly can knock spots off them. It's the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt for the opulent. Just compare for instance those others. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. Always see a fellow's weak point in his wife. Still there's destiny in it, falling in love. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn't take them in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them he matched them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes one. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and repent in December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is not back. Better detach.\n\nOw!\n\nOther hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch. Wristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I suppose, at once. Cat's away, the mice will play. I remember looking in Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. And time, well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it's all arranged. Magnetic needle tells you what's going on in the sun, the stars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come. Come. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you're a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.\n\nWonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine voice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like flowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the paint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn't hear. But lots of them can't kick the beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.\n\nWait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That's her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave you this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. What is it? Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She'd like scent of that kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there's some connection. For instance if you go into a cellar where it's dark. Mysterious thing too. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure. Suppose it's ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It's like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they're always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too. Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There or the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something. Muskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years. Dogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way. We're the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.\n\nPerhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink gives that. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like flies round treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The tree of forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to. That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life. And it's extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.\n\nMr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat. Almonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that's the soap.\n\nO by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never went back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could mention Meagher's just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph. Two and nine. Bad opinion of me he'll have. Call tomorrow. How much do I owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving credit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else.\n\nHere's this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as far as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had a good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walk a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still you learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as women don't mock what matter? That's the way to find out. Ask yourself who is he now. The Mystery Man on the Beach, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his kismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain they say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body feels the atmosphere. Old Betty's joints are on the rack. Mother Shipton's prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills seem coming nigh.\n\nHowth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or they might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of the dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds flash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt you. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through the small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against. Scowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest. Roygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. A star I see. Venus? Can't tell yet. Two. When three it's night. Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No. Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of the setting sun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native land, goodnight.\n\nDew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white fluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the position. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don't know how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green apples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it's the only time we cross legs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy chairs under them. But it's the evening influence. They feel all that. Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat Dillon's garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length oilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns. History repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I'm with you once again. Life, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity. They take advantage.\n\nAll quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The rhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the plumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change: that's all. Lovers: yum yum.\n\nTired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it comes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the same. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing new under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin's Barn. Are you not happy in your? Naughty darling. At Dolphin's barn charades in Luke Doyle's house. Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he and she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip: tear in Henny Doyle's overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle: cockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She leaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty from the dew.\n\nBa. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I'm a tree, so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very likely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him out, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray for us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition. Same thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there's the light in the priest's house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom's. Twentyeight it is. Two houses they have. Gabriel Conroy's brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out at night like mice. They're a mixed breed. Birds are like hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit still. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white. Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants to stamp his trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with three colours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the City Arms with the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different colours. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That's how that wise man what's his name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes on fire. It can't be tourists' matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory's not so bad.\n\nBa. Who knows what they're always flying for. Insects? That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be the one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what they say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. Faugh a Ballagh! Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really because it's round. Wife in every port they say. She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail end of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor's weighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well. And the tephilim no what's this they call it poor papa's father had on his door to touch. That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage. Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that's the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish ever get seasick?\n\nThen you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones' locker, moon looking down so peaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.\n\nA last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer's hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The shepherd's hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o'clock postman, the glowworm's lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy's terrace. By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup race! and from the door of Dignam's house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat flew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.\n\nLife those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish Lights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and breeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin's King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Don't know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean. But being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I didn't want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with masks too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I'll murder you. Is it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can people aim guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting better asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when you touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I remember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one is more sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista. O'Hara's tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I'd marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht. Buenas noches, se\u00f1orita. El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa. Why me? Because you were so foreign from the others.\n\nBetter not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you dull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for Leah, Lily of Killarney. No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital to see. Hope she's over. Long day I've had. Martha, the bath, funeral, house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus' song. Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan's. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in company. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me. Look at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he meant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early morning at close range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. But Dignam's put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for granted we're going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer's that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium. Her widow's mite. Well? What do you expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor man O'Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter face and a large apron. Ladies' grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say. Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed. Curse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She had red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does? Would I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti's gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes's. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in them. What's that? Might be money.\n\nMr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He brought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can't read. Better go. Better. I'm tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and pebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children always want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters. What's this? Bit of stick.\n\nO! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers do. Will I?\n\nMr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a message for her. Might remain. What?\nI.\n\nSome flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide comes here. Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters. O, those transparent! Besides they don't know. What is the meaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not like.\nAM. A.\n\nNo room. Let it go.\n\nMr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand. Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here. Except Guinness's barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by design.\n\nHe flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn't. Chance. We'll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made me feel so young.\n\nShort snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone.. Not even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I won't go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes a moment. Won't sleep, though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat again. No harm in him. Just a few.\n\nO sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed met him pike hoses frillies for Raoul de perfume your wife black hair heave under embon se\u00f1orita young eyes Mulvey plump bubs me breadvan Winkle red slippers she rusty sleep wander years of dreams return tail end Agendath swoony lovey showed me her next year in drawers return next in her next her next.\n\nA bat flew. Here. There. Here. Far in the grey a bell chimed. Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed. Just for a few\n\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\nCuckoo.\n\nThe clock on the mantelpiece in the priest's house cooed where Canon O'Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S. J. were taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup and talking about\n\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\nCuckoo.\n\nBecause it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was\n\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\nCuckoo.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/848352", "artist_names": "Harpers Bizarre", "full_title":
