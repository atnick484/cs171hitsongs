Frasier is playing a tune on the piano,\nMartin is looking through some old police work, and Daphne is\nbusying herself in the kitchen. Frasier turns round to find Eddie\nstaring at him.\n\nFrasier: Dad, he's doing it again! Must this dog stare at me all the time?\n\nMartin: I don't know. Eddie - must ya? [Eddie carries on staring]\nApparently he must.\n\nFrasier: [to Eddie:] What is so fascinating about me? What is it?\nDo you imagine I am a large piece of kibble? Am I some\nsort of canine enigma? Think about it, get back to me.\n\nDaphne enters carrying a tray of food.\n\nDaphne: Here we are, gents, dinner's up. [to Martin:] Can I give you\na hand clearing up your papers?\n\nMartin: No, you better let me. I need to keep these in a particular\norder.\nDaphne: What is all this, anyway?\n\nMartin: Oh, it's an old case of mine from the police force - the\n\u201cWeeping Lotus\" murder.\n\nFrasier: Dad, I can't believe you're still trotting this old thing up.\nHe's been trying to solve this case for twenty years.\n\nMartin: Yeah, and I'm not stopping until I do solve it. You adopt\ncertain instincts when you're a cop. And my instinct tells\nme that this case can be cracked. There just must be one\nsmall thing I keep overlooking. [tidies papers]\n\nFrasier: There is - who the murderer was. [laughs]\n\nThe doorbell sounds and Frasier goes to answer it as Daphne and\nMartin chat.\n\nDaphne: It's nice you feel so dedicated.\n\nMartin: It's a hobby. Some guys build a boat in their garage, I try\nto figure out why a maniac would kill a hooker and try to\nstuff her entire body into a bowling bag. It's relaxing!\n\n(At this point Frasier opens the front door to Niles who is carrying a\nbottle of wine. He enters and hands the wine to Frasier.)\nFrasier: Hello, Niles.\n\nNiles: Sorry I'm late, Frasier. Just as we were leaving, Maris had a\nrun-in with a rude directory assistance operator and it\nshattered her calm.\n\nFrasier: Have you ever considered that maybe Maris is a bit high\nstrung? Maybe she should see someone.\n\nNiles: She's seen everyone, why do you think she was calling\ndirectory assistance?\n\nDaphne: Evening, Dr. Crane.\n\nNiles: Hello, Daphne. It's so good to see you again. [she puts the\nmeal down] What an enchanting scent you're wearing.\n\nDaphne: [smells herself] Must be the ranch dressing. Won't Mrs.\nCrane be coming?\n\nNiles: No, I'm afraid. And please, no more of this \u201cDoctor\u201d and \u201cMrs.\nCrane\u201d formality. To you, it's Niles and... [stumped] er...\n\nFrasier: Maris.\n\nNiles: Yes, Maris.\n\nMartin: Glad you could join us, Niles.\n\nNiles: Oh, I wouldn't have missed it.\n\nMartin: Well, I guess the food's all ready: why don't we just go\nahead and start?\n\nEveryone sits down except Daphne who begins to take her food into\nthe kitchen.\n\nDaphne: Well, enjoy.\n\nMartin: Where are you going?\n\nDaphne: I thought I'd have mine in the kitchen.\n\nMartin: Don't be ridiculous.\n\nNiles: Yes, we can't have you eating by yourself in the kitchen.\nI'll join you.\n\nMartin: No. We're all eating right here, like a family, end of\ndiscussion.\n\nDaphne: Well, isn't this nice? Feels just like home.\n\nNiles: I'm famished.\n\nFrasier: Me, too.\n\nNiles and Frasier begin to eat...\n\nMartin: You boys still say a prayer before you eat?\n\n(They relent and pretend they do. All four close their eyes and hold\ntheir hands together. As Martin begins his prayer, Niles stares at\nDaphne as Eddie stares at Frasier. Daphne does not notice with her\neyes shut. However, Frasier notices Eddie's skin-creeping look.)\n\nMartin: We thank you, Lord, for the food we're about to eat. You have\nblessed our table with your palm. And thank you, Lord, for\nbringing this family together and we also thank you for the\nother gifts you have given to us. And may we always be able\nto share with those less fortunate...\n\nFrasier: [to Eddie:] OH, WILL YOU STOP STARING!\n\nNiles: [off guard:] I wasn't staring!\n\nMartin: [takes what he can get] Amen.\n\nThey all settle down. Daphne looks at Niles a little suspiciously\nas he begins the meal conversation.\n\nNiles: So Frasier, did you happen to read Derek Mann's column\ntoday? You were mentioned.\n\nFrasier: No, I missed it.\n\nNiles: Just as well, it wasn't flattering.\n\nFrasier: I still would have liked to have seen it anyway.\n\nNiles: Oh, why didn't you say so? [takes it out of his pocket]\n\nDaphne: If I may ask, who's Derek Mann?\n\nMartin: He writes that \"Mann About Town\" column for the Times. The\nthings that guys comes out with, sometimes he's really funny\n- what did he say about you?\n\nFrasier: [reading:] \u201cI hate Frasier Crane.\u201d\n\nMartin: [laughs, then:] Oh, sorry.\n\nFrasier: That's it. \"I hate Frasier Crane.\" That's it?\n\nMartin: Oh, don't let it bother you.\n\nFrasier: Well, actually it doesn't, dad. I knew when I chose a career\nin the public eye that I'd be open to certain criticisms,\nit's the price I pay for my celebrity. Thank you, Niles, for\nbringing me the paper, and thank you for highlighting it in\nyellow! Now, who would like some wine?\n\nDaphne: Oh, I'll have some.\n\nFrasier goes to pour some as Niles compliments Daphne.\n\nNiles: Daphne, this salad is exquisite.\n\nFrasier: [sitting down:] Now why would he say that?\n\nMartin: Must be the carrots, he always did like them.\n\nFrasier: Not the salad, Derek Mann. I mean, why would he write a thing\nlike that? I've never done anything to him, the attack is\ntotally unwarranted. I'm a healer, for God's sake.\n\nMartin: Oh, for crying out loud!\n\nFrasier: Dad, I have every right to feel upset about this - I will\nnot enjoy my dinner until this is where it belongs - in the\ntrash.\n\n(Frasier goes to bin it as Niles tries to stop him.)\n\nNiles: Oh, oh, there was an article in there I wanted to save.\n\nMartin: On what?\n\nNiles: Nothing.\n\nMartin: Come on, I'm interested.\n\nNiles: Oh, let's drop it.\n\nMartin: Why can't you tell me?\n\nNiles: All right, it was all about Margaret Thatcher's secret for\ngrowing prize-winning zinnias. Are you happy?\nMartin: [beat] Not really.\n\nFADE OUT\n\n(Act Card)\nOH, YEAH...\n\nScene Two - Radio Station.\n\nThe following afternoon Frasier is taking a call on air in his booth\nas Roz listens.\n\nFrasier: All right, Lorraine. Now, calm down and try and listen to\nwhat I'm going to say to you. Will you do that?\n\nLorraine: [v.o:] Okay.\n\nFrasier: All right, good girl. Now your problem...\n\nLorraine: [beep] Oh my gosh, another call waiting - someone else is\ntrying to get through. Do you mind if I take it?\n\nFrasier: No, no. Go right ahead. [she does] Well, certainly a very\ninteresting situation she's got herself into. Don't you\nthink so, Roz?\n\n(Roz is busy eating and reading magazines. She has to quickly chew her\nfood, put down her books just for the simple:)\n\nRoz: Yes.\n\nLorraine: Okay, I'm back.\n\nFrasier: All right, Lorraine. Now listen very carefully to what I'm\ngoing to tell you. Your problem seems...\n\nLorraine: [beep] Oh, I'm sorry, I'll be right back.\n\nFrasier: For someone who's got so many problems she certainly is\npopular. [laughs]\n\nLorraine: Okay, go ahead Dr. Crane. I'm here. [beep] Oh, I don't\nbelieve it - another call.\n\nFrasier: Hold it there, Lorraine. The reason why you want to take\nthat other call is the same reason that you want to change\nyour career and break up with your boyfriend. You're\nobsessed with what you think you're missing. The better\noffer, the call on the other line. Well, you've got to take\none call at a time from now on. Fully explore and\nexperience each one in its turn and you'll be a stronger\nperson for it. Do you follow me, Lorraine?\n\nLorraine: Okay, I'm back!\n\nFrasier: Thank you for your call. [hangs up] Well, we've only got\ntwo minutes left, so I would like to end today's program on\na personal note. As some of you may know, yesterday I was\nmentioned in Derek Mann's \"Mann About Town\" column. He\nsaid, and I quote, \"I Hate Frasier Crane\"... \"I Hate Frasier\nCrane\". [sarcastic:] What trenchant criticism. Move aside\nVoltaire, step back in the shadows H.L. Mencken, there's a\nnew kid in town. One can only wonder how many hours Derek\nMann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his\ntrembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef\nt'ouerve: \"I Hate Frasier Crane.\" A lesser critic would\nhave wasted our time by presenting a well thought-out,\npoint by point, constructive critique of this show. No, not\nour Mr. Mann. So dear listeners, when Mr. Mann's column\narrives on your front doorstep - read it, enjoy it, but\nabove all, treasure it. For one day this man will be joining\nthe Pantheon of the immortals. And if we're lucky... it'll be\none day soon. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. [signs off]\n\n(Frasier presses the off air button, and twirls his microphone around\nbefore blowing on it as if it were his weapon, then \u201cholsters\u201d it\nin his belt.)\n\nFADE TO:\n\n(Act Card)\nYEAH!\n\nScene Three - Caf\u00e9 Nervosa.\n\n(The following afternoon Frasier is drinking a coffee in the caf\u00e9 with\nRoz when Niles enters and sits with him.)\n\nNiles: Frasier, how funny running into you here.\n\nFrasier: I'm always here.\n\nNiles: Yes well, you weren't here twenty minutes ago: have you seen\ntoday's \"Times\"?\n\nFrasier: [knowing what's coming:] No.\n\nNiles: Lucky for you I saved you this copy. Take a look at Derek\nMann's column.\n\nFrasier: You know, this is the second time in as many days that you\nhave given me a paper. Have you ever considered getting\nyourself a route?\n\nNiles: [to Roz:] Hello, I don't believe we've met.\n\nRoz: Yes we have, Niles, three or four times. Roz Doyle.\n\nNiles: Oh, of course. It was at the... it was during the... well, I'm far\ntoo successful to feel awkward. Where did we meet?\n\nRoz: The radio station.\n\nNiles: Ah, I'll take your word for it. Nice to see you again. [then,\nto Frasier:] Mr. Mann heard your program yesterday.\n\nFrasier: So I see. [reading:] \u201cYesterday afternoon, Dr. Frasier Crane\ngot on my case for not giving him a point by point criticism\nof his radio show. Well, he asked for it, so here goes.\u201d\n\nRoz: [noticing:] Oh my god, his entire column is about your show.\n\nNiles: Not very flattering either. Towards the end he even attacks\nyour \"dimwitted sidekick call screener.\"\n\nRoz: [appalled:] That's me!\n\nNiles: Oh, now I remember you!\n\nFrasier: [reading:] \u201cIt's hard to say what I hate most about Crane's\nshow \u2013 his pompous, sanctimonious style, his constant self-\ncongratulatory references to his own life, or his voice: a mock-\nsympathetic tone so sickly sweet one wonders if the man\ngraduated from medical school or from some mind-controlling\ncult.\u201d\n\nNiles: It's continued on twelve.\n\nFrasier: I've read enough!\n\nWaiter: [asking:] Can I get you something?\n\nFrasier: [to Niles:] How can the man think something like that?\n\nWaiter: It's my job, I'm a waiter.\n\nFrasier: We don't want anything, thank you.\n\nRoz: Frasier, I know this stinks, but in a couple of days it'll\n\nblow over.\n\nFrasier: Oh, perhaps you're right. As angry as it makes me, to\nretaliate would be to stoop to his level. So the best\nresponse is no response at all.\n\nFADE TO:\nScene Four - Radio Station.\n\n(Soon after these comments he is already shouting into his microphone\nabout the recent newspaper report.)\n\nFrasier: [angry:] \u201cPompous and sanctimonious,\u201d am I?! Well, this Mann\ncharacter can't even write grammatical sentences! Every\nfive words there's one of his precious \"dot, dot, dots.\"\nMust be because he likes writing all those dots with the\ncrayon he writes this drivel in!\n\n(Roz, who looks like she has been listening to him rant for quite\na while, tries to steer him back to the show.)\n\nRoz: Dr. Crane, on line two we have Stewart who's having a\nproblem with delayed gratification.\n\nFrasier: Well, he's just going to have to wait! I don't know who this\nDerek Mann thinks he is, but if he thinks he can hide behind\nhis newspaper like some sniveling schoolchild cowering\nbehind a tree, then I say let's expose this Derek Mann for\nwhat he is: not a man at all, but half a man! [to Roz:] Now\nwhat line did you say Stewart was on?\n\nRoz: He hung up.\n\nFrasier: Well, I'm leaving all sorts of bodies in my wake today.\nLet's see who's on line five. [he presses button:] Hello,\nthis is Dr. Frasier Crane - I'm listening.\n\nDerek: [v.o:] Good, because I was listening too.\n\nFrasier: And you are?\n\nDerek: Derek Mann.\n\nFrasier: [regretting:] I see.\n\nDerek: Look, nobody calls me half a man - especially some Ivy League\ntwit. So what do you say we settle this like men?\n\nFrasier: Are you implying that you want to fight me?\n\nDerek: I'm not implying, I'm saying.\n\nFrasier: Fight, as in a fist fight?\n\nDerek: [sarcastic:] No, I thought we might throw pies at each\nother! So are you up to it, or aren't you man enough?\n\nFrasier: [thinks] We'll be right back after these messages.\nFrasier signs off for commercials as we fade out.\n\nAct Two.\nScene One - Radio Station.\n\n(The scene resumes where we left off. The commercials have finished\nand Frasier gets back to his radio show.)\n\nFrasier: And we're back. Well, we have a surprise caller on the line:\nDerek Mann.\n\nDerek: [v.o:] So what's it going to be, Crane, are you going to\nfight me or not?\n\nFrasier: Oh, you can't be serious.\n\nDerek: Just like I figured, you're chicken.\n\nFrasier: No, I just don't think that civilized people behave that\nway. You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners have an opinion\nabout that subject? Who do we have on the line?\n\nRoz: Well, lines one through eight are people who think you're chicken.\n\nDerek: You're chicken, Crane. Admit it!\n\nFrasier: I am not chicken!\n\nDerek: [squawks like a chicken]\n\nFrasier: We are mature thinking people, not cavemen!\n\nDerek: [squawks some more]\n\nFrasier: Alright, if you want a fight so bad, I'll give you a fight!\nYou just say the time and place!\n\nDerek: Kinsley square, right outside your office, by the old\nstatue. Noon tomorrow. Don't back out!\n\nFrasier: I won't! Don't you back out either because I know where your\noffice is too, and I know where you live, and I'll track you\ndown! Now who else out there wants a piece of me?!\n\nFADE TO:\n(Scene Card)\nET TU, EDDIE?\nScene Two - Frasier's Apartment.\n\n(That evening Martin is searching through his old case as Daphne\npasses him.)\n\nDaphne: Having a look at that old murder case again?\n\nMartin: Yeah, I've dug out the old crime scene photos.\n\nDaphne: Well, don't be a greedy guts - let me have a look.\n\n(Daphne has a look at the photo of the girl. After a while her psychic\npowers kick in.)\n\nDaphne: Her name was Helen.\n\nMartin: Yeah, it was. [knowing her trick:] Ah, you must have seen it\non some of my papers I've had lying around here.\n\nDaphne: No, I just got this feeling when I touched the picture.\n\nMartin: You're putting me on.\n\nDaphne: She had a lot of men in her life.\n\nMartin: No kidding: she was a hooker!\n\nDaphne: No, I mean she had four brothers.\n\nMartin: [surprised:] That's amazing. She did have four brothers.\nWhat else are you getting? Well, come on, tell me more.\n\nDaphne: I can't just turn it on and off like a faucet.\n\nMartin: Give it a try, will you? Please. What else are you getting?\n\nDaphne: Nothing. [suddenly:] No, wait. I see a man.\n\nMartin: Yeah?\n\nDaphne: A well-dressed man. He's wearing wing tips and a trench coat.\n\nMartin: Yeah? Yeah?\n\nDaphne: He's getting off an elevator... he's walking down a long\nhallway... she doesn't know he's coming... he's opening the\ndoor...\n\n(At this moment, a well-dressed man enters the apartment wearing wing\ntips and a trench coat - it's Frasier.)\n\nFrasier: Hello, everyone.\n\nDaphne: Sometimes I get my signals crossed.\n\nFrasier: What's going on?\n\nMartin: Well - unless you killed a hooker when you were twelve -\nnothing much!\n\nDaphne: We heard your show today. I just loved the way you handled\nthat Derek Mann.\n\nMartin: You made your old man proud. Yet the best part was when he\nchallenged you to a fight and you stood right up to him.\n\nFrasier: [worried:] Yes I did, didn't I?\n\nMartin: I can't wait to see that.\n\nFrasier: Oh, I'm not actually going to go through with it, dad.\n\nMartin: What are you talking about?\n\nFrasier: Well, I already won our little war of words. What would I\nstand to benefit by going through with actually going\nthrough with a fist fight?\n\nMartin: Frasier, maybe I'm misunderstanding here... he challenged\nyou and you're backing down?\n\nFrasier: Well, mature people are supposed to use their intellect to\nsettle their differences.\n\nMartin: A man doesn't just turn his tail and run - that's not the\nway I brought you up.\n\nFrasier: Are you encouraging me to fight?\n\nMartin: You bet I am - you gave the guy your word.\n\nFrasier: Yes, but I didn't even know what I was saying - I hadn't even\nhad lunch yet.\n\nMartin: I might have known this would have happened. It's Billy Kreizel\nall over again.\n\nFrasier: What did you say?\n\nMartin: Something about a Billy Kreizel, I believe.\n\nFrasier: I can't believe you're dragging that up - that was thirty\nyears ago.\n\nDaphne: Who's this Billy Kreizel?\n\nFrasier: Oh, he was this kid in fifth grade that used to torment me!\n\nMartin: So one day Frasier made fun of Billy's crewcut.\n\nFrasier: Well, he started it by making fun of the elbow patches on my\nblazer!\n\nMartin: Well, the point is, they were supposed to meet for a fight\nafter school. Only \"Patches\" here didn't show up!\n\nFrasier: I had a clarinet lesson!\n\nMartin: You don't need to remind me of that! Billy's old man was a\ncop, too. Boy, the guys rode me about that excuse of yours for\nyears. Every time I couldn't make it out for a drink they\nused to say, \"What's the matter? You got a clarinet lesson?\"\n\nDaphne: [wondering:] Couldn't you and Billy have met after the\nclarinet lesson?\n\nFrasier: Daphne, would you please excuse us for a moment!\n\nDaphne: [gets up:] I have a feeling I'm going to be excused quite a\nlot in this house.\n\n(She exits to the kitchen.)\n\nFrasier: [sarcastic:] Dad, I am sorry if I embarrassed you for not\nfighting Billy Kreizel thirty years ago. But the situation\nis not the same now.\n\nMartin: It's exactly the same.\n\nFrasier: I am an adult now, I've been to medical school, I hold a\ncertain position in this city - I do not settle my\ndifferences with brawling.\n\nMartin: The man challenged you and you accepted.\n\nFrasier: Dad, I can't believe this. You won't be happy until I come\nhome with a black eye.\n\nMartin: I just want you to do what you said you were going to do.\nYou know, you can talk about your medical school, your\nintellect, your place in this city, but you know what? It's\nall one big clarinet lesson... I can't even look at you.\n\n(Martin exits to the kitchen, angry with his son. Frasier is left with\nlittle dignity and looks at Eddie for a little support. However, even\nEddie turns his face away from him. Frasier can only sulk.)\n\nFADE TO:\n(Scene Card)\nREQUIEM FOR A LIGHTWEIGHT\n\nScene Three - Caf\u00e9 Nervosa.\n\n(The next day, Frasier is preparing for the big fight whilst chatting\nwith Roz.)\n\nRoz: So, I step out of the shower, I look out of the window and I\nnotice the garbage man looking right in at me. So I say,\n\"Did you get a good look?\" And he says, \"Not completely,\nturn around.\" Then he smiled, and he's missing a tooth,\nand that's when the romance went right out of it for me.\n\nFrasier: Roz, why are you telling me this story?\n\nRoz: I'm trying to take your mind of the fact that in five\nminutes you're going to walk right out into that square and\nget your clock cleaned.\n\nFrasier: Well, has it ever occurred to you that I might actually win\nthis fight?\n\nRoz: Your shoe\u2019s untied. [Frasier checks his tied shoes] If you\nfell for that one, you're going down and you're going down\nhard.\n\nNiles: [enters] Frasier, there's quite a crowd forming out there.\nSecretaries with bag lunches, business men, children with\nballoons...\n\nFrasier: All that's missing is a mariachi band.\n\nNiles: They're setting up.\n\nRoz: Well, I better go find a great place in the crowd. I'll be\noff to the left, Frasier, for when you tear his ear off and\nwant to throw it to a beautiful senorita.\nShe leaves the Caf\u00e9. Niles looks at Frasier.\n\nNiles: Frasier, as your brother and as your friend - why are you\ndoing this?\n\nFrasier: It's Billy Kreizel.\n\nNiles: [looking around:] Where?\n\nFrasier: [shakes head] He's not here, Niles. It's just that I ran away\nfrom him when I was ten.\n\nNiles: I remember.\n\nFrasier: You know, I've been running ever since. You know, this is\nwhere it stops. I'm not running anymore.\n\nNiles: What is it that makes us Crane boys such targets?\n\n(As he says this, he takes his nail file out of his coat pocket\nand buffs his nails. He blows on them and offers the file to\nFrasier which he refuses.)\n\nFrasier: [sarcastic:] Chalk it up to random violence!\n\n(Niles nods in agreement and exits the caf\u00e9. Martin enters.)\n\nMartin: Hey, there.\n\nFrasier: Dad? What are you doing here?\n\nMartin: Look son, I said a couple of things last night that maybe\nwent over the line.\n\nFrasier: Look dad, if you were worried that you talked me into\nsomething that I wasn't ready to do \u2013 well, you're wrong.\nYou can relax. I took this on for myself.\n\nMartin: Good.\n\nFrasier: Who told you that I was going through with it, anyway?\n\nMartin: Oh, let's just say a father knows certain things about his son.\nThey smile. Daphne enters.\n\nDaphne: Good news, I parked in front of a broken meter. We're getting\na freebie. Well, good luck, Dr. Crane, with the fight.\n\nFrasier: Thank you, Daphne. Any psychic predictions on the outcome?\n\nDaphne: Actually, yes. But don't worry, I'm frequently wrong.\n\n(Frasier removes his jacket and tie. Niles comes in.)\n\nNiles: Frasier, Frasier, there's something I want you to see.\n[points out of window:] There, the man standing to the left\nof the statue - I recognize his picture from the newspaper,\nthat's Derek Mann.\n\nFrasier: He's gigantic!\n\nDaphne: [looking out:] My God, you could show a movie on his back!\n\nMartin: Are you sure you want to go through with this?\n\nFrasier: Yes, yes I am.\n\n(Frasier throws a few shadow punches to loosen himself up.)\n\nMartin: Good, you'll be fine. Just remember this is a street fight\nand not a boxing match. So fight dirty and throw the first\npunch!\n\nDaphne: I found that a swift knee to the groin usually does the\ntrick.

You'll\nonly make me nervous.\n\nMartin: Whatever you want.\n\n(They all wish Frasier good luck. As he exits the mariachi band\nstrikes up. They all move over to the window to look out.)\n\nMartin: They've got a mariachi band out there!\n\nNiles: I'll have to get their card, I need someone for our summer\nbarbeque.\n\nDaphne: Oh look, they\u2019re starting the fight.\n\nMartin: Nah, they\u2019re just circling, sizing each other up. Come on,\nFrasier, if you're going to hit him, hit him now!\n\n(They all shout encouragements, then police sirens are heard.)\n\nNiles: Is that the police?\n\nMartin: Yeah, what are they doing here?\n\nDaphne: They're breaking it up! Just when they were getting started.\n\n(Shouts are heard from the crowd hurling insults at the police force.\nThe officer marches Frasier right into the Caf\u00e9.)\n\nFrasier: Alright, I'll come along peacefully - let me just get my\njacket.\n\nOfficer: Relax, I'm not arresting you. But I'm warning you that in\nthis town we don't settle our differences with street fights\n- no matter who you are.\n\nFrasier: Well thank you, officer, you'll have no more trouble from me.\n\nOfficer: Okay. [exits]\n\nFrasier: Dad, dad, did you see me? My hands are trembling, my chest\nis pounding, my mouth is all dry, my knees are like jello...\nGod, I feel great!\n\nMartin: You did good.\n\nFrasier: Yeah, I was out there. I was raring to go, you saw that...\n\nMartin: I know you were. You would have kicked his butt!\n\nDaphne: From here to Tacoma.\n\nNiles: [shouting:] I think we should celebrate! Everyone, a round\nof victory lattes on me.\n\n(As the gang celebrate, Martin walks up to the officer on the door.)\n\nMartin: Thanks Harry, I owe you one.\n\nOfficer: No problem, Marty.\n\nMartin: You cut it pretty close, though. Another minute, then Frasier\nwould have been sidewalk litter. He would have been lunch\nmeat.\n\nOfficer: Say, some of the guys are getting together later at Duke\u2019s.\nWhy don't you come along?\n\nMartin: Yeah, maybe I will. And you know why I will? Because the\nCrane boys don't take clarinet lessons anymore.\n\nOfficer: What the hell are you talking about?\n\nMartin: [embarrassed:] Oh that's right, you weren't in my precinct.\n\nCredits:\n\nFrasier's Apartment:\n\n(Eddie is sat on a chair staring at a picture of Frasier looking mad.\nHe doesn't take his eyes off him.)Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/137991", "artist_names": "Upton Sinclair", "full_title": "The Jungle (Chap. 24) by\u00a0Upton\u00a0Sinclair", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/7992b3de68958284e60c334c2ab55511.220x220x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7992b3de68958284e60c334c2ab55511.220x220x1.jpg", "id": 137991, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 205874, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": null, "path": "/Upton-sinclair-the-jungle-chap-24-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Upton-sinclair-the-jungle-chap-24-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1906, "month": 2, "day": 26}, "release_date_for_display": "February 26, 1906", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 26, 1906", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/7992b3de68958284e60c334c2ab55511.220x220x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7992b3de68958284e60c334c2ab55511.220x220x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "The Jungle (Chap. 24)", "title_with_featured": "The Jungle (Chap. 24)", "updated_by_human_at": 1616573895, "url": "https://genius.com/Upton-sinclair-the-jungle-chap-24-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/45231", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bafb829a5b06896f4ba15380121b9762.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 45231, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bafb829a5b06896f4ba15380121b9762.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "u", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Upton Sinclair", "slug": "Upton-sinclair", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Upton-sinclair"}, "artist": "Upton Sinclair", "lyrics": "The Jungle (Chap. 24) Lyrics\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the face of all his handicaps, Jurgis was obliged to make the price of a lodging, and of a drink every hour or two, under penalty of freezing to death. Day after day he roamed about in the arctic cold, his soul filled full of bitterness and despair. He saw the world of civilization then more plainly than ever he had seen it before; a world in which nothing counted but brutal might, an order devised by those who possessed it for the subjugation of those who did not. He was one of the latter; and all outdoors, all life, was to him one colossal prison, which he paced like a pent-up tiger, trying one bar after another, and finding them all beyond his power. He had lost in the fierce battle of greed, and so was doomed to be exterminated; and all society was busied to see that he did not escape the sentence. Everywhere that he turned were prison bars, and hostile eyes following him; the well-fed, sleek policemen, from whose glances he shrank, and who seemed to grip their clubs more tightly when they saw him; the saloon-keepers, who never ceased to watch him while he was in their places, who were jealous of every moment he lingered after he had paid his money; the hurrying throngs upon the streets, who were deaf to his entreaties, oblivious of his very existence\u2014and savage and contemptuous when he forced himself upon them. They had their own affairs, and there was no place for him among them. There was no place for him anywhere\u2014every direction he turned his gaze, this fact was forced upon him: Everything was built to express it to him: the residences, with their heavy walls and bolted doors, and basement windows barred with iron; the great warehouses filled with the products of the whole world, and guarded by iron shutters and heavy gates; the banks with their unthinkable billions of wealth, all buried in safes and vaults of steel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then one day there befell Jurgis the one adventure of his life. It was late at night, and he had failed to get the price of a lodging. Snow was falling, and he had been out so long that he was covered with it, and was chilled to the bone. He was working among the theater crowds, flitting here and there, taking large chances with the police, in his desperation half hoping to be arrested. When he saw a blue-coat start toward him, however, his heart failed him, and he dashed down a side street and fled a couple of blocks. When he stopped again he saw a man coming toward him, and placed himself in his path.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Please, sir,\" he began, in the usual formula, \"will you give me the price of a lodging? I've had a broken arm, and I can't work, and I've not a cent in my pocket. I'm an honest working-man, sir, and I never begged before! It's not my fault, sir\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurgis usually went on until he was interrupted, but this man did not interrupt, and so at last he came to a breathless stop. The other had halted, and Jurgis suddenly noticed that he stood a little unsteadily. \"Whuzzat you say?\" he queried suddenly, in a thick voice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurgis began again, speaking more slowly and distinctly; before he was half through the other put out his hand and rested it upon his shoulder. \"Poor ole chappie!\" he said. \"Been up\u2014hic\u2014up\u2014against it, hey?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then he lurched toward Jurgis, and the hand upon his shoulder became an arm about his neck. \"Up against it myself, ole sport,\" he said. \"She's a hard ole world.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They were close to a lamppost, and Jurgis got a glimpse of the other. He was a young fellow\u2014not much over eighteen, with a handsome boyish face. He wore a silk hat and a rich soft overcoat with a fur collar; and he smiled at Jurgis with benignant sympathy. \"I'm hard up, too, my goo' fren',\" he said. \"I've got cruel parents, or I'd set you up. Whuzzamatter whizyer?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I've been in the hospital.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hospital!\" exclaimed the young fellow, still smiling sweetly, \"thass too bad! Same's my Aunt Polly\u2014hic\u2014my Aunt Polly's in the hospital, too\u2014ole auntie's been havin' twins! Whuzzamatter whiz you?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I've got a broken arm\u2014\" Jurgis began.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So,\" said the other, sympathetically. \"That ain't so bad\u2014you get over that. I wish somebody'd break my arm, ole chappie\u2014damfidon't! Then they'd treat me better\u2014hic\u2014hole me up, ole sport!

Why don't you hassome supper?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I've got no money, sir.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No money! Ho, ho\u2014less be chums, ole boy\u2014jess like me! No money, either\u2014a'most busted! Why don't you go home, then, same's me?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I haven't any home,\" said Jurgis.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No home! Stranger in the city, hey? Goo' God, thass bad! Better come home wiz me\u2014yes, by Harry, thass the trick, you'll come home an' hassome supper\u2014hic\u2014wiz me! Awful lonesome\u2014nobody home!

Farewell, farewell, my own true love\u2014farewell, farewehell, my\u2014own true\u2014love!'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This last was a song, and the young gentleman's voice rose mournful and wailing, while he swung upon Jurgis's neck. The latter was glancing about nervously, lest some one should approach. They were still alone, however.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I came all right, all right,\" continued the youngster, aggressively, \"I can\u2014hic\u2014I can have my own way when I want it, by Harry\u2014Freddie Jones is a hard man to handle when he gets goin'! 'No, sir,' says I, 'by thunder, and I don't need anybody goin' home with me, either\u2014whujja take me for, hey? Think I'm drunk, dontcha, hey?\u2014I know you! But I'm no more drunk than you are, Kittens,' says I to her. And then says she, 'Thass true, Freddie dear' (she's a smart one, is Kitty), 'but I'm stayin' in the flat, an' you're goin' out into the cold, cold night!' 'Put it in a pome, lovely Kitty,' says I. 'No jokin', Freddie, my boy,' says she. 'Lemme call a cab now, like a good dear'\u2014but I can call my own cabs, dontcha fool yourself\u2014and I know what I'm a-doin', you bet! Say, my fren', whatcha say\u2014willye come home an' see me, an' hassome supper? Come 'long like a good feller\u2014don't be haughty! You're up against it, same as me, an' you can unerstan' a feller; your heart's in the right place, by Harry\u2014come 'long, ole chappie, an' we'll light up the house, an' have some fizz, an' we'll raise hell, we will\u2014whoop-la! S'long's I'm inside the house I can do as I please\u2014the guv'ner's own very orders, b'God! Hip! hip!\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They had started down the street, arm in arm, the young man pushing Jurgis along, half dazed. Jurgis was trying to think what to do\u2014he knew he could not pass any crowded place with his new acquaintance without attracting attention and being stopped. It was only because of the falling snow that people who passed here did not notice anything wrong.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, therefore, Jurgis stopped. \"Is it very far?\" he inquired.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Not very,\" said the other, \"Tired, are you, though? Well, we'll ride\u2014whatcha say? Good! Call a cab!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, gripping Jurgis tight with one hand, the young fellow began searching his pockets with the other. \"You call, ole sport, an' I'll pay,\" he suggested. \"How's that, hey?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he pulled out from somewhere a big roll of bills. It was more money than Jurgis had ever seen in his life before, and he stared at it with startled eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Looks like a lot, hey?\" said Master Freddie, fumbling with it. \"Fool you, though, ole chappie\u2014they're all little ones! I'll be busted in one week more, sure thing\u2014word of honor. An' not a cent more till the first\u2014hic\u2014guv'ner's orders\u2014hic\u2014not a cent, by Harry! Nuff to set a feller crazy, it is. I sent him a cable, this af'noon\u2014thass one reason more why I'm goin' home. 'Hangin' on the verge of starvation,' I says\u2014'for the honor of the family\u2014hic\u2014sen' me some bread. Hunger will compel me to join you\u2014Freddie.' Thass what I wired him, by Harry, an' I mean it\u2014I'll run away from school, b'God, if he don't sen' me some.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After this fashion the young gentleman continued to prattle on\u2014and meantime Jurgis was trembling with excitement. He might grab that wad of bills and be out of sight in the darkness before the other could collect his wits. Should he do it? What better had he to hope for, if he waited longer? But Jurgis had never committed a crime in his life, and now he hesitated half a second too long. \"Freddie\" got one bill loose, and then stuffed the rest back into his trousers' pocket.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Here, ole man,\" he said, \"you take it.\" He held it out fluttering. They were in front of a saloon; and by the light of the window Jurgis saw that it was a hundred-dollar bill! \"You take it,\" the other repeated. \"Pay the cabbie an' keep the change\u2014I've got\u2014hic\u2014no head for business! Guv'ner says so hisself, an' the guv'ner knows\u2014the guv'ner's got a head for business, you bet! 'All right, guv'ner,' I told him, 'you run the show, and I'll take the tickets!' An' so he set Aunt Polly to watch me\u2014hic\u2014an' now Polly's off in the hospital havin' twins, an' me out raisin' Cain! Hello, there! Hey! Call him!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A cab was driving by; and Jurgis sprang and called, and it swung round to the curb. Master Freddie clambered in with some difficulty, and Jurgis had started to follow, when the driver shouted: \"Hi, there! Get out\u2014you!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurgis hesitated, and was half obeying; but his companion broke out: \"Whuzzat? Whuzzamatter wiz you, hey?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the cabbie subsided, and Jurgis climbed in. Then Freddie gave a number on the Lake Shore Drive, and the carriage started away. The youngster leaned back and snuggled up to Jurgis, murmuring contentedly; in half a minute he was sound asleep, Jurgis sat shivering, speculating as to whether he might not still be able to get hold of the roll of bills. He was afraid to try to go through his companion's pockets, however; and besides the cabbie might be on the watch. He had the hundred safe, and he would have to be content with that.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the end of half an hour or so the cab stopped. They were out on the waterfront, and from the east a freezing gale was blowing off the ice-bound lake. \"Here we are,\" called the cabbie, and Jurgis awakened his companion.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Master Freddie sat up with a start.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hello!\" he said. \"Where are we? Whuzzis? Who are you, hey? Oh, yes, sure nuff! Mos' forgot you\u2014hic\u2014ole chappie! Home, are we? Lessee! Br-r-r\u2014it's cold! Yes\u2014come 'long\u2014we're home\u2014it ever so\u2014hic\u2014humble!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before them there loomed an enormous granite pile, set far back from the street, and occupying a whole block. By the light of the driveway lamps Jurgis could see that it had towers and huge gables, like a medieval castle. He thought that the young fellow must have made a mistake\u2014it was inconceivable to him that any person could have a home like a hotel or the city hall. But he followed in silence, and they went up the long flight of steps, arm in arm.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's a button here, ole sport,\" said Master Freddie. \"Hole my arm while I find her! Steady, now\u2014oh, yes, here she is! Saved!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A bell rang, and in a few seconds the door was opened. A man in blue livery stood holding it, and gazing before him, silent as a statue.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They stood for a moment blinking in the light. Then Jurgis felt his companion pulling, and he stepped in, and the blue automaton closed the door. Jurgis's heart was beating wildly; it was a bold thing for him to do\u2014into what strange unearthly place he was venturing he had no idea. Aladdin entering his cave could not have been more excited.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The place where he stood was dimly lighted; but he could see a vast hall, with pillars fading into the darkness above, and a great staircase opening at the far end of it. The floor was of tesselated marble, smooth as glass, and from the walls strange shapes loomed out, woven into huge portieres in rich, harmonious colors, or gleaming from paintings, wonderful and mysterious-looking in the half-light, purple and red and golden, like sunset glimmers in a shadowy forest.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The man in livery had moved silently toward them; Master Freddie took off his hat and handed it to him, and then, letting go of Jurgis' arm, tried to get out of his overcoat. After two or three attempts he accomplished this, with the lackey's help, and meantime a second man had approached, a tall and portly personage, solemn as an executioner. He bore straight down upon Jurgis, who shrank away nervously; he seized him by the arm without a word, and started toward the door with him. Then suddenly came Master Freddie's voice, \"Hamilton! My fren' will remain wiz me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The man paused and half released Jurgis. \"Come 'long ole chappie,\" said the other, and Jurgis started toward him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Master Frederick!\" exclaimed the man.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"See that the cabbie\u2014hic\u2014is paid,\" was the other's response; and he linked his arm in Jurgis'. Jurgis was about to say, \"I have the money for him,\" but he restrained himself. The stout man in uniform signaled to the other, who went out to the cab, while he followed Jurgis and his young master.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They went down the great hall, and then turned. Before them were two huge doors.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hamilton,\" said Master Freddie.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, sir?\" said the other.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Whuzzamatter wizze dinin'-room doors?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Nothing is the matter, sir.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Then why dontcha openum?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The man rolled them back; another vista lost itself in the darkness. \"Lights,\" commanded Master Freddie; and the butler pressed a button, and a flood of brilliant incandescence streamed from above, half-blinding Jurgis. He stared; and little by little he made out the great apartment, with a domed ceiling from which the light poured, and walls that were one enormous painting\u2014nymphs and dryads dancing in a flower-strewn glade\u2014Diana with her hounds and horses, dashing headlong through a mountain streamlet\u2014a group of maidens bathing in a forest pool\u2014all life-size, and so real that Jurgis thought that it was some work of enchantment, that he was in a dream palace. Then his eye passed to the long table in the center of the hall, a table black as ebony, and gleaming with wrought silver and gold. In the center of it was a huge carven bowl, with the glistening gleam of ferns and the red and purple of rare orchids, glowing from a light hidden somewhere in their midst.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This's the dinin' room,\" observed Master Freddie. \"How you like it, hey, ole sport?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He always insisted on having an answer to his remarks, leaning over Jurgis and smiling into his face. Jurgis liked it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Rummy ole place to feed in all 'lone, though,\" was Freddie's comment\u2014\"rummy's hell! Whuzya think, hey?\" Then another idea occurred to him and he went on, without waiting: \"Maybe you never saw anythin\u2014hic\u2014like this 'fore? Hey, ole chappie?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No,\" said Jurgis.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Come from country, maybe\u2014hey?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes,\" said Jurgis.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aha! I thosso! Lossa folks from country never saw such a place. Guv'ner brings 'em\u2014free show\u2014hic\u2014reg'lar circus! Go home tell folks about it.

Heard of him?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Jurgis managed to stammer out: \"I have worked for him in the yards.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What!\" cried Master Freddie, with a yell. \"You! In the yards? Ho, ho! Why, say, thass good! Shake hands on it, ole man\u2014by Harry! Guv'ner ought to be here\u2014glad to see you.

You think\u2014hic\u2014you think I'm drunk! Hey, now?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the butler again bowed his head. \"Yes, sir,\" he said, at which Master Freddie hung tightly upon Jurgis's neck and went into a fit of laughter. \"Hamilton, you damn ole scoundrel,\" he roared, \"I'll 'scharge you for impudence, you see 'f I don't! Ho, ho, ho! I'm drunk! Ho, ho!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two waited until his fit had spent itself, to see what new whim would seize him. \"Whatcha wanta do?\" he queried suddenly. \"Wanta see the place, ole chappie?

Hear me, sir?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, sir,\" said the butler, \"but, Master Frederick, your father left orders\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Master Frederick drew himself up to a stately height. \"My father's orders were left to me\u2014hic\u2014an' not to you,\" he said. Then, clasping Jurgis tightly by the neck, he staggered out of the room; on the way another idea occurred to him, and he asked: \"Any\u2014hic\u2014cable message for me, Hamilton?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, sir,\" said the butler.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Guv'ner must be travelin'. An' how's the twins, Hamilton?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They are doing well, sir.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good!\" said Master Freddie; and added fervently: \"God bless 'em, the little lambs!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They went up the great staircase, one step at a time; at the top of it there gleamed at them out of the shadows the figure of a nymph crouching by a fountain, a figure ravishingly beautiful, the flesh warm and glowing with the hues of life. Above was a huge court, with domed roof, the various apartments opening into it. The butler had paused below but a few minutes to give orders, and then followed them; now he pressed a button, and the hall blazed with light. He opened a door before them, and then pressed another button, as they staggered into the apartment.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was fitted up as a study. In the center was a mahogany table, covered with books, and smokers' implements; the walls were decorated with college trophies and colors\u2014flags, posters, photographs and knickknacks\u2014tennis rackets, canoe paddles, golf clubs, and polo sticks. An enormous moose head, with horns six feet across, faced a buffalo head on the opposite wall, while bear and tiger skins covered the polished floor. There were lounging chairs and sofas, window seats covered with soft cushions of fantastic designs; there was one corner fitted in Persian fashion, with a huge canopy and a jeweled lamp beneath. Beyond, a door opened upon a bedroom, and beyond that was a swimming pool of the purest marble, that had cost about forty thousand dollars.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Master Freddie stood for a moment or two, gazing about him; then out of the next room a dog emerged, a monstrous bulldog, the most hideous object that Jurgis had ever laid eyes upon. He yawned, opening a mouth like a dragon's; and he came toward the young man, wagging his tail. \"Hello, Dewey!\" cried his master. \"Been havin' a snooze, ole boy? Well, well\u2014hello there, whuzzamatter?\" (The dog was snarling at Jurgis.) \"Why, Dewey\u2014this' my fren', Mr. Rednose\u2014ole fren' the guv'ner's! Mr. Rednose, Admiral Dewey; shake han's\u2014hic. Ain't he a daisy, though\u2014blue ribbon at the New York show\u2014eighty-five hundred at a clip! How's that, hey?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The speaker sank into one of the big armchairs, and Admiral Dewey crouched beneath it; he did not snarl again, but he never took his eyes off Jurgis. He was perfectly sober, was the Admiral.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The butler had closed the door, and he stood by it, watching Jurgis every second. Now there came footsteps outside, and, as he opened the door a man in livery entered, carrying a folding table, and behind him two men with covered trays. They stood like statues while the first spread the table and set out the contents of the trays upon it. There were cold pates, and thin slices of meat, tiny bread and butter sandwiches with the crust cut off, a bowl of sliced peaches and cream (in January), little fancy cakes, pink and green and yellow and white, and half a dozen ice-cold bottles of wine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thass the stuff for you!\" cried Master Freddie, exultantly, as he spied them. \"Come 'long, ole chappie, move up.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he seated himself at the table; the waiter pulled a cork, and he took the bottle and poured three glasses of its contents in succession down his throat. Then he gave a long-drawn sigh, and cried again to Jurgis to seat himself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The butler held the chair at the opposite side of the table, and Jurgis thought it was to keep him out of it; but finally he understand that it was the other's intention to put it under him, and so he sat down, cautiously and mistrustingly. Master Freddie perceived that the attendants embarrassed him, and he remarked with a nod to them, \"You may go.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They went, all save the butler.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You may go too, Hamilton,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Master Frederick\u2014\" the man began.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Go!\" cried the youngster, angrily. \"Damn you, don't you hear me?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The man went out and closed the door; Jurgis, who was as sharp as he, observed that he took the key out of the lock, in order that he might peer through the keyhole.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Master Frederick turned to the table again. \"Now,\" he said, \"go for it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurgis gazed at him doubtingly. \"Eat!\" cried the other. \"Pile in, ole chappie!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't you want anything?\" Jurgis asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ain't hungry,\" was the reply\u2014\"only thirsty. Kitty and me had some candy\u2014you go on.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So Jurgis began, without further parley. He ate as with two shovels, his fork in one hand and his knife in the other; when he once got started his wolf-hunger got the better of him, and he did not stop for breath until he had cleared every plate. \"Gee whiz!\" said the other, who had been watching him in wonder.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then he held Jurgis the bottle. \"Lessee you drink now,\" he said; and Jurgis took the bottle and turned it up to his mouth, and a wonderfully unearthly liquid ecstasy poured down his throat, tickling every nerve of him, thrilling him with joy. He drank the very last drop of it, and then he gave vent to a long-drawn \"Ah!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good stuff, hey?\" said Freddie, sympathetically; he had leaned back in the big chair, putting his arm behind his head and gazing at Jurgis.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Jurgis gazed back at him. He was clad in spotless evening dress, was Freddie, and looked very handsome\u2014he was a beautiful boy, with light golden hair and the head of an Antinous. He smiled at Jurgis confidingly, and then started talking again, with his blissful insouciance. This time he talked for ten minutes at a stretch, and in the course of the speech he told Jurgis all of his family history. His big brother Charlie was in love with the guileless maiden who played the part of \"Little Bright-Eyes\" in \"The Kaliph of Kamskatka.\" He had been on the verge of marrying her once, only \"the guv'ner\" had sworn to disinherit him, and had presented him with a sum that would stagger the imagination, and that had staggered the virtue of \"Little Bright-Eyes.\" Now Charlie had got leave from college, and had gone away in his automobile on the next best thing to a honeymoon. \"The guv'ner\" had made threats to disinherit another of his children also, sister Gwendolen, who had married an Italian marquis with a string of titles and a dueling record. They lived in his chateau, or rather had, until he had taken to firing the breakfast dishes at her; then she had cabled for help, and the old gentleman had gone over to find out what were his Grace's terms. So they had left Freddie all alone, and he with less than two thousand dollars in his pocket. Freddie was up in arms and meant serious business, as they would find in the end\u2014if there was no other way of bringing them to terms he would have his \"Kittens\" wire that she was about to marry him, and see what happened then.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So the cheerful youngster rattled on, until he was tired out. He smiled his sweetest smile at Jurgis, and then he closed his eyes, sleepily. Then he opened them again, and smiled once more, and finally closed them and forgot to open them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For several minutes Jurgis sat perfectly motionless, watching him, and reveling in the strange sensation of the champagne. Once he stirred, and the dog growled; after that he sat almost holding his breath\u2014until after a while the door of the room opened softly, and the butler came in.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He walked toward Jurgis upon tiptoe, scowling at him; and Jurgis rose up, and retreated, scowling back. So until he was against the wall, and then the butler came close, and pointed toward the door. \"Get out of here!\" he whispered.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurgis hesitated, giving a glance at Freddie, who was snoring softly. \"If you do, you son of a\u2014\" hissed the butler, \"I'll mash in your face for you before you get out of here!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Jurgis wavered but an instant more. He saw \"Admiral Dewey\" coming up behind the man and growling softly, to back up his threats. Then he surrendered and started toward the door.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They went out without a sound, and down the great echoing staircase, and through the dark hall. At the front door he paused, and the butler strode close to him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hold up your hands,\" he snarled. Jurgis took a step back, clinching his one well fist.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What for?\" he cried; and then understanding that the fellow proposed to search him, he answered, \"I'll see you in hell first.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you want to go to jail?\" demanded the butler, menacingly. \"I'll have the police\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Have 'em!\" roared Jurgis, with fierce passion. \"But you won't put your hands on me till you do! I haven't touched anything in your damned house, and I'll not have you touch me!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So the butler, who was terrified lest his young master should waken, stepped suddenly to the door, and opened it. \"Get out of here!\" he said; and then as Jurgis passed through the opening, he gave him a ferocious kick that sent him down the great stone steps at a run, and landed him sprawling in the snow at the bottom.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/768511", "artist_names": "Barbra Streisand", "full_title": "My Man

am his\nForever more\nIt cost me a lot but that's one thing that I've got\nIt's my man\nCold and wet tired you bet\nBut all that I soon forget, with my man\nHe's not much for looks\nAnd no hero out of books, he's my man\nTwo or three girls has he\nThat he likes as well as me but I love him\nOh my man I love him so, he'll never know\nAll my life is just despair but I don't care\nWhen he takes me in his arms\nThe world is bright, alright\nWhat's the difference if I say \"I'll go away\"\nWhen I know I'll come back on my knees someday\nFor whatever my man is, I am his\nForever moreYou might also

well\nBella lies and that's my type, I\nWish that I could hold her\nBella cries and that's alright, she's\nLeakin' on my shoulder again, well\nBella lies and that's my type, I\nWish that I could hold\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe wants to live in LA\nWhere every dog has her day\nFlip flops in the toaster now\nScotch tape on this broken vow\nAnd wow, it's time to live without my puppy's chow\nI was askin'

thread is VERY LONG. But most of it is quotes, verses, links, and annotations which make up 50% + of the thread. This isn\u2019t meant for everyone to read, except a select few which are intrested in this.)\n\nI think the GOATNESS of G Rap must be acknowledged in one thread, so that if anyone wants to find about g rap, then they can just come here to see his strengths and songs/albums to go to for specific things.\n\nIn terms of old school hip hop music (we\u2019re talking 80\u2019s, not 90\u2019s), there are the super lyrical MC\u2019s, and also in these cases, founding fathers, that like to show and prove their skill (e.g: Rakim, and others), there are the ones that attract the ladies, but at the same time kick ill rhymes (e.g: Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool J), there are the ones that had something to say (e.g: Boogie Down Productions), there are the political ones (e.g: Public Enemy), there are the storytelling ones (e.g: Slick Rick), there are the battle ones (e.g: Kool Moe Dee), and then there are the ones that you can tell without being told, that they are 80s (that\u2019s not a good or bad thing) (e.g: Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Run-D.M.C, Fat Boys, a lot of others). So what category does Kool G Rap fall into you ask? Kool G Rap falls into all of those categories, and is a diverse character. Kool G Rap rhymes about, crime, poverty, racism, songs for the females, and dope verse dropping.\n\n- Technical Lyrical Ability:\nIt is nearly undisputed that G rap is one of the most technical rappers of all time. Along with rakim he literally revolutionized and were the first to master multisyllable rhyming. However, it\u2019s not just his incredible GOAT multsyllables (which has influenced everyone from Eminem to Pharoahe Monch) it is also his consonance, assonance, internal rhyming, intricate rhyme schemes, alliteration, and even his usage of similes, metaphors, and extended metaphors.\nConsonance, assonance, internals, multis, and etc\u2026 are replete within his songs and verses, however here is a specific example of his alliteration:\n\nYou preschool poets are pitiful\nYou playing with no principle\nPut out public school\nI put a pencil in the principal\nPlea bargain my pre-meditateds palmin' my penis\nYou prolly with PoPo and participate with subpoenas\nI part through your peoples like \u201cPardon, Pa\u201d it\u2019s a problem\nThey probably plenty prayin or plain playing possum\nMake police park cars, snap pictures of parts of \u2018em\nPull punks pop pellets, you punks want no parts of him, period\nAnd of his extended metaphors:\n\nMy brain is like a factory constantly creating\nMaterial stitch by stitch for decoration\nLyrics are fabrics, beat is the lining\nMy passion in rhyming is fashion designing\nNow it gets odd it, cause people want to sport it\nYou bought it, if you didn\u2019t then you couldn\u2019t afford it\n\nCheck out this in depth and well written analysis of just one kool g rap verse, displaying his incredible skills when it comes to lyricism and being technical:\n\n\nCheck out his rhyme schems in these songs and the technical analysis generated as well:\nMen at Work\nAllied Meta-Forces\nCannon Fire\nGood Die Young\n\n- Flow\nKool G Rap seriously has one of the greatest flows OAT. he has soo many different type of flows, and he is literally a master of all of them. His flow is also versatile in a good way. usually many rappers who stick to one flow, once they try to change it, it usually sounds forced since the artist is trying to sound to much like another rapper/style. However with g rap his flows are always natural, and this is very intentional as g rap says himself:\n\nThe flow is nothing but G Rap just staying with a flow that\u2019s not dated, but is still G Rap at the same time. Because I could never flow with somebody else\u2019s flow like that. And if I did, it might sound like somebody else\u2019s flow, but these dudes was inspired by G Rap and so they took pieces of G Rap with them and became what they became. So what might sound like somebody else\u2019s flow\u2014nah, not really, that\u2019s a part of G Rap and if we could go back and listen to each and every record I made you\u2019ll probably hear those flows and shit that I did before. Somebody might have took a certain flow of mine and just based their whole style around that and just ran with it. I never just did one flow, I mean you hear a flow I did on \u201cMen at Work\u201d and you heard a different flow on \u201cRoad to the Riches,\u201d so it\u2019s like I never just did only one flow.\n\nSo as G rap said he has the fast type flow like in Men at Work (incredible fast paced flow) and a more laid back flow like on Road to Riches. However, those songs were from his earlier career, and since then G rap has refined his flow so much more on later albums like on Live and Let Die and 4,5,6. 4,5,6 is probably his best album flow wise, which is funny since i was recently reading a review of 4,5,6 by G rap and the first thing it said was:\n\nLadies and Gentlemen\u2026. The Greatest FLOOOOOOOOOOW On Earth!!!\nHe also said:\n\nIf Rakim would be titled with being the \u201cGod of Modern Lyricism\u201d, then surely Kool G. Rap is the \u201cGod of Modern Flow\u201d, being the first to have expert timing in his lyrics and punching out syllable after syllable with machine gun accuracy.\n\n\n\nEven Martin Connor (who is a computer scientist who is known on the internet, particularly RG for giving objective and in depth analysis\u2019s of rappers flows) had this to say about G raps flow and rhythm:\n\nOn this song, though, I wasn\u2019t looking for his rhymes, which is generally the last thing I pick up on a song, but the rhythms of his words. What I enjoyed so much about his musical rhythms on this song was the one, small, but very unique/characteristic idea he kept repeating. It was honestly music to my ears \u2014 pun intended \u2014 when he started repeating the idea that he first mentions around 0:11, on the words \u201cfront of my.\u201d The important aspects of this idea are that it\u2019s 3-notes long, and faster than his other rhythms, and are triplets (which is a technical, musical term, so I won\u2019t go into it.) This 3-note and fast rhythm, which I\u2019ll call rhythm 1 just for simplicity\u2019s sake, stands out from his other rhythms, which are generally slower.\n\nNow, let me walk you through how I heard this song. I heard this rhythm 1 idea once, and it stuck out because it was so unique from the other rhythms he was rapping. When he repeated it around 0:14, on \u201craggedy,\u201d I knew that something was going on. However, it was up to Kool G Rap to get the most out of this idea. At 0:15, he does rhythm 1 again, on \u201ckickin a.\u201d Again, everything I\u2019m quoting has 3 notes/syllables (they\u2019re the same thing,) and they\u2019re all fast rhythms.\n\nHaving mentioned rhythm 1 three times already, I was dying, dying, dying for him to mention it throughout the rest of the song. But from 0:17 to 0:34, he doesn\u2019t at all. That might not sound like a long time, but in music that\u2019s 7 bars, which is a long time in terms of musical time. At this point, I was incredibly disappointed, and thought I\u2019d be able to dismiss KGR as just another good-but-not-great rapper. However, when he brought rhythm 1 back at around 0:35, on \u201cthinking a-\u201d, my heart leapt for joy. He even does it again, right after, on \u201cgotta get\u201d. I now knew this was a rapper to be reckoned with.\n\nThat\u2019s because this is clearly a musician who understands how to unify an extended musical structure, a 4-minute long song, in unique ways. His simple repetition of a unique rhythm is a great way to keep the thread of dramatic tension throughout this entire song taught. After 0:36, I\u2019m not paying at all to the words Kool G Rap is saying, but instead listening for that unique rhythm. Every time it comes back, it\u2019s a relieving satisfaction of my musical expectations. For instance, he does it again at 0:45 and 0:55. I\u2019ll let you track down the rest of the times it occurs, because it\u2019s honestly so much fun to do so.\n\n\nBut please listen to these songs if you want an idea of how incredible G raps flow is:\n\nIt\u2019s a Shame- His flow on this song is just so fucking godly and on point, its almost makes me mad how incredible his flow is here. Especially the part where he says:\n\nThe boss of all bosses, I own racehorses and a fortress\nCorridors with olympic torches and Mona Lisa portraits\nJacuzzis and saunas and eatin steak at Benihana\u2019s\nBentley\u2019s, limousine, the front yard stream is full of pirahnas\nI\u2019m set, a private jet, I drink a lot of Beck\u2019s\nGet a lot of sess, condo and duplex, diamond infested Rolex\nDeliver a crown at the Wall Unit\u2019s with Silver China\nSippin on finer wine-r you see more shines than diamond miners\nThe Highness, kingpin of heroin\nI\u2019m thorough when I have to bring the terror in\nHandle business in each and every borough in\nTown or city, I\u2019m rollin like Frank Nitti, I\u2019m rich and pretty\nBack up kiddies, I got crimies that\u2019s grimy and gritty\nA nigga that\u2019s spunky and likes to keep his pockets chunky\nMakin most of my money, from all the dopefiends and junkies\nKool is Back- Along with tracks like Men at Work and #1 with the bullet (renegades BDK), this track is another example of Kool G raps rapid fire fast paced flow.\n\n1st verse of Blowin up in da world- This is honestly one of his best songs OAT, and his menacing flow is so incredible. His flow is some what sporadic (in the most amazing way possible), and it is a classic example of his trademark flow mixed with his GOAT breath control. G rap is one of those rappers that can spit 6 bars seemingly without taking a single breath. When Pun came out, his flow was one of his most stand out characteristics, and you can thank G rap for that since Pun basically took G raps entire breathless flow. For more songs with this type of flow just check out Executioner style,Let the games begin, and 4,5,6. His flow and breath control on BUIDW is especially nice when he says:\n\nI never remembered the dinners, the brother was straight fat cat\nNot even a Big Mac black, I had kit-kats on top of crackerjacks\n\nReading it may not sound that impressive but listen to the way G rap delivers this line with his breathless flow. Its incredible.\n\nWhen it comes to flow G rap is set, with multiple incredible flows from his laid back styled flow to his breathless intricate flows that have all influenced the flows of Big Pun, Nas, raekwon, BIG, and etc\u2026\n\n- Storytelling\nStorytelling is one of the most unique and intriguing things that an emcee can do. If you look at the GOAT\u2019s across the board, storytelling songs stand out in their discography as some of the most creative and entertaining songs. Some of the best storytellers in hip hop include eminem, nas, Biggie, Ghostface, Slick Rick, and etc\u2026 However, when it comes to storytelling in my honest and well thought out opinion; kool g rap is thee greatest hip hop storyteller of all time\u2026 The only one that comes close is nas, but in general G rap is the greatest when it comes to stroytelling\u2026 Storytelling is one of g raps main focus as well:\n\nA lot of people say what I write is very descriptive, because\nI\u2019m a writer kind of rapper. I\u2019m not just a rapper, like, that\ntry to get people to dance or to move and stuff like that\u2014I\u2019ll\nwrite that shit that\u2019s gonna have you sit there and you gonna\nsee visuals of what I\u2019m talking about. You\u2019re gonna see a\nshort little movie\u2014I\u2019m gonna give somebody a visual of G\nRap doing something.\n-Kool G Rap\n\nI was always a writer/novelist. The first thing I wanted to do before I started rapping was to write novels. I always had the instinct to tell stories, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m credited for being one of the most cinematic rappers.\n-Kool G rap\n\nHis first album didn\u2019t necessarily have storytelling songs however there were many instances of his ability to craft and describe images, however his 2nd album is where we see a large increase/improvement of storytelling and imagery such as:\n- Streets of new york (with NY state of mind type imagery, which this song actually directly influenced NY state of mind..)\n- Wanted: Dead or Alive: Beginning with a very zoomed in narrative of him on the run from the police after having committed a bank heist for the mob, it then zooms out to talk about the crime in the city in a general fashion. Kool G repeats this formula again in the second verse.\nand etc\u2026\n\nThese songs however these songs and albums are nothing really special looking at it from todays standards (they were great for the time in which they came out). They are nothing compared to his 3rd album Live and Let die, which was the mark of G raps GOAT storytelling status\u2026\n\nFrom the very first track we have a long, twisty heist story that Kool G Rap tells from the perspective of a low-level mob henchman, working for the Luciano crime family. Dissatisfied by what he thinks is insufficient pay for the drug running and money laundering jobs he is required to handle from day to day, he steals a shipment of 10 kg of cocaine (around $200,000 worth) so he can go into business for himself. His bosses catch him on the way to the airport, where he is plotting to flee town with his wife and son, but they are able to escape following a gunfight. He then drives into Mexico and stops at a filling station where he is again pursued by the Luciano family. He is able to kill his pursuers, including Don Luciano, and escapes.\nTrain robbery: An incredibly visual story about a gruesome train heist over an eerie beat that perfectly reflects/captres g raps story. Incredible imagery and extremely easy to follow story.\nStraight Jakcet: Honestly not his best storytelling song, however it is pretty visual and the content is very unique and intriguing.\nIll Street Blues: A very well thought out and descriptive/vvid story. each evrse is amazing and pays so much attention to detail, in this incrediblely elaborate mob story:\n\n\n\n\n\nEdge of Sanity: G Rap is on the edge of sanity because he can\u2019t get a job and his girlfriend is urging him to get off his lazy ass. He blames his place in society for committing crimes. He resorts to criminal measures and predictably, with an unsuccessful court case to follow, he ends up doing jail time. The echoing voices in the production reflect on his despair and sane-less thought process. While he\u2019s away, his girlfriend is seeing someone else. It\u2019s all an accumulation of bad things in G Rap\u2019s life. One of the best put together tracks on the album. It really shows how the prison system destroys the unity and family unit, and drives the average African American male in todays society to the edge of sanity\u2026\n\nLive and Let Die was G rap\u2019s space to just create some of the most vivid, intriguing, and Mafioso gangster hip hop story's of all time. It is his gangster and mafia hip hop themed storytelling, in his albums up to this point that would influence scores of GOAT storytellers such as Raekwon, Biggie, Nas, and etc\u2026 However, arguably his greatest album for Mafioso and vivid storytelling is without a doubt roots of evil. Nearly every single track is a storytelling song with gangster themed plots. It also includes some of his most cinematic and imagery filled raps such as:\n\nHitmans Diary: Here G Rap crafts a song surrounded on the basic premise of street poetry, only with a much more violent and gruesome circumstance. The concept here finds Kool reading out of his diary about all of the little events that he ends up running into which always end with somebody dying. Yeah, some would say this is just bonafied gangsta rap, but I prefer to call it \u201cgangsta, with a twist\u201d due to the fact that it\u2019s actually creative and has a story of it\u2019s own.\n\nOne Dark Night:\n\nFoul Cats:\n\nTekilla Sunrise: Here he is describing fantasies of being a glorified drug-lord, this time showing his dark side, explaining that he\u2019ll kill anybody regardless of race, color, or creed. After this part, he goes on to tell a story about his altercation with an enemy mexican which led to a huge gun fight. The cinematic style of Kool G. Rap comes into fruition here as he describes being on the wrong side of deadly street violence, and actually story tells. The dark, brooding production fits the depressing feel of the lyrics.\n\nAnd finally of course the best storytelling song on the album, of g raps career, and IMO the GOAT storytelling song; Thug Love Story (Chapter I,II, and III). I simply cant explain how incredible this storytelling track is. If you are unsure of g raps storytelling skills then this song would be the definitive answer to confirm g raps GOAT status in storytelling. I gave a great an d in depth description of the GOATNESS of this storytelling song which I advise you to read if you really want to understand the intricacy of the storytelling in this song and why it\u2019s so GOAT:\nn\n\n\nEverything from the content of g raps stories, to the plots, and the imagery and literary elements utilized in these songs are undeniable proof that G rap is the #1 storyteller, and if not certainly top 5 to top 3 storytellers OAT. Listen to these songs listed (which is a far cry from all of his storytelling songs lmao), read the lyrics, and annotations and I am assured that you will eventually be convinced of G raps GOAT storytelling skills\u2026\n\nSocially conscious/Content:\nKool G rap is far from being a socially conscious rapper in the same sense that emcees such as Talib Kweli and Common are, however he has a great deal of socially conscious songs, and his typical subject matter/content is substantive and can be \u201csocially aware\u201d in other ways. Some of his best socially conscious storytelling songs include:\nRoad to riches:\nErase Racism\nCrime Pays:\n\nEdge Of Sanity\nBlowin Up In da World\nWhere ya At\nHome sweet home\nHowever even when he is not necessarily being socially conscious his content contains alot of graphic and vivid descriptions of poverty, the street life, and struggles of blacks in america. His content can also be very entertaining like a movie when he talks about mafia type drug deals and heists. it is always versatile and intriguing, and never bland.\n\nDiscography\n\n\nPeople really don\u2019t realize how great Kool G rap\u2019s discography is. His first two albums with DJ Polo (1989: Road to Riches and 1990: Wanted: Dead or Alive) are classics which helped revolutionize lyricism and were absolutely mind blowing for its time. They are great albums (a little \u201cdusty\u201d, but not as dusty as other albums of the time and you can certainly appreciate it) and certified classics. His next album Live and let die in 1992, would end up being his last DJ Polo album but also being one fo the best projects of his career. Here we G rap experimenting and significantly advancing his versatile flows, impeccable lyricism, and top notch flow. For 1992, this was so ahead of its time, establishing a more advanced platform which would become the blueprint for countless GOAT rappers. It also includes features from ice cube, big daddy kane, and scarface and he outshines them all. Another certified classic, and significantly better album. After that we have his first solo album 4,5,6 and his most commercially successful album. This arguably his best album sonically and in terms of flows, and while he may not have as much storytelling, he still delivers on every single track murdering it, with many features including a classic nas feature. This album is considered a classic, however its more debatable. It\u2019s still a GOAT level album. If you missed the classic g rap cinematic storytelling on 4,5,6 then his next album in 1998 would certainly make up for that; Roots of evil. It is the ultimate work of lyrical mobsterism. Everything about the album screams Mafioso, starting from the album cover. The cover is an adaptation of the video cover of the film Scarface. Instead of the Cuban refugee turned wealthy drug kingpin Tony Montana (the lead character played by Al Pacino) and the summary of his saga, it features Kool G Rap and the summary of his career. Lyrically and musically, Roots of Evil fully epitomizes Mafioso rap. Different standout tracks such as \u201cOne Dark Night,\u201d \u201cTekilla Sunrise,\u201d \u201cMobstas,\u201d and \u201cThug\u2019s Love Story (Chapter I, II, III)\u201d are all demonstrations of Kool G Rap\u2019s versatility. \u201cOne Dark Night,\u201d a bass-heavy track, is a short but intense tale of a shootout. \u201cTekilla Sunrise,\u201d with its Latin guitar samples, is a song that \u201cmakes you want to see G Rap and Antonia Banderas busting off clips at each other in an action flick.\u201d (Juon, RapReviews). \u201cMobstas,\u201d backed by fluctuating synthesizer play, is an intricately pieced mosaic in which Kool G Rap paints a dream. He meets legendary mobsters and vigilantes (including Al Capone, Frank Costello, Lucky Luciano, Bugsy Siegel, Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly, John Dillinger). Thug Love Story is a \u201c9-minute excursion into the underworld, and is without a doubt thee greatest storytelling song in hip hop history. It is one of the greatest mafiaso hip hop albums and one fo the greatest hip hop storytelling albums, with every single track resembling a more lyrical version of biggies cinematic Niggas Bleed. At this point in g rap\u2019s discography, he has been on a straight winning streak with 5 incredible and classic (or near classic) albums from 1989 to 1998. He improves dramatically throughout these albums and delivers every single album. After this point he has The Giananca Story in 2002 and riches, royalty, respect in 2011. TGS in 2002 is not as great or classic as his previous 5 albums, however it received great feedback and includes some of g raps best verses and songs. It is a step down nonetheless, but a decent to good album with some classic mob deep features. Then his 2011 album was an even bigger step down and is his worst album reciveing mixed reviews. However someone in the games as long a g rap, who has 7 official albums, the first 5 being incredible and GOAT level, the next being a decent to good album, one slip up is quite impressive. His other albums shown in the picture above are compilation albums, and some collab albums that are alright with mixed reviews. G rap however has one of the best first 5 album runs in hip hop history, and has been consistently releasing music more than nearly every other 80s rappers.\n\nInfluence\nG rap is one of the most influental rappers of all time. His legacy and imapct on hip hop is often understated to say the least. When you think of the pioneers of 90s hip hop, you usually think of emcees like KRS ONE, Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, Chuck D, adn etc\u2026 However, people really don\u2019t acknowledge the impact that g rap has had on Hip Hop. For starters, G rap literally influenced the entire sub genre of hip hop knwon as gangsta rap and mafioso rap. G rap pioneered the drug and mafia themed raps, influecing countless gangster rap artist. G rap is the father of gangster rap, literally making him the OG of rap\u2026 Without G rap we would not have rappers/groups like\n- Nas\n- Raekwon\n- Ghostface killah\n- Biggie\n- Jay Z\n- Big Pun\n- The LOX\n- Big L\n-AZ\n- Scarface\nand etc\u2026\n\nAnd without G rap we would'nt have classic mafioso themed rap albums like:\n\nLets not forget to mention the fact that Rakim was not the only one to master multisyllable rhyming in the 80s\u2026 G rap was just as important to the pioneering of modern lyricism today as rakim, and he is arguably (from a technical aspect) just as good and in some aspects better than rakim\u2026.\n\nJust check out this Kool G Rap Demo the same year that paid in full came out\n\n\nG rap was rhyming just as insane as rakim, and his debut album in 1989 was just as influntal and impactful to lyricism in hip hop\u2026 In fact it was G raps multisyllable raps and intrciate rhyme schemes that helped significantly influence lyrical heavy weights such as:\n- eminem\n- Elzhi\n- Pharoahe Monch\n- Joell Ortiz\n- Black Thought\n- R.A the rugged man\n- Canibus\n- MF DOOM\n- Papoose\n- RZA\n- Immortal technique\n- Vinnie Paz\n- Action Bronson\n\nAll the rappers I named above have mentioned G rap as a major influence lyrically. IMO he is probably the 2nd most influental rapper of all time (with rakim at #1), with not only helping revolutionize lyricism, but by also help creating an entire sub genre of hip hop that has literally directly influenced some of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.\n\n\nLets also not forget the artist that he not only gave the entire blueprint for all of these artists styles, flows, and careers, but he also helped them get put on in the first place. One of the best examples is nas. When nas came out the biggest comparison was rakim, but another huge comparison was g rap. G rap comparisons were everywhere, and nas has admitted this since nas\u2019s style is so heavily influenced by g rap. Before illmatic kool g rap actually tried to get nas signed to def jam and set up a meeting for nas with Kevin liles. They rejected him since they said his style was too similar to g rap. G rap didn\u2019t give up on nas and gave nas studio sessions at his house. And it was at G raps house where nas met MC serch, who would lead nas to live at the barbecue and blow up. Kool G Rap was the one putting nas\u2019s name out to producers and rappers telling them how crazy this kid was. All of this is pre-illmatic. G rap practically helped catapult nas\u2019s career both through his influence in style and business connections that he gave nas. Once illmatic came out nas had already knew the right people and producers through g rap, and according to G rap the \u201cpassing the torch moment was nas\u2019s feature on Fast Life (fun fact: nas is on the cover of the 4,5,6 album right next to g rap) track:\n\u201cFast Life\u201d was looked at as a passing of the torch to Nas, because before I had been shopping him around. He recorded his whole demo in my studio. By the time we did \u201cFast Life\u201d together, Nas had already started to make his entry into the game. That was the first time we had rapped together on a song, and the timing made it a passing of the torch. Before that, I set up a meeting with Lyor Cohen and Kevin Liles at Def Jam to talk about Nas. Kevin Liles was the one who said that he sounds too much like a G Rap, and so Def Jam passed. I knew I had some influence on him but I knew he had his own identity.[3]\n\u2014\u2009Kool G Rap\nAnd it stands today as nas\u2019s favorite feature since it showed how he could go toe to toe with one of the best, who birthed his style. So without g rap, their would be no nas at all. Literally.\nG rap\u2019s influence and impact on the game can\u2019t be overlooked at all.\n\nRenegades\nKool G Rap nearly never gets outshined on a track. Its almost always a renegade:\n- He renegaded Big daddy Kane, Masta Ace, and marley marl in their prime on the symphony. His original verse was like 10-15 minutes, so they cut it and the rest of the verse went to his CLASSIC men at work. He outshined them all without a doubt.\n- He renegaded Mobb Deep on the realest. Alchemist said that he wote his verse first and quickly, and just left everyone in the studio completely stunned and speechless. He even received a hip hop quotable of the month for it:\n\n\n\nHe renegaded Big L on fall back, with superior flow and lyricism. It was kind of embarrassing to hear big ls verse with g raps tbh.\nHe renegaded BDK again in his prime with #1 with the bullet with not one but two incredible verses displaying that G rap could outrap BDK in terms of flow and incredibly fast paced rhyming; two of BDK\u2019s most special traits\u2026\nKool G rap murdered Pun twice on wishful thinking and dramaticide. Even though pun delivered well, g rap just stole the track.\nHe renegaded AZ and Papoose (who had a lyrical miracle verse but still couldn\u2019t be as technical as g rap) on Thug connection in terms of flow, lyricism, and content.\nHe embarrassed Ghostface Killah on dogs of War from his 36 seasons album\u2026\nIMO he renegaded ghostface and raekwon on rivers of blood, but not that bad.\nHe is the first person to outshine canibus on a record, from allied meta forces. Even though its close and canibus held his own, g rap outshined him with an epic verse.\nI still think G rap outshined nas on fast life. Nas held his own and was able to keep up but g rap flowed better, was more technical, and has better replay value than nas\u2019s verse IMO.\n\nThe only time I can think of G rap ever getting outshined was by RA the rugged man on 3 kingz. RA increased his rhyme density by 10-15% tho, to keep up with G rap, and RA is ALWAYS praising Kool G Rap as the GOAT emcee and GOAT lyricist. That\u2019s it. The rest can\u2019t outshine him by a lot.\n\nOverall, G rap is a GOAT imo the 2nd greatest rapper of all time, and just a full package. His delivery, flows, lyricism, content, storytelling, punchlines, consistency, legacy, and etc\u2026 is all just top notch. He has a top 10-15 flow OAT, top 5 technical lyricist, #1 storyteller OAT, has one of the best first 5 album runs OAT, and is the 2nd most influential rapper. The importance of g rap is so incredible and unbearable, that it is criminal that it is outshined by the GOAT legacy's of rakim, KRS, and BDK. Even Big daddy kane said:\n\u201cI always feel like I took his slot. I always felt he never got the props he deserved. When I took off it wasn\u2019t really enough room for us two, so my man never got to shine the way he could have. I don\u2019t think the world knows how great Kool G rap is on the mic\u201d\nAnd even peter Rosenberg said to G rap:\n\u201cHow do you feel being the guy who allowed other people to make bread. You were the guy who never sought money or glory, you just did your job, added to the craft, and help facilitate other people\u201d\nHe even said in response to Rosenberg asking if he knew nas was going to make more money than him saying:\n\u201cI would\u2019ve never thought of it like that\u2026 Im one of the guys who appreciates true lyricism. If I hear something that I feel the world needs to hear, I just wanna get it out there. (I didn\u2019t do it for a big pay day). Which is why I never monopolize off the game like that.\u201d\nHe is truly one of the most influential GOAT rappers that never gets the recognition he deserves; but at the same time doesn\u2019t care as long as he is delivering and contributing to the art form in making authentic music and giving the pathway for others to do so as well. The dude is so real, humble, and committed to his art in ways that is lost IMO in todays hip hop. His whole persona brings together street-level wit with the verbal aptitude of a bookworm, bridging the gap between high-brow lyrical nerds and head-nodding tough guys in a manner that has yet to be duplicated effectivelyEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1514560", "artist_names": "Dionne Warwick", "full_title": "You Can Have Him by\u00a0Dionne\u00a0Warwick",

Burton", "lyrics": "Arabian Nights, Vol. 3 (Chap. 13) LyricsTale Of Kamar Al Zaman\n\nThat there was in times of yore and in ages long gone before a King called Shahrim\u00e1n,[FN#220] who was lord of many troops and guards, and officers, and who reigned over certain islands, known as the Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1n Islands,[FN#221] on the borders of the land of the Persians. But he was stricken in years and his bones were wasted, without having been blessed with a son, albeit he had four wives, daughters of Kings, and threescore concubines, with each of whom he was wont to lie one night in turn.[FN#222] This preyed upon his mind and disquieted him, so that he complained thereof to one of his Wazirs, saying, \"Verily I fear lest my kingdom be lost when I die, for that I have no son to succeed me.\" The Minister answered, \"O King, peradventure Allah shall yet bring something to pass; so rely upon the Almighty and be instant in prayer. It is also my counsel that thou spread a banquet and invite to it the poor and needy, and let them eat of thy food; and supplicate the Lord to vouchsafe thee a son; for perchance there may be among thy guests a righteous soul whose prayers find acceptance; and thereby thou shalt win thy wish.\" So the King rose, made the lesser ablution, and prayed a two-bow prayer,[FN#223] then he cried upon Allah with pure intention; after which he called his chief wife to bed and lay with her forthright. By grace of God she conceived and, when her months were accomplished, she bore a male child, like the moon on the night of fulness. The King named him Kamar al-Zam\u00e1n,[FN#224] and rejoiced in him with extreme joy and bade the city be dressed out in his honour; so they decorated the streets seven days, whilst the drums beat and the messengers bore the glad tidings abroad. Then wet and dry nurses were provided for the boy and he was reared in splendour and delight, until he reached the age of fifteen. He grew up of surpassing beauty and seemlihead and symmetry, and his father loved him so dear that he could not brook to be parted from him day or night. One day he complained to a certain of his Ministers anent the excess of his love for his only child, saying, \"O thou the Wazir, of a truth I fear for my son, Kamar al-Zaman, the shifts and accidents which befal man and fain would I marry him in my life-time.\" Answered the Wazir, \"O King, know thou that marriage is one of the most honourable of moral actions, and thou wouldst indeed do well and right to marry thy son in thy lifetime, ere thou make him Sultan.\" On this quoth the King, \"Hither with my son Kamar al-Zaman;\" so he came and bowed his head to the ground in modesty before his sire. \"O Kamar al Zaman,\" said King Shahriman, \"of a truth I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee during my lifetime.\" Replied he, \"O my father, know that I have no lust to marry nor cloth my soul incline to women; for that concerning their craft and perfidy I have read many books and heard much talk, even as saith the poet,\n\n'Now, an of women ask ye, I reply:\u2014*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In their affairs I'm versed a doctor rare!\nWhen man's head grizzles and his money dwindles, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In their affections he hath naught for share.'\n\nAnd another said:\u2014\n'Rebel against women and so shalt thou serve Allah the more; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The youth who gives women the rein must forfeit all hope to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     soar.\nThey'll baulk him when seeking the strange device, Excelsior, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tho' waste he a thousand of years in the study of science\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     and lore.' \"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verses he continued, \"O my father, wedlock is a thing whereto I will never consent; no, not though I drink the cup of death.\" When Sultan Shahriman heard these words from his son, light became darkness in his sight and he grieved thereat with great grief.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman heard these words from his son, the light became darkness in his sight and he grieved over his son's lack of obedience to his directions in the matter of marriage; yet, for the great love he bore him, he was unwilling to repeat his wishes and was not wroth with him, but caressed him and spake him fair and showed him all manner of kindness such as tendeth to induce affection. All this, and Kamar al-Zaman increased daily in beauty and loveliness and amorous grace; and the King bore with him for a whole year till he became perfect in eloquence and elegant wit. All men were ravished with his charms; and every breeze that blew bore the tidings of his gracious favour; his fair sight was a seduction to the loving and a garden of delight to the longing, for he was honey-sweet of speech and the sheen of his face shamed the full moon; he was a model of symmetry and blandishment and engaging ways; his shape was as the willow-wand or the rattan- cane and his cheeks might take the place of rose or red anemone. He was, in fine the pink of perfection, even as the poet hath said of him,\n\n\"He came and cried they, 'Now be Allah blest! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Praise Him that clad that soul in so fair vest!'\nHe's King of Beauty where the beauteous be; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     All are his Ryots,[FN#225] all obey his hest:\nHis lip-dew's sweeter than the virgin honey; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His teeth are pearls in double row close press:\nAll charms are congregate in him alone, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And deals his loveliness to man unrest.\nBeauty wrote on those cheeks for worlds to see *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'I testify there is none good but He.'\"[FN#226]\n\nWhen the year came to an end, the King called his son to him and said, \"O my son, wilt thou not hearken to me?\" Whereupon Kamar al-Zaman fell down for respect and shame before his sire and replied, \"O my father, how should I not hearken to thee, seeing that Allah commandeth me to obey thee and not gain-say thee?\" Rejoined King Shahriman, \"O my son, know that I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee whilst yet I live, and make thee King over my realm, before my death.\" When the Prince heard his sire pronounce these words he bowed his head awhile, then raised it and said, \"O my father, this is a thing which I will never do; no, not though I drink the cup of death! I know of a surety that the Almighty hath made obedience to thee a duty in religion; but, Allah upon thee! press me not in this matter of marriage, nor fancy that I will ever marry my life long; for that I have read the books both of the ancients and the moderns, and have come to know all the mischiefs and miseries which have befallen them through women and their endless artifices. And how excellent is the saying of the poet,\n'He whom the randy motts entrap *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall never see deliverance!\nThough build he forts a thousand-fold, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose mighty strength lead-plates enhance,[FN#227]\nTheir force shall be of no avail; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     These fortresses have not a chance!\nWomen aye deal in treachery *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To far and near o'er earth's expanse\nWith fingers dipt in Henna-blood *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And locks in braids that mad the glance;\nAnd eyelids painted o'er with Kohl *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  They gar us drink of dire mischance.'\n\nAnd how excellently saith another,\n\n'Women, for all the chastity they claim, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Are offal cast by kites where'er they list:\nThis night their talk and secret charms are shine, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That night another joyeth calf and wrist:\nLike inn, whence after night thou far'st at dawn, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lodges other wight thou hast not wist.'\"[FN#228]\n\nNow when King Shahriman heard these his son's words and learnt the import of his verses and poetical quotations, he made no answer, of his excessive love for him, but redoubled in graciousness and kindness to him. He at once broke up the audience and, as soon as the seance was over, he summoned his Minister and taking him apart, said to him, \"O thou the Wazir! tell me how I shall deal with my son in the matter of marriage.\"- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted stay.\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King summoned his Minister; and, taking him apart, said to him, \"O thou the Wazir, tell me what I shall do with my son in the matter of marriage. Of a truth I took counsel with thee thereon and thou didst counsel me to marry him, before making him King. I have spoken with him of wedlock time after time and he still gainsaid me; so do thou, O Wazir, forthright advise me what to do.\" Answered the Minister, \"O King, wait another year and, if after that thou be minded to speak to him on the matter of marriage, speak not to him privily, but address him on a day of state, when all the Emirs and Wazirs are present with the whole of the army standing before thee. And when all are in crowd then send for thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and summon him; and, when he cometh, broach to him the matter of marriage before the Wazirs and Grandees and Officers of state and Captains; for he will surely be bashful and daunted by their presence and will not dare to oppose thy will.\" Now when King Shahriman heard his Wazir's words, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, seeing success in the project, and bestowed on him a splendid robe of honour. Then he took patience with his son another year, whilst, with every day that passed over him, Kamar al-Zaman increased in beauty and loveliness, and elegance and perfect grace, till he was nigh twenty years old. Indeed Allah had clad him in the cloak of comeliness and had crowned him with the crown of completion: his eye-glance was more bewitching than H\u00e1r\u00fat and Mar\u00fat[FN#229] and the play of his luring looks more misleading than T\u00e1gh\u00fat;[FN#230] and his cheeks shone like the dawn rosy-red and his eyelashes stormed the keen-edged blade: the whiteness of his brow resembled the moon shining bright, and the blackness of his locks was as the murky night; and his waist was more slender than the gossamer[FN#231] and his back parts than two sand heaps bulkier, making a Babel of the heart with their softness; but his waist complained of the weight of his hips and loins; and his charms ravished all mankind, even as one of the poets saith in these couplets,\n\"By his eyelash tendril curled, by his slender waist I swear,\nBy the dart his witchery feathers, fatal hurtling through the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   air;\nBy the just roundness of his shape, by his glances bright and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   keen\nBy the swart limping of his locks, and his fair forehead shining\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sheen;\nBy his eyebrows which deny that she who looks on them should\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sleep,\nWhich now commanding, now forbidding, o'er me high dominion keep;\nBy the roses of his cheek, his face as fresh as myrtle wreath\nHis tulip lips, and those pure pearls that hold the places of his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     teeth;\nBy his noble form, which rises featly turned in even swell\nTo where upon his jutting chest two young pomegranates seem to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   dwell\nBy his supple moving hips, his taper waist, the silky skin,\nBy all he robbed Perfection of, and holds enchained his form\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     within;\nBy his tongue of steadfastness, his nature true, and excellent,\nBy the greatness of his rank, his noble birth, and high descent,\nMusk from my love her savour steals, who musk exhales from every\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     limb\nAnd all the airs ambergris breathes are but the Zephyr's blow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     o'er him.\nThe sun, methinks, the broad bright sun, as low before my love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     should quail\nAs would my love himself transcend the paltry paring of his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     nail!\"[FN#232]\nSo King Shahriman, having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shahriman having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival, a day of state when the audience hall was filled with his Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of his reign and Officers of State and Captains of might and main. Thereupon he sent for his son Kamar al-Zaman who came, and kissing the ground before him three times, stood in presence of his sire with his hands behind his back the right grasping the left.[FN#233] Then said the King to him, \"Know O my son, that I have not sent for thee on this occasion and summoned thee to appear before this assembly and all these officers of estate here awaiting our orders save and except that I may lay a commandment on thee, wherein do thou not disobey me; and my commandment is that thou marry, for I am minded to wed thee to a King's daughter and rejoice in thee ere I die.\" When the Prince heard this much from his royal sire, he bowed his head groundwards awhile, then raising it towards his father and being moved thereto at that time by youthful folly and boyish ignorance, replied, \"But for myself I will never marry; no, not though I drink the cup of death! As for thee, thou art great in age and small of wit: hast thou not, twice ere this day and before this occasion, questioned me of the matter of marriage and I refused my consent? Indeed thou dotest and are not fit to govern a flock of sheep!\" So saying Kamar al-Zaman unclasped his hands from behind his back and tucked up his sleeves above his elbows before his father, being in a fit of fury; moreover, he added many words to his sire, knowing not what he said in the trouble of his spirits. The King was confounded and ashamed, for that this befel in the presence of his grandees and soldier-officers assembled on a high festival and a state occasion; but presently the majesty of Kingship took him, and he cried out at his son and made him tremble. Then he called to the guards standing before him and said, \"Seize him!' So they came forward and laid hands on him and, binding him, brought him before his sire, who bade them pinion his elbows behind his back and in this guise make him stand before the presence. And the Prince bowed down his head for fear and apprehension, and his brow and face were beaded and spangled with sweat; and shame and confusion troubled him sorely. Thereupon his father abused him and reviled him and cried, \"Woe to thee, thou son of adultery and nursling of abomination![FN#234] How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman cried out to his son Kamar al-Zaman, \"How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee. Knowest thou not that this deed thou hast done were a disgrace to him had it been done by the meanest of my subjects?\" And the King commanded his Mamelukes to loose his elbow bonds and imprison him in one of the bastions of the citadel. So they took the Prince and thrust him into an old tower, wherein there was a dilapidated saloon and in its middle a ruined well, after having first swept it and cleansed its floor-flags and set therein a couch on which they laid a mattress, a leathern rug and a cushion; and then they brought a great lanthorn and a wax candle, for that place was dark, even by day. And lastly the Mamelukes led Kamar al-Zaman thither, and stationed an eunuch at the door. And when all this was done, the Prince threw himself on the couch, sad-spirited, and heavy- hearted; blaming himself and repenting of his injurious conduct to his father, whenas repentance availed him naught, and saying, \"Allah curse marriage and marriageable and married women, the traitresses all! Would I had hearkened to my father and accepted a wife! Had I so done it had been better for me than this jail.\" This is how it fared with him; but as regards King Shahri man, he remained seated on his throne all through the day until sundown; then he took the Minister apart and said to him \"Know thou, O Wazir, that thou and thou only west the cause of all this that hath come to pass between me and my son by the advice thou west pleased to devise; and so what dost thou counsel me to do now?\" Answered he, \"O King, leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days: then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, said to King Shahriman, \"Leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days; then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again.\" The King accepted the Wazir's opinion and lay down to sleep that night troubled at heart concerning his son; for he loved him with dearest love because he had no other child but this; and it was his wont every night not to sleep, save after placing his arm under his son's neck. So he passed that night in trouble and unease on the Prince 's account, tossing from side to side, as he were laid on coals of Artemisia-wood[FN#235]: for he was overcome with doubts and fears and sleep visited him not all that livelong night; but his eyes ran over with tears and he began repeating, ;\n\n\"While slanderers slumber, longsome is my night; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Suffice thee a heart so sad in parting-plight;\nI say, while night in care slow moments by, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'What! no return for thee, fair morning light?'\"\n\nAnd the saying of another,\n\n\"When saw I Pleiad-stars his glance escape *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And Pole star draught of sleep upon him pour;\nAnd the Bier-daughters[FN#236] wend in mourning dight, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I knew that morning was for him no more!\"\n\nSuch was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, when the night came upon him the eunuch set the lanthorn before him and lighting the wax-candle, placed it in the candlestick; then brought him somewhat of food. The Prince ate a little and continually reproached himself for his unseemly treatment of his father, saying to himself, \"O my soul, knowest thou not that a son of Adam is the hostage of his tongue, and that a man's tongue is what casteth him into deadly perils?\" Then his eyes ran over with tears and he bewailed that which he had done, from anguished vitals and aching heart, repenting him with exceeding repentance of the wrong wherewith he had wronged his father and repeating,\n\n\"Fair youth shall die by stumbling of the tongue: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Stumble of foot works not man's life such wrong:\nThe slip of lip shall oft smite off the head, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     While slip of foot shall never harm one long.\"\n\nNow when he had made an end of eating, he asked for the wherewithal to wash his hands and when the Mameluke had washed them clean of the remnants of food, he arose and made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the prayers of sundown and nightfall, conjoining them in one; after which he sat down.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince Kamar al-Zaman had prayed (conjoining them in one) the prayers of sundown and nightfall, he sat down on the well and began reciting the Koran, and he repeated \"The Cow,\" the \"House of Imr\u00e1n,\" and \"Y. S.;\" \"The Compassionate,\" \"Blessed be the King,\" \"Unity\" and \"The two Talismans''[FN#237]; and he ended with blessing and supplication and with saying, \"I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned.\"[FN#238] Then he lay down upon his couch which was covered with a mattress of satin from al- Ma'adin town, the same on both sides and stuffed with the raw silk of Irak; and under his head was a pillow filled with ostrich-down And when ready for sleep, he doffed his outer clothes and drew off his bag-trousers and lay down in a shirt of delicate stuff smooth as wax; and he donned a head-kerchief of azure Mar\u00e1zi[FN#239] cloth; and at such time and on this guise Kamar al-Zaman was like the full-orbed moon, when it riseth on its fourteenth night. Then, drawing over his head a coverlet of silk, he fell asleep with the lanthorn burning at his feet and the wax-candle over his head, and he ceased not sleeping through the first third of the night, not knowing what lurked for him in the womb of the Future, and what the Omniscient had decreed for him. Now, as Fate and Fortune would have it, both tower and saloon were old and had been many years deserted; and there was therein a Roman well inhabited by a Jinniyah of the seed of Iblis[FN#240] the Accursed, by name Maym\u00fanah, daughter of Al- Dimiry\u00e1t, a renowned King of the J\u00e1nn.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the name of the Jinniyah in question was Maymunah, daughter of Al-Dimiryat; a renowned King of the Jann. And as Kamar al-Zaman continued sleeping till the first third of the night, Maymunah came up out of the Roman well and made for the firmament, thinking to listen by stealth to the converse of the angels; but when she reached the mouth of the well, she saw a light shining in the tower, contrary to custom; and having dwelt there many years without seeing the like, she said to herself, \"Never have I witnessed aught like this\"; and, marvelling much at the matter, determined that there must be some cause therefor. So she made for the light and found the eunuch sleeping within the door; and inside she saw a couch spread, whereon was a human form with the wax-candle burning at his head and the lanthorn at his feet, and she wondered to see the light and stole towards it little by little. Then she folded her wings and stood by the bed and, drawing back the coverlid, discovered Kamar al-Zaman's face. She was motionless for a full hour in admiration and wonderment; for the lustre of his visage outshone that of the candle; his face beamed like a pearl with light; his eyelids were languorous like those of the gazelle; the pupils of his eyes were intensely black and brilliant[FN#241]; his cheeks were rosy red; his eye-brows were arched like bows and his breath exhaled a scent of musk, even as saith of him the poet,\n\n\"I kissed him: darker grew those pupils,[FN#242] which *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Seduce my soul, and cheeks flushed rosier hue;\nO heart, if slanderers dare to deem there be *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His like in chasms, Say 'Bring him hither, you!' \"\n\nNow when Maymunah saw him, she pronounced the formula of praise,[FN#243] and said, \"Blessed be Allah, the best of Creators!\"; for she was of the true-believing Jinn; and she stood awhile gazing on his face, exclaiming and envying the youth his beauty and loveliness. And she said in herself, \"By Allah! I will do no hurt to him nor let any harm him; nay, from all of evil will I ransom him, for this fair face deserveth not but that folk should gaze upon it and for it praise the Lord. Yet how could his family find it in their hearts to leave him in such desert place where, if one of our M\u00e1rids came upon him at this hour, he would assuredly slay him.\" Then the Ifritah Maymunah bent over him and kissed him between the eyes, and presently drew back the sheet over his face which she covered up; and after this she spread her wings and soaring into the air, flew upwards. And after rising high from the circle of the saloon she ceased not winging her way through air and ascending skywards till she drew near the heaven of this world, the lowest of the heavens. And behold, she heard the noisy flapping of wings cleaving the welkin and, directing herself by the sound, she found when she drew near it that the noise came from an Ifrit called Dahnash. So she swooped down on him like a sparrow-hawk and, when he was aware of her and knew her to be Maymunah, the daughter of the King of the Jinn, he feared her and his side-muscles quivered; and he implored her forbearance, saying, I conjure thee by the Most Great and August Name and by the most noble talisman graven upon the seal-ring of Solomon, entreat me kindly and harm me not!\" When she heard these words her heart inclined to him and she said, \"Verily, thou conjurest me, O accursed, with a mighty conjuration. Nevertheless, I will not let thee go, till thou tell me whence thou comest at this hour.\" He replied, \"O Princess, Know that I come from the uttermost end of China-land and from among the Islands, and I will tell thee of a wonderful thing I have seen this night. If thou kind my words true, let me wend my way and write me a patent under thy hand and with thy sign manual that I am thy freedman, so none of the Jinn-hosts, whether of the upper who fly or of the lower who walk the earth or of those who dive beneath the waters, do me let or hindrance.\" Rejoined Maymunah, \"And what is it thou hast seen this night, O liar, O accursed! Tell me without leasing and think not to escape from my hand with falses, for I swear to thee by the letters graven upon the bezel of the seal-ring of Solomon David son (on both of whom be peace!), except thy speech be true, I will pluck out thy feathers with mine own hand and strip off thy skin and break thy bones!\" Quoth the Ifrit Dahnash son of Shamh\u00farish[FN#244] the Flyer, \"I accept, O my lady, these conditions.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-eight Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash spoke thus to Maymunah, \"I accept, O my lady, these conditions.\" Then he resumed, \"Know, O my mistress, that I come to-night from the Islands of the Inland Sea in the parts of China, which are the realms of King Ghay\u00far, lord of the Islands and the Seas and the Seven Palaces. There I saw a daughter of his, than whom Allah hath made none fairer in her time: I cannot picture her to thee, for my tongue would fail to describe her with her due of praise; but I will name to thee a somewhat of her charms by way of approach. Now her hair is like the nights of disunion and separation and her face like the days of union and delectation; and right well hath the poet said when picturing her,\n\n'She dispread the locks from her head one night, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Showing four fold nights into one night run\nAnd she turned her visage towards the moon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And two moons showed at moment one.'\n\nShe hath a nose like the edge of the burnished blade and cheeks like purple wine or anemones blood-red: her lips as coral and carnelian shine and the water of her mouth is sweeter than old wine; its taste would quench Hell's fiery pain. Her tongue is moved by wit of high degree and ready repartee: her breast is a seduction to all that see it (glory be to Him who fashioned it and finished it!); and joined thereto are two upper arms smooth and rounded; even as saith of her the poet Al-Walah\u00e1n,[FN#245]\n\n'She hath wrists which, did her bangles not contain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would run from out her sleeves in silvern rain.'\n\nShe hath breasts like two globes of ivory, from whose brightness the moons borrow light, and a stomach with little waves as it were a figured cloth of the finest Egyptian linen made by the Copts, with creases like folded scrolls, ending in a waist slender past all power of imagination; based upon back parts like a hillock of blown sand, that force her to sit when she would fief stand, and awaken her, when she fain would sleep, even as saith of her and describeth her the poet,\n\n\n'She hath those hips conjoined by thread of waist, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Hips that o'er me and her too tyrannise\nMy thoughts they daze whene'er I think of them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And weigh her down whene'er she would uprise.'[FN#246]\n\nAnd those back parts are upborne by thighs smooth and round and by a calf like a column of pearl, and all this reposeth upon two feet, narrow, slender and pointed like spear-blades,[FN#247] the handiwork of the Protector and Requiter, I wonder how, of their littleness, they can sustain what is above them. But I cut short my praises of her charms fearing lest I be tedious.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash bin Shamhurish said to the Ifritah Maymunah, \"Of a truth I cut short my praises fearing lest I be tedious.\" Now when Maymunah heard the description of that Princess and her beauty and loveliness, she stood silent in astonishment; whereupon Dahnash resumed, \"The father of this fair maiden is a mighty King, a fierce knight, immersed night and day in fray and fight; for whom death hath no fright and the escape of his foe no dread, for that he is a tyrant masterful and a conqueror irresistible, lord of troops and armies and continents and islands, and cities and villages, and his name is King Ghayur, Lord of the Islands and of the Seas and of the Seven Palaces. Now he loveth his daughter, the young maiden whom I have described to thee, with dearest love and, for affection of her, he hath heaped together the treasures of all the kings and built her therewith seven palaces, each of a different fashion; the first of crystal, the second of marble, the third of China steel, the fourth of precious stones and gems of price, the fifth of porcelain and many-hued onyxes and ring bezels, the sixth of silver and the seventh of gold. And he hath filled the seven palaces with all sorts of sumptuous furniture, rich silken carpets and hangings and vessels of gold and silver and all manner of gear that kings require; and hath bidden his daughter to abide in each by turns for a certain season of the year; and her name is the Princess Budur.[FN#248] Now when her beauty became known and her name and fame were bruited abroad in the neighbouring countries, all the kings sent to her father to demand her of him in marriage, and he consulted her on the matter, but she disliked the very word wedlock with a manner of abhorrence and said, O my father, I have no mind to marry; no, not at all; for I am a sovereign Lady and a Queen suzerain ruling over men, and I have no desire for a man who shall rule over me. And the more suits she refused, the more her suitors' eagerness increased and all the Royalties of the Inner Islands of China sent presents and rarities to her father with letters asking her in marriage. So he pressed her again and again with advice on the matter of espousals; but she ever opposed to him refusals, till at last she turned upon him angrily and cried, 'O my father, if thou name matrimony to me once more, I will go into my chamber and take a sword and, fixing its hilt in the ground, will set its point to my waist; then will I press upon it, till it come forth from my back, and so slay myself.' Now when the King heard these her words, the light became darkness in his sight and his heart burned for her as with a flame of fire, because he feared lest she should kill herself; and he was filled with perplexity concerning her affair and the kings her suitors. So he said to her 'If thou be determined not to marry and there be no help for it abstain from going and coming in and out.' Then he placed her in a house and shut her up in a chamber, appointing ten old women as duennas to guard her, and forbade her to go forth to the Seven Palaces; moreover, he made it appear that he was incensed against her, and sent letters to all the kings, giving them to know that she had been stricken with madness by the Jinns; and it is now a year since she hath thus been secluded.\" Then continued the Ifrit Dahnash, addressing the Ifritah Maymunah, \"And I, O my lady go to her every night and take my fill of feeding my sight on her face and I kiss her between the eyes: yet, of my love to her, I do her no hurt neither mount her, for that her youth is fair and her grace surpassing: every one who seeth her jealouseth himself for her. I conjure thee, therefore, O my lady, to go back with me and look on her beauty and loveliness and stature and perfection of proportion; and after, if thou wilt, chastise me or enslave me; and win to thy will, for it is shine to bid and to forbid.\" So saying, the Ifrit Dahnash bowed his head towards the earth and drooped his wings downward; but Maymunah laughed at his words and spat in his face and answered, \"What is this girl of whom thou pratest but a potsherd wherewith to wipe after making water?[FN#249] Faugh! Faugh! By Allah, O accursed, I thought thou hadst some wondrous tale to tell me or some marvellous news to give me. How would it be if thou were to sight my beloved? Verily, this night I have seen a young man, whom if thou saw though but in a dream, thou wouldst be palsied with admiration and spittle would flow from thy mouth.\" Asked the Ifrit, \"And who and what is this youth?\"; and she answered, \"Know, O Dahnash, that there hath befallen the young man the like of what thou tellest me befel thy mistress; for his father pressed him again and again to marry, but he refused, till at length his sire waxed wroth at being opposed and imprisoned him in the tower where I dwell: and I came up to-night and saw him.\" Said Dahnash, \"O my lady, shew me this youth, that I may see if he be indeed handsomer than my mistress, the Princess Budur, or not; for I cannot believe that the like of her liveth in this our age.\" Rejoined Maymunah, \"Thou liest, O accursed, O most ill-omened of Marids and vilest of Satans![FN#250] Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen It was the One Hundred and Eightieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifritah Maymunah spake thus to the Ifrit Dahnash, \"Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world! Art thou mad to fellow thy beloved with my beloved?\" He said, \"Allah upon thee, O my lady, go back with me and look upon my mistress, and after I will with thee and look upon thy beloved.\" She answered, \"It must needs be so, O accursed, for thou art a knavish devil; but I will not go with thee nor shalt thou come with me, save upon condition of a wager which is this. If the lover thou lovest and of whom thou boastest so bravely, prove handsomer than mine whom I mentioned and whom I love and of whom I boast, the bet shall be shine against me; but if my beloved prove the handsomer the bet shall be mine against thee.\" Quoth Dahnash the Ifrit, \"O my lady, I accept this thy wager and am satisfied thereat; so come with me to the Islands.\" Quoth Maymunah; \"No! for the abode of my beloved is nearer than the abode of shine: here it is under us; so come down with me to see my beloved and after we will go look upon thy mistress.\" \"I hear and I obey,\" said Dahnash. So they descended to earth and alighted in the saloon which the tower contained; then Maymunah stationed Dahnash beside the bed and, putting out her hand, drew back the silken coverlet from Kamar al-Zaman's face, when it glittered and glistened and shimmered and shone like the rising sun. She gazed at him for a moment, then turning sharply round upon Dahnash said, \"Look, O accursed, and be not the basest of madmen; I am a maid, yet my heart he hath waylaid.\" So Dahnash looked at the Prince and long continued gazing steadfastly on him then, shaking his head, said to Maymunah, \"By Allah, O my lady, thou art excusable; but there is yet another thing to be considered, and this is, that the estate female differeth from the male. By Allah's might, this thy beloved is the likest of all created things to my mistress in beauty and loveliness and grace and perfection; and it is as though they were both cast alike in the mould of seemlihead.\" Now when Maymunah heard these words, the light became darkness in her sight and she dealt him with her wing so fierce a buffet on the head as well-nigh made an end of him. Then quoth she to him, \"I conjure thee, by the light of his glorious countenance, go at once, O accursed, and bring hither thy mistress whom thou lovest so fondly and foolishly, and return in haste that we may lay the twain together and look on them both as they lie asleep side by side; so shall it appear to us which be the goodlier and more beautiful of the two. Except thou obey me this very moment, O accursed, I will dart my sparks at thee with my fire and consume thee; yea, in pieces I will rend thee and into the deserts cast thee, that to stay at home and wayfarer an example thou be!\" Quoth Dahnash, \"O my lady, I will do thy behests, for I know forsure that my mistress is the fairer and the sweeter.\" So saying the If rit flew away and Maymunah flew with him to guard him. They were absent awhile and presently returned, bearing the young lady, who was clad in a shift of fine Venetian silk, with a double edging of gold and purfled with the most exquisite of embroidery having these couplets worked upon the ends of the sleeves,\n\n\"Three matters hinder her from visiting us, in fear *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Of hate-full, slandering envier and his hired spies:\nThe shining light of brow, the trinkets' tinkling voice, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And scent of essences that tell whene'er she tries:\nGi'en that she hide her brow with edge of sleeve, and leave *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     At home her trinketry, how shall her scent\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     disguise?''[FN#251]\n\nAnd Dahnash and Maymunah stinted not bearing that young lady till they had carried her into the saloon and had laid her beside the youth Kamar al-Zaman.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash and the Ifritah Maymunah stinted not bearing Princess Budur till they descended and laid her on the couch beside Kamar al- Zaman. Then they uncovered both their faces, and they were the likest of all folk, each to other, as they were twins or an only brother and sister; and indeed they were a seduction to the pious, even as saith of them the poet Al-Mub\u00edn,\n\n\"O heart! be not thy love confined to one, *\nLest thou by doting or disdain be undone:\nLove all the fair, and thou shalt find with them *\nIf this be lost, to thee that shall be won.\"\n\nAnd quoth another,\n\n\"Mine eyes beheld two lying on the ground; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Both had I loved if on these eyne they lay!\"\n\nSo Dahnash and Maymunah gazed on them awhile, and he said, \"By Allah, O my lady, it is good! My mistress is assuredly the fairer.\" She replied, \"Not so, my beloved is the fairer; woe to thee, O Dahnash! Art blind of eye and heart that lean from fat thou canst not depart? Wilt thou hide the truth? Dost thou not see his beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetry? Out on thee, hear what I purpose to say in praise of my beloved and, if thou be a lover true to her thou dost love, do thou the like for her thou Lovest.\" Then she kissed Kamar al-Zaman again and again between the eyes and improvised this ode,\n\n\"How is this? Why should the blamer abuse thee in his pride?\nWhat shall console my heart for thee, that art but slender bough?\n\nA Nature Kohl'd[FN#252] eye thou hast that witcheth far and wide;\nFrom pure platonic love[FN#253] of it deliverance none I trow!\n\nThose glances, fell as plundering Turk, to heart such havoc deal\nAs never havocked scymitar made keenest at the curve.\n\nOn me thou layest load of love the heaviest while I feel\nSo feeble grown that under weight of chemisette I swerve.\n\nMy love for thee as wottest well is habit, and my lowe\nIs nature; to all others false is all the love I tender:\n\nNow were my heart but like to shine I never would say No;\nOnly my wasted form is like thy waist so gracious slender:\n\nOut on him who in Beauty's robe for moon like charms hath fame,\nAnd who is claimed by mouth of men as marvel of his tribe!\n\n'Of man what manner may he be' (ask they who flyte and blame)\n'For whom thy heart is so distressed?' I only cry 'Describe!'\n\nOh stone-entempered heart of him! learn of his yielding grace\nAnd bending form to show me grace and yielding to consent.\nOh my Prince Beautiful, thou hast an Overseer in place[FN#254]\nWho irketh me, and eke a Groom whose wrong cloth ne'er relent.\n\nIndeed he lieth who hath said that all of loveliness\nWas pent in Joseph: in thy charms there's many and many a Joe!\n\nThe Genii dread me when I stand and face to face address;\nBut meeting thee my fluttering heart its shame and terror show.\n\nI take aversion semblance and I turn from thee in fright,\nBut more aversion I assume, more love from me dost claim;\n\nThat hair of jetty black! That brow e'er raying radiant light! Those eyne wherein white jostles black![FN#255] That dearling dainty frame!\"\n\nWhen Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he joyed with exceeding joy and marvelled with excessive wonderment.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Ifrit Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he shook for exceeding joy and said, \"Thou hast celebrated thy beloved in song and thou hast indeed done well in praise of him whom thou lovest! And there is no help for it but that I also in my turn do my best to enfame my mistress, and recite somewhat in her honour.\" Then the Ifrit went up to the Lady Budur; and' kissing her between the eyes, looked at Maymunah and at his beloved Princess and recited the following verses, albeit he had no skill in poesy,\n\n\"Love for my fair they chide in angry way; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unjust for ignorance, yea unjustest they!\nAh lavish favours on the love mad, whom *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Taste of thy wrath and parting woe shall slay:\nIn sooth for love I'm wet with railing tears, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That rail mine eyelids blood thou mightest say:\nNo marvel what I bear for love, 'tis marvel *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That any know my \"me\" while thou'rt away:\nUnlawful were our union did I doubt *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thy love, or heart incline to other May.\"\n\nAnd eke these words:\u2014\n\n\"I feed eyes on their stead by the valley's side, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And I'm slain and my slaver[FN#256] aside hath tried:\nGrief-wine have I drunken, and down my cheeks *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Dance tears to the song of the camel-guide:\nFor union-blessing I strive though sure, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In Budur and Su'ad all my bliss shall bide:[FN#257]\nWot I not which of three gave me most to 'plain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So hear them numbered ere thou decide:\nThose Sworders her eyne, that Lancer her fig- *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     -ure, or ring-mail'd Locks which her forehead hide.\nQuoth she (and I ask of her what so wights *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Or abide in towns or in desert ride[FN#258] )\nTo me, 'In thy heart I dwell, look there!' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Quoth I, 'Where's my heart ah where? ah where?'\"\n\nWhen Maymunah heard these lines from the Ifrit, she said, \"Thou hast done well, O Dahnash! But say thou which of the two is the handsomer?\" And he answered, \"My mistress Budur is handsomer than thy beloved!\" Cried Maymunah, \"Thou liest, O accursed. Nay, my beloved is more beautiful than shine!\" But Dahnash persisted, \"Mine is the fairer.\" And they ceased not to wrangle and challenge each other's words till Maymunah cried out at Dahnash and would have laid violent hands on him, but he humbled himself to her and, softening his speech, said, \"Let not the truth be a grief to thee, and cease we this talk, for all we say is to testify in favour of our lovers; rather let each of us withdraw the claim and seek we one who shall judge fairly between us which of the two be fairer; and by his sentence we will abide.\" \"I agree to this,\" answered she and smote the earth with her foot, whereupon there came out of it an Ifrit blind of an eye, humpbacked and scurvy-skinned, with eye-orbits slit up and down his face.[FN#259] On his head were seven horns and four locks of hair fell to his heels; his hands were pitchfork-like and his legs mast-like and he had nails as the claws of a lion, and feet as the hoofs of the wild ass.[FN#260] When that If rit rose out of the earth and sighted Maymunah, he kissed the ground before her and, standing with his hands clasped behind him, said, \"What is thy will, O my mistress, O daughter of my King?\"[FN#261] She replied, \"O Kashkash, I would have thee judge between me and this accursed Dahnash.\" And she made known to him the matter, from first to last, whereupon the Ifrit Kashkash looked at the face of the youth and then at the face of the girl; and saw them lying asleep, embraced, each with an arm under the other's neck, alike in beauty and loveliness and equal in grace and goodliness. The Marid gazed long upon them, marvelling at their seemlihead; and, after carefully observing the twain, he turned to Maymunah and Dahnash, and reseated these couplets.\n\n\"Go, visit her thou lovest, and regard not\nThe words detractors utter, envious churls\nCan never favour love. Oh! sure the Merciful\nNe'er made a thing more fair to look upon,\nThan two fond lovers in each others' arms,\nSpeaking their passion in a mute embrace.\nWhen heart has turned to heart, the fools would part them\nStrike idly on cold steel. So when thou'st found\nOne purely, wholly shine, accept her true heart,\nAnd live for her alone. Oh! thou that blamest\nThe love-struck for their love, give o'er thy talk,\nHow canst thou minister to a mind diseased?\"[FN#262]\n\nThen he turned again to Maymunah and Dahnash and said to them, \"By Allah, if you will have the truth, I tell you fairly the twain be equal in beauty, and loveliness and perfect grace and goodliness, nor can I make any difference between them on account of their being man and woman. But I have another thought which is that we wake each of them in turn, without the knowledge of the other, and whichever is the more enamoured shall be held inferior in seemlihead and comeliness.\" Quoth Maymunah, \"Right is this recking,\" and quoth Dahnash, \"I consent to this.\" Then Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman, whereupon he started from sleep in a fright.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-third Night,\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman who started from sleep in a fright and rubbed the bitten part, his neck, and scratched it hard because of the smart. Then turning sideways, he found lying by him something whose breath was sweeter than musk and whose skin was softer than cream. Hereat marvelled he with great marvel and he sat up and looked at what lay beside him; when he saw it to be a young lady like an union pearl, or a shining sun, or a dome seen from afar on a well built wall; for she was five feet tall, with a shape like the letter Alif[FN#263], bosomed high and rosy checked; even as saith of her the poet,\n\n\"Four things which ne'er conjoin, unless it be *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To storm my vitals and to shed my blood:\nBrow white as day and tresses black as night *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cheeks rosy red and lips which smiles o'erflood.\"\n\nAnd also quoth another,\n\n\"A Moon she rises, Willow wand she waves, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Breathes Ambergris, and gazes, a Gazelle:\nMeseems that sorrow woes my heart and wins *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And, when she wendeth hastes therein to dwell!\"\n\nAnd when Kamar al-Zaman saw the Lady Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, and her beauty and comeliness, she was sleeping clad in a shift of Venetian silk, without her petticoat-trousers, and wore on her head a kerchief embroidered with gold and set with stones of price: her ears were hung with twin earrings which shone like constellations and round her neck was a collar of union pearls, of size unique, past the competence of any King. When he saw this, his reason was confounded and natural heat began to stir in him; Allah awoke in him the desire of coition and he said to himself, \"Whatso Allah willeth, that shall be, and what He willeth not shall never be!\" So saying, he put out his hand and, turning her over, loosed the collar of her chemise; then arose before his sight her bosom, with its breasts like double globes of ivory; whereat his inclination for her redoubled and he desired her with exceeding hot desire, He would have awakened her but she would not awake, for Dahnash had made her sleep heavy; so he shook her and moved her, saying, \"O my beloved, awake and look on me; I am Kamar al-Zaman.\" But she awoke not, neither moved her head; where-upon he considered her case for a long hour and said to himself, \"If I guess aright, this is the damsel to whom my father would have married me and these three years past I have refused her; but Inshallah!\u2014God willing\u2014as soon as it is dawn, I will say to him, 'Marry me to her, that I may enjoy her.'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to himself, \"By Allah, when I see dawn I will say to my sire, 'Marry me to her that I may enjoy her'; nor will I let half the day pass ere I possess her and take my fill of her beauty and loveliness.\" Then he bent over Budur to buss her, whereat the Jinniyah Maymunah trembled and was abashed and Dahnash, the Ifrit, was like to fly for joy. But, as Kamar al- Zaman was about to kiss her upon the mouth, he was ashamed before Allah and turned away his head and averted his face, saying to his heart, \"Have patience.\" Then he took thought awhile and said, \"I will be patient; haply my father when he was wroth with me and sent me to this jail, may have brought my young lady and made her lie by my side to try me with her, and may have charged her not to be readily awakened when I would arouse her, and may have said to her, 'Whatever thing Kamar al-Zaman do to thee, make me ware thereof'; or belike my sire standeth hidden in some stead whence (being himself unseen) he can see all I do with this young lady; and to morrow he will scold me and cry, 'How cometh it that thou sayest, I have no mind to marry; and yet thou didst kiss and embrace yonder damsel?' So I will withhold myself lest I be ashamed before my sire; and the right and proper thing to do is not to touch her at this present, nor even to look upon her, except to take from her somewhat which shall serve as a token to me and a memorial of her; that some sign endure between me and her.\" Then Kamar al-Zaman raised the young lady's hand and took from her little finger a seal-ring worth an immense amount of money, for that its bezel was a precious jewel and around it were graven these couplets,\n\n\"Count not that I your promises forgot, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Despite the length of your delinquencies\nBe generous, O my lord, to me inclining; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply your mouth and cheeks these lips may kiss:\nBy Allah, ne'er will I relinquish you *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Albe you will transgress love's boundaries.\"\n\nThen Kamar al-Zaman took the seal-ring from the little finger of Queen Budur and set it on his own; then, turning his back to her, went to sleep.[FN#264] When Maymunah the Jinniyah saw this, she was glad and said to Dahnash and Kashkash, \"Saw ye how my beloved Kamar al-Zaman bore himself chastely towards this young lady? Verily, this was of the perfection of his good gifts; for observe you twain how he looked on her and noted her beauty and loveliness, and yet embraced her not neither kissed her nor put his hand to her, but turned his back and slept.\" Answered they, \"Even so!\" Thereupon Maymunah changed herself into a flea and entering into the raiment of Budur, the loved of Dahnash, crept up her calf and came upon her thigh and, reaching a place some four carats[FN#265] below her navel, there bit her. Thereupon she opened her eyes and sitting up in bed, saw a youth lying beside her and breathing heavily in his sleep, the loveliest of Almighty Allah's creatures, with eyes that put to shame the fairest Houris of Heaven; and a mouth like Solomon's seal, whose water was sweeter to the taste and more efficacious than a theriack, and lips the colour of coral-stone, and cheeks like the blood red anemone, even as saith one, describing him in these couplets,\n\n\"My mind's withdrawn from Zaynab and Naw\u00e1r[FN#266] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     By rosy cheeks that growth of myrtle bear;\nI love a fawn, a tunic-vested boy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And leave the love of bracelet-wearing Fair:\nMy mate in hall and closet is unlike *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Her that I play with, as at home we pair.\nOh thou, who blam'st my flight from Hind and Zaynab, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The cause is clear as dawn uplighting air!\nWould'st have me fare[FN#267] a slave, the thrall of thrall, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cribbed, pent, confined behind the bar and wall?\"\n\nNow when Princess Budur saw him, she was seized by a transport of passion and yearning and love-longing,\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur saw Kamar al-Zaman she was forthwith seized with a transport of passion and yearning and love longing, and she said to herself, \"Alas, my shame! This is a strange youth and I know him not. How cometh he to be lying by my side on one bed?\" Then she looked at him a second time and, noting his beauty and loveliness, said, \"By Allah, he is indeed a comely youth and my heart[FN#268] is well-nigh torn in sunder with longing for him! But alas, how am I shamed by him! By the Almighty, had I known it was this youth who sought me in marriage of my father, I had not rejected him, but had wived with him and enjoyed his loveliness!\" Then she gazed in his face and said, \"O my lord and light of mine eyes, awake from sleep and take thy pleasure in my beauty and grace.\" And she moved him with her hand; but Maymunah the Jinniyah let down sleep upon him as it were a curtain, and pressed heavily on his head with her wings so that Kamar al-Zaman awoke not. Then Princess Budur shook him with her hands and said, \"My life on thee, hearken to me; awake and up from thy sleep and look on the narcissus and the tender down thereon, and enjoy the sight of naked waist and navel; and touzle me and tumble me from this moment till break of day! Allah upon thee, O my lord, sit up and prop thee against the pillow and slumber not!\" Still Kamar al-Zaman made her no reply but breathed hard in his sleep. Continued she, \"Alas! Alas! thou art insolent in thy beauty and comeliness and grace and loving looks! But if thou art handsome, so am I handsome; what then is this thou dost? Have they taught thee to flout me or hath my father, the wretched old fellow,[FN#269] made thee swear not to speak to me to-night?\" But Kamar al-Zaman opened not his mouth neither awoke, whereat her passion for him redoubled and Allah inflamed her heart with love of him. She stole one glance of eyes that cost her a thousand sighs: her heart fluttered, and her vitals throbbed and her hands and feet quivered; and she said to Kamar al-Zaman \"Talk to me, O my lord! Speak to me, O my friend! Answer me, O my beloved, and tell me thy name, for indeed thou hast ravished my wit!\" And during all this time he abode drowned in sleep and answered her not a word, and Princess Budur sighed and said, \"Alas! Alas! why art thou so proud and self satisfied?\" Then she shook him and turning his hand over, saw her seal-ring on his little finger, whereat she cried a loud cry, and followed it with a sigh of passion and said, \"Alack! Alack! By Allah, thou art my beloved and thou lovest me! Yet thou seemest to turn thee away from me out of coquetry, for all, O my darling, thou camest to me, whilst I was asleep and knew not what thou didst with me, and tookest my seal-ring; and yet I will not pull it off thy finger.\" So saying, she opened the bosom of his shirt and bent over him and kissed him and put forth her hand to him, seeking somewhat that she might take as a token, but found nothing. Then she thrust her hand into his breast and, because of the smoothness of his body, it slipped down to his waist and thence to his navel and thence to his yard, whereupon her heart ached and her vitals quivered and lust was sore upon her, for that the desire of women is fiercer than the desire of men,[FN#270] and she was ashamed of her own shamelessness. Then she plucked his seal-ring from his finger, and put it on her own instead of the ring he had taken, and bussed his inner lips and hands, nor did she leave any part of him unkissed; after which she took him to her breast and embraced him and, laying one of her hands under his neck and the other under his arm-pit, nestled close to him and fell asleep by his side.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur fell asleep by the side of Kamar al-Zaman, after doing that which she did, quoth Maymunah to Dahnash, Night thou, O accursed, how proudly and coquettishly my beloved bore himself, and how hotly and passionately thy mistress showed herself to my dearling? There can be no doubt that my beloved is handsomer than shine; nevertheless I pardon thee.\" Then she wrote him a document of manumission and turned to Kashkash and said, \"Go, help Dahnash to take up his mistress and aid him to carry her back to her own place, for the night waneth apace and there is but little left of it.\" \"I hear and I obey;\" answered Kashkash. So the two Ifrits went forward to Princess Budur and upraising her flew away with her; then, bearing her back to her own place, they laid her on her bed, whilst Maymunah abode alone with Kamar al-Zaman, gazing upon him as he slept, till the night was all but spent, when she went her way. As soon as morning morrowed, the Prince awoke from sleep and turned right and left, but found not the maiden by him and said in his mind, \"What is this business? It is as if my father would incline me to marriage with the damsel who was with me and have now taken her away by stealth, to the intent that my desire for wedlock may redouble.\" Then he called out to the eunuch who slept at the door, saying, \"Woe to thee, O damned one, arise at once!\" So the eunuch rose, bemused with sleep, and brought him basin and ewer, whereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered the water closet and did his need;[FN#271] then, coming out made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the dawn-prayer, after which he sat telling on his beads the ninety-and-nine names of Almighty Allah. Then he looked up and, seeing the eunuch standing in service upon him, said, \"Out on thee, O Saw\u00e1b! Who was it came hither and took away the young lady from my side and I still sleeping?\" Asked the eunuch, 'O my lord, what manner of young lady?\" \"The young lady who lay with me last night,\" replied Kamar al-Zaman. The eunuch was startled at his words and said to him, \"By Allah, there hath been with thee neither young lady nor other! How should young lady have come in to thee, when I was sleeping in the doorway and the door was locked? By Allah, O my lord, neither male nor female hath come in to thee!\" Exclaimed the Prince, \"Thou liest, O pestilent slave!: is it of thy competence also to hoodwink me and refuse to tell me what is become of the young lady who lay with me last night and decline to inform me who took her away?\" Replied the eunuch (and he was affrighted at him), \"By Allah, O my lord, I have seen neither young lady nor young lord!\" His words only angered Kamar al-Zaman the more and he said to him, \"O accursed one, my father hath indeed taught thee deceit! Come hither.\" So the eunuch came up to him, and the Prince took him by the collar and dashed him to the ground; whereupon he let fly a loud fart[FN#272] and Kamar al-Zaman, kneeling upon him, kicked him and throttled him till he fainted away. Then he dragged him forth and tied him to the well-rope, and let him down like a bucket into the well and plunged him into the water, then drew him up and lowered him down again. Now it was hard winter weather, and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not to plunge the eunuch into the water and pull him up again and douse him and haul him whilst he screamed and called for help; and the Prince kept on saying \"By Allah, O damned one, I will not draw thee up out of this well till thou tell me and fully acquaint me with the story of the young lady and who it was took her away, whilst I slept.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One and Eighty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to the eunuch, \"By Allah! I will not draw thee up out of this well until thou tell me the story of the young lady and who it was took her away whilst I slept.\" Answered the eunuch, after he had seen death staring him in the face; \"O my lord, let me go and I will relate to thee the truth and the whole tale.\" So Kamar al-Zaman pulled him up out of the well, all but dead for suffering, what with cold and the pain of dipping and dousing, drubbing and dread of drowning. He shook like cane in hurricane, his teeth were clenched as by cramp and his clothes were drenched and his body befouled and torn by the rough sides of the well: briefly he was in a sad pickle. Now when Kamar al-Zaman saw him in this sorry plight, he was concerned for him; but, as soon as the eunuch found himself on the floor, he said to him, \"O my lord, let me go and doff my clothes and wring them out and spread them in the sun to dry, and don others; after which I will return to thee forthwith and tell thee the truth of the matter.\" Answered the Prince, \"O rascal slave! hadst thou not seen death face to face, never hadst thou confessed to fact nor told me a word; but go now and do thy will, and then come back to me at once and tell me the truth.\" Thereupon the eunuch went out, hardly crediting his escape, and ceased not running, stumbling and rising in his haste, till he came in to King Shahriman, whom he found sitting at talk with his Wazir of Kamar al-Zaman's case. The King was saying to the Minister, \"I slept not last night, for anxiety concerning my son, Kamar al-Zaman and indeed I fear lest some harm befal him in that old tower. What good was there in imprisoning him?\" Answered the Wazir, \"Have no care for him. By Allah, no harm will befal him! None at all! Leave him in prison for a month till his temper yield and his spirit be broken and he return to his senses.\" As the two spoke behold, up rushed the eunuch, in the aforesaid plight, making to the King who was troubled at sight of him; and he cried \"O our lord the Sultan! Verily, thy son's wits are fled and he hath gone mad, he hath dealt with me thus and thus, so that I am become as thou seest me, and he kept saying, 'A young lady lay with me this night and stole away secretly whilst I slept. Where is she?' And he insisteth on my letting him know where she is and on my telling him who took her away. But I have seen neither girl nor boy: the door was locked all through the night, for I slept before it with the key under my head, and I opened to him in the morning with my own hand. When King Shahriman heard this, he cried out, saying, \"Alas, my son!;\" and he was enraged with sore rage against the Wazir, who had been the cause of all this case and said to him, \"Go up, bring me news of my son and see what hath befallen his mind.\" So the Wazir rose and, stumbling over his long skirts, in his fear of the King's wrath, hastened with the slave to the tower. Now the sun had risen and when the Minister came in to Kamar al-Zaman, he found him sitting on the couch reciting the Koran; so he saluted him and seated himself by his side, and said to him, \"O my lord, this wretched eunuch brought us tidings which troubled and alarmed us and which incensed the King.\" Asked Kamar al-Zaman, \"And what hath he told you of me to trouble my father? In good sooth he hath troubled none but me.\" Answered the Wazir, \"He came to us in fulsome state and told us of thee a thing which Heaven forfend; and the slave added a lie which it befitteth not to repeat, Allah preserve thy youth and sound sense and tongue of eloquence, and forbid to come from thee aught of offense!\" Quoth the Prince, \"O Wazir, and what thing did this pestilent slave say of me?\" The Minister replied, \"He told us that thy wits had taken leave of thee and thou wouldst have it that a young lady lay with thee last night, and thou west instant with him to tell thee whither she went and thou diddest torture him to that end.\" But when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was enraged with sore rage and he said to the Wazir, \"'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her per misted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman heard the words of the Wazir he was enraged with sore rage and said to him, \"'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did and forbade him to tell me what became of the young lady who lay with me last night. But thou, O Wazir, art cleverer than the eunuch, so do thou tell me without stay or delay, whither went the young lady who slept on my bosom last night; for it was you who sent her and bade her steep in my embrace and we lay together till dawn; but, when I awoke, I found her not. So where is she now?\" Said the Wazir, \"O my lord Kamar al-Zaman, Allah's name encompass thee about! By the Almighty, we sent none to thee last night, but thou layest alone, with the door locked on thee and the eunuch sleeping behind it, nor did there come to thee young lady or any other. Regain thy reason, O my lord, and stablish thy senses and occupy not thy mind with vanities.\" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman who was incensed at his words, \"O Wazir, the young lady in question is my beloved, the fair one with the black eyes and rosy cheeks, whom I held in my arms all last night.\" So the Minister wondered at his words and asked him, \"Didst thou see this damsel last night with shine own eyes on wake or in sleep?\" Answered Kamar al-Zaman, \"O ill- omened old man, dost thou fancy I saw her with my ears? Indeed, I saw her with my very eyes and awake, and I touched her with my hand, and I watched by her full half the night, feeding my vision on her beauty and loveliness and grace and tempting looks. But you had schooled her and charged her to speak no word to me; so she feigned sleep and I lay by her side till dawn, when I awoke and found her gone.\" Rejoined the Wazir, \"O my lord Kamar al- Zaman, haply thou sawest this in thy sleep; it must have been a delusion of dreams or a deception caused by eating various kinds of food, or a suggestion of the accursed devils.\" Cried the Prince, \"O pestilent old man! wilt thou too make a mock of me and tell me this was haply a delusion of dreams, when that eunuch confessed to the young lady, saying, 'At once I will return to thee and tell thee all about her?'\" With these words, he sprang up and rushed at the Wazir and gripped hold of his beard (which was long[FN#273]) and, after gripping it, he twisted his hand in it and haling him off the couch, threw him on the floor. It seemed to the Minister as though his soul departed his body for the violent plucking at his beard; and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not kicking the Wazir and basting his breast and ribs and cuffing him with open hand on the nape of his neck till he had well-nigh beaten him to death. Then said the old man in his mind, \"Just as the eunuch-slave saved his life from this lunatic youth by telling him a lie, thus it is even fitter that I do likewise; else he will destroy me. So now for my lie to save myself, he being mad beyond a doubt.\" Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, \"O my lord, pardon me; for indeed thy father charged me to conceal from thee this affair of the young lady; but now I am weak and weary and wounded with funding; for I am an old man and lack strength and bottom to endure blows. Have, therefore, a little patience with me and I will tell thee all and acquaint thee with the story of the young woman.\" When the Prince heard this, he left off drubbing him and said, \"Wherefore couldst thou not tell me the tale until after shame and blows? Rise now, unlucky old man that thou art, and tell me her story.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"Say, dost thou ask of the young lady with the fair face and perfect form?\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"Even so! Tell me, O Wazir, who it was that led her to me and laid her by my side, and who was it that took her away from me by night; and let me know forthright whither she is gone, that I myself may go to her at once. If my father did this deed to me that he might try me by means of that beautiful girl, with a view to our marriage, I consent to wed her and free myself of this trouble; for he did all these dealings with me only because I refused wedlock. But now I consent and I say again, I consent to matrimony: so tell this to my father, O Wazir, and advise him to marry me to that young lady; for I will have none other and my heart loveth none save her alone. Now rise up at once and haste thee to my father and counsel him to hurry on our wedding and bring me his answer within this very hour.\" Rejoined the Wazir, \"'Tis well!\" and went forth from him, hardly believing himself out of his hands. Then he set off from the tower, walking and tripping up as he went, for excess of fright and agitation, and he ceased not hurrying till he came in to King Shahriman.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-nineth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, fared forth from the tower, and ceased not running till he came in to King Shahriman, who said to him as he sighted him, \"O thou Wazir, what man hath brought thee to grief and whose mischief hath treated thee in way unlief; how happeneth it that I see thee dumb foundered and coming to me thus astounded?\" Replied the Wazir, \"O King! I bring thee good news.\" \"And what is it?\" quoth Shahriman, and quoth the Wazir, \"Know that thy son Kamar al- Zaman's wits are clean gone and that he hath become stark mad.\" Now when the King heard these words of the Minister, light became darkness in his sight and he said, \"O Wazir, make clear to me the nature of his madness.\" Answered the Wazir, \"O my lord, I hear and I obey.\" Then he told him that such and such had passed and acquainted him with all that his son had done; whereupon the King said to him, \"Hear, O Wazir, the good tidings which I give thee in return for this thy fair news of my son's insanity; and it shall be the cutting off of thy head and the forfeiture of my favour, O most ill-omened of Wazirs and foulest of Emirs! for I feel that thou hast caused my son's disorder by the wicked advice and the sinister counsel thou hast given me first and last. By Allah, if aught of mischief or madness have befallen my son I will most assuredly nail thee upon the palace dome and make thee drain the bitterest draught of death!'' Then he sprang up and, taking the Wazir, with him, fared straight for the tower and entered it. And when Kamar al-Zaman saw the two, he rose to his father in haste from the couch whereon he sat and kissing his hands drew back and hung down his head and stood before him with his arms behind him, and thus remained for a full hour. Then he raised his head towards his sire; the tears gushed from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks and he began repeating,\n\n\"Forgive the sin 'neath which my limbs are trembling,\nFor the slave seeks for mercy from his master;\nI've done a fault, which calls for free confession,\nWhere shall it call for mercy, and forgiveness?''[FN#274]\n\nWhen the King heard this, he arose and embraced his son, and kissing him between the eyes, made him sit by his side on the couch; then he turned to the Wazir, and, looking on him with eyes of wrath, said, \"O dog of Wazirs, how didst thou say of my son such and such things and make my heart quake for him?\" Then he turned to the Prince and said, \"O my son, what is to-day called?\" He answered, \"O my father, this day is the Sabbath, and to morrow is First day: then come Second day, Third, Fourth, Fifth day and lastly Friday.\"[FN#275] Exclaimed the King, \"O my son, O Kamar al-Zaman, praised be Allah for the preservation of thy reason! What is the present month called in our Arabic?\" \"Z\u00fa'l Ka'adah,\" answered Kamar al-Zaman, \"and it is followed by Z\u00fa'l hijjah; then cometh Muharram, then Safar, then Rab\u00ed'a the First and Rab\u00ed'a the Second, the two Jam\u00e1d\u00e1s, Rajab, Sha'aban, Ramaz\u00e1n and Shaww\u00e1l.\" At this the King rejoiced exceedingly and spat in the Wazir's face, saying, \"O wicked old man, how canst thou say that my son is mad? And now none is mad but thou.\" Hereupon the Minister shook his head and would have spoken, but bethought himself to wait awhile and see what might next befal. Then the King said to his child, \"O my son, what words be these thou saddest to the eunuch and the Wazir, declaring, 'I was sleeping with a fair damsel this night?'[FN#276] What damsel is this of whom thou speakest?\" Then Kamar al-Zaman laughed at his father's words and replied, \"O my father, know that I can bear no more jesting; so add me not another mock or even a single word on the matter, for my temper hath waxed short by that you have done with me. And know, O my father, with assured knowledge, that I consent to marry, but on condition that thou give me to wife her who lay by my side this night; for I am certain it was thou sentest her to me and madest me in love with her and then despatchedst a message to her before the dawn and tookest her away from beside me.\" Rejoined the King, \"The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninetieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth King Shahriman to his son Kamar al-Zaman, \"The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness! What thing be this young lady whom thou fanciest I sent to thee last night and then again that I sent to withdraw her from thee before dawn? By the Lord, O my son, I know nothing of this affair, and Allah upon thee, tell me if it be a delusion of dreaming or a deception caused by indisposition. For verily thou layest down to sleep last night with thy mind occupied anent marriage and troubled with the talk of it (Allah damn marriage and the hour when I spake of it and curse him who counselled it!); and without doubt or diffidence I can say that being moved in mind by the mention of wedlock thou dreamedst that a handsome young lady embraced thee and didst fancy thou sawest her when awake. But all this, O my son, is but an imbroglio of dreams.\" Replied Kamar al-Zaman, \"Leave this talk and swear to me by Allah, the All creator, the Omniscient; the Humbler of the tyrant Caesars and the Destroyer of the Chosroes, that thou knowest naught of the young lady nor of her woning-place.\" Quoth the King, \"By the Might of Allah Almighty, the God of Moses and Abraham, I know naught of all this and never even heard of it; it is assuredly a delusion of dreams thou hast seen in sleep.' Then the Prince replied to his sire, \"I will give thee a self evident proof that it happened to me when on wake.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al Zamar said to his sire, \"I will give thee a self-evident proof that this happened to me when on wake. Now let me ask thee, did it ever befal any man to dream that he was battling a sore battle and after to awake from sleep and find in his hand a sword-blade besmeared with blood? Answered the King, \"No, by Allah, O my son, this hath never been.\" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman, \"I will tell thee what happened to me and it was this. Meseemed I awoke from sleep in the middle of the past night and found a girl lying by my side, whose form was like mine and whose favour was as mine. I embraced her and turned her about with my hand and took her seal- ring, which I put on my finger, and she pulled off my ring and put it on hers. Then I went to sleep by her side, but refrained from her for shame of thee, deeming that thou hadst sent her to me, intending to tempt me with her and incline me to marriage, and suspecting thee to be hidden somewhere whence thou couldst see what I did with her. And I was ashamed even to kiss her on the mouth for thy account, thinking over this temptation to wedlock; and, when I awoke at point of day, I found no trace of her, nor could I come at any news of her, and there befel me what thou knowest of with the eunuch and with the Wazir. How then can this case have been a dream and a delusion, when the ring is a reality? Save for her ring on my finger I should indeed have deemed it a dream; but here is the ring on my little finger: look at it, O King, and see what is its worth.\" So saying he handed the ring to his father, who examined it and turned it over, then looked to his son and said, \"Verily, there is in this ring some mighty mystery and some strange secret. What befel thee last night with the girl is indeed a hard nut to crack, and I know not how intruded upon us this intruder. None is the cause of all this posher save the Wazir; but, Allah upon thee, O my son, take patience, so haply the Lord may turn to gladness this thy grief and to thy sadness bring complete relief: as quoth one of the poets,\n\n'Haply shall Fortune draw her rein, and bring *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Fair chance, for she is changeful, jealous, vain:\nStill I may woo my want and wishes win, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And see on heels of care unfair, the fain.'\n\nAnd now, O my son, I am certified at this hour that thou art not mad; but thy case is a strange one which none can clear up for thee save the Almighty.\" Cried the Prince, \"By Allah, O my father, deal kindly with me and seek out this young lady and hasten her coming to me; else I shall die of woe and of my death shall no one know.\" Then he betrayed the ardour of his passion; and turned towards his father and repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"If your promise of personal call prove untrue, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Deign in vision to grant me an interview:\nQuoth they, 'How can phantom[FN#277] appear to the sight *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of a youth, whose sight is fordone, perdue?'\"\n\nThen, after ending his poetry, Kamar al-Zaman again turned to his father, with submission and despondency, and shedding tears in flood, began repeating these lines.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman had repeated to his father these verses, he wept and complained and groaned from a wounded heart; and added these lines,\n\n\"Beware that eye glance which hath magic might; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Wherever turn those orbs it bars our flight:\nNor be deceived by low sweet voice, that breeds *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    A fever festering in the heart and sprite:\nSo soft that silky skin, were rose to touch it *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     She'd cry and tear-drops rain for pain and fright:\nDid Zephyr e'en in sleep pass o'er her land, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Scented he'd choose to dwell in scented site:\nHer necklets vie with tinkling of her belt; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Her wrists strike either wristlet dumb with spite:\nWhen would her bangles buss those rings in ear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Upon the lover's eyne high mysteries 'light:\nI'm blamed for love of her, nor pardon claim; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Eyes are not profiting which lack foresight:\nHeaven strip thee, blamer mine! unjust art thou; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Before this fawn must every eye low bow.\"[FN#278]\n\nAfter which he said, \"By Allah, O my father, I cannot endure to be parted from her even for an hour.\" The King smote hand upon hand and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! No cunning contrivance can profit us in this affair.\" Then he took his son by the hand and carried him to the palace, where Kamar al-Zaman lay down on the bed of languor and the King sat at his head, weeping and mourning over him and leaving him not, night or day, till at last the Wazir came in to him and said, \"O King of the age and the time, how long wilt thou remain shut up with thy son and hide thyself from thy troops. Haply, the order of thy realm may be deranged, by reason of shine absence from thy Grandees and Officers of State. It behoveth the man of understanding, if he have various wounds in his body, to apply him first to medicine the most dangerous; so it is my counsel to thee that thou remove thy son from this place to the pavilion which is in the palace overlooking the sea; and shut thyself up with him there, setting apart in every week two days, Thursday and Monday, for state receptions and progresses and reviews. On these days let shine Emirs and Wazirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and high Officials and Grandees of the realm and the rest of the levies and the lieges have access to thee and submit their affairs to thee; and do thou their needs and judge among them and give and take with them and bid and forbid. And the rest of the week thou shalt pass with thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and cease not thus doing till Allah shall vouchsafe relief to you twain. Think not, O King, that thou art safe from the shifts of Time and the strokes of Change which come like a traveller in the night; for the wise man is ever on his guard and how well saith the poet,\n\n'Thou deemedst well of Time when days went well, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And fearedst not what ills might bring thee Fate:\nThe Nights so fair and restful cozened thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For peaceful Nights bring woes of heavy weight.\nOh children of mankind whom Time befriends, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Beware of Time's deceits or soon or late!'''[FN#279]\n\nWhen the Sultan heard his Wazir's words he saw that they were right and deemed his counsel wise, and it had effect upon him for he feared lest the order of the state be deranged; so he rose at once and bade transport his son from his sick room to the pavilion in the palace overlooking the sea. Now this palace was girt round by the waters and was approached by a causeway twenty cubits wide. It had windows on all sides commanding an ocean- view; its floor was paved with parti-coloured marbles and its ceiling was painted in the richest pigments and figured with gold and lapis-lazuli. They furnished it for Kamar al-Zaman with splendid upholstery, embroidered rugs and carpets of the richest silk; and they clothed the walls with choice brocades and hung curtains bespangled with gems of price. In the midst they set him a couch of juniper[FN#280]-wood inlaid with pearls and jewels, and Kamar al-Zaman sat down thereon, but the excess of his concern and passion for the young lady had wasted his charms and emaciated his body; he could neither eat nor drink nor sleep; and he was like a man who had been sick twenty years of sore sickness. His father seated himself at his head, grieving for him with the deepest grief, and every Monday and Thursday he gave his Wazirs and Emirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and Lords of the realm and levies and the rest of his lieges leave to come up to him in that pavilion. So they entered and did their several service and duties and abode with him till the end of the day, when they went their ways and the King returned to his son in the pavilion whom he left not night nor day; and he ceased not doing on this wise for many days and nights. Such was the case with Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman; but as regards Princess Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seven Palaces, when the two Jinns bore her up and laid her on her bed, she slept till daybreak, when she awoke and sitting upright looked right and left, but saw not the youth who had lain in her bosom. At this her vitals fluttered, her reason fled and she shrieked a loud shriek which awoke all her slave girls and nurses and duennas. They flocked in to her; and the chief of them came forward and asked, \"What aileth thee, O my lady?\" Answered the Princess, \"O wretched old woman, where is my beloved, the handsome youth who lay last night in my bosom? Tell me whither he is gone.\" Now when the duenna heard this, the light starkened in her sight and she feared from her mischief with sore affright, and said to her, \"O my Lady Budur, what unseemly words are these?\" Cried the Princess, \"Woe to thee pestilent crone that thou art! I ask thee again where is my beloved, the goodly youth with the shining face and the slender form, the jetty eyes and the joined eyebrows, who lay with me last night from supper-tide until near daybreak?\" She rejoined \"By Allah, O my lady, I have seen no young man nor any other. I conjure thee, carry not this unseemly jest too far lest we all lose our lives; for perhaps the joke may come to thy father's ears and who shall then deliver us from his hand?\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the duenna bespake the Lady Budur in these words, \"Allah upon thee, O my lady! carry not this unseemly jest too far; for perhaps it may come to thy father's ears, and who shall then deliver us from his hand?\" The Princess rejoined, \"In very sooth a youth lay with me last night, one of the fairest-faced of men.\" Exclaimed the duenna, \"Heaven preserve thy reason! indeed no one lay with thee last night.\" Thereupon the Princess looked at her hand and, finding Kamar al-Zaman's seal-ring on her finger in stead of her own, said to her, \"Woe to thee, thou accursed! thou traitress! wilt thou lie to me and tell me that none lay with me last night and swear to me a falsehood in the name of the Lord?\" Replied the duenna, \"By Allah, I do not lie to thee nor have I sworn falsely.\" Then the Princess was incensed by her words and, drawing a sword she had by her, she smote the old woman with it and slew her;[FN#281] whereupon the eunuch and the waiting-women and the concubines cried out at her, and ran to her father and, without stay or delay, acquainted him with her case. So the King went to her, and asked her, \"O my daughter, what aileth thee?\"; and she answered, \"O my father, where is the youth who lay with me last night?\" Then her reason fled from her head and she cast her eyes right and left and rent her raiment even to the skirt. When her sire saw this, he bade the women lay hands on her; so they seized her and manacled her, then putting a chain of iron about her neck, made her fast to one of the palace-windows and there left her.[FN#282] Thus far concerning Princess Budur; but as regards her father, King Ghayur, the world was straitened upon him when he saw what had befallen his daughter, for that he loved her and her case was not a little grievous to him. So he summoned on it the doctors and astrologers and men skilled in talisman- writing and said to them, \"Whoso healeth my daughter of what ill she hath, I will marry him to her and give him half of my kingdom; but whoso cometh to her and cureth her not, I will strike off his head and hang it over her palace-gate.\" Accordingly, all who went in to her, but failed to heal her, he beheaded and hung their heads over the palace-gates, till he had beheaded on her account forty doctors and crucified forty astrologers; wherefor the general held aloof from her, all the physicians having failed to medicine her malady; and her case was a puzzle to the men of science and the adepts in cabalistic characters. And as her longing and passion redoubled and love and distraction were sore upon her, she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"My fondness, O my moon, for thee my foeman is, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to thy comradeship the nights my thought compel:\nIn gloom I bide with fire that flames below my ribs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose lowe I make comparison with heat of Hell:\nI'm plagued with sorest stress of pine and ecstasy; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor clearest noon tide can that horrid pain dispel.\"\n\nThen she sighed and repeated these also,\n\n\"Salams fro' me to friends in every stead; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Indeed to all dear friends do I incline:\nSalams, but not salams that bid adieu; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Salams that growth of good for you design:\nI love you dear, indeed, nor less your land, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But bide I far from every need of mine!\"\n\nAnd when the Lady Budur ceased repeating her poetry, she wept till her eyes waxed sore and her cheeks changed form and hue, and in this condition she continued three years. Now she had a foster-brother, by name Marzaw\u00e1n,[FN#283] who was travelling in far lands and absent from her the whole of this time. He loved her with an exceeding love, passing the love of brothers; so when he came back he went in to his mother and asked for his sister, the Princess Budur. She answered him, \"O my son, thy sister hath been smitten with madness and hath passed these three years with a chain of iron about her neck; and all the physicians and men of science have failed of healing her.\" When Marzawan heard these words he said, \"I must needs go in to her; peradventure I may discover what she hath, and be able to medicine her;\" and his mother replied, \"Needs must thou visit her, but wait till to morrow, that I may contrive some thing to suit thy case.\" Then she went a-foot to the palace of the Lady Budur and, accosting the eunuch in charge of the gates, made him a present and said to him, \"I have a daughter, who was brought up with thy mistress and since then I married her; and, when that befel the Princess which befel her, she became troubled and sore concerned, and I desire of thy favour that my daughter may go in to her for an hour and look on her; and then return whence she came, so shall none know of it.\" Quoth the eunuch, \"This may not be except by night, after the King hath visited his child and gone away; then come thou and thy daughter.\" So she kissed the eunuch's hand and, returning home, waited till the morrow at nightfall; and when it was time she arose and sought her son Marzawan and attired him in woman's apparel; then, taking his hand in hers, led him towards the palace, and ceased not walking with him till she came upon the eunuch after the Sultan had ended his visit to the Princess. Now when the eunuch saw her, he rose to her, and said, \"Enter, but do not prolong thy stay!\" So they went in and when Marzawan beheld the Lady Budur in the aforesaid plight, he saluted her, after his mother had doffed his woman's garb: then he took out of their satchel books he had brought with him; and, lighting a wax- candle, he began to recite certain conjurations Thereupon the Princess looked at him and recognising him, said, \"O my brother, thou hast been absent on thy travels' and thy news have been cut off from us.\" He replied, \"True! but Allah hath brought me back safe and sound, I am now minded to set out again nor hath aught delayed me but the news I hear of thee; wherefore my heart burned for thee and I came to thee, so haply I may free thee of thy malady.\" She rejoined, O my brother, thinkest thou it is madness aileth me?\" \"Yes.\" answered he, and she said, \"Not so, by Allah! 'tis even as saith the poet,\n\n'Quoth they 'Thou rav'st on him thou lov'st': quoth I, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'The sweets of love are only for th' insane!'\nLove never maketh Time his friend befriend; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Only the Jinn-struck wight such boon can gain:\nWell! yes, I'm mad: bring him who madded me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And, if he cure m: madness, blame restrain!'\"\n\nThen she let Marzawan know that she was love-daft and he said \"Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply there may be in my hand something which shall be a means of deliverance for thee.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of da, and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Marzawar thus addressed Princess Budur, \"Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply Allah may inspire me with a means of deliverance for thee.\" Quoth she, \"O my brother, hear my story which is this. One night I awoke from sleep, in the last third of the night[FN#284] and, sitting up, saw by my side the handsomest of youths that be, and tongue faileth to describe him, for he was as a willow-wand or an Indian rattan-cane. So methought it was my father who had done on this wise in order thereby to try me, for that he had consulted me concerning wedlock, when the Kings sought me of him to wife, and I had refused. It was this though withheld me from arousing him, for I feared that, if I did aught of embraced him, he would peradventure inform my father of m, doings. But in the morning, I found on my finger his seal-ring, in place of my own which he had taken. And, O my brother, m, heart was seized with love of him at first sight; and, for the violence of my passion and longing, I have never savoured the taste of sleep and have no occupation save weeping alway and repeating verses night and day. And this, O my brother, is my story and the cause of my madness.\" Then she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Now Love hast banished all that bred delight; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With that heart-nibbling fawn my joys took flight:\nLightest of trifles lover's blood to him *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who wastes the vitals of the hapless wight!\nFor him I'm jealous of my sight and thought; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart acts spy upon my thought and sight:\nThose long-lashed eyelids rain on me their shafts *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Guileful, destroying hearts where'er they light:\nNow, while my portion in the world endures, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall I behold him ere I quit world-site?\nWhat bear I for his sake I'd hide, but tears *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Betray my feelings to the spy's despight.\nWhen near, our union seemeth ever far; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When far, my thoughts to him aye nearest are.\"\n\nAnd presently she continued, \"See then, O my brother, how thou mayest aid me in mine affliction.\" So Marzawan bowed his head ground-wards awhile, wondering and not knowing what to do, then he raised it and said to her, \"All thou hast spoken to me I hold to be true, though the case of the young man pass my understanding: but I will go round about all lands and will seek for what may heal thee; haply Allah shall appoint thy healing to be at my hand. Meanwhile, take patience and be not disquieted.\" Thereupon Marzawan farewelled her, praying that she might be constant and left her repeating these couplets,\n\n\"Thine image ever companies my sprite, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    For all thou'rt distant from the pilgrim's sight:\nBut my heart-wishes e'er attract thee near: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    What is the lightning's speed to Thought's swift flight?\nThen go not thou, my very light of eyes *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which, when thou'rt gone, lack all the Kohl of light.\"\n\nThen Marzawan returned to his mother's house, where he passed the night. And when the morrow dawned, having equipped himself for his journey, he fared forth and ceased not faring from city to city and from island to island for a whole month, till he came to a town named Al-Tayrab.[FN#285] Here he went about scenting news of the townsfolk, so haply he might light on a cure for the Princess's malady, for in every capital he entered or passed by, it was reported that Queen Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, had lost her wits. But arriving at Al-Tayrab city, he heard that Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, was fallen sick and afflicted with melancholy madness. So Marzawan asked the name of the Prince's capital and they said to him, \"It is on the Islands of Khalidan and it lieth distant from our city a whole month's journey by sea, but by land it is six months' march.\" So he went down to the sea in a ship which was bound for the Khalidan Isles, and she sailed with a favouring breeze for a whole month, till they came in sight of the capital; and there remained for them but to make the land when, behold, there came out on them a tempestuous wind which carried away the masts and rent the canvas, so that the sails fell into the sea and the ship capsized, with all on board,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship capsized with all on board, each sought his own safety; and as for Marzawan the set of the sea carried him under the King's palace, wherein was Kamar al-Zaman. And by the decree of destiny it so happened that this was the day on which King Shahriman gave audience to his Grandees and high officers, and he was sitting, with his son's head on his lap, whilst an eunuch fanned away the flies; and the Prince had not spoken neither had he eaten nor drunk for two days, and he was grown thinner than a spindle.[FN#286] Now the Wazir was standing respectfully a-foot near the latticed window giving on the sea and, raising his eyes, saw Marzawan being beaten by the billows and at his last gasp; whereupon his heart was moved to pity for him, so he drew near to the King and moving his head towards him said, \"I crave thy leave, O King, to go down to the court of the pavilion and open the water-gate that I may rescue a man who is at the point of drowning in the sea and bring him forth of danger into deliverance; peradventure, on this account Allah may free thy son from what he hath!\" The King replied, \"O thou Wazir, enough is that which hath befallen my son through thee and on shine account. Haply, if thou rescue this drowning man, he will come to know our affairs, and look on my son who is in this state and exult over me; but I swear by Allah, that if this half-drowned wretch come hither and learn our condition and look upon my son and then fare forth and speak of our secrets to any, I will assuredly strike off thy head before his; for thou, O my Minister art the cause of all that hath betided us, first and last. Now do as thou wilt.\" Thereupon the Wazir sprang up and, opening the private pastern which gave upon the sea, descended to the causeway; then walked on twenty steps and came to the water where he saw Marzawan nigh unto death. So he put out his hand to him and, catching him by his hair, drew him ashore in a state of insensibility, with belly full of water and eyes half out of his head. The Wazir waited till he came to himself, when he pulled off his wet clothes and clad him in a fresh suit, covering his head with one of his servants' turbands; after which he said to him, Know that I have been the means of saving thee from drowning: do not thou requite me by causing my death and shine own.\"\u00c4And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir did to Marzawan what he did, he thus addressed him Know that I have been the cause of saving thee from drowning so requite me not by causing my death and shine own.\" Asked Marzawan, And how so?\"; and the Wazir answered, \"Thou art at this hour about to go up and pass among Emirs and Wazirs all of them silent and none speaking, because of Kamar al-Zaman the son of the Sultan.\" Now when Marzawan heard the name of Kamar al-Zaman, he knew that this was he whom he had heard spoken of in sundry cities and of whom he came in search, but he feigned ignorance and asked the Wazir, \"And who is Kamar al-Zaman? Answered the Minister, \"He is the son of Sultan Shahriman and he is sore sick and lieth strown on his couch restless alway, eating not nor drinking neither sleeping night or day; indeed he is nigh upon death and we have lost hope of his living and are certain that he is dying. Beware lest thou look too long on him, or thou look on any other than that where thou settest thy feet: else thou art a lost man, and I also.\" He replied, \"Allah upon thee, O Wazir, I implore thee, of thy favour, acquaint me touching this youth thou describest, what is the cause of the condition in which he is.\" The Wazir replied, \"I know none, save that, three years ago, his father required him to wed, but he refused; whereat the King was wroth and imprisoned him. And when he awoke on the morrow, he fancied that during the night he had been roused from sleep and had seen by his side a young lady of passing loveliness, whose charms tongue can never express; and he assured us that he had plucked off her seal-ring from her finger and had put it on his own and that she had done likewise; but we know not the secret of all this business. So by Allah, O my son, when thou comest up with me into the palace, look not on the Prince, but go thy way; for the Sultan's heart is full of wrath against me.\" So said Marzawan to himself, \"By Allah; this is the one I sought!\" Then he followed the Wazir up to the palace, where the Minister seated himself at the Prince's feet; but Marzawan found forsooth nothing to do but go up to Kamar al-Zaman and stand before him at gaze. Upon this the Wazir, died of affright in his skin, and kept looking at Marzawan and signalling him to wend his way; but he feigned not to see him and gave not over gazing upon Kamar al- Zaman, till he was well assured that it was indeed he whom he was seeking,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan looked upon Kamar al-Zaman and knew that it was indeed he whom he was seeking, he cried, \"Exalted be Allah, Who hath made his shape even as her shape and his complexion as her complexion and his cheek as her cheek!'' Upon this Kamar al-Zaman opened his eyes and gave earnest ear to his speech; and, when Marzawan saw him inclining to hear, he repeated these couplets[FN#287],\n\n\"I see thee full of song and plaint and love's own ecstasy;\nDelighting in describing all the charms of loveliness:\n\nArt smit by stroke of Love or hath shaft-shot wounded thee?\nNone save the wounded ever show such signals of distress!\nHo thou! crown the wine cup and sing me singular\nPraises to Sulaym\u00e1, Al-Rab\u00e1b, Tan'oum addrest;[FN#288]\n\nGo round the grape-vine sun[FN#289] which for mansion hath a jar;\nWhose East the cup boy is, and here my mouth that opes for West.\n\nI'm jealous of the very clothes that dare her sides enroll\nWhen she veils her dainty body of the delicatest grace:\n\nI envy every goblet of her lips that taketh toll\nWhen she sets the kissing cup on that sweetest kissing-place.\n\nBut deem not by the keen-edged scymitar I'm slain\u2014\nThe hurts and harms I dree are from arrows of her eyes.\n\nI found her finger tips, as I met her once again,\nDeep-reddened with the juice of the wood that ruddy dyes;[FN#290]\n\nAnd cried, 'Thy palms thou stainedst when far away was I\nAnd this is how thou payest one distracted by his pine!'\n\nQuoth she (enkindling in my heart a flame that burned high\nSpeaking as one who cannot hide of longing love the sign),\n\n'By thy life, this is no dye used for dyeing; so forbear\nThy blame, nor in charging me with falsing Love persist!\n\nBut when upon our parting-day I saw thee haste to fare,\n\nThe while were bared my hand and my elbow and my wrist;\n\n'I shed a flood of blood-red tears and with fingers brushed away; Hence blood-reddened were the tips and still blood-red they remain.'\n\nHad I wept before she wept, to my longing-love a prey,\nBefore repentance came, I had quit my soul of pain;\n\nBut she wept before I wept and I wept to see her care\nAnd I said, 'All the merit to precedent;'[FN#291]\n\nBlame me not for loving her, now on self of Love I swear\nFor her sake, for her only, these pains my soul torment.\n\nShe hath all the lere of Lukm\u00e1n[FN#292] and Y\u00fasuf's beauty lief;\nSweet singer David's voice and Maryam's chastity:\n\nWhile I've all Jacob's mourning and Jonah's prison-grief,\nAnd the sufferings of Job and old Adam's history:\n\nYet kill her not, albeit of my love for her I die;\nBut ask her why my blood to her was lawful. ask her why?\"\n\nWhen Marzawan recited this ode, the words fell upon Kamar al- Zaman's heart as freshness after fever and returning health; and he sighed and, turning his tongue in his mouth, said to his sire, \"O my father, let this youth come and sit by my side.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to his sire, \"O my father, allow this youth to come and sit by my side.\" Now when the King heard these words from his son, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, though at the first his heart had been set against Marzawan and he had determined that the stranger's head needs must be stricken off: but when he heard Kamar al-Zaman speak, his anger left him and he arose and drawing Marzawan to him, seated him by his son and turning to him said, \"Praised be Allah for thy safety!\" He replied, \"Allah preserve thee! and preserve thy son to thee!\" and called down blessings on the King. Then the King asked, \"From what country art thou?\"; and he answered, \"From the Islands of the Inland Sea, the kingdom of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas and the Seven Palaces.\" Quoth King Shahriman, \"Maybe thy coming shall be blessed to my son and Allah vouchsafe to heal what is in him.\" Quoth Marzawan, \"Inshallah, naught shall be save what shall be well!\" Then turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he said to him in his ear unheard of the King and his court, 'O my lord! be of good cheer, and hearten thy heart and let shine eyes be cool and clear and, with respect to her for whose sake thou art thus, ask not of her case on shine account. But thou keptest thy secret and fellest sick, while she told her secret and they said she had gone mad; so she is now in prison, with an iron chain about her neck, in most piteous plight; but, Allah willing, the healing of both of you shall come from my hand.\" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, his life returned to him and he took heart and felt a thrill of joy and signed to his father to help him sit up; and the King was like to fly for gladness and rose hastily and lifted him up. Presently, of his fear for his son, he shook the kerchief of dismissal[FN#293]; and all the Emirs and Wazirs withdrew; then he set two pillows for his son to lean upon, after which he bade them perfume the palace with saffron and decorate the city, saying to Marzawan, \"By Allah, O my son, of a truth shine aspect be a lucky and a blessed!\" And he made as much of him as he might and called for food, and when they brought it, Marzawan came up to the Prince and said, \"Rise, eat with me.\" So he obeyed him and ate with him, and all the while the King invoked blessings on Marzawan and said, \"How auspicious is thy coming, O my son!\" And when the father saw his boy eat, his joy and gladness redoubled, and he went out and told the Prince's mother and all the household. Then he spread throughout the palace the good news of the Prince's recovery and the King commanded the decoration of the city and it was a day of high festival. Marzawan passed that night with Kamar al-Zaman, and the King also slept with them in joy and delight for his son's recovery.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman also passed that night with them in the excess of his joy for his son's recovery. And when the next morning dawned, and the King had gone away and the two young men were left alone, Kamar al-Zaman told his story from beginning to end to Marzawan who said, \"In very sooth I know her with whom thou didst foregather; her name is the Princess Budur and she is daughter to King Ghayur.\" Then he related to him all that had passed with the Princess from first to last and acquainted him with the excessive love she bore him, saying, \"All that befel thee with thy father hath befallen her with hers, and thou art without doubt her beloved, even as she is shine; so brace up thy resolution and take heart, for I will bring thee to her and unite you both anon and deal with you even as saith the poet,\n\n\"Albe to lover adverse be his love, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And show aversion howso may he care;\nYet will I manage that their persons[FN#294] meet, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     E'en as the pivot of a scissor pair.\"\n\nAnd he ceased not to comfort and solace and encourage Kamar al- Zaman and urged him to eat and drink till he ate food and drank wine, and life returned to him and he was saved from his ill case; and Marzawan cheered him and diverted him with talk and songs and stories, and in good time he became free of his disorder and stood up and sought to go to the Hammam.[FN#295] So Marzawan took him by the hand and both went to the bath, where they washed their bodies and made them clean.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundredth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, went to the Hammam, his father in his joy at this event freed the prisoners, and presented splendid dresses to his grandees and bestowed large alm-gifts upon the poor and bade decorate the city seven days. Then quoth Marzawan to Kamar al-Zaman, \"Know, O my lord, that I came not from the Lady Budur save for this purpose, and the object of my journey was to deliver her from her present case; and it remaineth for us only to devise how we may get to her, since thy father cannot brook the thought of parting from thee. So it is my counsel that to-morrow thou ask his leave to go abroad hunting. Then do thou take with thee a pair of saddle-bags full of money and mount a swift steed, and lead a spare horse, and I will do the like, and say to thy sire, 'I have a mind to divert myself with hunting the desert and to see the open country and there to pass one night.' Suffer not any servant to follow us, for as soon as we reach the open country, we will go our ways.\" Kamar al- Zaman rejoiced in this plan with great joy and cried, \"It is good.\" Then he stiffened his back and, going in to his father, sought his leave and spoke as he had been taught, and the King consented to his going forth a-hunting and said, \"O my son, blessed be the day that restoreth thee to health! I will not gainsay thee in this; but pass not more than one night in the desert and return to me on the morrow; for thou knowest that life is not good to me without thee, and indeed I can hardly believe thee to be wholly recovered from what thou hadst,[FN#296] because thou art to me as he of whom quoth the poet,\n\n'Albe by me I had through day and night *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Solomon's carpet and the Chosroes' might,\nBoth were in value less than wing of gnat, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unless these eyne could hold thee aye in sight.'\"[FN#297]\n\nThen the King equipped his son Kamar al-Zaman and Marzawan for the excursion, bidding make ready for them four horses, together with a dromedary to carry the money and a camel to bear the water and belly timber; and Kamar al-Zaman forbade any of his attendants to follow him. His father farewelled him and pressed him to his breast and kissed him, saying, \"I ask thee in the name of Allah, be not absent from me more than one night, wherein sleep will be unlawful to me, for I am even as saith the poet,\n\n'Thou present, in the Heaven of heavens I dwell; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Bearing shine absence is of hells my Hell:\nPledged be for thee my soul! If love for thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Be crime, my crime is of the fellest fell.\nDoes love-lowe burn thy heart as burns it mine, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Doomed night and day Gehenna-fire to smell?'\"\n\nAnswered Kamar al-Zaman, \"O my father, Inshallah, I will lie abroad but one night!\" Then he took leave of him, and he and Marzawan mounted and leading the spare horses, the dromedary with the money and the camel with the water and victual, turned their faces towards the open country;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawning day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and First Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman and Marzawan fared forth and turned their faces towards the open country; and they travelled from the first of the day till nightfall, when they halted and ate and drank and fed their beasts and rested awhile; after which they again took horse and ceased not journeying for three days, and on the fourth they came to a spacious tract wherein was a thicket. They alighted in it and Marzawan, taking the camel and one of the horses, slaughtered them and cut off their flesh and stripped their bones. Then he doffed from Kamar al-Zaman his shirt and trousers which he smeared with the horse's blood and he took the Prince's coat which he tore to shreds and befouled with gore; and he cast them down in the fork of the road. Then they ate and drank and mounting set forward again; and, when Kamar al- Zaman asked why this was done, and said, \"What is this O my brother, and how shall it profit us?\"; Marzawan replied, \"Know that thy father, when we have outstayed the second night after the night for which we had his leave, and yet we return not, will mount and follow in our track till he come hither; and, when he happeneth upon this blood which I have spilt and he seeth thy shirt and trousers rent and gore-fouled, he will fancy that some accident befel thee from bandits or wild-beasts, so he will give up hope of thee and return to his city, and by this device we shall win our wishes.\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"By Allah, this be indeed a rare device! Thou hast done right well.''[FN#298] Then the two fared on days and nights and all that while Kamar al-Zaman did naught but complain when he found himself alone, and he ceased not weeping till they drew near their journeys end, when he rejoiced and repeated these verses,\n\n\"Wilt tyrant play with truest friend who thinks of thee each\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     hour, * And after showing love-desire betray indifference?\nMay I forfeit every favour if in love I falsed thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     If thee I left, abandon me by way of recompense:\nBut I've been guilty of no crime such harshness to deserve, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And if I aught offended thee I bring my penitence;\nOf Fortune's wonders one it is thou hast abandoned me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Fortune never wearieth of showing wonderments.\"\n\nWhen he had made an end of his verses, Marzawan said to him, \"Look! these be King Ghayur's Islands;\" whereat Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done, and kissed him between the eyes and strained him\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan said \"Look! these be the Islands of King Ghayur;\" Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done and kissed him between the eyes and strained him to his bosom. And after reaching the Islands and entering the city they took up their lodging in a khan, where they rested three days from the fatigues of their wayfare; after which Marzawan carried Kamar al-Zaman to the bath and, clothing him in merchant's gear, provided him with a geomantic tablet of gold,[FN#299] with a set of astrological instruments and with an astrolabe of silver, plated with gold. Then he said to him, \"Arise, O my lord, and take thy stand under the walls of the King's palace and cry out, 'I am the ready Reckoner; I am the Scrivener; I am he who weeteth the Sought and the Seeker; I am the finished man of Science; I am the Astrologer accomplished in experience! Where then is he that seeketh?' As soon as the King heareth this, he will send after thee and carry thee in to his daughter the Princess Budur, thy lover; but when about going in to her do thou say to him, 'Grant me three days' delay, and if she recover, give her to me to wife; and if not, deal with me as thou dealest with those who forewent me.' He will assuredly agree to this, so as soon as thou art alone with her, discover thyself to her; and when she seeth thee, she will recover strength and her madness will cease from her and she will be made whole in one night. Then do thou give her to eat and drink. and her father, rejoicing in her recovery, will marry thee to her and share his kingdom with thee; for he hath imposed on himself this condition and so peace be upon thee.\" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words he exclaimed, \"May I never lack thy benefits!\", and, taking the set of instruments aforesaid, sallied forth from the caravanserai in the dress of his order. He walked on till he stood under the walls of King Ghayur's palace, where he began to cry out, saying, \"I am the Scribe, I am the ready Reckoner, I am he who knoweth the Sought and the Seeker; I am he who openeth the Volume and summeth up the Sums;[FN#300] who Dreams can expound whereby the sought is found! Where then is the seeker?\" Now when the city people heard this, they flocked to him, for it was long since they had seen Scribe or Astrologer, and they stood round him and, looking upon him, they saw one in the prime of beauty and grace and perfect elegance, and they marvelled at his loveliness, and his fine stature and symmetry. Presently one of them accosted him and said, \"Allah upon thee, O thou fair and young, with the eloquent tongue! incur not this affray; nor throw thy life away in thine ambition to marry the Princess Budur. Only cast shine eyes upon yonder heads hung up; all their owners have lost their lives in this same venture.\" Yet Kamar al-Zaman paid no heed to them, but cried out at the top of his voice, saying, \"I am the Doctor, the Scrivener! I am the Astrologer, the Calculator!\" And all the townsfolk forbade him from this, but he regarded them not at all, saying in his mind, \"None knoweth desire save whoso suffereth it.\" Then he began again to cry his loudest, shouting, \"I am the Scrivener, I am the Astrologer!\"\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman in no wise heeded the words of the citizens, but continued to cry out, \"I am the Calculator! I am the Astrologer!\" Thereupon all the townsfolk were wroth with him and said to him, \"Thou art nothing but an imbecile, silly, self-willed lad! Have pity on shine own youth and tender years and beauty and loveliness.\" But he cried all the more, \"I am the Astrologer, I am the Calculator! Is there any one that seeketh?\" As he was thus crying and the people forbidding him, behold, King Ghayur heard his voice and the clamour of the lieges and said to his Wazir, \"Go down and bring me yon Astrologer.\" So the Wazir, went down in haste, and taking Kamar al-Zaman from the midst of the crowd led him up to the King; and when in the presence he kissed the ground and began versifying,\n\n\"Eight glories meet, all, all conjoined in thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whereby may Fortune aye thy servant be:\nLere, lordliness, grace, generosity; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Plain words, deep meaning, honour, victory!\"\n\nWhen the King looked upon him, he seated him by his side and said to him, \"By Allah, O my son, an thou be not an astrologer, venture not thy life nor comply with my condition; for I have bound myself that whoso goeth in to my daughter and healeth her not of that which hath befallen her I will strike off his head; but whoso healeth her him I will marry to her. So let not thy beauty and loveliness delude thee: for, by Allah! and again, by Allah! If thou cure her not, I will assuredly cut off thy head.\" And Kamar al-Zaman replied, \"This is thy right; and I consent, for I wot of this ere came I hither.\" Then King Ghayur took the Kazis to witness against him and delivered him to the eunuch, saying, \"Carry this one to the Lady Budur.\" So the eunuch took him by the hand and led him along the passage; but Kamar al-Zaman outstripped him and pushed on before, whilst the eunuch ran after him, saying, \"Woe to thee! Hasten not to shine own ruin: never yet saw I astrologer so eager for his proper destruction; but thou weetest not what calamities are before thee.\" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman turned away his face from the eunuch,\u2014And Shah razed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the eunuch thus addressed Kamar al-Zaman, \"Patience, and no indecent hurry!\"; the Prince turned away his face and began repeating these couplets,\n\n\"A Sage, I feel a fool before thy charms; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Distraught, I wot not what the words I say:\nIf say I 'Sun,' away thou dost not pass *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From eyes of me, while suns go down with day:\nThou hast completed Beauty, in whose praise *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Speech-makers fail, and talkers lose their way.\"\n\nThen the eunuch stationed Kamar al-Zaman behind the curtain of the Princess's door and the Prince said to him, \"Which of the two ways will please thee more, treat and cure thy lady from here or go in and heal her within the curtain?\" The eunuch marvelled at his words and answered, \"An thou heal her from here it were better proof of thy skill.\" Upon this Kamar al-Zaman sat down behind the curtain and, taking out ink case, pen and paper, wrote the following: \"This is the writ of one whom passion swayeth,* and whom longing waylayeth * and wakeful misery slayeth * one who despaireth of living * and looketh for naught but dying * with whose mourning heart * nor comforter nor helper taketh part * One whose sleepless eyes * none succoureth from anxieties * whose day is passed in fire * and his night in torturing desire * whose body is wasted for much emaciation * and no messenger from his beloved bringeth him consolation.\" And after this he indited the following couplets,\n\n\"I write with heart devoted to thy thought, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And eyelids chafed by tears of blood they bled;\nAnd body clad, by loving pine and pain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In shirt of leanness, and worn down to thread,\nTo thee complain I of Love's tormentry, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which ousted hapless Patience from her stead:\nA toi! show favour and some mercy deign, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For Passion's cruel hands my vitals shred.\"\n\nAnd beneath his lines he wrote these cadenced sentences, \"The heart's pain is removed * by union with the beloved * and whomso his lover paineth * only Allah assaineth! * If we or you have wrought deceit * may the deceiver win defeat! * There is naught goodlier than a lover who keeps faith * with the beloved who works him scathe.\" Then, by way of subscription, he wrote, \"From the distracted and despairing man * whom love and longing trepan * from the lover under passion's ban * the prisoner of transport and distraction * from this Kamar al-Zaman * son of Shahriman * to the peerless one * of the fair Houris the pearl-union * to the Lady Budur * daughter of King Al Ghayur * Know thou that by night I am sleepless * and by day in distress * consumed with increasing wasting and pain * and longing and love unfain * abounding in sighs * with tear flooded eyes * by passion captive ta'en * of Desire the slain * with heart seared by the parting of us twain * the debtor of longing bane, of sickness cup-companion * I am the sleepless one, who never closeth eye * the slave of love, whose tears run never dry * for the fire of my heart is still burning * and never hidden is the flame of my yearning.\" Then on the margin Kamar al-Zaman wrote this admired verse,\n\n\"Salem from graces hoarded by my Lord *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To her, who holds my heart and soul in hoard!\"\n\nAnd also these,\n\n\"Pray'ee grant me some words from your lips, belike *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Such mercy may comfort and cool these eyne:\nFrom the stress of my love and my pine for you, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I make light of what makes me despised, indign:\nAllah guard a folk whose abode was far, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And whose secret I kept in the holiest shrine:\nNow Fortune in kindness hath favoured me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thrown on threshold dust of this love o' mine:\nBy me bedded I looked on Bud\u00far, whose sun *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The moon of my fortunes hath made to shine.\"\n\nThen, having affixed his seal-ring to the missive, he wrote these couplets in the place of address,\n\n\"Ask of my writ what wrote my pen in dole, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And hear my tale of misery from this scroll;\nMy hand is writing while my tears down flow, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to the paper 'plains my longing soul:\nMy tears cease not to roll upon this sheet, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And if they stopped I'd cause blood-gouts to roll.\"\n\nAnd at the end he added this other verse,\n\n\"I've sent the ring from off thy finger bore *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I when we met, now deign my ring restore!\"\n\nThen Kamar al-Zaman set the Lady Budur's ring inside the letter and sealed it and gave it to the eunuch, who took it and went in with it to his mistress.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman, after setting the seal-ring inside the epistle, gave it to the eunuch who took it and went in with it to his mistress; and, when the Lady Budur opened it, she found therein her own very ring. Then she read the paper and when she understood its purport and knew that it was from her beloved, and that he in person stood behind the curtain, her reason began to fly and her breast swelled for joy and rose high; and she repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Long, long have I bewailed the sev'rance of our loves, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With tears that from my lids streamed down like burning\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rain;\nAnd vowed that, if the days deign reunite us two, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My lips should never speak of severance again:\nJoy hath o'erwhelmed me so that, for the very stress *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of that which gladdens me to weeping I am fain.\nTears are become to you a habit, O my eyes, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So that ye weep as well for gladness as for pain.''[FN#301]\n\nAnd having finished her verse, the Lady Budur stood up forthwith and, firmly setting her feet to the wall, strained with all her might upon the collar of iron, till she brake it from her neck and snapped the chains. Then going forth from behind the curtain she threw herself on Kamar al-Zaman and kissed him on the mouth, like a pigeon feeding its young.[FN#302] And she embraced him with all the stress of her love and longing and said to him, \"O my lord do I wake or sleep and hath the Almighty indeed vouchsafe] us reunion after disunion? Laud be to Allah who hath our loves repaired, even after we despaired!\" Now when the eunuch saw her in this case, he went off running to King Ghayur and, kissing the ground before him, said, \"O my lord, know that this Astrologer is indeed the Shaykh of all astrologers, who are fools to him, all of them; for verily he hath cured thy daughter while standing behind the curtain and without going in to her.\" Quoth the King, \"Look well to it, is this news true?\" Answered the eunuch, \"O my lord, rise and come and see for thyself how she hath found strength to break the iron chains and is come forth to the Astrologer, kissing and embracing him.\" Thereupon the King arose and went in to his daughter who, when she saw him, stood up in haste and covered her head,[FN#303] and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"The toothstick love I not; for when I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Siw\u00e1k,'[FN#304] I miss thee, for it sounds 'Siw\u00e1-ka'.\nThe caper-tree I love; for when I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Ar\u00e1k'[FN#305] it sounds I look on thee, 'Ar\u00e1-ka.'\"\n\nThereupon the King was so transported for joy at her recovery that he felt like to fly and kissed her between the eyes, for he loved her with dearest love; then, turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he asked him who he was, and said, \"What countryman art thou?\" So the Prince told him his name and rank, and informed him that he was the son of King Shahriman, and presently related to him the whole story from beginning to end; and acquainted him with what happened between himself and the Lady Budur; and how he had taken her seal-ring from her finger and had placed it on his own; whereat Ghayur marvelled and said, \"Verily your story deserveth in books to be chronicled, and when you are dead and gone age after age be read.\" Then he summoned Kazis and witnesses forthright and married the Lady Budur to Prince Kamar al-Zaman; after which he bade decorate the city seven days long. So they spread the tables with all manner of meats, whilst the drums beat and the criers anounced the glad tidings, and all the troops donned their richest clothes; and they illuminated the city and held high festival. Then Kamar al-Zaman went in to the Lady Budur and the King rejoiced in her recovery and in her marriage; and praised Allah for that He had made her to fall in love with a goodly youth of the sons of Kings. So they unveiled her and displayed the bride before the bridegroom; and both were the living likeness of each other in beauty and comeliness and grace and love-allurement. Then Kamar al-Zaman lay with her that night and took his will of her, whilst she in like manner fulfilled her desire of him and enjoyed his charms and grace; and they slept in each other's arms till the morning. On the morrow, the King made a wedding-feast to which he gathered all comers from the Islands of the Inner and Outer Seas, and he spread the tables with choicest viands nor ceased the banquetting for a whole month. Now when Kamar al-Zaman had thus fulfilled his will and attained his inmost desire, and whenas he had tarried awhile with the Princess Budur, he bethought him of his father, King Shahriman, and saw him in a dream, saying, \"O my son, is it thus thou dealest with me?\" and recited in the vision these two couplets,\n\n\"Indeed to watch the darkness-moon he blighted me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to star-gaze through longsome night he plighted me:\nEasy, my heart! for haply he'll unite with thee; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And patience, Sprite! with whatso ills he dight to thee.\"\n\nNow after seeing his father in the dream and hearing his re preaches, Kamar al-Zaman awoke in the morning, afflicted and troubled, whereupon the Lady Budur questioned him and he told her what he had seen.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman acquainted the Lady Budur with what he had seen in his dream, she and he went in to her sire and, telling him what had passed, besought his leave to travel. He gave the Prince the permission he sought; but the Princess said, \"O my father, I cannot bear to be parted from him.\" Quoth Ghayur, her sire, \"Then go thou with him,\" and gave her leave to be absent a whole twelvemonth and afterwards to visit him in every year once; so she kissed his hand and Kamar al-Zaman did the like. Thereupon King Ghayur proceeded to equip his daughter and her bridegroom for the journey, and furnished them with outfit and appointments for the march; and brought out of his stables horses marked with his own brand, blood-dromedaries[FN#306] which can journey ten days without water, and prepared a litter for his daughter, besides loading mules and camels with victual; moreover, he gave them slaves and eunuchs to serve them and all manner of travellinggear; and on the day of departure, when King Ghayur took leave of Kamar al-Zaman, he bestowed on him ten splendid suits of cloth of gold embroidered with stones of price, together with ten riding horses and ten she-camels, and a treasury of money;[FN#307] and he charged him to love and cherish his daughter the Lady Budur. Then the King accompanied them to the farthest limits of his Islands where, going in to his daughter Budur in the litter, he kissed her and strained her to his bosom, weeping and repeating,\n\n\"O thou who wooest Severance, easy fare! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For love-embrace belongs to lover-friend:\nFare softly! Fortune's nature falsehood is, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And parting shall love's every meeting end.\"\n\nThen leaving his daughter, he went to her husband and bade him farewell and kissed him; after which he parted from them and, giving the order for the march he returned to his capital with his troops. The Prince and Princess and their suite fared on without stopping through the first day and the second and the third and the fourth, nor did they cease faring for a whole month till they came to a spacious champaign, abounding in pasturage, where they pitched their tents; and they ate and drank and rested, and the Princess Budur lay down to sleep. Presently, Kamar al-Zaman went in to her and found her lying asleep clad in a shift of apricot-coloured silk that showed all and everything; and on her head was a coif of gold-cloth embroidered with pearls and jewels. The breeze raised her shift which laid bare her navel and showed her breasts and displayed a stomach whiter than snow, each one of whose dimples would contain an ounce of benzoin- ointment.[FN#308] At this sight, his love and longing redoubled, and he began reating,\n\n\"An were it asked me when by hell-fire burnt, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When flames of heart my vitals hold and hem,\n'Which wouldst thou chose, say wouldst thou rather them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Or drink sweet cooling draught?' I'd answer, 'Them!' \"\n\nThen he put his hand to the band of her petticoat-trousers and drew it and loosed it, for his soul lusted after her, when he saw a jewel, red as dye-wood, made fast to the band. He untied it and examined it and, seeing two lines of writing graven thereon, in a character not to be read, marvelled and said in his mind, \"Were not this bezel something to her very dear she had not bound it to her trousers-band nor hidden it in the most privy and precious place about her person, that she might not be parted from it. Would I knew what she cloth with this and what is the secret that is in it.\" So saying, he took it and went outside the tent to look at it in the light,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he took the bezel to look at it in the light, the while he was holding it behold, a bird swooped down on him and, snatching the same from his hand, flew off with it and then lighted on the ground. There-upon Kamar al-Zaman fearing to lose the jewel, ran after the bird; but it flew on before him, keeping just out of his reach, and ceased not to draw him on from dale to dale and from hill to hill, till the night starkened and the firmament darkened, when it roosted on a high tree. So Kamar al-Zaman stopped under the tree confounded in thought and faint for famine and fatigue, and giving himself up for lost, would have turned back, but knew not the way whereby he came, for that darkness had overtaken him. Then he exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious the Great!\"; and laying him down under the tree (whereon was the bird) slept till the morning, when he awoke and saw the bird also wake up and fly away. He arose and walked after it, and it flew on little by little before him, after the measure of his faring; at which he smiled and said, \"By Allah, a strange thing! Yesterday, this bird flew before me as fast as I could run, and to-day, knowing that I have awoke tired and cannot run, he flieth after the measure of my faring. By Allah, this is wonderful! But I must needs follow this bird whether it lead me to death or to life; and I will go wherever it goeth, for at all events it will not abide save in some inhabited land.[FN#309] So he continued to follow the bird which roosted every night upon a tree; and he ceased not pursuing it for a space of ten days, feeding on the fruits of the earth and drinking of its waters. At the end of this time, he came in sight of an inhabited city, whereupon the bird darted off like the glance of the eye and, entering the town, disappeared from Kamar al-Zaman, who knew not what it meant or whither it was gone; so he marvelled at this and exclaimed, \"Praise be to Allah who hath brought me in safety to this city!\" Then he sat down by a stream and washed his hands and feet and face and rested awhile; and, recalling his late easy and pleasant life of union with his beloved and contrasting it with his present plight of trouble and fatigue and distress and strangerhood and famine and severance, the tears streamed from his eyes and he began repeating these cinquains,\n\n\"Pain had I hid thy handwork, but it showed, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Changed sleep for wake, and wake with me abode:\nWhen thou didst spurn my heart I cried aloud *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Pate, hold thy hand and cease to gird and goad:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          In dole and danger aye my sprite I spy!\nAn but the Lord of Love were just to me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Sleep fro' my eyelids ne'er were forced to flee.\nPity, my lady, one for love o' thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Prom his tribes darling brought to low degree:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Love came and doomed Wealth beggar-death to die.\nThe railers chide at thee: I ne'er gainsay, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But stop my ears and dumbly sign them Nay:\n'Thou lov'st a slender may,' say they; I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'I've picked her out and cast the rest away:'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Enough; when Fate descends she blinds man's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          eye!\"[FN#310]\n\nAnd as soon as he had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he rose and walked on little by little, till he entered the city.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as soon as Kamar al-Zaman had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he arose and entered the city-gate[FN#311] not knowing whither he should wend. He crossed the city from end to end, entering by the land-gate, and ceased not faring on till he came out at the sea- gate, for the city stood on the sea-shore. Yet he met not a single one of its citizens. And after issuing from the land-gate he fared forwards and ceased not faring till he found himself among the orchards and gardens of the place; and, passing among the trees presently came to a garden and stopped before its door; where-upon the keeper came out to him and saluted him. The Prince returned his greeting and the gardener bade him welcome, saying, \"Praised be Allah that thou hast come off safe from the dwellers of this city! Quick, come into the garth, ere any of the townfolk see thee.\" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered that garden, wondering in mind, and asked the keeper, \"What may be the history of the people of this city and who may they be?\" The other answered, \"Know that the people of this city are all Magians: but Allah upon thee, tell me how thou camest to this city and what caused thy coming to our capital.\" Accordingly Kamar al-Zaman told the gardener all that had befallen him from beginning to end, whereat he marvelled with great marvel and said, \"Know, O my son, that the cities of Al-Islam lie far from us; and between us and them is a four months' voyage by sea and a whole twelve months' journey by land. We have a ship which saileth every year with merchandise to the nearest Moslem country and which entereth the seas of the Ebony Islands and thence maketh the Khalidan Islands, the dominions of King Shahriman.\" Thereupon Kamar al- Zaman considered awhile and concluded that he could not do better than abide in the garden with the gardener and become his assistant, receiving for pay one fourth of the produce. So he said to him, \"Wilt thou take me into thy service, to help thee in this garden?\" Answered the gardener, \"To hear is to consent;\" and began teaching him to lead the water to the roots of the trees. So Kamar al-Zaman abode with him, watering the trees and hoeing up the weeds and wearing a short blue frock which reached to his knees. And he wept floods of tears; for he had no rest day or night, by reason of his strangerhood and he ceased not to repeat verses upon his beloved, amongst others the following couplets,\n\n\n\"Ye promised us and will ye not keep plight? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ye said a say and shall not deed be dight?\nWe wake for passion while ye slumber and sleep; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Watchers and wakers claim not equal right:\nWe vowed to keep our loves in secrecy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But spake the meddler and you spoke forthright:\nO friend in pain and pleasure, joy and grief, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In all case you, you only, claim my sprite!\nMid folk is one who holds my prisoned heart; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would he but show some ruth for me to sight.\nNot every eye like mine is wounded sore, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Not every heart like mine love-pipings blight:\nYe wronged me saying, Love is wrongous aye *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yea! ye were right, events have proved that quite.\nForget they one love-thralled, whose faith the world *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Robs not, though burn the fires in heart alight:\nIf an my foeman shall become my judge, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whom shall I sue to remedy his despight?\nHad not I need of love nor love had sought, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart forsure were not thus love-distraught.\"\n\nSuch was the case with Kamar al-Zaman; but as regards his wife, the Lady Budur, when she awoke she sought her husband and found him not: then she saw her petticoat-trousers undone, for the band had been loosed and the bezel lost, whereupon she said to herself, \"By Allah, this is strange! Where is my husband? It would seem as if he had taken the talisman and gone away, knowing not the secret which is in it. Would to Heaven I knew whither can he have wended! But it must needs have been some extraordinary matter that drew him away, for he cannot brook to leave me a moment. Allah curse the stone and damn its hour!\" Then she considered awhile and said in her mind, \"If I go out and tell the varlets and let them learn that my husband is lost they will lust after me: there is no help for it but that I use stratagem. So she rose and donned some of her husband's clothes and riding- boots, and a turband like his, drawing one corner of it across her face for a mouth-veil.[FN#312] Then, setting a slave-girl in her litter, she went forth from the tent and called to the pages who brought her Kamar al-Zaman's steed; and she mounted and bade them load the beasts and resume the march. So they bound on the burdens and departed; and she concealed her trick, none doubting but she was Kamar al-Zaman, for she favoured him in face and form; nor did she cease journeying, she and her suite, days and nights, till they came in sight of a city overlooking the Salt Sea, where they pitched their tents without the walls and halted to rest. The Princess asked the name of the town and was told, \"It is called the City of Ebony; its King is named Arman\u00fas, and he hath a daughter Hay\u00e1t al-Nuf\u00fas[FN#313] hight,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur halted within sight of the Ebony City to take her rest, King Armanus sent a messenger, to learn what King it was who had encamped without his capital; so the messenger, coming to the tents, made inquiry anent their King, and was told that she was a King's son who had lost the way being bound for the Khalidan Islands; whereupon he returned to King Armanus with the tidings; and, when the King heard them, he straightway rode out with the lords of his land to greet the stranger on arrival. As he drew near the tents the Lady Budur came to meet him on foot, whereupon the King alighted and they saluted each other. Then he took her to the city and, bringing her up to the palace, bade them spread the tables and trays of food and commanded them to transport her company and baggage to the guess house. So they abode there three days; at the end of which time the King came in to the Lady Budur. Now she had that day gone to the Hammam and her face shone as the moon at its full, a seduction to the world and a rending of the veil of shame to mankind; and Armanus found her clad in a -suit of silk, embroidered with gold and jewels; so he said to her, 'O my son, know that I am a very old man, decrepit withal, and Allah hath blessed me with no child save one daughter, who resembleth thee in beauty and grace; and I am now waxed unfit for the conduct of the state. She is shine, O my son; and, if this my land please thee and thou be willing to abide and make thy home here, I will marry thee to her and give thee my kingdom and so be at rest.\" When Princess Budur heard this, she bowed her head and her forehead sweated for shame, and she said to herself. \"How shall I do, and I a woman? If I refuse and depart from him, I cannot be safe but that haply send after me troops to slay me; and if I consent, belike I shall be put to shame. I have lost my beloved Kamar al-Zaman and know not what is become of him; nor can I escape from this scrape save by holding my peace and consenting and abiding here, till Allah bring about what is to be.\" So she raised her head and made submission to King Armanus, saying, \"Hearkening and obedience!\"; whereat he rejoiced and bade the herald make proclamation throughout the Ebony Islands to hold high festival and decorate the houses. Then he assembled his Chamberlains and Nabobs, and Emirs and Wazirs and his officers of state and the Kazis of the city; and, formally abdicating his Sultanate, endowed Budur therewith and invested her in all the vestments of royalty. The Emirs and Grandees went in to her and did her homage, nothing doubting but that she was a young man, and all who looked on her bepissed their bag-trousers, for the excess of her beauty and loveliness. Then, after the Lady Budur had been made Sultan and the drums had been beaten in announcement of the glad event, and she had been ceremoniously enthroned, King Armanus proceeded to equip his daughter Hayat al-Nufus for marriage, and in a few days, they brought the Lady Budur in to her, when they seemed as it were two moons risen at one time or two suns in conjunction. So they entered the bridal-chamber and the doors were shut and the curtains let down upon them, after the attendants had lighted the wax-candles and spread for them the carpet-bed. When Budur found herself alone with the Princess Hayat al-Nufus, she called to mind her beloved Kamar al-Zaman and grief was sore upon her. So she wept for his absence, and estrangement and she began repeating,\n\n\"O ye who fled and left my heart in pain low li'en, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     No breath of life if found within this frame of mine:\nI have an eye which e'er complains of wake, but lo! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tears occupy it would that wake content these eyne!\nAfter ye marched forth the lover 'bode behind; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Question of him what pains your absence could design!\nBut for the foods of tears mine eyelids rail and rain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My fires would flame on high and every land calcine.\nTo Allah make I moan of loved ones lost for aye, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who for my pine and pain no more shall pain and pine:\nI never wronged them save that over love I nurst: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Love departs us lovers into blest and curst.\"\n\nAnd when she had finished her repeating, the Lady Budur sat down beside the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and kissed her on the mouth; after which rising abruptly, she made the minor ablution and betook herself to her devotions; nor did she leave praying till Hayat al-Nufus fell asleep, when she slips into bed and lay with her back to her till morning. And when day had broke the King and Queen came in to their daughter and asked her how she did. whereupon she told them what she had seen, and repeated to them the verses she had heard. Thus far concerning Hayat al-Nufus and her father; but as regards Queen Budur she went forth and seated herself upon the royal throne and all the Emirs and Captains and Officers of state came up to her and wished her joy of the kingship, kissing the earth before her and calling down blessings upon her. And she accosted them with smiling face and clad them in robes of honour, augmenting the fiefs of the high officials and giving largesse to the levies; wherefore all the people loved her and offered up prayers for the long endurance of her reign, doubting not but that she was a man. And she ceased not sitting all day in the hall of audience, bidding and forbidding; dispensing justice, releasing prisoners and remitting the customs-dues, till nightfall, when she withdrew to the apartment prepared for her. Here she found Hayat al-Nufus seated, so she sat down by her side and, clapping her on the back, coaxed and caressed her and kissed her between the eyes, and fell to versifying in these couplets,\n\n\"What secret kept I these my tears have told, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And my waste body must my love unfold:\nThough hid my pine, my plight on parting day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To every envious eye my secret sold:\nO ye who broke up camp, you've left behind *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My spirit wearied and my heart a-cold:\nIn my hearts core ye dwell, and now these eyne *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Roll blood-drops with the tears they whilome rolled:\nThe absent will I ransom with my soul; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     All can my yearning for their sight behold:\nI have an eye whose babe,[FN#314] for love of thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rejected sleep nor hath its tears controlled.\nThe foeman bids me patient bear his loss, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ne'er may mine ears accept the ruth he doled!\nI tricks their deme of me, and won my wish *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of Kamar al-Zaman's joys manifold:\nHe joins all perfect gifts like none before, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Boasted such might and main no King of old:\nSeeing his gifts, Bin Z\u00e1'idah's[FN#315] largesse *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Forget we, and Mu'\u00e1wiyah mildest-soul'd:[FN#316]\nWere verse not feeble and o'er short the time *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I had in laud of him used all of rhyme.\"\n\nThen Queen Budur stood up and wiped away her tears and, making the lesser ablution,[FN#317] applied her to pray: nor did she give over praying till drowsiness overcame the Lady Hayat al- Nufus and she slept, whereupon the Lady Budur came and lay by her till the morning. At daybreak, she arose and prayed the dawn- prayer; and presently seated herself on the royal throne and passed the day in ordering and counter ordering and giving laws and administering justice. This is how it fared with her; but as regards King Armanus he went in to his daughter and asked her how she did; so she told him all that had befallen her and repeated to him the verses which Queen Budur had recited, adding, \"O my father, never saw I one more abounding in sound sense and modesty than my husband, save that he cloth nothing but weep and sigh.\" He answered, \"O my daughter, have patience with him yet this third night, and if he go not in unto thee and do away thy maidenhead, we shall know how to proceed with him and oust him from the throne and banish him the country.\" And on this wise he agreed with his daughter what course he would take.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Tenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Armanus had agreed with his daughter on this wise and had determined what course he would take and night came on, Queen Budur arose from the throne of her kingdom and betaking herself to the palace, entered the apartment prepared for her. There she found the wax-candles lighted and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus seated and awaiting her; whereupon she bethought her of her husband and what had betided them both of sorrow and severance in so short a space; she wept and sighed and groaned groan upon groan, and began improvising these couplets,\n\n\"News of my love fill all the land, I swear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     As suns on Ghaz\u00e1[FN#318]-wold rain heat and glare:\nSpeaketh his geste but hard its sense to say; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thus never cease to grow my cark and care:\nI hate fair Patience since I loved thee; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     E'er sawest lover hate for love to bear?\nA glance that dealt love-sickness dealt me death, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Glances are deadliest things with torments rare:\nHe shook his love locks down and bared his chin, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whereby I spied his beauties dark and fair:\nMy care, my cure are in his hands; and he *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who caused their dolour can their dole repair:\nHis belt went daft for softness of his waist; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His hips, for envy, to uprise forbear:\nHis brow curl-diademed is murky night; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unveil 't and lo! bright Morn shows brightest light.\"\n\nWhen she had finished her versifying, she would have risen to pray, but, lo and behold! Hayat al-Nufus caught her by the skirt and clung to her saying, \"O my lord, art thou not ashamed before my father, after all his favour, to neglect me at such a time as this?\" When Queen Budur heard her words, she sat down in the same place and said, \"O my beloved, what is this thou sayest?\" She replied, \"What I say is that I never saw any so proud of himself as thou. Is every fair one so disdainful? I say not this to incline thee to me; I say it only of my fear for thee from King Armanus; because he purposeth, unless thou go in unto me this very night, and do away my maidenhead, to strip thee of the kingship on the morrow and banish thee his kingdom; and peradventure his excessive anger may lead him to slay thee. But I, O my lord, have ruth on thee and give thee fair warning; and it is thy right to reck.\"[FN#319] Now when Queen Budur heard her speak these words, she bowed her head ground-wards awhile in sore perplexity and said in herself, \"If I refuse I'm lost; and if I obey I'm shamed. But I am now Queen of all the Ebony Islands and they are under my rule, nor shall I ever again meet my Kamar al- Zaman save in this place; for there is no way for him to his native land but through the Ebony Islands. Verily, I know not what to do in my present case, but I commit my care to Allah who directeth all for the best, for I am no man that I should arise and open this virgin girl.\" Then quoth Queen Budur to Hayat al- Nufus, \"O my beloved, that I have neglected thee and abstained from thee is in my own despite.\" And she told her her whole story from beginning to end and showed her person to her, saying, \"I conjure thee by Allah to keep my counsel, for I have concealed my case only that Allah may reunite me with my beloved Kamar al- Zaman and then come what may.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eleventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur acquainted Hayat al-Nufus with her history and bade her keep it secret, the Princess heard her with extreme wonderment and was moved to pity and prayed Allah to reunite her with her beloved, saying, \"Fear nothing, O my sister; but have patience till Allah bring to pass that which must come to pass:\" and she began repeating,\n\n\"None but the men of worth a secret keep;\nWith worthy men a secret's hidden deep;\nAs in a room, so secrets lie with me,\nWhose door is sealed, lock shot and lost the key.\"[FN#320]\n\nAnd when Hayat al-Nufus had ended her verses, she said, \"O my sister, verily the breasts of the noble and brave are of secrets the grave; and I will not discover shine.\" Then they toyed and embraced and kissed and slept till near the Mu'ezzin's call to dawn prayer, when Hayat al-Nufus arose and took a pigeon-poult,[FN#321] and cut its throat over her smock and besmeared herself with its blood. Then she pulled off her petticoat-trousers and cried aloud, where-upon her people hastened to her and raised the usual lullilooing and outcries of joy and gladness. Presently her mother came in to her and asked her how she did and busied herself about her and abode with her till evening; whilst the Lady Budur arose with the dawn, and repaired to the bath and, after washing herself pure, proceeded to the hall of audience, where she sat down on her throne and dispensed justice among the folk. Now when King Armanus heard the loud cries of joy, he asked what was the matter and was informed of the consummation of his daughter's marriage; whereat he rejoiced and his breast swelled with gladness and he made a great marriage-feast whereof the merry-making lasted a long time. Such was their case: but as regards King Shahriman it was on this wise. After his son had fared forth to the chase accompanied by Marzawan, as before related, he tarried patiently awaiting their return at nightfall; but when his son did not appear he passed a sleepless night and the dark hours were longsome upon him; his restlessness was excessive, his excitement grew upon him and he thought the morning would never dawn. Anc when day broke he sat expecting his son and waited till noon, but he came not; whereat his heart forebode separation and was fired with fears for Kamar al-Zaman; and he cried, \"Alas! my son!\" and he wept till his clothes were drenched with tears, and repeated with a beating heart,\n\n\n\"Love's votaries I ceased not to oppose, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Till doomed to taste Love's bitter and Love's sweet:\nI drained his rigour-cup to very dregs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Self humbled at its slaves' and freemen's feet:\nFortune had sworn to part the loves of us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     She kept her word how truly, well I weet!\"\n\nAnd when he ended his verse, he wiped away his tears and bade his troops make ready for a march and prepare for a long expedition. So they all mounted and set forth, headed by the Sultan, whose heart burnt with grief and was fired with anxiety for his son Kamar al-Zaman; and they advanced by forced marches. Now the King divided his host into six divisions, a right wing and a left wing, a vanguard and a rear guard;[FN#322] and bade them rendezvous for the morrow at the cross-roads. Accordingly they separated and scoured the country all the rest of that day till night, and they marched through the night and at noon of the ensuing day they joined company at the place where four roads met. But they knew not which the Prince followed, till they saw the sign of torn clothes and sighted shreds of flesh and beheld blood still sprinkled by the way and they noted every piece of the clothes and fragment of mangled flesh scattered on all sides. Now when King Shahriman saw this, he cried from his heart-core a loud cry, saying, \"Alas, my son!\"; and buffeted his face and plucks his beard and rent his raiment, doubting not but his son was dead. Then he gave himself up to excessive weeping and wailing, and the troops also wept for his weeping, all being assured that Prince Kamar al-Zaman had perished. They threw dust on their heads, and the night surprised them shedding tears and lamenting till they were like to die. Then the King with a heart on fire and with burning sighs spake these couplets,\n\n\"Chide not the mourner for bemourning woe; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Enough is yearning every Ill to show:\nHe weeps for stress of sorrow and of pain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And these to thee best evidence his lowe:\nHappy![FN#323] of whom Love sickness swore that ne'er *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Should cease his eye lids loving tears to flow:\nHe mourns the loss of fairest, fullest Moon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shining o'er all his peers in glorious glow:\nBut death made drink a brimming cup, what day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     He fared from natal country fain to go:\nHis home left he and went from us to grief; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor to his brethren could he say adieu:\nYea, his loss wounded me with parting pangs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And separation cost me many a throe:\nHe fared farewelling, as he fared, our eyes; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Whenas his Lord vouch-safed him Paradise.\"\n\nAnd when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twelfth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital, giving up his son for lost, and deeming that wild beasts or banditti had set upon him and torn him to pieces; and made proclamation that all in the Khalidan Islands should don black in mourning for him. Moreover, he built, in his memory, a pavilion, naming it House of Lamentations; and on Mondays and Thursdays he devoted himself to the business of the state and ordering the affairs of his levies and lieges; and the rest of the week he was wont to spend in the House of Lamentations, mourning for his son and bewailing him with elegiac verses,[FN#324] of which the following are some:\u2014\n\n\"My day of bliss is that when thou appearest; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My day of bale[FN#325] is that whereon thou farest:\nThough through the night I quake in dread of death; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Union wi' thee is of all bliss the dearest.\"\n\nAnd again he said,\n\n\"My soul be sacrifice for one, whose going *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Afflicted hearts with sufferings sore and dread:\nLet joy her widowed term[FN#326] fulfil, for I *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Divorced joy with the divorce thrice-said.\"[FN#327]\n\nSuch was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Queen Budur daughter of King Ghayur, she abode as ruler in the Ebony Islands, whilst the folk would point to her with their fingers, and say, \"Yonder is the son-in-law of King Armanus.\" And every night she lay with Hayat al-Nufus, to whom she lamented her desolate state and longing for her husband Kamar al-Zaman; weeping and describing to her his beauty and loveliness, and yearning to enjoy him though but in a dream: And at times she would repeat,\n\n\"Well Allah wots that since my severance from thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I wept till forced to borrow tears at usury:\n'Patience!' my blamer cried, 'Heartsease right soon shalt see!' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Quoth I, 'Say, blamer, where may home of Patience be?'\"\n\nThis is how it fared with Queen Budur; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, he abode with the gardener in the garden for no short time, weeping night and day and repeating verses bewailing the past time of enjoyment and delight; whilst the gardener kept comforting him and assuring him that the ship would set sail for the land of the Moslems at the end of the year. And in this condition he continued till one day he saw the folk crowding together and wondered at this; but the gardener came in to him and said, \"O my son, give over work for this day nor lead water to the trees; for it is a festival day, whereon folk visit one another. So take thy rest and only keep shine eye on the garden, whilst I go look after the ship for thee; for yet but a little while and I send thee to the land of the Moslems.\" Upon this, he went forth from the garden leaving to himself Kamar al-Zaman, who fell to musing upon his case till his heart was like to break and the tears streamed from his eyes. So he wept with excessive weeping till he swooned away and, when he recovered, he rose and walked about the garden, pondering what Time had done with him and bewailing the long endurance of his estrangement and separation from those he loved. As he was thus absorbed in melancholy thought, his foot stumbled and he fell on his face, his forehead striking against the projecting root of a tree; and the blow cut it open and his blood ran down and mingled with his tears Then he rose and, wiping away the blood, dried his tears and bound his brow with a piece of rag; then continued his walk about the garden engrossed by sad reverie. Presently, he looked up at a tree and saw two birds quarrelling thereon, and one of them rose up and smote the other with its beak on the neck and severed from its body its head, wherewith it flew away, whilst the slain bird fell to the ground before Kamar al-Zaman. As it lay, behold, two great birds swooped down upon it alighting, one at the head and the other at the tail, and both drooped their wings and bowed their bills over it and, extending their necks towards it, wept. Kamar al-Zaman also wept when seeing the birds thus bewail their mate, and called to mind his wife and father, And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman wept and lamented his separation from spouse and sire, when he beheld those two birds weeping over their mate. Then he looked at the twain and saw them dig a grave and therein bury the slain bird; after which they flew away far into the firmament and disappeared for a while; but presently they returned with the murtherer-bird and, alighting on the grave of the murthered, stamped on the slayer till they had done him to death. Then they rent his belly and tearing out his entrails, poured the blood on the grave of the slain[FN#328]: moreover, they stripped off his skin and tare his flesh in pieces and, pulling out the rest of the bowels, scattered them hither and thither. All this while Kamar al-Zaman was watching them wonderingly; but presently, chancing to look at the place where the two birds had slain the third, he saw therein something gleaming. So he drew near to it and noted that it was the crop of the dead bird. Whereupon he took it and opened it and found the talisman which had been the cause of his separation from his wife. But when he saw it and knew it, he fell to the ground a-fainting for joy; and, when he revived, he said, \"Praised be Allah! This is a foretaste of good and a presage of reunion with my beloved.\" Then he examined the jewel and passed it over his eyes[FN#329]; after which he bound it to his forearm, rejoicing in coming weal, and walked about till nightfall awaiting the gardener's return; and when he came not, he lay down and slept in his wonted place. At daybreak he rose to his work and, girding his middle with a cord of palm- fibre, took hatchet and basket and walked down the length of the garden, till he came to a carob-tree and struck the axe into its roots. The blow rang and resounded; so he cleared away the soil from the place and discovered a trap-door and raised it.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen It was the Two Hundred and Fourteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman raised the trap-door, he found a winding stair, which he descended and came to an ancient vault of the time of Ad and Tham\u00fad,[FN#330] hewn out of the rock. Round the vault stood many brazen vessels of the bigness of a great oil-jar which he found full of gleaming red gold: whereupon he said to himself, \"Verily sorrow is gone and solace is come!\" Then he mounted from the souterrain to the garden and, replacing the trap-door as it was before, busied himself in conducting water to the trees till the last of the day, when the gardener came back and said to him, \"O my son, rejoice at the good tidings of a speedy return to thy native land: the merchants are ready equipped for the voyage and the ship in three days' time will set sail for the City of Ebony, which is the first of the cities of the Moslems, and after making it, thou must travel by land a six months' march till thou come to the Islands of Khalidan, the dominions of King Shahriman.\" At this Kamar al-Zaman rejoiced and began repeating,\n\n\"Part not from one whose wont is not to part from you; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor with your cruel taunts an innocent mortify:\nAnother so long parted had ta'en heart from you, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And had his whole condition changed,\u2014but not so I.\"\n\nThen he kissed the gardener's hand and said, \"O my father, even as thou hast brought me glad tidings, so I also have great good news for thee,' and told him anent his discovery of the vault; whereat the gardener rejoiced and said, \"O my son, fourscore years have I dwelt in this garden and have never hit on aught whilst thou, who hast not sojourned with me a year, hast discovered this thing; wherefore it is Heaven's gift to thee, which shall end thy crosses and aid thee to rejoin thy folk and foregather with her thou lovest.\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"There is no help but it must be shared between me and thee.\" Then he carried him to the underground-chamber and showed him the gold, which was in twenty jars: he took ten and the gardener ten, and the old man said to him, \"O my son, fill thyself leather bottles[FN#331] with the sparrow-olives[FN#332] which grow in this garden, for they are not found except in our land; and the merchants carry them to all parts. Lay the gold in the bottles and strew it over with olives: then stop them and cover them and take them with thee in the ship.\" So Kamar al-Zaman arose without stay or delay and took fifty leather bottles and stored in each somewhat of the gold, and closed each one after placing a layer of olives over the gold; and at the bottom of one of the bottles he laid the talisman. Then sat he down to talk with the gardener, confident of speedy reunion with his own people and saying to himself, \"When I come to the Ebony Islands I will journey thence to my father's country and enquire for my beloved Budur. Would to Heaven I knew whether she returned to her own land or journeyed on to my father's country or whether there befel her any accident by the way.\" And he began versifying,\n\n\"Love in my breast they lit and fared away, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And far the land wherein my love is pent:\nFar lies the camp and those who camp therein; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Par is her tent-shrine, where I ne'er shall tent.\nPatience far deaf me when from me they fled; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Sleep failed mine eyes, endurance was forspent:\nThey left and with them left my every joy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Wending with them, nor find I peace that went:\nThey made these eyes roll down love tears in flood, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lacking them these eyne with tears are drent.\nWhen my taste spins once again would see them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When pine and expectation but augment,\nIn my heart's core their counterfeits I trace, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With love and yearning to behold their grace.\"\n\nThen, while he awaited the end of the term of days, he told the gardener the tale of the birds and what had passed between them; whereat the hearer wondered; and they both lay down and slept till the morning. The gardener awoke sick and abode thus two days; but on the third day, his sickness increased on him, till they despaired of his life and Kamar al-Zaman grieved with sore grief for him. Meanwhile behold, the Master and his crew came and enquired for the gardener; and, when Kamar al-Zaman told them that he was sick, they asked, \"Where be the youth who is minded to go with us to the Ebony Islands?\" \"He is your servent and he standeth before you!\" answered the Prince and bade them carry the bottles of olives to the ship; so they transported them, saying, \"Make haste, thou, for the wind is fair;\" and he replied, \"I hear and obey.\" Then he carried his provaunt on board and, returning to bid the gardener farewell, found him in the agonies of death; so he sat down at his head and closed his eyes, and his soul departed his body; whereupon he laid him out and committed him to the earth unto the mercy of Allah Almighty. Then he made for the ship but found that she had already weighed anchor and set sail; nor did she cease to cleave the seas till she disappeared from his sight. So he went back to whence he came heavy-hearted with whirling head; and neither would he address a soul nor return a reply; and reaching the garden and sitting down in cark and care he threw dust on his head and buffeted his cheeks.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fifteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship sped on her course, Kamar al-Zaman returned to the garden in cark and care; but- anon he rented the place of its owner and hired a man to help him in irrigating the trees. Moreover, he repaired the trap-door and he went to the underground chamber and bringing the rest of the gold to grass, stowed it in other fifty bottles which he filled up with a layer of olives. Then he enquired of the ship and they told him that it sailed but once a year, at which his trouble of mind redoubled and he cried sore for that which had betided him, above all for the loss of the Princess Budur's talisman, and spent his nights and days weeping and repealing verses. Such was his case; but as regards the ship she sailed with a favouring wind till she reached the Ebony Islands. Now by decree of destiny, Queen Budur was sitting at a lattice-window overlooking the sea and saw the galley cast anchor upon the strand. At this sight, her heart throbbed and she took horse with the Chamberlains and Nabobs and, riding down to the shore, halted by the ship, whilst the sailors broke bulk and bore the bales to the storehouses; after which she called the captain to her presence and asked what he had with him. He answered \"O King, I have with me in this ship aromatic drugs and cosmetics and healing powders and ointments and plasters and precious metals and rich stuffs and rugs of Yemen leather, not to be borne of mule or camel, and all manner of otters and spices and perfumes, civet and ambergris and camphor and Sumatra aloes-wood, and tamerinds[FN#333] and sparrow-olives to boot, such as are rare to find in this country.\" When she heard talk of sparrow- olives her heart longed for them and she said to the ship-master, \"How much of olives hast thou?\" He replied, \"Fifty bottles full, but their owner is not with us, so the King shall take what he will of them.\" Quoth she, \"Bring them ashore, that I may see them.'' Thereupon he called to the sailors, who brought her the fifty bottles; and she opened one and, looking at the olives, said to the captain, \"I will take the whole fifty and pay you their value, whatso it be.\" He answered, \"By Allah, O my lord, they have no value in our country; moreover their shipper tarried behind us, and he is a poor man.\" Asked she, \"And what are they worth here?\" and he answered \"A thousand dirhams.\" \"I will take them at a thousand,\" she said and bade them carry the fifty bottles to the palace. When it was night, she called for a bottle of olives and opened it, there being none in the room but herself and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then, placing a dish before her she turned into it the contents of the jar, when there fell out into the dish with the olives a heap of red gold; and she said to the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, \"This is naught but gold!\" So she sent for the rest of the bottles and found them all full of precious metal and scarce enough olives to fill a single jar. Moreover, she sought among the gold and found therein the talisman, which she took and examined and behold, it was that which Kamar al- Zaman had taken from off the band of her petticoat trousers. Thereupon she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Sixteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Budur saw the talisman she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon; and when she recovered she said to herself, \"Verily, this talisman was the cause of my separation from my beloved Kamar al-Zaman; but now it is an omen of good.\" Then she showed it to Hayat al-Nufus and said to her, \"This was the cause of disunion and now, please Allah, it shall be the cause of reunion.\" As soon as day dawned she seated herself on the royal throne and sent for the ship-master, who came into the presence and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, \"Where didst thou leave the owner of these olives?\" Quoth he, \"O King of the age, we left him in the land of the Magians and he is a gardener there.\" She rejoined, \"Except thou bring him to me, thou knowest not the harm which awaiteth thee and thy ship.\" Then she bade them seal up the magazines of the merchants and said to them, \"Verily the owner of these olives hath borrowed of me and I have a claim upon him for debt and, unless ye bring him to me, I will without fail do you all die and seize your goods.\" So they went to the captain and promised him the hire of the ship, if he would go and return a second time, saying, \"Deliver us from this masterful tyrant.\" Accordingly the skipper embarked and set sail and Allah decreed him a prosperous voyage, till he came to the Island of the Magians and, landing by night, went up to the garden. Now the night was long upon Kamar al-Zaman, and he sat, bethinking him of his beloved, and bewailing what had befallen him and versifying,\n\n\"A night whose stars refused to run their course, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     A night of those which never seem outworn:\nLike Resurrection-day, of longsome length[FN#334] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To him that watched and waited for the morn.\"\n\nNow at this moment, the captain knocked at the garden-gate, and Kamar al-Zaman opened and went out to him, whereupon the crew seized him and went down with him on board the ship and set sail forthright; and they ceased not voyaging days and nights, whilst Kamar al-Zaman knew not why they dealt thus with him; but when he questioned them they replied, \"Thou hast offended against the Lord of the Ebony Islands, the son-in-law of King Armanus, and thou hast stolen his monies, miserable that thou art!\" Said he, \"By Allah! I never entered that country nor do I know where it is!\" However, they fared on with him, till they made the Ebony Islands and landing, carried him up to the Lady Budur, who knew him at sight and said, \"Leave him with the eunuchs, that they may take him to the bath.\" Then she relieved the merchants of the embargo and gave the captain a robe of honour worth ten thousand pieces of gold; and, after returning to the palace, she went in that night to the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and told her what had passed, saying, \"Keep thou my counsel, till I accomplish my purpose, and do a deed which shall be recorded and shall be read by Kings and commoners after we be dead and gone.\" And when she gave orders that they bear Kamar al-Zaman to the bath, they did so and clad him in a royal habit so that, when he came forth, he resembled a willow-bough or a star which shamed the greater and lesser light[FN#335] and its glow, and his life and soul returned to his frame. Then he repaired to the palace and went in to the Princess Budur; and when she saw him she schooled her heart to patience, till she should have accomplished her purpose; and she bestowed on him Mamelukes and eunuchs, camels and mules. Moreover, she gave him a treasury of money and she ceased not advancing him from dignity to dignity, till she made him Lord High Treasurer and committed to his charge all the treasures of the state; and she admitted him to familiar favour and acquainted the Emirs with his rank and dignity. And all loved him, for Queen Budur did not cease day by day to increase his allowances. As for Kamar al-Zaman, he was at a loss anent the reason of her thus honouring him; and he gave gifts and largesse out of the abundance of the wealth; and he devoted himself to the service of King Armanus; so that the King and all the Emirs and people, great and small, adored him and were wont to swear by his life. Nevertheless, he ever marvelled at the honour and favour shown him by Queen Budur and said to himself, \"By Allah, there needs must be a reason for this affection! Peradventure, this King favoureth me not with these immoderate favours save for some ill purpose and, therefore, there is no help but that I crave leave of him to depart his realm.\" So he went in to Queen Budur and said to her, \"O King, thou hast overwhelmed me with favours, but it will fulfil the measure of thy bounties if thou take from me all thou hast been pleased to bestow upon me, and permit me to depart.\" She smiled and asked, \"What maketh thee seek to depart and plunge into new perils, whenas thou art in the enjoyment of the highest favour and greatest prosperity?\" Answered Kamar al- Zaman, \"O King, verily this favour, if there be no reason for it, is indeed a wonder of wonders, more by token that thou hast advanced me to dignities such as befit men of age and experience, albeit I am as it were a young child.\" And Queen Budur rejoined, \"The reason is that I love thee for shine exceeding loveliness and thy surpassing beauty; and if thou wilt but grant me my desire of thy body, I will advance thee yet farther in honour and favour and largesse; and I will make thee Wazir, for all thy tender age even as the folk made me Sultan over them and I no older than thou; so that nowadays there is nothing strange when children take the head and by Allah, he was a gifted man who said,\n\n'It seems as though of Lot's tribe were our days, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And crave with love to advance the young in years.'\"[FN#336]\n\nWhen Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was abashed and his cheeks flushed till they seemed a-flame; and he said, \"I need not these favours which lead to the commission of sin; I will live poor in wealth but wealthy in virtue and honour.\" Quoth she, \"I am not to be duped by thy scruples, arising from prudery and coquettish ways; and Allah bless him who saith,\n\n'To him I spake of coupling, but he said to me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    How long this noyous long persistency?'\nBut when gold piece I showed him, he cried, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   'Who from the Almighty Sovereign e'er shall flee?'\"\n\nNow when Kamar al-Zaman, heard these words and understood her verses and their import, he said, \"O King, I have not the habit of these doings, nor have I strength to bear these heavy burthens for which elder than I have proved unable; then how will it be with my tender age?\" But she smiled at his speech and retorted, \"Indeed, it is a matter right marvellous how error springeth from the disorder of man's intendiment!! Since thou art a boy, why standest thou in fear of sin or the doing of things forbidden, seeing that thou art not yet come to years of canonical responsibility; and the offences of a child incur neither punishment nor reproof? Verily, thou hast committed thyself to a quibble for the sake of contention, and it is thy duty to bow before a proposal of fruition, so henceforward cease from denial and coyness, for the commandment of Allah is a decree foreordained:[FN#337] indeed, I have more reason than thou to fear falling and by sin to be misled; and well inspired was he who said,\n\n'My prickle is big and the little one said, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Thrust boldly in vitals with lion-like stroke!\nThen I, ' 'Tis a sin!; and he, 'No sin to me! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   So I had him at once with a counterfeit poke.\"[FN#338]\n\nWhen Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, the light became darkness in his sight and he said, \"O King, thou hast in thy household fair women and female slaves, who have not their like in this age: shall not these suffice thee without me?

So he rose up with her, on this condition, and went with her to her own boudoir, that she might quench the lowe of her lust, saying, \"There is no Majesty, and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the fated decree of the All- powerful, the All-wise!\"; and he doffed his bag-trousers, shamefull and abashed, with the tears running from his eyes for stress of affright. Thereat she smiled and making him mount upon a couch with her, said to him, \"After this night, thou shalt see naught that will offend thee.\" Then she turned to him bussing and bosoming him and bending calf over calf, and said to him, \"Put thy hand between my thighs to the accustomed place; so haply it may stand up to prayer after prostration.\" He wept and cried, \"I am not good at aught of this,\" but she said, \"By my life, an thou do as I bid thee, it shall profit thee!\" So he put out his hand, with vitals a-fire for confusion, and found her thighs cooler than cream and softer than silk. The touching of them pleasured him and he moved his hand hither and thither, till it came to a dome abounding in good gifts and movements and shifts, and said in himself, \"Perhaps this King is a hermaphrodite,[FN#348] neither man nor woman quite;\" so he said to her, \"O King, I cannot find that thou hast a tool like the tools of men; what then moved thee to do this deed?\" Then loudly laughed Queen Budur till she fell on her back,[FN#349] and said, \"O my dearling, how quickly thou hast forgotten the nights we have lain together!\" Then she made herself known to him, and he knew her for his wife, the Lady Budur, daughter of King al-Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas. So he embraced her and she embraced him, and he kissed her and she kissed him; then they lay down on the bed of pleasure voluptuous, repeating the words of the poet,\n\n\"When his softly bending shape bid him close to my embrace *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which clips him all about like the tendrils of the vine\nAnd shed a flood of softness on the hardness of his heart, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     He yielded though at first he was minded to decline;\nAnd dreading lest the railer's eye should light upon his form, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Came armoured with caution to baffle his design:\nHis waist makes moan of hinder cheeks that weigh upon his feet *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Like heavy load of merchandise upon young camel li'en;\nGirt with his glances scymitar which seemed athirst for blood, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And clad in mail of dusky curls that show the sheeniest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     shine,\nHis fragrance wafted happy news of footstep coming nigh, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to him like a bird uncaged I flew in straightest line:\nI spread my cheek upon his path, beneath his sandal-shoon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lo! the stibium[FN#350] of their dust healed all my hurt\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     of eyne.\nWith one embrace again I bound the banner of our loves[FN#351] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And loosed the knot of my delight that bound in bonds\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    malign:\nThen bade I make high festival, and straight came flocking in *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Pure joys that know not grizzled age[FN#352] nor aught of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     pain and pine:\nThe full moon dotted with the stars the lips and pearly teeth *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That dance right joyously upon the bubbling face of wine:\nSo in the prayer-niche of their joys I yielded me to what *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would make the humblest penitent of sinner most indign.\nI swear by all the signs[FN#353] of those glories in his face *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I'll ne'er forget the Chapter entituled Al-Ikhlas.\"[FN#354]\n\nThen Queen Budur told Kamar al-Zaman all that had befallen her from beginning to end and he did likewise; after which he began to upbraid her, saying, \"What moved thee to deal with me as thou hast done this night?\" She replied, \"Pardon me! for I did this by way of jest, and that pleasure and gladness might be increased.\" And when dawned the morn and day arose with its sheen and shone, she sent to King Armanus, sire of the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, and acquainted him with the truth of the case and that she was wife to Kamar al-Zaman. Moreover, she told him their tale and the cause of their separation, and how his daughter was a virgin, pure as when she was born. He marvelled at their story with exceeding marvel and bade them chronicle it in letters of gold. Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, \"O King's son, art thou minded to become my son-in-law by marrying my daughter?\" Replied he, \"I must consult the Queen Budur, as she hath a claim upon me for benefits without stint.\" And when he took counsel with her, she said, \"Right is thy recking; marry her and I will be her handmaid; for I am her debtor for kindness and favour and good offices, and obligations manifold, especially as we are here in her place and as the King her father hath whelmed us with benefits.\"[FN#355] Now when he saw that she inclined to this and was not jealous of Hayat al-Nufus, he agreed with her upon this matter.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Seventeenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman agreed with his wife, Queen Budur, upon this matter and told King Armanus what she had said; whereat he rejoiced with great joy. Then he went out and, seating himself upon his chair of estate, assembled all the Wazirs, Emirs, Chamberlains and Grandees, to whom he related the whole story of Kamar al-Zaman and his wife, Queen Budur, from first to last; and acquainted them with his desire to marry his daughter Hayat al-Nufus to the Prince and make him King in the stead of Queen Budur. Whereupon said they all, \"Since he is the husband of Queen Budur, who hath been our King till now, whilst we deemed her son-in-law to King Armanus, we are all content to have him to Sultan over us; and we will be his servants, nor will we swerve from his allegiance.\" So Armanus rejoiced hereat and, summoning Kazis and witnesses and the chief officers of state, bade draw up the contract of marriage between Kamar al-Zaman and his daughter, the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then he held high festival, giving sumptuous marriage-feasts and bestowing costly dresses of honour upon all the Emirs and Captains of the host; moreover he distributed alms to the poor and needy and set free all the prisoners. The whole world rejoiced in the coming of Kamar al-Zaman to the throne, blessing him and wishing him endurance of glory and prosperity, renown and felicity; and, as soon as he became King, he remitted the customs-dues and released all men who remained in gaol. Thus he abode a long while, ordering himself worthily towards his lieges; and he lived with his two wives in peace, happiness, constancy and content, lying the night with each of them in turn. He ceased not after this fashion during many years, for indeed all his troubles and afflictions were blotted out from him and he forgot his father King Shahriman and his former estate of honour and favour with him. After a while Almighty Allah blessed him with two boy children, as they were two shining moons, through his two wives; the elder whose name was Prince Amjad,[FN#356] by Queen Budur, and the younger whose name was Prince As'ad by Queen Hayat al-Nufus; and this one was comelier than his brother. They were reared in splendour and tender affection, in respectful bearing and in the perfection of training; and they were instructed in penmanship and science and the arts of government and horsemanship, till they attained the extreme accomplishments and the utmost limit of beauty and loveliness; both men and women being ravished by their charms. They grew up side by side till they reached the age of seventeen, eating and drinking together and sleeping in one bed, nor ever parting at any time or tide; wherefore all the people envied them. Now when they came to man's estate and were endowed with every perfection, their father was wont, as often as he went on a journey, to make them sit in his stead by turns in the hall of judgement; and each did justice among the folk one day at a time. But it came to pass, by confirmed fate and determined lot, that love for As'ad (son of Queen Hayat al-Nufus) rose in the heart of Queen Budur, and that affection for Amjad (son of Queen Budur) rose in the heart of Queen Hayat al-Nufus.[FN#357] Hence it was that each of the women used to sport and play with the son of her sister-wife, kissing him and straining him to her bosom, whilst each mother thought that the other's behaviour arose but from maternal affection. On this wise passion got the mastery of the two women's hearts and they became madly in love with the two youths, so that when the other's son came in to either of them, she would press him to her breast and long for him never to be parted from her; till, at last, when waiting grew longsome to them and they found no path to enjoyment, they refused meat and drink and banished the solace of sleep. Presently, the King fared forth to course and chase, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day in turn as was their wont.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eighteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King fared forth to sport and hunt, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day by turn, as was their wont. Now Prince Amjad sat in judgement the first day, bidding and forbidding, appointing and deposing, giving and refusing; and Queen Hayat al-Nufus, mother of As'ad, wrote to him a letter suing for his favour and discovering to him her passion and devotion; altogether put tiny off the mask and giving him to know that she desired to enjoy him. So she took a scroll and thereon indited these cadences, \"From the love deranged * the sorrowful and estranged * whose torment is prolonged for the longing of thee! * Were I to recount to thee the extent of my care * and what of sadness I bear * the passion which my heart cloth tear * and all that I endure for weeping and unrest * and the rending of my sorrowful breast * my unremitting grief * and my woe without relief * and all my suffering for severance of thee * and sadness and love's ardency * no letter could contain it; nor calculation could compass it * Indeed earth and heaven upon me are strait; and I have no hope and no trust but what from thee I await * Upon death I am come nigh * and the horrors of dissolution I aby * Burning upon me is sore * with parting pangs and estrangement galore * Were I to set forth the yearnings that possess me more and more * no scrolls would suffice to hold such store * and of the excess of my pain and pine, I have made the following lines:- -\n\nWere I to dwell on heart-consuming heat, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unease and transports in my spins meet,\nNothing were left of ink and reeden pen *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor aught of paper; no, not e'en a sheet.\n\nThen Queen Hayat al-Nufus wrapped up her letter in a niece of costly silk scented with musk and ambergris; and folded it up with her silken hair-strings[FN#358] whose cost swallowed down treasures laid it in a handkerchief and gave it to a eunuch bidding him bear it to Prince Amjad.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Nineteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that she gave her missive to the eunuch in waiting and bade him bear it to Prince Amjad. And that eunuch went forth ignoring what the future hid for him (for the Omniscient ordereth events even as He willeth); and, going in to the Prince, kissed the ground between his hands and handed to him the letter. On receiving the kerchief he opened it and, reading the epistle and recognizing its gist he was ware that his father's wife was essentially an adulteress and a traitress at heart to her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman. So he waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and railed at women and their works, saying, \"Allah curse women, the traitresses, the imperfect in reason and religion!\"[FN#359] Then he drew his sword and said to the eunuch, \"Out on thee, thou wicked slave! Dost thou carry messages of disloyalty for thy lord's wife? By Allah, there is no good in thee, O black of hue and heart, O foul of face and Nature's forming!\" So he smote him on the neck and severed his head from his body; then, folding the kerchief over its contents he thrust it into his breast pocket and went in to his own mother and told her what had passed, reviling and reproaching her, and saying, \"Each one of you is viler than the other; and, by Allah the Great and Glorious, did I not fear ill-manneredly to transgress against the rights of my father, Kamar al-Zaman, and my brother, Prince As'ad, I would assuredly go in to her and cut off her head, even as I cut off that of her eunuch!\" Then he went forth from his mother in a mighty rage; and when the news reached Queen Hayat al-Nufus of what he had done with her eunuch, she abused him[FN#360] and cursed him and plotted perfidy against him. He passed the night, sick with rage, wrath and concern; nor found he pleasure in meat, drink or sleep. And when the next morning dawned Prince As'ad fared forth in his turn to rule the folk in his father's stead, whilst his mother, Hayat al-Nufus, awoke in feeble plight because of what she had heard from Prince Amjad concerning the slaughter of her eunuch. So Prince As'ad sat in the audience-chamber that day, judging and administering justice, appointing and deposing, bidding and forbidding, giving and bestowing. And he ceased not thus till near the time of afternoon-prayer, when Queen Budur sent for a crafty old woman and, discovering to her what was in her heart, wrote a letter to Prince As'ad, complaining of the excess of her affection and desire for him in these cadenced lines, \"From her who perisheth for passion and love-forlorn * to him who in nature and culture is goodliest born * to him who is conceited of his own loveliness * and glories in his amorous grace * who from those that seek to enjoy him averteth his face * and refuseth to show favour unto the self abasing and base * him who is cruel and of disdainful mood * from the lover despairing of good * to Prince As'ad * with passing beauty endowed * and of excelling grace proud * of the face moon bright * and the brow flower-white * and dazzling splendid light * This is my letter to him whose love melteth my body * and rendeth my skin and bones! * Know that my patience faileth me quite * and I am perplexed in my plight * longing and restlessness weary me * and sleep and patience deny themselves to me * but mourning and watching stick fast to me * and desire and passion torment me * and the extremes of languor and sickness have sheet me * Yet may my life be a ransom for thee * albeit thy pleasure be to slay her who loveth thee * and Allah prolong the life of thee * and preserve thee from all infirmity!\" And after these cadences she wrote these couplets,\n\n\"Fate hath commanded I become thy fere, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O shining like full moon when clearest clear!\nAll beauty dost embrace, all eloquence; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Brighter than aught within our worldly sphere:\nContent am I my torturer thou be: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply shalt alms me with one lovely leer!\nHappy her death who dieth for thy love! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     No good in her who holdeth thee unclear!\"\n\nAnd also the following couplets,\n\n\"Unto thee, As'ad! I of passion-pangs complain; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Have ruth on slave of love so burnt with flaming pain:\nHow long, I ask, shall hands of Love disport with me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With longings, dolour, sleepliness and bale and bane?\nAnon I 'plain of sea in heart, anon of fire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In vitals, O strange case, dear wish, my fairest fain!\nO blamer, cease thy blame, and seek thyself to fly *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From love, which makes these eyne a rill of tears to rain.\nHow oft I cry for absence and desire, Ah grief! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But all my crying naught of gain for me shall gain:\nThy rigours dealt me sickness passing power to bear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thou art my only leach, assain me an thou deign!\nO chider, chide me not in caution, for I doubt *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That plaguey Love to thee shall also deal a bout.\"\n\nThen Queen Budur perfumed the letter-paper with a profusion of odoriferous musk and, winding it in her hairstrings which were of Iraki silk, with pendants of oblong emeralds, set with pearls and stones of price, delivered it to the old woman, bidding her carry it to Prince As'ad.[FN#361] She did so in order to pleasure her, and going in to the Prince, straightway and without stay, found him in his own rooms and delivered to him the letter in privacy; after which she stood waiting an hour or so for the answer. When As'ad had read the paper and knew its purport, he wrapped it up again in the ribbons and put it in his bosom-pocket: then (for he was wrath beyond all measure of wrath) he cursed false women and sprang up and drawing his sword, smote the old trot on the neck and cut off her pate. Thereupon he went in to his mother, Queen Hayat al-Nufus, whom he found lying on her bed in feeble case, for that which had betided her with Prince Amjad, and railed at her and cursed her; after which he left her and fore-gathered with his brother, to whom he related all that had befallen him with Queen Budur, adding, \"By Allah, O my brother, but that I was ashamed before thee, I had gone in to her forthright and had smitten her head off her shoulders!\" Replied Prince Amjad, \"By Allah, O my brother, yesterday when I was sitting upon the seat of judgement, the like of what hath befallen thee this day befel me also with thy mother who sent me a letter of similar purport.\" And he told him all that had passed, adding, \"By Allah, O my brother, naught but respect for thee withheld me from going in to her and dealing with her even as I dealt with the eunuch!\" They passed the rest of the night conversing and cursing womankind, and agreed to keep the matter secret, lest their father should hear of it and kill the two women. Yet they ceased not to suffer trouble and foresee affliction. And when the morrow dawned, the King returned with his suite from hunting and sat awhile in his chair of estate; after which he sent the Emirs about their business and went up to his palace, where he found his two wives lying a-bed and both exceeding sick and weak. Now they had made a plot against their two sons and concerted to do away their lives, for that they had exposed themselves before them and feared to be at their mercy and dependent upon their forbearance. When Kamar al-Zaman saw them on this wise, he said to them, \"What aileth you?\" Whereupon they rose to him and kissing his hands answered, perverting the case and saying \"Know, O King, that thy two sons, who have been reared in thy bounty, have played thee false and have dishonoured thee in the persons of thy wives.\" Now when he heard this, the light became darkness in his sight, and he raged with such wrath that his reason fled: then said he to them, \"Explain me this matter.\" Replied Queen Budur, \"O King of the age, know that these many days past thy son As'ad hath been in the persistent habit of sending me letters and messages to solicit me to lewdness and adultery while I still forbade him from this, but he would not be forbidden; and, when thou wentest forth to hunt, he rushed in on me, drunk and with a drawn sword in his hand, and smiting my eunuch, slew him. Then he mounted on my breast, still holding the sword, and I feared lest he should slay me, if I gainsaid him, even as he had slain my eunuch; so he took his wicked will of me by force. And now if thou do me not justice on him, O King, I will slay myself with my own hand, for I have no need of life in the world after this foul deed.\" And Queen Hayat al-Nufus, choking with tears, told him respecting Prince Amjad a story like that of her sister-wife.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twentieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Queen Hayat al-Nufus told her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman, a story like that of her sister in wedlock, Budur, and, quoth she, \"The same thing befel me with thy son Amjad;\" after which she took to weeping and wailing and said, \"Except thou do me justice on him I will tell my father, King Armanus.\" Then both women wept with sore weeping before King Kamar al-Zaman who, when he saw their tears and heard their words, concluded that their story was true and, waxing wroth beyond measure of wrath, went forth thinking to fall upon his two sons and put them to death. On his way he met his father- in-law, King Armanus who, hearing of his return from the chase, had come to salute him at that very hour and, seeing him with naked brand in hand and blood dripping from his nostrils, for excess of rage, asked what ailed him. So Kamar al-Zaman told him all that his sons Amjad and As'ad had done and added, \"And here I am now going in to them to slay them in the foulest way and make of them the most shameful of examples.\" Quoth King Armanus (and indeed he too was wroth with them), \"Thou dost well, O my son, and may Allah not bless them nor any sons that do such deed against their father's honour. But, O my son, the sayer of the old saw saith, 'Whoso looketh not to the end hath not Fortune to friend.' In any case, they are thy sons, and it befitteth not that thou kill them with shine own hand, lest thou drink of their death-agony,[FN#362] and anon repent of having slain them whenas repentance availeth thee naught. Rather do thou send them with one of thy Mamelukes into the desert and let him kill them there out of thy sight, for, as saith the adage, 'Out of sight of my friend is better and pleasanter.'[FN#363] And when Kamar al-Zaman heard his father-in-law's words, he knew them to be just; so he sheathed his sword and turning back, sat down upon the throne of his realm. There he summoned his treasurer, a very old man, versed in affairs and in fortune's vicissitudes, to whom he said, \"Go in to my sons, Amjad and As'ad; bind their hands behind them with strong bonds, lay them in two chests and load them upon a mule. Then take horse thou and carry them into mid desert, where do thou kill them both and fill two vials with their blood and bring the same to me in haste.\" Replied the treasurer, \"I hear and I obey,\" and he rose up hurriedly and went out forthright to seek the Princes; and, on his road, he met them coming out of the palace-vestibule, for they had donned their best clothes and their richest; and they were on their way to salute their sire and give him joy of his safe return from his going forth to hunt. Now when he saw them, he laid hands on them, saying, \"Omy sons, know ye that I am but a slave commanded, and that your father hath laid a commandment on me; will ye obey his commandment?\" They said, \"Yes\"; whereupon he went up to them and, after pinioning their arms, laid them in the chests which he loaded on the back of a mule he had taken from the city. And he ceased not carrying them into the open country till near noon, when he halted in a waste and desolate place and, dismounting from his mare, let down the two chests from the mule's back. Then he opened them and took out Amjad and As'ad; and when he looked upon them he wept sore for their beauty and loveliness; then drawing his sword he said to them, \"By Allah, O my lords, indeed it is hard for me to deal so evilly by you; but I am to be excused in this matter, being but a slave commanded, for that your father King Kamar al-Zaman hath bidden me strike off your heads.\" They replied, \"O Emir, do the King's bidding, for we bear with patience that which Allah (to Whom be Honour, Might and Glory!) hath decreed to us; and thou art quit of our blood.\" Then they embraced and bade each other farewell, and As'ad said to the treasurer, \"Allah upon thee, O uncle, spare me the sight of my brother's death-agony and make me not drink of his anguish, but kill me first, for that were the easier for me.\" And Amjad said the like and entreated the treasurer to kill him before As'ad, saying, \"My brother is younger than I; so make me not taste of his anguish. And they both wept bitter tears whilst the treasurer wept for their weeping;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the treasurer wept for their weeping; then the two brothers embraced and bade farewell and one said to the other, \"All this cometh of the malice of those traitresses, my mother and thy mother; and this is the reward of my forbearance towards thy mother and of thy for bearance towards my mother! But there is no Might and there is no Majesty save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily, we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning.\"[FN#364] And As'ad em braced his brother, sobbing and repeating these couplets,\n\n\"O Thou to whom sad trembling wights in fear complain! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   O ever ready whatso cometh to sustain!\nThe sole resource for me is at Thy door to knock, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   At whose door knock an Thou to open wilt not deign?\nO Thou whose grace is treasured in the one word, Be![FN#365] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Favour me, I beseech, in Thee all weals contain.\"\n\nNow when Amjad heard his brother's weeping he wept also and pressing him to his bosom repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"O Thou whose boons to me are more than one! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose gifts and favours have nor count nor bound!\nNo stroke of all Fate's strokes e'er fell on me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Thee to take me by the hand I found.\"\nThen said Amjad to the treasurer, \"I conjure thee by the One, Omnipotent, the Lord of Mercy, the Beneficent! slay me before my brother As'ad, so haply shall the fire be quencht in my heart's core and in this life burn no more.\" But As'ad wept and exclaimed, \"Not so: I will die first;\" whereupon quoth Amjad, \"It were best that I embrace thee and thou embrace me, so the sword may fall upon us and slay us both at a single stroke.\" Thereupon they embraced, face to face and clung to each other straitly, whilst the treasurer tied up the twain and bound them fast with cords, weeping the while. Then he drew his blade and said to them, \"By Allah, O my lords, it is indeed hard to me to slay you! But have ye no last wishes that I may fulfil or charges which I may carry out, or message which I may deliver?\" Replied Amjad, \"We have no wish; and my only charge to thee is that thou set my brother below and me above him, that the blow may fall on me first, and when thou hast killed us and returnest to the King and he asketh thee, 'What heardest thou from them before their death?'; do thou answer, 'Verily thy sons salute thee and say to thee, Thou knewest not if we were innocent or guilty, yet hast thou put us to death and hast not certified thyself of our sin nor looked into our case.' Then do thou repeat to him these two couplets,\n\n'Women are Satans made for woe o' men; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I fly to Allah from their devilish scathe:\nSource of whatever bale befel our kind, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    In wordly matters and in things of Faith.'\"\n\nContinued Amjad, \"We desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was ad the Two Hundred and Twenty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad added, speaking to the treasurer, \"We desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets which thou hast just now heard; and I conjure thee by Allah to have patience with us, whilst I cite to my brother this other pair of couplets.\" Then he wept with sore weeping and began,\n\n\"The Kings who fared before us showed *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Of instances full many a show:\nOf great and small and high and low *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     How many this one road have trod!\"\n\nNow when the treasurer heard these words from Amjad, he wept till his beard was wet, whilst As'ad's eyes brimmed with tears and he in turn repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Fate frights us when the thing is past and gone; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Weeping is not for form or face alone[FN#366]:\nWhat ails the Nights?[FN#367] Allah blot out our sin, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And be the Nights by other hand undone!\nEre this Zubayr-son[FN#368] felt their spiteful hate, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who fled for refuge to the House and Stone:\nWould that when Kh\u00e1rijah was for Amru slain[FN#369] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     They had ransomed Ali with all men they own.\"\n\nThen, with cheeks stained by tears down railing he recited also these verses,\n\n\"In sooth the Nights and Days are charactered *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    By traitor falsehood and as knaves they lie;\nThe Desert-reek[FN#370] recalls their teeth that shine; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    All horrid blackness is their K of eye:\nMy sin anent the world which I abhor *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Is sin of sword when sworders fighting hie.\"\n\nThen his sobs waxed louder and he said,\n\n\"O thou who woo'st a World[FN#371] unworthy, learn *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'Tis house of evils, 'tis Perdition's net:\nA house where whoso laughs this day shall weep *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    The next: then perish house of fume and fret!\nEndless its frays and forays, and its thralls *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Are ne'er redeemed, while endless risks beset.\nHow many gloried in its pomps and pride, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Till proud and pompous did all bounds forget,\nThen showing back of shield she made them swill[FN#372] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Full draught, and claimed all her vengeance debt.\nFor know her strokes fall swift and sure, altho' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Long bide she and forslow the course of Fate:\nSo look thou to thy days lest life go by *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Idly, and meet thou more than thou hast met;\nAnd cut all chains of world-love and desire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And save thy soul and rise to secrets higher.\"\n\nNow when As'ad made an end of these verses, he strained his brother Amjad in his arms, till they twain were one body, and the treasurer, drawing his sword, was about to strike them, when behold, his steed took fright at the wind of his upraised hand, and breaking its tether, fled into the desert. Now the horse had cost a thousand gold pieces and on its back was a splendid saddle worth much money; so the treasurer threw down his sword, and ran after his beast.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when his horse ran away, the treasurer ran after it in huge concern, and ceased not running to catch the runaway till it entered a thicket. He followed it whilst it dashed through the wood, smiting the earth with its hoofs till it raised a dust-cloud which towered high in air; and snorting and puffing and neighing and waxing fierce and furious. Now there happened to be in this thicket a lion of terrible might; hideous to sight, with eyes sparkling light: his look was grim and his aspect struck fright into man's sprite. Presentry the treasurer turned and saw the lion making towards him; but found no way of escape nor had he his sword with him. So he said in himself, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This strait is come upon me for no other cause but because of Amjad and As'ad; and indeed this journey was unblest from the first!\" Meanwhile the two Princes were grievously oppressed by the heat and grew sore athirst, so that their tongues hung out and they cried for succour, but none came to their relief and they said, \"Would to Heaven we had been slain and were at peace from this pain! But we know not whither the horse hath fled, that the treasurer is gone and hath left us thus pinioned. If he would but come back and do us die, it were easier to us than this torture to aby.\" Said As'ad, \"O my brother, be patient, and the relief of Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) shall assuredly come to us; for the horse started not away save of His favour towards us, and naught irketh us but this thirst.\" Upon this he stretched and shook himself and strained right and left, till he burst his pinion-bonds; then he rose and unbound his brother and catching up the Emir's sword, said, \"By Allah, we will not go hence, till we look after him and learn what is become of him.\" Then they took to following on the trail till it led them to the thicket and they said to each other, \"Of a surety, the horse and the treasurer have not passed out of this wood.\" Quoth As'ad, \"Stay thou here, whilst I enter the thicket and search it;\" and Amjad replied, \"I will not let thee go in alone: nor will we enter it but together; so if we escape, we shall escape together and if we perish, we shall perish together.\" Accordingly both entered and found that the lion had sprang upon the treasurer, who lay like a sparrow in his grip, calling upon Allah for aid and signing with his hands to Heaven. Now when Amjad saw this, he took the sword and, rushing upon the lion, smote him between the eyes and laid him dead on the ground. The Emir sprang up, marvelling at this escape and seeing Amjad and As'ad, his master's sons, standing there, cast himself at their feet and exclaimed, \"By Allah, O my lords, it were intolerable wrong in me to do you to death. May the man never be who would kill you! Indeed, with my very life, I will ransom you.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the treasurer to Amjad and As'ad, \"With my life will I ransom you both!\" Then he hastily rose and, at once embracing them, enquired how they had loosed their bonds and come thither; whereupon they told him how the bonds of one of them had fallen loose and he had unbound the other, whereto they were helped by the purity of their intentions, and how they had tracked his trail till they came upon him. So he thanked them for their deed and went with them forth of the thicket; and, when they were in the open country, they said to him, \"O uncle, do our father's bidding.\" He replied, \"Allah forbid that I should draw near to you with hurt! But know ye that I mean to take your clothes and clothe you with mine; then will I fill two vials with the lion's blood and go back to the King and tell him I have out vou to death. But as for you two, fare ye forth into the lands, for Allah's earth is wide; and know, O my lords, that it paineth me to part from you.\" At this, they all fell a-weeping; then the two youths put off their clothes and the treasurer habited them with his own. Moreover he made two parcels of their dress and, filling two vials with the lion's blood, set the parcels before him on his horse's back. Presently he took leave of them and, making his way to the city, ceased not faring till he went in to King Kamar al-Zaman and kissed the ground between his hands. The King saw him changed in face and troubled (which arose from his adventure with the lion) and, deeming this came of the slaughter of his two sons, rejoiced and said to him, \"Hast thou done the work?\" \"Yes, O our lord,\" replied the treasurer and gave him the two parcels of clothes and the two vials full of blood. Asked the King, \"What didst thou observe in them; and did they give thee any charge?\" Answered the treasurer, \"I found them patient and resigned to what came down upon them and they said to me, 'Verily, our father is excusable; bear him our salutation and say to him, 'Thou art quit of our killing. But we charge thee repeat to him these couplets,\n\n'Verily women are devils created for us. We seek refuge with God from the artifice of the devils. They are the source of all the misfortunes that have appeared among mankind in the affairs of the world and of religion.'''[FN#373]\n\nWhen the King heard these words of the treasurer, he bowed his head earthwards, a long while and knew his sons' words to mean that they had been wrongfully put to death. Then he bethought himself of the perfidy of women and the calamities brought about by them; and he took the two parcels and opened them and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping,\u2014And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Kamar la-Zaman opened the two bundles and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping, it so came to pass that he found, in the pocket of his son As'ad's raiment, a letter in the hand of his wife enclosing her hair strings; so he opened and read it and understanding the contents knew that the Prince had been falsely accused and wrongously. Then he searched Amjad's parcel of dress and found in his pocket a letter in the handwriting of Queen Hayat al-Nufus enclosing also her hair-strings; so he opened and read it and knew that Amjad too had been wronged; whereupon he beat hand upon hand and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I have slain my sons unjustly.\" And he buffeted his face, crying out, \"Alas, my sons! Alas, my long grief!\" Then he bade them build two tombs in one house, which he styled \"House of Lamentations,\" and had graved thereon his sons' names; and he threw himself on Amjad's tomb, weeping and groaning and lamenting, and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"O moon for ever set this earth below, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose loss bewail the stars which stud the sky!\nO wand, which broken, ne'er with bend and wave *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Shall fascinate the ravisht gazer's eye;\nThese eyne for jealousy I 'reft of thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nor shall they till next life thy sight descry:\nI'm drowned in sea of tears for insomny *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Wherefore, indeed in S\u00e1hirah-stead[FN#374] I lie.\"\nThen he threw himself on As'ad's tomb, groaning and weeping and lamenting and versifying with these couplets,\n\"Indeed I longed to share unweal with thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    But Allah than my will willed otherwise:\nMy grief all blackens 'twixt mine eyes and space, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yet whitens all the blackness from mine eyes:[FN#375]\nOf tears they weep these eyne run never dry, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And ulcerous flow in vitals never dries:\nRight sore it irks me seeing thee in stead[FN#376] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Where slave with sovran for once levelled lies.\"\n\nAnd his weeping and wailing redoubled; and, after he had ended his lamentations and his verse, he forsook his friends and intimates, and denying himself to his women and his family, cut himself off from the world in the House of Lamentations, where he passed his time in weeping for his sons. Such was his case; but as regards Amjad and As'ad they fared on into the desert eating of the fruits of the earth and drinking of the remnants of the rain for a full month, till their travel brought them to a mountain of black flint[FN#377] whose further end was unknown; and here the road forked, one line lying along the midway height and the other leading to its head. They took the way trending to the top and gave not over following it five days, but saw no end to it and were overcome with weariness, being unused to walking upon the mountains or elsewhere.[FN#378] At last, despairing of coming to the last of the road, they retraced their steps and, taking the other, that led over the midway heights,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princes Amjad and As'ad returned from the path leading to the Mountain- head and took that which ran along the midway heights, and walked through all that day till nightfall, when As'ad, weary with much travel, said to Amjad, \"O my brother, I can walk no farther, for I am exceeding weak.\" Replied Amjad, \"O my brother, take courage! May be Allah will send us relief.\" So they walked on part of the night, till the darkness closed in upon them, when As'ad became weary beyond measure of weariness and cried out, \"O my brother, I am worn out and spent with walking,\" and threw himself upon the ground and wept. Amjad took him in his arms and walked on with him, bytimes sitting down to rest till break of day, when they came to the mountain-top and found there a stream of running water and by it a pomegranate-tree and a prayer-niche.[FN#379] They could hardly believe their eyes when they saw it; but, sitting down by that spring, drank of its water and ate of the fruit of that granado-tree; after which they lay on the ground and slept till sunrise, when they washed and bathed in the spring and, eating of the pomegranates, slept again till the time of mid-afternoon prayer. Then they thought to continue their journey, but As'ad could not walk, for both his feet were swollen. So they abode there three days till they were rested, after which they set out again and fared on over the mountain days and nights, tortured by and like to die of thirst, till they sighted a city gleaming afar off, at which they rejoiced and made towards it. When they drew near it, they thanked Allah (be His Name exalted!) and Amjad said to As'ad, \"O my brother, sit here, whilst I go to yonder city and see what it is and whose it is and where we are in Allah's wide world, that we may know through what lands we have passed in crossing this mountain, whose skirts had we followed, we had not reached this city in a whole year. So praised be Allah for safety!\" Replied As'ad, \"By Allah, O my brother, none shall go down into that city save myself, and may I be thy ransom! If thou leave me alone, be it only for an hour, I shall imagine a thousand things and be drowned in a torrent of anxiety on shine account, for I cannot brook shine absence from me.\" Amjad rejoined, \"Go then and tarry not. So As'ad took some gold pieces, and leaving his brother to await him, descended the mountain and ceased not faring on till he entered the city. As he threaded the streets he was met by an old man age-decrepit, whose beard flowed down upon his breast and forked in twain;[FN#380] he bore a walking-staff in his hand and was richly clad, with a great red turband on his head. When As'ad saw him, he wondered at his dress and his mien; nevertheless, he went up to him and saluting him said, \"Where be the way to the market, O my master?\" Hearing these words the Shaykh smiled in his face and replied, \"O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?\" As'ad rejoined, \"Yes, I am a stranger.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Shaykh who met As'ad smiled in his face and said to him, \"O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?\" and As'ad replied, \"Yes, I am a stranger.\" Then rejoined the old man, \"Verily, thou gladdenest our country with thy presence, O my son, and thou desolatest shine own land by reason of shine absence. What wantest thou of the market?\" Quoth As'ad, \"O uncle, I have a brother, with whom I have come from a far land and with whom I have journeyed these three months; and, when we sighted this city, I left him, who is my elder brother, upon the mountain and came hither, purposing to buy victual and what else, and return therewith to him, that we might feed thereon.\" Said the old man, \"Rejoice in all good, O my son, and know thou that to-day I give a marriage-feast, to which I have bidden many guests, and I have made ready plenty of meats, the best and most delicious that heart can desire. So if thou wilt come with me to my place, I will give thee freely all thou lackest without asking thee a price or aught else. Moreover I will teach thee the ways of this city; and, praised be Allah, O my son, that I, and none other have happened upon thee.\" \"As thou wilt,\" answered As'ad, \"do as thou art disposed, but make haste, for indeed my brother awaiteth me and his whole heart is with me.\" The old man took As'ad by the hand and carried him to a narrow lane, smiling in his face and saying, \"Glory be to Him who hath delivered thee from the people of this city!\" And he ceased not walking till he entered a spacious house, wherein was a saloon and behold, in the middle of it were forty old men, well stricken in years, collected together and forming a single ring as they sat round about a lighted fire, to which they were doing worship and prostrating themselves.[FN#381] When As'ad saw this, he was confounded and the hair of his body stood on end though he knew not what they were; and the Shaykh said to them, \"O Elders of the Fire, how blessed is this day!\" Then he called aloud, saying, \"Hello, Ghazb\u00e1n!\" Whereupon there came out to him a tall black slave of frightful aspect, grim-visaged and flat nosed as an ape who, when the old man made a sign to him, bent As'ad's arms behind his back and pinioned them; after which the Shaykh said to him, \"Let him down into the vault under the earth and there leave him and say to my slave girl Such-an-one, 'Torture him night and day and give him a cake of bread to eat morning and evening against the time come of the voyage to the Blue Sea and the Mountain of Fire, whereon we will slaughter him as a sacrifice.'\" So the black carried him out at another door and, raising a flag in the floor, discovered a flight of twenty steps leading to a chamber[FN#382] under the earth, into which he descended with him and, laying his feet in irons, gave him over to the slave girl and went away. Meanwhile, the old men said to one another, \"When the day of the Festival of the Fire cometh, we will sacrifice him on the mountain, as a propitiatory offering whereby we shall pleasure the Fire.\" Presently the damsel went down to him and beat him a grievous beating, till streams of blood flowed from his sides and he fainted; after which she set at his head a scone of bread and a cruse of brackish water and went away and left him. In the middle of the night, he revived and found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating: so he wept bitter tears; and recalling his former condition of honour and prosperity, lordship and dominion, and his separation from his sire and his exile from his native land.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when As'ad found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating he recalled his whilome condition of honour and prosperity and dominion and lordship, and he wept and groaned aloud and recited these couplets,\n\n\"Stand by the ruined stead and ask of us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor deem we dwell there as was state of us:\nThe World, that parter, hath departed us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yet soothes not hate-full hearts the fate of us:\nWith whips a cursed slave girl scourges us, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And teems her breast with rancorous hate of us:\nAllah shall haply deign to unpart our lives, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Chastise our foes, and end this strait of us.\"\n\nAnd when As'ad had spoken his poetry, he put out his hand towards his head and finding there the crust and the cruse full of brackish water he ate a bittock, just enough to keep life in him, and drank a little water, but could get no sleep till morning for the swarms of bugs[FN#383] and lice. As soon as it was day, the slave girl came down to him and changed his clothes, which were drenched with blood and stuck to him, so that his skin came off with the shirt; wherefor he shrieked aloud and cried, \"Alas!\" and said, \"O my God, if this be Thy pleasure, increase it upon me! O Lord, verily Thou art not unmindful of him that oppresseth me; do Thou then avenge me upon him!\" And he groaned and repeated the following verses,\n\n\n\"Patient, O Allah! to Thy destiny *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I bow, suffice me what Thou deign decree:\nPatient to bear Thy will, O Lord of me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Patient to burn on coals of Ghaz\u00e1-tree:\nThey wrong me, visit me with hurt and harm; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply Thy grace from them shall set me free:\nFar be's, O Lord, from thee to spare the wronger *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O Lord of Destiny my hope's in Thee!\"\n\nAnd what another saith,\n\n\"Bethink thee not of worldly state, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Leave everything to course of Fate;\nFor oft a thing that irketh thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall in content eventuate;\nAnd oft what strait is shall expand, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And what expanded is wax strait.\nAllah will do what wills His will *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So be not thou importunate!\nBut 'joy the view of coming weal *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Shall make forget past bale and bate.\"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verse, the slave-girl came down upon him with blows till he fainted again; and, throwing him a flap of bread and a gugglet of saltish water, went away and left him sad and lonely, bound in chains of iron, with the blood streaming from his sides and far from those he loved. So he wept and called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that As'ad called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed; so he wept and groaned and complained and poured forth tears in floods and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"Easy, O Fate! how long this wrong, this injury, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Robbing each morn and eve my brotherhood fro' me?\nIs't not time now thou deem this length sufficiency *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Of woes and, O thou Heart of Rock, show clemency?\nMy friends thou wrongedst when thou madst each enemy *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Mock and exult me for thy wrongs, thy tyranny:\nMy foeman's heart is solaced by the things he saw *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   In me, of strangerhood and lonely misery:\nSuffice thee not what came upon my head of dole, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Friends lost for evermore, eyes wan and pale of blee?\nBut must in prison cast so narrow there is naught *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Save hand to bite, with bitten hand for company;\nAnd tears that tempest down like goodly gift of cloud, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And longing thirst whose fires weet no satiety.\nRegretful yearnings, singulfs and unceasing sighs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Repine, remembrance and pain's very ecstacy:\nDesire I suffer sore and melancholy deep, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And I must bide a prey to endless phrenesy:\nI find me ne'er a friend who looks with piteous eye, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And seeks my presence to allay my misery:\nSay, liveth any intimate with trusty love *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Who for mine ills will groan, my sleepless malady?\nTo whom moan I can make and, peradventure, he *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall pity eyes that sight of sleep can never see?\nThe flea and bug suck up my blood, as wight that drinks *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Wine from the proffering hand of fair virginity:\nAmid the lice my body aye remindeth me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of orphan's good in K\u00e1zi's claw of villainy:\nMy home's a sepulchre that measures cubits three, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Where pass I morn and eve in chained agony:\nMy wines are tears, my clank of chains takes music's stead, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cares my dessert of fruit and sorrows are my bed.\"\n\nAnd when he had versed his verse and had prosed his prose, he again groaned and complained and remembered he had been and how he had been parted from his brother. Thus far concerning him; but as regards his brother Amjad, he awaited As'ad till mid-day yet he returned not to him: whereupon Amjad's vitals fluttered, the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirtieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Amjad awaited his brother As'ad till mid-day and he returned not to him, Amjad's vitals fluttered; the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears, exclaiming, \"Alas, my brother! Alas, my friend! Alas my grief! How I feared me we should be separated!\" Then he descended from the mountain-top with the tears running down his cheeks; and, entering the city, ceased not walking till he made the market. He asked the folk the name of the place and concerning its people and they said, \"This is called the City of the Magians, and its citizens are mostly given to Fire-worshipping in lieu of the Omnipotent King.\" Then he enquired of the City of Ebony and they answered, \"Of a truth it is a year's journey thither by land and six months by sea: it was governed erst by a King called Armanus; but he took to son- in-law and made King in his stead a Prince called Kamar al-Zaman distinguished for justice and munificence, equity and benevolence.\" When Amjad heard tell of his father, he groaned and wept and lamented and knew not whither to go. However, he bought a something of food and carried it to a retired spot where he sat down thinking to eat; but, recalling his brother, he fell a- weeping and swallowed but a morsel to keep breath and body together, and that against his will. Then he rose and walked about the city, seeking news of his brother, till he saw a Moslem tailor sitting in his shop so he sat down by him and told him his story; whereupon quoth the tailor, \"If he have fallen into the hands of the Magians, thou shalt hardly see him again: yet it may be Allah will reunite you twain. But thou, O my brother,\" he continued wilt thou lodge with me?\" Amjad answered, \"Yes\"; and the tailor rejoiced at this. So he abode with him many days, what while the tailor comforted him and exhorted him to patience and taught him tailoring, till he became expert in the craft. Now one day he went forth to the sea-shore and washed his clothes; after which he entered the bath and put on clean raiment; then he walked about the city, to divert himself with its sights and presently there met him on the way a woman of passing beauty and loveliness, without peer for grace and comeliness. When she saw him she raised her face-veil and signed to him by moving her eyebrows and her eyes with luring glances, and versified these couplets,\n\n\"I drooped my glance when seen thee on the way *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    As though, O slim-waist! felled by Sol's hot ray:\nThou art the fairest fair that e'er appeared, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Fairer to-day than fair of yesterday:[FN#384]\nWere Beauty parted, a fifth part of it *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With Joseph or a part of fifth would stay;\nThe rest would fly to thee, shine ownest own; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Be every soul thy sacrifice, I pray!\"\n\nWhen Amjad heard these her words, they gladdened his heart which inclined to her and his bowels yearned towards her and the hands of love sported with him; so he sighed to her in reply and spoke these couplets,\n\n\"Above the rose of cheek is thorn of lance;[FN#385] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who dareth pluck it, rashest chevisance?\nStretch not thy hand towards it, for night long *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Those lances marred because we snatched a glance!\nSay her, who tyrant is and tempter too *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     (Though justice might her tempting power enhance):\u2014\nThy face would add to errors were it veiled; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unveiled I see its guard hath best of chance!\nEye cannot look upon Sol's naked face; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But can, when mist-cloud dims his countenance:\nThe honey-hive is held by honey-bee;[FN#386] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ask the tribe-guards what wants their vigilance?\nAn they would slay me, let them end their ire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rancorous, and grant us freely to advance:\nThey're not more murderous, an charge the whole *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Than charging glance of her who wears the mole.\"\n\nAnd hearing these lines from Amjad she sighed with the deepest sighs and, signing to him again, repeated these couplets,\n\n\"'Tis thou hast trodden coyness path not I: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Grant me thy favours for the time draws nigh:\nO thou who makest morn with light of brow, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And with loosed brow-locks night in lift to stye!\nThine idol-aspect made of me thy slave, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tempting as temptedst me in days gone by:\n'Tis just my liver fry with hottest love: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who worship fire for God must fire aby:\nThou sellest like of me for worthless price; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     If thou must sell, ask high of those who buy.\"\nWhen Amjad heard these her words he said to her, \"Wilt thou come to my lodging or shall I go with thee to shine?\" So she hung her head in shame to the ground and repeated the words of Him whose Name be exalted, \"Men shall have the pre-eminence above women, because of those advantages wherein Allah hath caused the one of them to excel the other.\"[FN#387] Upon this, Amjad took the hint.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad took the woman's hint and understood that she wished to go with him whither he was going; he felt himself bounder to find a place wherein to receive her, but was ashamed to carry her to the house of his host, the tailor. So he walked on and she walked after him, and the two ceased not walking from street to street and place to place, till she was tired and said to him, \"O my lord, where is thy house?\" Answered he, \"Before us a little way.\" Then he turned aside into a handsome by-street, followed by the young woman, and walked on till he came to the end, when he found it was no thoroughfare and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" Then raising his eyes, he saw, at the upper end of the lane a great doer with two stone benches; but it was locked. So Amjad sat down on one of the benches and she on the other; and she said to him, \"O my lord, wherefore waitest thou?\" He bowed his head awhile to the ground then raised it and answered, \"I am awaiting my Mameluke who hath the key; for I bade him make me ready meat and drink and flowers, to deck the wine-service against my return from the bath.\" But he said to himself, \"Haply the time will be tedious to her and she will go about her business, leaving me here, when I will wend my own way.\" However, as soon as she was weary of long waiting, she said, \"O my lord, thy Mameluke delayeth; and here are we sitting in the street;\" and she arose and took a stone and went up to the lock. Said Amjad, \"Be not in haste, but have patience till the servant come.\" However, she hearkened not to him, but smote the wooden bolt with the stone and broke it in half, whereupon the door opened. Quoth he, \"What possessed thee to do this deed?\" Quoth she, \"Pooh, pooh, my lord! what matter it? Is not the house thy house and thy place?\" He said, \"There was no need to break the bolt.\" Then the damsel entered, to the confusion of Amjad, who knew not what to do for fear of the people of the house; but she said to him, \"Why dost thou not enter, O light of mine eyes and core of my heart?\" Replied he, \"I hear and obey; but my servant tarrieth long and I know not if he have done aught of what I bade him and specially enjoined upon him, or not.\" Hereupon he entered, sore in fear of the people of the house, and found himself in a handsome saloon with four dais'd recesses, each facing other, and containing closets and raised seats, all bespread with stuffs of silk and brocade; and in the midst was a jetting fountain of costly fashion, on whose margin rested a covered tray of meats, with a leather tablecloth hanging up and gem-encrusted dishes, full of fruits and sweet- scented flowers. Hard by stood drinking vessels and a candlestick with a single wax-candle therein; and the place was full of precious stuffs and was ranged with chests and stools, and on each seat lay a parcel of clothes upon which was a purse full of monies, gold and silver. The floor was paved with marble and the house bore witness in every part to its owner's fortune. When Amjad saw all this, he was confounded at his case and said to himself, \"I am a lost man! Verily we are Allah's and to Allah we are returning!\" As for the damsel, when she sighted the place she rejoiced indeed with a joy nothing could exceed, and said to him, \"By Allah, O my lord, thy servant hath not failed of his duty; for see, he hath swept the place and cooked the meat and set on the fruit; and indeed I come at the best of times.\" But he paid no heed to her, his heart being taken up with fear of the house- folk; and she said, \"Fie, O my lord, O my heart! What aileth thee to stand thus?\" Then she sighed and, giving him a buss which sounded like the cracking of a walnut, said, \"O my lord, an thou have made an appointment with other than with me, I will gird my middle and serve her and thee. Amjad laughed from a heart full of rage and wrath and came forwards and sat down, panting and saying to himself, \"Alack, mine ill death and doom when the owner of the place shall return!\" Then she seated herself by him and fell to toying and laughing, whilst Amjad sat careful and frowning, thinking a thousand thoughts and communing with himself, \"Assuredly the master of the house cannot but come, and then what shall I say to him? he needs must kill me and my life will be lost thus foolishly.\" Presently she rose and, tucking up her sleeves, took a tray of food on which she laid the cloth and then set it before Amjad and began to eat, saying, \"Eat, O my lord.\" So he came forward and ate; but the food was not pleasant to him; on the contrary he ceased not to look towards the door, till the damsel had eaten her fill, when she took away the tray of the meats and, setting on the dessert, fell to eating of the dried fruits. Then she brought the wine service and opening the jar, filled a cup and handed it to Amjad, who took it from her hand saying to him self, ' Ah, ah! and well away, when the master of the house cometh and seeth me!\"; and he kept his eyes fixed on the threshold, even with cup in hand. While he was in this case, lo! in came the master of the house, who was a white slave, one of the chief men of the city, being Master of the Horse[FN#388] to the King. He had fitted up this saloon for his pleasures, that he might make merry therein and be private with whom he would, and he had that day bidden a youth whom he loved and had made this entertainment for him. Now the name of this slave was Bah\u00e1dur,[FN#389] and he was open of hand, generous, munificent and fain of alms-giving and charitable works.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it wad the Two Hundred and Thirty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Bahadur, the Master of the Horse and the owner of the house, came to the door of the saloon and found it open, he entered slowly and softly and looking in, with head advanced and out stretched neck, saw Amjad and the girl sitting before the dish of fruit and the wine-jar in front of them. Now Amjad at that moment had the cup in his hand and his face turned to the door; and when his glance met Bahadur's eyes his hue turned pale yellow and his side-muscles quivered, so seeing his trouble Bahadur signed to him with his finger on his lips, as much as to say, \"Be silent and come hither to me.\" Whereupon he set down the cup and rose and the damsel cried, \"Whither away?\" He shook his head and, signing to her that he wished to make water, went out into the passage barefoot. Now when he saw Bahadur he knew him for the master of the house; so he hastened to him and, kissing his hands, said to him, \"Allah upon thee, O my lord, ere thou do me a hurt, hear what I have to say.\" Then he told him who he was from first to last and acquainted him with what caused him to quit his native land and royal state, and how he had not entered his house of his free will, but that it was the girl who had broken the lock-bolt and done all this.[FN#390] When Bahadur heard his story and knew that he was a King's son, he felt for him and, taking compassion on him, said, \"Hearken to me, O Amjad, and do what I bid thee and I will guarantee thy safety from that thou fearest; but, if thou cross me, I will kill thee.\" Amjad replied, \"Command me as thou wilt: I will not gainsay thee in aught; no, never, for I am the freedman of thy bounty.\" Rejoined Bahadur, \"Then go back forthwith into the saloon, sit down in thy place and be at peace and at shine ease; I will presently come in to thee, and when thou seest me (remember my name is Bahadur) do thou revile me and rail at me, saying, 'What made thee tarry till so late?' And accept no excuse from me; nay, so far from it, rise and beat me; and, if thou spare me, I will do away thy life. Enter now and make merry and whatsoever thou seekest of me at this time I will bring thee forthwith; and do thou spend this night as thou wilt and on the morrow wend thy way. This I do in honour of thy strangerhood, for I love the stranger and hold myself bounder to do him devoir.\" So Amjad kissed his hand, and, returning to the saloon with his face clad in its natural white and red, at once said to the damsel, \"O my mistress, thy presence hath gladdened this shine own place and ours is indeed a blessed night.\" Quoth the girl, \"Verily I see a wonderful change in thee, that thou now welcomest me so cordially!\" So Amjad answered, \"By Allah, O my lady, methought my servant Bahadur had robbed me of some necklaces of jewels, worth ten thousand diners each; however, when I went out but now in concern for this, I sought for them and found them in their place. I know not why the slave tarrieth so long and needs must I punish him for it.\" She was satisfied with his answer, and they sported and drank and made merry and ceased not to be so till near sundown, when Bahadur came in to them, having changed his clothes and girt his middle and put on shoes, such as are worn of Mamelukes. He saluted and kissed the ground; then held his hands behind him and stood, with his head hanging down, as one who confesseth to a fault. So Amjad looked at him with angry eyes and asked, \"Why hast thou tarried till now, O most pestilent of slaves?\" Answered Bahadur, \"O my lord, I was busy washing my clothes and knew not of thy being here; for our appointed time was nightfall and not day-tide.\" But Amjad cried out at him, saying, \"Thou liest, O vilest of slaves! By Allah, I must needs beat thee.\" So he rose and, throwing Bahadur prone on the ground, took a stick and beat him gently; but the damsel sprang up and, snatching the stick from his hand, came down upon Bahadur so lustily, that in extreme pain the tears ran from his eyes and he ground his teeth together and called out for succour; whilst Amjad cried out to the girl \"Don't\"; and she cried out, \"Let me satisfy my anger upon him!\" till at last he pulled the stick out of her hand and pushed her away. So Bahadur rose and, wiping away his tears from his cheeks, waited upon them the while, after which he swept the hall and lighted the lamps; but as often as he went in and out, the lady abused him and cursed him till Amjad was wroth with her and said, \"For Almighty Allah's sake leave my Mameluke; he is not used to this.\" Then they sat and ceased not eating and drinking (and Bahadur waiting upon them) till midnight when, being weary with service and beating, he fell asleep in the midst of the hall and snored and snorted; whereupon the damsel, who was drunken with wine, said to Amjad, \"Arise, take the sword hanging yonder and cut me off this slave's head; and, if thou do it not, I will be the death of thee!\" \"What possesseth thee to slay my slave?\" asked Amjad; and she answered, \"Our joyaunce will not be complete but by his death. If thou wilt not kill him, I will do it myself.\" Quoth Amjad, \"By Allah's rights to thee, do not this thing!\" Quoth she, \"It must perforce be;\" and, taking down the sword, drew it and made at Bahadur to kill him; but Amjad said in his mind, \"This man hath entreated us courteously and sheltered us and done us kindness and made himself my slave: shall we requite him by slaughtering him? This shall never be!\" Then he said to the woman, \"If my Mameluke must be killed, better I should kill him than thou.\" So saying, he took the sword from her and, raising his hand, smote her on the neck and made her head fly from her body. It fell upon Bahadur who awoke and sat up and opened his eyes, when he saw Amjad standing by him and in his hand the sword dyed with blood, and the damsel lying dead. He enquired what had passed, and Amjad told him all she had said, adding, \"Nothing would satisfy her but she must slay thee; and this is her reward.\" Then Bahadur rose and, kissing the Prince's hand, said to him, \"Would to Heaven thou hadst spared her! but now there is nothing for it but to rid us of her without stay or delay, before the day-break.\" Then he girded his loins and took the body, wrapped it in an Ab\u00e1-cloak and, laying it in a large basket of palm-leaves, he shouldered it saying, \"Thou art a stranger here and knowest no one: so sit thou in this place and await my return till day-break. If I come back to thee, I will assuredly do thee great good service and use my endeavours to have news of thy brother; but if by sunrise I return not, know that all is over with me; and peace be on thee, and the house and all it containeth of stuffs and money are shine.\" Then he fared forth from the saloon bearing the basket; and, threading the streets, he made for the salt sea, thinking to throw it therein: but as he drew near the shore, he turned and saw that the Chief of Police and his officers had ranged themselves around him; and, on recognising him, they wondered and opened the basket, wherein they found the slain woman. So they seized him and laid him in bilboes all that night till the morning, when they carried him and the basket, as it was, to the King and reported the case. The King was sore enraged when he looked upon the slain and said to Bahadur, \"Woe to thee! Thou art always so doing; thou killest folk and castest them into the sea and takest their goods. How many murders hast thou done ere this?\" Thereupon Bahadur hung his head.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahadur hung down his head groundwards before the King, who cried out at him, saying, \"Woe to thee! Who killed this girl?\" He replied, \"O my lord! I killed her, and there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"[FN#391] So the King in his anger, commanded to hang him; and the hangman went down with him by the King's commandment, and the Chief of Police accompanied him with a crier who called upon all the folk to witness the execution of Bahadur, the King's Master of the Horse; and on this wise they paraded him through the main streets and the market-streets. This is how it fared with Bahadur; but as regards Amjad, he awaited his host's return till the day broke and the sun rose, and when he saw that he came not, he exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Would I knew what is become of him?\" And, as he sat musing behold, he heard the crier proclaiming Bahadur's sentence and bidding the people to see the spectacle of his hanging at midday; whereat he wept and exclaimed, \"Verily, we are Allah's and to Him we are returning! He meaneth to sacrifice himself unjustly for my sake, when I it was who slew her. By Allah, this shall never be!\" Then he went from the saloon and, shutting the door after him, hurriedly threaded the streets till he overtook Bahadur, when he stood before the Chief of Police and said to him, \"O my lord, put not Bahadur to death, for he is innocent. By Allah, none killed her but I.\" Now when the Captain of Police heard these words, he took them both and, carrying them before the King, acquainted him with what Amjad had said; whereupon he looked at the Prince and asked him, \"Didst thou kill the damsel?\" He answered, \"Yes\" and the King said, \"Tell me why thou killedst her, and speak the truth.\" Replied Amjad, \"O King, it is indeed a marvellous event and a wondrous matter that hath befallen me: were it graven with needles on the eye-corners, it would serve as a warner to whoso would be warned!\" Then he told him his whole story and informed him of all that had befallen him and his brother, first and last; whereat the King was much startled and surprised and said to him, \"Know that now I find thee to be excusable; but list, O youth! Wilt thou be my Waz\u00edr?\" \"Hearkening and obedience,\" answered Amjad whereupon the King bestowed magnificent dresses of honour on him and Bahadur and gave him a handsome house, with eunuchs and officers and all things needful, appointing him stipends and allowances and bidding him make search for his brother As'ad. So Amjad sat down in the seat of the Wazirate and governed and did justice and invested and deposed and took and gave. Moreover, he sent out a crier to cry his brother throughout the city, and for many days made proclamation in the main streets and market-streets, but heard no news of As'ad nor happened on any trace of him. Such was his case; but as regards his brother, the Magi ceased not to torture As'ad night and day and eve and morn for a whole year's space, till their festival drew near, when the old man Bahram[FN#392] made ready for the voyage and fitted out a ship for himself.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahram, the Magian, having fitted out a ship for the voyage, took As'ad and put him in a chest which he locked and had it transported on board. Now it so came to pass that, at the very time of shipping it, Amjad was standing to divert himself by looking upon the sea; and when he saw the men carrying the gear and shipping it, his heart throbbed and he called to his pages to bring him his beast. Then, mounting with a company of his officers, he rode down to the sea-side and halted before the Magian's ship, which he commended his men to board and search. They did his bidding, and boarded the vessel and rummaged in every part, but found nothing; so they returned and told Amjad, who mounted again and rode back. But he felt troubled in mind; and when he reached his place and entered his palace, he cast his eyes on the wall and saw written thereon two lines which were these couplets,\n\n\"My friends! if ye are banisht from mine eyes, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From heart and mind ye ne'er go wandering:\nBut ye have left me in my woe, and rob *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rest from my eyelids while ye are slumbering.\"\n\nAnd seeing them Amjad thought of his brother and wept. Such was his case; but as for Bahram, the Magian, he embarked and shouted and bawled to his crew to make sail in all haste. So they shook out the sails and departed and ceased not to fare on many days and nights; and, every other day, Bahram took out As'ad and gave him a bit of bread and made him drink a sup of water, till they drew near the Mountain of Fire. Then there came out on them a storm-wind and the sea rose against them, so that the ship was driven out of her course till she took a wrong line and fell into strange waters; and, at last they came in sight of a city builded upon the shore, with a castle whose windows overlooked the main. Now the ruler of this city was a Queen called Marj\u00e1nah, and the captain said to Bahram, \"O my lord, we have strayed from our course and come to the island of Queen Marjanah, who is a devout Moslemah; and, if she know that we are Magians, she will take our ship and slay us to the last man. Yet needs must we put in here to rest and refit.\" Quoth Bahram, \"Right is thy recking, and whatso thou seest fit that will I do!\" Said the ship master, \"If the Queen summon us and question us, how shall we answer her?\"; and Bahram replied, \"Let us clothe this Moslem we have with us in a Mameluke's habit and carry him ashore with us, so that when the Queen sees him, she will suppose and say, 'This is a slave.' As for me I will tell her that I am a slave-dealer[FN#393] who buys and sells white slaves, and that I had with me many but have sold all save this one, whom I retained to keep my accounts, for he can read and write.\" And the captain said \"This device should serve.\" Presently they reached the city and slackened sail and cast the anchors; and the ship lay still, when behold, Queen Marjanah came down to them, attended by her guards and, halting before the vessel, called out to the captain, who landed and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, \"What is the lading of this thy ship and whom hast thou with thee?\"\" Quoth he, \"O Queen of the Age, I have with me a merchant who dealeth in slaves.\" And she said, \"Hither with him to me\"; whereupon Bahram came ashore to her, with As'ad walking behind him in a slave's habit, and kissed the earth before her. She asked, \"What is thy condition?\"; and he answered, \"I am a dealer in chattels.\" Then she looked at As'ad and, taking him for a Mameluke, asked him, \"What is thy name, O youth?\" He answered, \"Dost thou ask my present or my former name?\" \"Hast thou then two names?\" enquired she, and he replied (and indeed his voice was choked with tears), \"Yes; my name aforetime was Al-As'ad, the most happy, but now it is Al- Mu'tarr\u2014Miserrimus.\" Her heart inclined to him and she said, \"Canst thou write?\" \"Yes,'' answered he, and she gave him ink- case and reed-pen and paper and said to him, \"Write somewhat that I may see it.\" So he wrote these two couplets,\n\n\"What can the slave do when pursued by Fate, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O justest Judge! whatever be his state?[FN#394]\nWhom God throws hand bound in the depths and says, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Beware lest water should thy body wet?\"[FN#395]\n\nNow when she read these lines, she had ruth upon him and said to Bahram, \"Sell me this slave.\" He replied, \"O my lady, I cannot sell him, for I have parted with all the rest and none is left with me but he.\" Quoth the Queen, \"I must need have him of thee, either by sale or way of gift.\" But quoth Bahram, \"I will neither sell him nor give him.\" Whereat she was wroth and, taking As'ad by the hand, carried him up to the castle and sent to Bahram, saying, \"Except thou set sail and depart our city this very night, I will seize all thy goods and break up thy ship.\" Now when the message reached the Magian, he grieved with sore grief and cried, \"Verily this voyage is on no wise to be commended.\" Then he arose and made ready and took all he needed and awaited the coming of the night to resume his voyage, saying to the sailors, \"Provide yourselves with your things and fill your water-skins, that we may set sail at the last of the night.\" So the sailors did their business and awaited the coming of darkness. Such was their case; but as regards Queen Marjanah, when she had brought As'ad into the castle, she opened the casements overlooking the sea and bade her handmaids bring food. They set food before As'ad and herself and both ate, after which the Queen called for wine.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Marjanah bade her handmaids bring wine and they set it before her, she fell to drinking with As'ad. Now, Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) filled her heart with love for the Prince and she kept filling his cup and handing it to him till his reason fled; and presently he rose and left the hall to satisfy a call of nature. As he passed out of the saloon he saw an open door through which he went and walked on till his walk brought him to a vast garden full of all manner fruits and flowers; and, sitting down under a tree, he did his occasion. Then he rose and went up to a jetting fountain in the garden and made the lesser ablution and washed his hands and face, after which he would have risen to go away; but the air smote him and he fell back, with his clothes undone and slept, and night overcame him thus. So far concerning him; but as concerns Bahram, the night being come, he cried out to his crew, saying, \"Set sail and let us away!\"; and the' answered, \"We hear and obey, but wait till we fill our water- skins and then we will set sail.\" So they landed with their water skins and went round about the castle, and found nothing but garden-walls: whereupon they climbed over into the garden and followed the track of feet, which led them to the fountain; and there they found As'ad lying on his back. They knew him and were glad to find him; and, after filling their water-skins, they bore him off and climbed the wall again with him and carried him back in haste to Bahram to whom they said, \"Hear the good tidings of thy winning thy wish; and gladden thy heart and beat thy drums and sound thy pipes; for thy prisoner, whom Queen Marjanah took from thee by force, we have found and brought back to thee\"; and they threw As'ad down before him. When Bahram saw him, his heart leapt for joy and his breast swelled with gladness. Then he bestowed largesse on the sailors and bade them set sail in haste. So they sailed forthright, intending to make the Mountain of Fire and stayed not their course till the morning. This is how it fared with them; but as regards Queen Marjanah, she abode awhile, after As'ad went down from her, awaiting his return in vain for he came not; thereupon she rose and sought him, yet found no trace of him. Then she bade her women light flambeaux and look for him, whilst she went forth in person and, seeing the garden- door open, knew that he had gone thither. So she went out into the garden and finding his sandals lying by the fountain, searched the place in every part, but came upon no sign of him; and yet she gave not over the search till morning. Then she enquired for the ship and they told her, \"The vessel set sail in the first watch of the night\"; wherefor she knew that they had taken As'ad with them, and this was grievous to her and she was sore an-angered. She bade equip ten great ships forthwith and, making ready for fight, embarked in one of the ten with her Mamelukes and slave-women and men-at-arms, all splendidly accoutred and weaponed for war. They spread the sails and she said to the captains, \"If you overtake the Magian's ship, ye shall have of me dresses of honour and largesse of money; but if you fail so to do, I will slay you to the last man.\" Whereat fear and great hope animated the crews and they sailed all that day and the night and the second day and the third day till, on the fourth they sighted the ship of Bahram, the Magian, and before evening fell the Queen's squadron had surrounded it on all sides, just as Bahram had taken As'ad forth of the chest and was beating and torturing him, whilst the Prince cried out for help and deliverance, but found neither helper nor deliverer: and the grievous bastinado sorely tormented him. Now while so occupied, Bahram chanced to look up and, seeing himself encompassed by the Queen's ships, as the white of the eye encompasseth the black, he gave himself up for lost and groaned and said, \"Woe to thee, O As'ad! This is all out of thy head.\" Then taking him by the hand he bade his men throw him overboard and cried, \"By Allah I will slay thee before I die myself!\" So they carried him along by the hands and feet and cast him into the sea and he sank; but Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) willed that his life be saved and that his doom be deferred; so He caused him to sink and rise again and he struck out with his hands and feet, till the Almighty gave him relief, and sent him deliverance; and the waves bore him far from the Magian's ship and threw him ashore. He landed, scarce crediting his escape, and once more on land he doffed his clothes and wrung them and spread them out to dry; whilst he sat naked and weeping over his condition, and bewailing his calamities and mortal dangers, and captivity and stranger hood. And presently he repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"Allah, my patience fails: I have no ward; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My breast is straitened and clean cut my cord;\nTo whom shall wretched slave of case complain *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Save to his Lord? O thou of lords the Lord!\"\n\nThen, having ended his verse, he rose and donned his clothes but he knew not whither to go or whence to come; so he fed on the herbs of the earth and the fruits of the trees and he drank of the streams, and fared on night and day till he came in sight of a city; whereupon he rejoiced and hastened his pace; but when he reached it,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it Was the Two Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he reached the city the shades of evening closed around him and the gates were shut. Now by the decrees of Pate and man's lot this was the very city wherein he had been a prisoner and to whose King his brother Amjad was Minister. When As'ad saw the gate was locked, he turned back and made for the burial-ground, where finding a tomb without a door, he entered therein and lay down and fell asleep, with his face covered by his long sleeve.[FN#396] Meanwhile, Queen Marjanah, coming up with Bahram's ship, questioned him of As'ad. Now the Magian, when Queen Marjanah overtook him with her ships, baffled her by his artifice and gramarye; swearing to her that he was not with him and that he knew nothing of him. She searched the ship, but found no trace of her friend, so she took Bahram and, carrying him back to her castle, would have put him to death, but he ransomed himself from her with all his good and his ship; and she released him and his men. They went forth from her hardly believing in their deliverance, and fared on ten days' journey till they came to their own city and found the gate shut, it being eventide. So they made for the burial-ground, thinking to lie the night there and, going round about the tombs, as Fate and Fortune would have it, saw the building wherein As'ad lay wide open; whereat Bahram marvelled and said, \"I must look into this sepulchre.\" Then he entered and found As'ad lying in a corner fast asleep, with his head covered by his sleeve; so he raised his head, and looking in his face, knew him for the man on whose account he had lost his good and his ship, and cried, \"What! art thou yet alive?\" Then he bound him and gagged him without further parley, and carried him to his house, where he clapped heavy shackles on his feet and lowered him into the underground dungeon aforesaid prepared for the tormenting of Moslems, and he bade his daughter by name Bost\u00e1n,[FN#397] torture him night and day, till the next year, when they would again visit the Mountain of Fire and there offer him up as a sacrifice. Then he beat him grievously and locking the dungeon door upon him, gave the keys to his daughter. By and by, Bostan opened the door and went down to beat him, but finding him a comely youth and a sweet-faced with arched brows and eyes black with nature's Kohl,[FN#398] she fell in love with him and asked him, \"What is thy name?\" \"My name is As'ad,\" answered he; whereat she cried, \"Mayst thou indeed be happy as thy name,[FN#399] and happy be thy days! Thou deservest not torture and blows, and I see thou hast been injuriously entreated.\" And she comforted him with kind words and loosed his bonds. Then she questioned him of the religion of Al-Islam and he told her that it was the true and right Faith and that our lord Mohammed had approved himself by surpassing miracles[FN#400] and signs manifest, and that fire-worship is harmful and not profitable; and he went on to expound to her the tenets of Al-Islam till she was persuaded and the love of the True Faith entered her heart. Then, as Almighty Allah had mixed up with her being a fond affection for As'ad, she pronounced the Two Testimonies[FN#401] of the Faith and became of the people of felicity. After this, she brought him meat and drink and talked with him and they prayed together: moreover, she made him chicken stews and fed him therewith, till he regained strength and his sickness left him and he was restored to his former health. Such things befel him with the daughter of Bahram, the Magian; and so it happened that one day she left him and stood at the house-door when behold, she heard the crier crying aloud and saying, \"Whoso hath with him a handsome young man, whose favour is thus and thus, and bringeth him forth, shall have all he seeketh of money; but if any have him and deny it, he shall be hanged over his own door and his property shall be plundered and his blood go for naught.\" Now As'ad had acquainted Bostan bint Bahram with his whole history: so, when she heard the crier, she knew that it was he who was sought for and, going down to him, told him the news. Then he fared forth and made for the mansion of the Wazir, whom, when As'ad saw, exclaimed, \"By Allah, this Minister is my brother Amjad!\" Then he went up (and the damsel walking behind him) to the Palace, where he again saw his brother, and threw himself upon him; whereupon Amjad also knew him and fell upon his neck and they embraced each other, whilst the Wazir's Mamelukes dismounted and stood round them. They lay awhile insensible and, when they came to themselves, Amjad took his brother and carried him to the Sultan, to whom he related the whole story, and the Sultan charged him to plunder Bahram's house.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Sultan ordered Amjad to plunder Bahram's house and to hang its owner. So Amjad despatched thither for that purpose a company of men, who sacked the house and took Bahram and brought his daughter to the Wazir by whom she was received with all honour, for As'ad had told his brother the torments he had suffered and the kindness she had done him. Thereupon Amjad related in his turn to As'ad all that had passed between himself and the damsel; and how he had escaped hanging and had become Wazir; and they made moan, each to other, of the anguish they had suffered for separation. Then the Sultan summoned Bahram and bade strike off his head; but he said, \"O most mighty King, art thou indeed resolved to put me to death?\" Replied the King, \"Yes, except thou save thyself by becoming a Moslem.\" Quoth Bahram, \"O King, bear with me a little while!\" Then he bowed his head groundwards and presently raising it again, made pro fession of The Faith and islamised at the hands of the Sultan. They all rejoiced at his conversion and Amjad and As'ad told him all that had befallen them, whereat he wondered and said, \"O my lords, make ready for the journey and I will depart with you and carry you back to your father's court in a ship.\" At this they rejoiced and wept with sore weeping but he said, \"O my lords, weep not for your departure, for it shall reunite you with those you love, even as were Ni'amah and Naomi.\" \"And what befel Ni'amah and Naomi?\" asked they. \"They tell,\" replied Bahram, \"(but Allah alone is All knowing) the following tale of\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n\n\n[FN#221] The \"topothesia\" is worthy of Shakespeare's day. \"Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1n\" is evidently a corruption of \"Kh\u00e1lidat\u00e1ni\" (for Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1t), the Eternal, as Ibn Wardi calls the Fortunate Islands, or Canaries, which owe both their modern names to the classics of Europe. Their present history dates from A.D. 1385, unless we accept the Dieppe-Rouen legend of Labat which would place the discovery in A.D. 1326. I for one thoroughly believe in the priority on the West African Coast, of the gallant descendants of the Northmen.\n\n[FN#222] Four wives are allowed by Moslem law and for this reason. If you marry one wife she holds herself your equal, answers you and \"gives herself airs\"; two are always quarrelling and making a hell of the house; three are \"no company\" and two of them always combine against the nicest to make her hours bitter. Four are company, they can quarrel and \"make it up\" amongst themselves, and the husband enjoys comparative peace. But the Moslem is bound by his law to deal equally with the four, each must have her dresses her establishment and her night, like her sister wives. The number is taken from the Jews (Arbah Turim Ev. Hazaer, i.) \"the wise men have given good advice that a man should not marry more than four wives.\" Europeans, knowing that Moslem women are cloistered and appear veiled in public, begin with believing them to be mere articles of luxury, and only after long residence they find out that nowhere has the sex so much real liberty and power as in the Moslem East. They can possess property and will it away without the husband's leave: they can absent themselves from the house for a month without his having a right to complain; and they assist in all his counsels for the best of reasons: a man can rely only on his wives and children, being surrounded by rivals who hope to rise by his ruin. As regards political matters the Circassian women of Constantinople really rule the Sultanate and there soignez la femme! is the first lesson of getting on in the official world.\n\n[FN#223] This two-bow prayer is common on the bride-night; and at all times when issue is desired.\n\n[FN#224] The older Camaralzaman=\"Moon of the age.\" Kamar is the moon between her third and twenty-sixth day: Hil\u00e1l during the rest of the month: Badr (plur. Bud\u00far whence the name of the Princess) is the full moon.\n\n[FN#225] Arab \"Ra'\u00e1y\u00e1\" plur. of 'Ra'\u00edyat\" our Anglo-Indian Ryot, lit. a liege, a subject; secondarily a peasant, a Fellah.\n\n[FN#226] Another audacious parody of the Moslem \"testification\" to the one God, and to Mohammed the Apostle.\n\n[FN#227] Showing how long ago forts were armed with metal plates which we have applied to war-ships only of late years.\n\n[FN#228] The comparison is abominably true\u2014in the East.\n\n[FN#229] Two fallen angels who taught men the art of magic. They are mentioned in the Koran (chaps. ii.), and the commentators have extensively embroidered the simple text. Popularly they are supposed to be hanging by their feet in a well in the territory of Babel, hence the frequent allusions to \"Babylonian sorcery\" in Moslem writings; and those who would study the black art at head-quarters are supposed to go there. They are counterparts of the Egyptian Jamnes and Mambres, the Jannes and Jambres of St. Paul (2 Tim. iii. 8).\n\n[FN#230] An idol or idols of the Arabs (Allat and Ozza) before Mohammed (Koran chaps. ii. 256). Etymologically the word means \"error\" and the termination is rather Hebraic than Arabic.\n\n[FN#231] Arab. \"Khayt hamay\u00e1n\" (wandering threads of vanity), or\nMukh\u00e1t al-Shaytan (Satan's snivel),=our \"gossamer\"=God's summer\n(Mutter Gottes Sommer) or God's cymar (?).\n\n[FN#232] These lines occur in Night xvii.; so I borrow from\nTorrens (p. 163) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#233] A posture of peculiar submission; contrasting strongly with the attitude afterwards assumed by Prince Charming.\n\n[FN#234] A mere term of vulgar abuse not reflecting on either parent: I have heard a mother call her own son, \"Child of adultery.\"\n\n[FN#235] Arab. \"Ghaz\u00e1,\" the Artemisia (Euphorbia ?) before noticed. If the word be a misprint for Ghad\u00e1 it means a kind of Euphorbia which, with the Ar\u00e1k (wild caper-tree) and the Daum palm (Crucifera thebiaca), is one of the three normal growths of the Arabian desert (Pilgrimage iii. 22).\n\n[FN#236] Arab. \"Ban\u00e1t al-Na'ash,\" usually translated daughters of the bier, the three stars which represent the horses in either Bear, \"Charles' Wain,\" or Ursa Minor, the waggon being supposed to be a bier. \"Ban\u00e1t\" may be also sons, plur. of Ibn, as the word points to irrational objects. So Job (ix. 9 and xxxviii. 32) refers to U. Major as \"Ash\" or \"Aysh\" in the words, \"Canst thou guide the bier with its sons?\" (erroneously rendered \"Arcturus with his sons\") In the text the lines are enigmatical, but apparently refer to a death parting.\n\n[FN#237] The Chapters are: 2, 3, 36, 55, 67 and the two last (\"Daybreak\" cxiii. and \"Men\" cxiv.), which are called Al-Mu'izzat\u00e1ni (vulgar Al-Mu'izzatayn), the \"Two Refuge-takings or Preventives,\" because they obviate enchantment. I have translated the two latter as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Say:\u2014Refuge I take with the Lord of the Day-break *\nfrom mischief of what He did make *\nfrom mischief of moon eclipse-showing *\nand from mischief of witches on cord-knots blowing *\nand from mischief of envier when envying.\"\n\n\"Say:\u2014Refuge I take with the Lord of men *\nthe sovran of men *\nthe God of men *\nfrom the Tempter, the Demon *\nwho tempteth in whisper the breasts of men *\nand from Jinnis and (evil) men.\"\n\n[FN#238] The recitations were N\u00e1filah, or superogatory, two short chapters only being required and the taking refuge was because he slept in a ruin, a noted place in the East for Ghuls as in the West for ghosts.\n\n[FN#239] Lane (ii. 222) first read \"M\u00faroozee\" and referred it to the Mur\u00faz tribe near Herat he afterwards (iii. 748) corrected it to \"Marwazee,\" of the fabric of Marw (Margiana) the place now famed for \"Mervousness.\" As a man of Rayy (Rhages) becomes R\u00e1z\u00ed (e.g. Ibn F\u00e1ris al-Raz\u00ed), so a man of Marw is Mar\u00e1zi, not Mur\u00fazi nor M\u00e1rwazi. The \"Mikna' \" was a veil forming a kind of \"respirator,\" defending from flies by day and from mosquitos, dews and draughts by night. Easterns are too sensible to sleep with bodies kept warm by bedding, and heads bared to catch every blast. Our grandfathers and grandmothers did well to wear bonnets-de-nuit, however ridiculous they may have looked.\n\n[FN#240] Iblis, meaning the Despairer, is called in the Koran (chaps. xviii. 48) \"One of the genii (Jinnis) who departed from the command of his Lord.\" Mr. Rodwell (in loco) notes that the Satans and Jinnis represent in the Koran (ii. 32, etc.) the evil-principle and finds an admixture of the Semitic Satans and demons with the \"Genii from the Persian (Babylonian ?) and Indian (Egyptian ?) mythologies.\"\n\n[FN#241] Of course she could not see his eyes when they were shut; nor is this mere Eastern inconsequence. The writer means, \"had she seen them, they would have showed,\" etc.\n\n[FN#242] The eyes are supposed to grow darker under the influence of wine and sexual passion.\n\n[FN#243] To keep off the evil eye.\n[FN#244] Like Dahnash this is a fanciful P. N., fit only for a Jinni. As a rule the appellatives of Moslem \"genii\" end in\u00fas (oos), as Tarn\u00fas, Huliy\u00e1nus, the Jewish in\u2014nas, as Jattunas; those of the Tars\u00e1 (the \"funkers\" i.e. Christians) in\u2014d\u00fas, as Sid\u00fas, and the Hindus in\u2014t\u00fas, as Nakt\u00fas (who entered the service of the Prophet Shays, or Seth, and was converted to the Faith). The King of the Genii is Malik Katsh\u00e1n who inhabits Mount Kaf; and to the west of him lives his son-in-law, Abd al-Rahman with 33,000 domestics: these names were given by the Apostle Mohammed. \"Baktan\u00fas\" is lord of three Moslem troops of the wandering Jinns, which number a total of twelve bands and extend from Sind to Europe. The Jinns, Divs, Peris (\"fairies\") and other pre-Adamitic creatures were governed by seventy-two Sultans all known as Sulayman and the last I have said was J\u00e1n bin J\u00e1n. The angel H\u00e1ris was sent from Heaven to chastise him, but in the pride of victory he also revolted with his followers the Jinns whilst the Peris held aloof. When he refused to bow down before Adam he and his chiefs were eternally imprisoned but the other Jinns are allowed to range over earth as a security for man's obedience. The text gives the three orders. flyers. walkers and divers.\n\n[FN#245] i.e. distracted (with love); the Lakab, or poetical name, of apparently a Spanish poet.\n\n[FN#246] Nothing is more \"anti-pathetic\" to Easterns than lean hips and flat hinder-cheeks in women and they are right in insisting upon the characteristic difference of the male and female figure. Our modern sculptors and painters, whose study of the nude is usually most perfunctory, have often scandalised me by the lank and greyhound-like fining off of the frame, which thus becomes rather simian than human.\n\n[FN#247] The small fine foot is a favourite with Easterns as well as Westerns. Ovid (A.A.) is not ashamed \"ad teneros Oscula (not basia or suavia) ferre pedes.\" Ariosto ends the august person in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Il breve, asciutto, e ritondetto piece,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (The short-sized, clean-cut, roundly-moulded foot).\n\nAnd all the world over it is a sign of \"blood,\" i.e. the fine nervous temperament.\n\n[FN#248] i.e. \"full moons\": the French have corrupted it to\n\"Badoure\"; we to \"Badoura.\" winch is worse.\n\n[FN#249] As has been said a single drop of urine renders the clothes ceremoniously impure, hence a Stone or a handful of earth must be used after the manner of the torche-cul. Scrupulous Moslems, when squatting to make water, will prod the ground before them with the point o f stick or umbrella, so as to loosen it and prevent the spraying of the urine.\n\n[FN#250] It is not generally known to Christians that Satan has a wife called Aww\u00e1 (\"Haww\u00e1\" being the Moslem Eve) and, as Adam had three sons, the Tempter has nine, viz., Zu 'l-baysun who rules in bazars. Wassin who prevails in times of trouble. Awan who counsels kings; Haffan patron of wine-bibbers; Marrah of musicians and dancers; Masbut of news-spreaders (and newspapers ?); Dulh\u00e1n who frequents places of worship and interferes with devotion. Dasim, lord of mansions and dinner tables, who prevents the Faithful saying \"Bismillah\" and \"Inshallah,\" as commanded in the Koran (xviii. 23), and Lak\u00eds, lord of Fire worshippers (Herklots, chap. xxix. sect. 4).\n\n[FN#251] Strong perfumes, such as musk (which we Europeans dislike and suspect), are always insisted upon in Eastern poetry, and Mohammed's predilection for them is well known. Moreover the young and the beautiful are held (justly enough) to exhale a natural fragrance which is compared with that of the blessed in Paradise. Hence in the Mu'allakah of Imr al-Keys:\u2014\n\nBreathes the scent of musk when they rise to rove, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    As the Zephyr's breath with the flavour o'clove.\n\nIt is made evident by dogs and other fine-nosed animals that every human being has his, or her, peculiar scent which varies according to age and health. Hence animals often detect the approach of death.\n\n[FN#252] Arab. \"Kahl\u00e1.\" This has been explained. Mohammed is said to have been born with \"Kohl'd eyes.\"\n\n[FN#253] Haw\u00e1 al-'uzr\u00ed, before noticed (Night cxiv.).\n\n[FN#254] These lines, with the N\u00e1zir (eye or steward), the H\u00e1jib (Groom of the Chambers or Chamberlain) and Joseph, are also repeated from Night cxiv. For the Nazir see Al-Hariri (Nos. xiii. and xxii.)\n\n[FN#255] The usual allusion to the H\u00far (Houris) from \"Hangar,\" the white and black of the eye shining in contrast. The Persian Magi also placed in their Heaven (Bihisht or Minu) \"Huran,\" or black-eyed nymphs, under the charge of the angel Zamiy\u00e1d.\n\n[FN#256] In the first hemistich, \"bi-shitt 'it w\u00e1dy\" (by the wady-bank): in the second, \"wa shatta 'l w\u00e1dy\" (\"and my slayer\"\u2014 i.e. w\u00e1dy act. part. of wady, killing\u2014\"hath paced away\").\n\n[FN#257] The double entendre is from the proper names Bud\u00far and Su'\u00e1d (Beatrice) also meaning \"auspicious (or blessed) full moons.\"\n\n[FN#258] Arab. \"H\u00e1zir\" (also Ahl al-hazer, townsmen) and B\u00e1di, a Badawi, also called \"Ahl al-Wabar,\" people of the camel's hair (tent) and A'ar\u00e1b (Nomadic) as opposed to Arab (Arab settled or not). They still boast with Ibn Abbas, cousin of Mohammed, that they have kerchiefs (not turbands) for crowns, tents for houses, loops for walls, swords for scarves and poems for registers or written laws.\n\n[FN#259] This is a peculiarity of the Jinn tribe when wearing hideous forms. It is also found in the Hindu Rakshasa.\n\n[FN#260] Which, by the by, are small and beautifully shaped. The animal is very handy with them, as I learnt by experience when trying to \"Rareyfy\" one at Bayrut.\n\n[FN#261] She being daughter of Al-Dimiry\u00e1t, King of the Jinns.\nMr. W. F. Kirby has made him the subject of a pretty poem.\n\n[FN#262] These lines have occurred in Night xxii. I give\nTorrens's version (p. 223) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#263] Arab. \"K\u00e1mat Alfiyyah,\" like an Alif, the first of the Arabic alphabet, the Heb. Aleph. The Arabs, I have said, took the flag or water leaf form and departed very far from the Egyptian original (we know from Plutarch that the hieroglyphic abecedarium began with \"a\"), which was chosen by other imitators, namely the bull's head, and which in the cursive form, especially the Phnician, became a yoke. In numerals \"Alif\" denotes one or one thousand. It inherits the traditional honours of Alpha (as opposed to Omega) and in books, letters and writings generally it is placed as a monogram over the \"Bismillah,\" an additional testimony to the Unity. (See vol. i. p. 1.) In medi\u00e6val Christianity this place of honour was occupied by the cross: none save the wildest countries have preserved it, but our vocabulary still retains Criss' (Christ-)cross Row, for horn-book, on account of the old alphabet and nine digits disposed in the form of a Latin cross. Hence Tickell (\"The Horn-book\"):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        \u2014\u2014Mortals ne'er shall know\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        More than contained of old the Chris'-cross Row.\n\n[FN#264] The young man must have been a demon of chastity.\n\n[FN#265] Arab. \"Kir\u00e1t\" from i.e. bean, the seed of the Abrus precatorius, in weight=two to three (English) grains; and in length=one finger-breadth here; 24 being the total. The Moslem system is evidently borrowed from the Roman \"as\" and \"uncia.\"\n\n[FN#266] Names of women.\n\n[FN#267] Arab. \"Amsa\" (lit. he passed the evening) like \"asbaha\" (he rose in the morning) \"Azh\u00e1\" (he spent the forenoon) and \"bata\" (he spent the night), are idiomatically used for \"to be in any state, to continue\" without specification of time or season.\n\n[FN#268] Lit. \"my liver ;\" which viscus, and not the heart, is held the seat of passion, a fancy dating from the oldest days. Theocritus says of Hercules, \"In his liver Love had fixed a wound\" (Idyl. xiii.). In the Anthologia \"Cease, Love, to wound my liver and my heart\" (lib. vii.). So Horace (Odes, i. 2); his Latin Jecur and the Persian \"Jigar\" being evident congeners. The idea was long prevalent and we find in Shakespeare:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         Alas, then Love may be called appetite,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         No motion of the liver but the palate.\n\n[FN#269] A marvellous touch of nature, love ousting affection; the same trait will appear in the lover and both illustrate the deep Italian saying, \"Amor discende, non ascende.\" The further it goes down the stronger it becomes as of grand-parent for grand-child and vice versa.\n\n[FN#270] This tenet of the universal East is at once fact and unfact. As a generalism asserting that women's passion is ten times greater than man's (Pilgrimage, ii. 282), it is unfact. The world shows that while women have more philoprogenitiveness, men have more amativeness; otherwise the latter would not propose and would nurse the doll and baby. Pact, however, in low-lying lands, like Persian Mazanderan versus the Plateau; Indian Malabar compared with Mar\u00e1tha-land; California as opposed to Utah and especially Egypt contrasted with Arabia. In these hot damp climates the venereal requirements and reproductive powers of the female greatly exceed those of the male; and hence the dissoluteness of morals would be phenomenal, were it not obviated by seclusion, the sabre and the revolver. In cold-dry or hot-dry mountainous lands the reverse is the case; hence polygamy there prevails whilst the low countries require polyandry in either form, legal or illegal (i,e. prostitution) I have discussed this curious point of \"geographical morality\" (for all morality is, like conscience, both geographical and chronological), a subject so interesting to the lawgiver, the student of ethics and the anthropologist, in \"The City of the Saints \" But strange and unpleasant truths progress slowly, especially in England.\n\n[FN#271] This morning evacuation is considered, in the East, a sine qu\u00e2 non of health; and old Anglo-Indians are unanimous in their opinion of the \"bard fajar\" (as they mispronounce the dawn-clearance). The natives of India, Hind\u00fas (pagans) and Hind\u00eds (Moslems), unlike Europeans, accustom themselves to evacuate twice a day, evening as well as morning. This may, perhaps, partly account for their mildness and effeminacy; for:\u2014\n\nC'est la constipation qui rend l'homme rigoureux.\n\nThe English, since the first invasion of cholera, in October, 1831, are a different race from their costive grandparents who could not dine without a \"dinner-pill.\" Curious to say the clyster is almost unknown to the people of Hindostan although the barbarous West Africans use it daily to \"wash 'um belly,\" as the Bonney-men say. And, as Sonnini notes to propose the process in Egypt under the Beys might have cost a Frankish medico his life.\n\n[FN#272] The Egyptian author cannot refrain from this characteristic polissonnerie; and reading it out is always followed by a roar of laughter. Even serious writers like Al- Hariri do not, as I have noted, despise the indecency.\n\n[FN#273] \"'Long beard and little wits,\" is a saying throughout the East where the Kausaj (= man with thin, short beard) is looked upon as cunning and tricksy. There is a venerable Joe Miller about a schoolmaster who, wishing to singe his long beard short, burnt it off and his face to boot:\u2014which reminded him of the saying. A thick beard is defined as one which wholly conceals the skin; and in ceremonial ablution it must be combed out with the fingers till the water reach the roots. The Sunnat, or practice of the Prophet, was to wear the beard not longer than one hand and two fingers' breadth. In Persian \"K\u00faseh\" (thin beard) is an insulting term opposed to \"Khush-r\u00edsh,\" a well-bearded man. The Iranian growth is perhaps the finest in the world, often extending to the waist; but it gives infinite trouble, requiring, for instance, a bag when travelling. The Arab beard is often composed of two tufts on the chin-sides and straggling hairs upon the cheeks; and this is a severe mortification, especially to Shaykhs and elders, who not only look upon the beard as one of man's characteristics, but attach a religious importance to the appendage. Hence the enormity of Kamar al-Zaman's behaviour. The Persian festival of the vernal equinox was called Kusehnish\u00edn (Thin-beard sitting). An old man with one eye paraded the streets on an ass with a crow in one hand and a scourge and fan in the other, cooling himself, flogging the bystanders and crying heat! heat! (garm\u00e1! garm\u00e1!). For other particulars see Richardson (Dissertation, p. Iii.). This is the Italian Giorno delle Vecchie, Thursday in Mid Lent, March 12 (1885), celebrating the death of Winter and the birth of Spring.\n\n[FN#274] I quote Torrens (p. 400) as these lines have occurred in\nNight xxxviii.\n\n[FN#275] Moslems have only two names for week days, Friday,\nAl-Jum'ah or meeting-day, and Al-Sabt, Sabbath day, that is\nSaturday. The others are known by numbers after Quaker fashion\nwith us, the usage of Portugal and Scandinavia.\n\n[FN#276] Our last night.\n\n[FN#277] Arab. \"Tayf\"=phantom, the nearest approach to our \"ghost,\" that queer remnant of Fetishism imbedded in Christianity; the phantasma, the shade (not the soul) of tile dead. Hence the accurate Niebuhr declares, \"apparitions (i.e., of the departed) are unknown in Arabia.\" Haunted houses are there tenanted by Ghuls, Jinns and a host of supernatural creatures; but not by ghosts proper; and a man may live years in Arabia before he ever hears of the \"Tayf.\" With the Hindus it is otherwise (Pilgrimage iii. 144). Yet the ghost, the embodied fear of the dead and of death is common, in a greater or less degree, to all peoples; and, as modern Spiritualism proves, that ghost is not yet laid.\n\n[FN#278] Mr. Payne (iii. 133) omits the lines which are \u00e0propos de rein and read much like \"nonsense verses.\" I retain them simply because they are in the text.\n\n[FN#279] The first two couplets are the quatrain (or octave) in\nNight xxxv.\n\n[FN#280] Arab. \"Ar'ar,\" the Heb. \"Aroer,\" which Luther and the A.\nV. translate \"heath.\" The modern Aramaic name is \"Lizz\u00e1b\"\n(Unexplored Syria. i. 68).\n\n[FN#281] In the old version and the Bresl. Edit. (iii. 220) the\nPrincess beats the \"Kahram\u00e1nah,\" but does not kill her.\n\n[FN#282] 'This is still the popular Eastern treatment of the insane.\n\n[FN#283] Pers. \"Marz-b\u00e1n\" = Warden of the Marches, Margrave. The foster-brother in the East is held dear as, and often dearer than, kith and kin.\n\n[FN#284] The moderns believe most in the dawn-dream.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        \u2014Quirinus\n\nPost mediam noctem visus, quum somnia vera.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          (Horace Sat. i. 10, 33,)\n\n[FN#285] The Bresl.

Both are used by Nizami and Al-Hariri, the most \"elegant\" of Arab writers.\n\n[FN#287] These form a Kas\u00eddah, Ode or Elegy= rhymed couplets numbering more than thirteen: If shorter it is called a \"Ghazal.\" I have not thought it necessary to preserve the monorhyme.\n\n[FN#288] Sulaym\u00e1 dim. of Salm\u00e1= any beautiful woman Rab\u00e1b = the viol mostly single stringed: Tan'oum=she who is soft and gentle.

The distich is highly fanciful and the conceits would hardly occur to a\n\n[FN#290] Arab. \"Andam,\" a term applied to Brazil-wood (also called \"Bakkam\") and to \"dragon's blood,\" but not, I think, to tragacanth, the \"goat's thorn,\" which does not dye. Andam is often mentioned in The Nights.\n\n[FN#291] The superior merit of the first (explorer, etc.) is a lieu commun with Arabs. So Al-Hariri in Preface quotes his predecessor:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Justly of praise the price I pay;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          The praise is his who leads the way.\n\n[FN#292] There were two Lukmans, of whom more in a future page.\n\n[FN#293] This symbolic action is repeatedly mentioned in The\nNights.\n\n[FN#294] Arab. \"Shakhs\"=a person, primarily a dark spot. So \"Saw\u00e1d\"=blackness, in Al-Hariri means a group of people who darken the ground by their shade.\n\n[FN#295] The first bath after sickness, I have said, is called\n\"Ghusl al-Sihhah,\"\u2014the Washing of Health.\n\n[FN#296] The words \"malady\" and \"disease\" are mostly avoided during these dialogues as ill-omened words which may bring on a relapse.\n\n[FN#297] Solomon's carpet of green silk which carried him and all his host through the air is a Talmudic legend generally accepted in Al-Islam though not countenanced by the Koran. chaps xxvii. When the \"gnat's wing\" is mentioned, the reference is to Nimrod who, for boasting that he was lord of all, was tortured during four hundred years by a gnat sent by Allah up his ear or nostril.\n\n[FN#298] The absolute want of morality and filial affection in the chaste young man is supposed to be caused by the violence of his passion, and he would be pardoned because he \"loved much.\"\n\n[FN#299] I have noticed the geomantic process in my \"History of Sindh\" (chaps. vii.). It is called \"Zarb al-Ram!\" (strike the sand, the French say \"frapper le sable\") because the rudest form is to make on the ground dots at haphazard, usually in four lines one above the other: these are counted and, if even-numbered, two are taken ( ** ); if odd one ( * ); and thus the four lines will form a scheme say * * * * * * This is repeated three times, producing the same number of figures; and then the combination is sought in an explanatory table or, if the practitioner be expert, he pronounces off-hand. The Nights speak of a \"Takht Raml\" or a board, like a schoolboy's slate, upon which the dots are inked instead of points in sand. The moderns use a \"Kura'h,\" or oblong die, upon whose sides the dots, odd and even, are marked; and these dice are hand-thrown to form the e figure. By way of complication Geomancy is mixed up with astrology and then it becomes a most complicated kind of ariolation and an endless study. \"Napoleon's Book of Fate,\" a chap-book which appeared some years ago, was Geomancy in its simplest and most ignorant shape. For the rude African form see my Mission to Dahome, i. 332, and for that of Darfour, pp. 360-69 of Shaykh Mohammed's Voyage before quoted.\n\n[FN#300] Translators understand this of writing marriage contracts; I take it in a more general sense.\n\n[FN#301] These lines are repeated from Night Ixxv.: with Mr. Payne's permission I give his rendering (iii. 153) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#302] The comparison is characteristically Arab.\n\n[FN#303] Not her \"face\": the head, and especially the back of the head, must always be kept covered, even before the father.\n\n[FN#304] Arab. \"Siw\u00e1k\"=a tooth-stick; \"Siw\u00e1-ka\"=lit. other than thou.\n\n[FN#305] Arab. \"Ar\u00e1k\"=tooth stick of the wild caper-tree; \"Ar\u00e1-ka\" lit.=I see thee. The capparis spinosa is a common desert-growth and the sticks about a span long (usually called Misw\u00e1k), are sold in quantities at Meccah after being dipped in Zemzem water. In India many other woods are used, date-tree, Salvadora, Achyrantes, phyllanthus, etc. Amongst Arabs peculiar efficacy accompanies the tooth-stick of olive, \"the tree springing from Mount Sinai\" (Koran xxiii. 20); and Mohammed would use no other, because it prevents decay and scents the mouth. Hence Koran, chaps. xcv. 1. The \"Misw\u00e1k\" is held with the unused end between the ring-finger and minimus, the two others grasp the middle and the thumb is pressed against the back close to the lips. These articles have long been sold at the Medical Hall near the \"Egyptian Hall,\" Piccadilly. They are better than our unclean tooth-brushes because each tooth gets its own especial rubbing' not a general sweep; at the same time the operation is longer and more troublesome. In parts of Africa as well as Asia many men walk about with the tooth-stick hanging by a string from the neck.\n\n[FN#306] The \"Mehari,\" of which the Algerine-French speak, are the dromedaries bred by the Mahrah tribe of Al-Yaman, the descendants of Mahrat ibn Haydan. They are covered by small wild camels (?) called Al-H\u00fash, found between Oman and Al-Shihr: others explain the word to mean \"stallions of the Jinns \" and term those savage and supernatural animals, \"Naj\u00e1ib al-Mahriyah\"nobles of the Mahrah.\n\n[FN#307] Arab. \"Khaznah\"=a thousand purses; now about \u00a35000. It denotes a large sum of money, like the \"Badrah,\" a purse containing 10,000 dirhams of silver (Al-Hariri), or 80,000 (Burckhardt Prov. 380); whereas the \"Nis\u00e1b\" is a moderate sum of money, gen. 20 gold dinars=200 silver dirhams.\n\n[FN#308] As The Nights show, Arabs admire slender forms; but the hips and hinder cheeks must be highly developed and the stomach fleshy rather than lean. The reasons are obvious. The Persians who exaggerate everything say e.g. (Husayn V\u00e1iz in the Anv\u00e1r-i-Suhayli):\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          How paint her hips and waist ? Who saw\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          A mountain (Koh) dangling to a straw (k\u00e1h)?\n\nIn Antar his beloved Abla is a tamarisk (T. Orientalis). Others compare with the palm-tree (Solomon), the Cypress (Persian, esp. Hafiz and Firdausi) and the Ar\u00e1k or wild Capparis (Arab.).\n\n[FN#309] Ubi aves ibi angel). All African travellers know that a few birds flying about the bush, and a few palm-trees waving in the wind, denote the neighbourhood of a village or a camp (where angels are scarce). The reason is not any friendship for man but because food, animal and vegetable, is more plentiful Hence Albatrosses, Mother Carey's (Mater Cara, the Virgin) chickens, and Cape pigeons follow ships.\n\n[FN#310] The stanza is called Al-Mukhammas=cinquains; the quatrains and the \"bob,\" or \"burden\" always preserve the same consonance. It ends with a Koranic lieu commun of Moslem morality.\n\n[FN#311] Moslem port towns usually have (or had) only two gates. Such was the case with Bayrut, Tyre, Sidon and a host of others; the faubourg-growth of modern days has made these obsolete. The portals much resemble the entrances of old Norman castles\u2014Arques for instance. (Pilgrimage i. 185.)\n\n[FN#312] Arab. \"Lis\u00e1m\"; before explained.\n\n[FN#313] i.e. Life of Souls (persons, etc.).\n\n[FN#314] Arab. \"Ins\u00e1nu-h\u00e1\"=her (i.e. their) man: i.e. the babes of the eyes: the Assyrian Ishon, dim. of Ish=Man; which the Hebrews call \"B\u00e1bat\" or \"Bit\" (the daughter) the Arabs \"Bubu (or Hadakat) al-Aye\"; the Persians \"Mardumak-i-chashm\" (mannikin of the eye); the Greeks and the Latins pupa, pupula, pupilla. I have noted this in the Lyricks of Camoens (p. 449).\n\n[FN#315] Ma'an bin Z\u00e1'idah, a soldier and statesman of the eighth century.\n\n[FN#316] The mildness of the Caliph Mu'\u00e1wiyah, the founder of the Ommiades, proverbial among the Arabs, much resembles the \"meekness\" of Moses the Law-giver, which commentators seem to think has been foisted into Numbers xii. 3.\n\n[FN#317] Showing that there had been no consummation of the marriage which would have demanded \"Ghusl,\" or total ablution, at home or in the Hammam.\n\n[FN#318] I have noticed this notable desert-growth.\n\n[FN#319] 'The \"situation\" is admirable, solution appearing so difficult and catastrophe imminent.\n\n[FN#320] This quatrain occurs in Night ix.: I have borrowed from\nTorrens (p. 79) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#321] The belief that young pigeon's blood resembles the virginal discharge is universal; but the blood most resembling man's is that of the pig which in other points is so very human. In our day Arabs and Hindus rarely submit to inspection the nuptial sheet as practiced by the Israelites and Persians. The bride takes to bed a white kerchief with which she staunches the blood and next morning the stains are displayed in the Harem. In Darfour this is done by the bridegroom. \"Prima Venus debet esse cruenta,\" say the Easterns with much truth, and they have no faith in our complaisant creed which allows the hymen-membrane to disappear by any but one accident.\n\n[FN#322] Not meaning the two central divisions commanded by the\nKing and his Wazir.\n\n[FN#323] Ironic\u00e8.\n\n[FN#324] Arab. \"Rasy\"=praising in a funeral sermon.\n\n[FN#325] Arab. \"Man\u00e1y\u00e1,\" plur. of \"Maniyat\" = death. Mr. R. S. Poole (the Academy, April 26, 1879) reproaches Mr. Payne for confounding \"Muniyat\" (desire) with \"Maniyat\" (death) but both are written the same except when vowel-points are used.\n\n[FN#326] Arab. \"Iddat,\" alluding to the months of celibacy which, according to Moslem law, must be passed by a divorced woman before she can re-marry.\n\n[FN#327] Arab. \"Tal\u00e1k bi'l-Sal\u00e1sah\"=a triple divorce which cannot be revoked; nor can the divorcer re-marry the same woman till after consummation with another husband. This subject will continually recur.\n\n[FN#328] An allusion to a custom of the pagan Arabs in the days of ignorant Heathenism The blood or brain, soul or personality of the murdered man formed a bird called Sady or H\u00e1mah (not the Hum\u00e1 or Hum\u00e1i, usually translated \"phnix\") which sprang from the head, where four of the five senses have their seat, and haunted his tomb, crying continually, \"Usk\u00fani!\"=Give me drink (of the slayer's blood) ! and which disappeared only when the vendetta was accomplished. Mohammed forbade the belief. Amongst the Southern Slavs the cuckoo is supposed to be the sister of a murdered man ever calling or vengeance.\n\n[FN#329] To obtain a blessing and show how he valued it.\n\n[FN#330] Well-known tribes of proto-historic Arabs who flourished before the time of Abraham: see Koran (chaps. xxvi. et passim). They will be repeatedly mentioned in The Nights and notes.\n\n[FN#331] Arab. \"Amt\u00e1r\"; plur. of \"Matr,\" a large vessel of leather or wood for water, etc.\n\n[FN#332] Arab. \"As\u00e1f\u00edr\u00ed,\" so called because they attract sparrows (as\u00e1f\u00edr) a bird very fond of the ripe oily fruit. In the Romance of \"Antar\" As\u00e1f\u00edr camels are beasts that fly like birds in fleetness. The reader must not confound the olives of the text with the hard unripe berries (\"little plums pickled in stale\") which appear at English tables, nor wonder that bread and olives are the beef-steak and potatoes of many Mediterranean peoples It is an excellent diet, the highly oleaginous fruit supplying the necessary carbon,\n\n[FN#333] Arab. \"Tamer al-Hindi\"=the \"Indian-date,\" whence our word \"Tamarind.\" A sherbet of the pods, being slightly laxative, is much drunk during the great heats; and the dried fruit, made into small round cakes, is sold in the bazars. The traveller is advised not to sleep under the tamarind's shade, which is infamous for causing ague and fever. In Sind I derided the \"native nonsense,\" passed the night under an \"Indian date-tree\" and awoke with a fine specimen of ague which lasted me a week.\n\n[FN#334] Moslems are not agreed upon the length of the Day of Doom when all created things, marshalled by the angels, await final judgment; the different periods named are 40 years, 70, 300 and 50,000. Yet the trial itself will last no longer than while one may milk an ewe, or than \"the space between two milkings of a she-camel.\" This is bringing down Heaven to Earth with a witness; but, after all, the Heaven of all faiths, including \"Spiritualism,\" the latest development, is only an earth more or less glorified even as the Deity is humanity more or less perfected.\n\n[FN#335] Arab. \"Al-Kamar\u00e1ni,\" lit. \"the two moons.\" Arab rhetoric prefers it to \"Shams\u00e1ni,\" or {`two suns,\" because lighter (akhaff), to pronounce. So, albeit Omar was less worthy than Abu-Bakr the two are called \"Al-Omar\u00e1ni,\" in vulgar parlance, Omarayn.\n\n[FN#336] Alluding to the angels who appeared to the Sodomites in the shape of beautiful youths (Koran xi.).\n\n[FN#337] Koran xxxiii. 38.\n\n[FN#338] \"Niktu-hu taklidan\" i.e. not the real thing (with a woman). It may also mean \"by his incitement of me.\" All this scene is written in the worst form of Persian-Egyptian blackguardism, and forms a curious anthropological study. The \"black joke\" of the true and modest wife is inimitable.\n\n[FN#339] Arab. \"Jam\u00edz\" (in Egypt \"Jammayz\") = the fruit of the true sycomore (F. Sycomorus) a magnificent tree which produces a small tasteless fig, eaten by the poorer classes in Egypt and by monkeys. The \"T\u00edn\" or real fig here is the woman's parts; the \"mulberry- fig,\" the anus. Martial (i. 65) makes the following distinction:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Dicemus ficus, quas scimus in arbore nasci,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Dicemus ficos, Caeciliane, tuos.\n\nAnd Modern Italian preserves a difference between fico and fica.\n\n[FN#340] Arab. \"Gh\u00e1niyat Az\u00e1r\u00e1\" (plur. of Azr\u00e1 = virgin): the former is properly a woman who despises ornaments and relies on \"beauty unadorned\" (i.e. in bed).\n\n[FN#341] \"Nihil usitatius apud monachos, cardinales, sacrificulos,\" says Johannes de la Casa Beneventius Episcopus, quoted by Burton Anat. of Mel. lib. iii. Sect. 2; and the famous epitaph on the Jesuit,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Ci-git un Jesuite:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Passant, serre les fesses et passe vite!\n\n[FN#342] Arab. \"Kiblah\"=the fronting-place of prayer, Meccah for Moslems, Jerusalem for Jews and early Christians. See Pilgrimage (ii. 321) for the Moslem change from Jerusalem to Meccah and ibid. (ii. 213) for the way in which the direction was shown.\n\n[FN#343] The Koran says (chaps. ii.): \"Your wives are your tillage: go in therefore unto your tillage in what manner so ever ye will.\" Usually this is understood as meaning in any posture, standing or sitting, lying, backwards or forwards. Yet there is a popular saying about the man whom the woman rides (vulg. St. George, in France, le Postillon); \"Cursed be who maketh woman Heaven and himself earth!\" Some hold the Koranic passage to have been revealed in confutation of the Jews, who pretended that if a man lay with his wife backwards, he would beget a cleverer child. Others again understand it of preposterous venery, which is absurd: every ancient law-giver framed his code to increase the true wealth of the people\u2014population\u2014and severely punished all processes, like onanism, which impeded it. The Persians utilise the hatred of women for such misuse when they would force a wive to demand a divorce and thus forfeit her claim to Mahr (dowry); they convert them into catamites till, after a month or so, they lose all patience and leave the house.\n\n[FN#344] Koran lit 9: \"He will be turned aside from the Faith (or Truth) who shall be turned aside by the Divine decree;\" alluding, in the text, to the preposterous venery her lover demands.\n[FN#345] Arab. \"Fut\u00fah\" meaning openings, and also victories, benefits. The lover congratulates her on her mortifying self in order to please him.\n\n[FN#346] \"And the righteous work will be exalt\": (Koran xxxv. 11) applied ironically.\n\n[FN#347] A prolepsis of Tommy Moore:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         Your mother says, my little Venus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         There's something not quite right between us,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0               And you're in fault as much as I,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Now, on my soul, my little Venus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          I swear 'twould not be right between us,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0               To let your mother tell a lie.\n\nBut the Arab is more moral than Mr. Little. as he purposes to repent.\n\n[FN#348] Arab. \"Khunsa\" flexible or flaccid, from Khans=bending inwards, i.e. the mouth of a water-skin before drinking. Like Mukhannas, it is also used for an effeminate man, a passive sodomite and even for a eunuch. Easterns still believe in what Westerns know to be an impossibility, human beings with the parts and proportions of both sexes equally developed and capable of reproduction; and Al-Islam even provides special rules for them (Pilgrimage iii. 237). We hold them to be Buffon's fourth class of (duplicate) monsters belonging essentially to one or the other sex, and related to its opposite only by some few characteristics. The old Greeks dreamed, after their fashion, a beautiful poetic dream of a human animal uniting the contradictory beauties of man and woman. The duality of the generative organs seems an old Egyptian tradition, at least we find it in Genesis (i. 27) where the image of the Deity is created male and female, before man was formed out of the dust of the ground (ii. 7). The old tradition found its way to India (if the Hindus did not borrow the idea from the Greeks); and one of the forms of Mahadeva, the third person of their triad, is entitled \"Ardhan\u00e1r\u00ed\"=the Half-woman, which has suggested to them some charming pictures. Europeans, seeing the left breast conspicuously feminine, have indulged in silly surmises about the \"Amazons.\"\n\n[FN#349] This is a mere phrase for our \"dying of laughter\": the queen was on her back. And as Easterns sit on carpets, their falling back is very different from the same movement off a chair.\n\n[FN#350] Arab. \"Ismid,\" the eye-powder before noticed.\n\n[FN#351] When the Caliph (e.g. Al-T\u00e1'i li'llah) bound a banner to a spear and handed it to an officer, he thereby appointed him Sultan or Viceregent.\n\n[FN#352] Arab. \"Sh\u00e1ib al-ingh\u00e1z\"=lit. a gray beard who shakes head in disapproval.\n\n[FN#353] Arab. \"Ay\u00e1t\" = the Hebr. \"Ototh,\" signs, wonders or\nKoranic verses.\n\n[FN#354] The Chapter \"Al-Ikhl\u00e1s\" i.e. clearing (oneself from any faith but that of Unity) is No. cxii. and runs thus:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Say, He is the One God!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                The sempiternal God,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0           He begetteth not, nor is He begot,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0              And unto Him the like is not.\n\nIt is held to be equal in value to one-third of the Koran, and is daily used in prayer. Mr. Rodwell makes it the tenth.\n\n[FN#355] The Lady Budur shows her noble blood by not objecting to her friend becoming her Zarrat (sister-wife). This word is popularly derived from \"Zarar\"=injury; and is vulgarly pronounced in Egypt \"Durrah\" sounding like Durrah = a parrot (see Burckhardt's mistake in Prov. 314). The native proverb says, \"Ayshat al-durrah murrah,\" the sister-wife hath a bitter life. We have no English equivalent; so I translate indifferently co-wife, co-consort, sister-wife or sister in wedlock.\n\n[FN#356] Lane preserves the article \"El-Amjad\" and \"El-As'ad;\" which is as necessary as to say \"the John\" or \"the James,\" because neo-Latins have \"il Giovanni\" or \"il Giacomo.\" In this matter of the article, however, it is impossible to lay down a universal rule: in some cases it must be preserved and only practice in the language can teach its use. For instance, it is always present in Al-Bahrayn and al-Yaman; but not necessarily so with Irak and Najd.\n\n[FN#357] It is hard to say why this ugly episode was introduced.\nIt is a mere false note in a tune pretty enough.\n\n[FN#358] The significance of this action will presently appear.\n\n[FN#359] An \"Had\u00eds.\"\n\n[FN#360] Arab. \"Sabb\" = using the lowest language of abuse. chiefly concerning women-relatives and their reproductive parts.\n\n[FN#361] The reader will note in the narration concerning the two Queens the parallelism of the Arab's style which recalls that of the Hebrew poets. Strings of black silk are plaited into the long locks (an \"idiot-fringe\" being worn over the brow) because a woman is cursed \"who joineth her own hair to the hair of another\" (especially human hair). Sending the bands is a sign of affectionate submission; and, in extremes\" cases the hair itself is sent.\n\n[FN#362] i.e., suffer similar pain at the spectacle, a phrase often occurring.\n\n[FN#363] i.e., when the eye sees not, the heart grieves not.\n\n[FN#364] i.e., unto Him we shall return, a sentence recurring in almost every longer chapter of the Koran.\n\n[FN#365] Arab. \"Kun,\" the creative Word (which, by the by, proves the Koran to be an uncreated Logos); the full sentence being \"Kun fa k\u00e1na\" = Be! and it became. The origin is evidently, \"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light\" (Gen. i. 3); a line grand in its simplicity and evidently borrowed from the Egyptians, even as Yahveh (Jehovah) from \"Ankh\"=He who lives (Brugsch Hist. ii. 34).\n\n[FN#366] i.e. but also for the life and the so-called \"soul.\"\n\n[FN#367] Arab. \"Lay\u00e1li\"=lit. nights which, I have said, is often applied to the whole twenty-four hours. Here it is used in the sense of \"fortune\" or \"fate ;\" like \"days\" and \"days and nights.\"\n\n[FN#368] Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr a nephew of Ayishah, who had rebuilt the Ka'abah in A.H. 64 (A.D. 683), revolted (A.D. 680) against Yezid and was proclaimed Caliph at Meccah. He was afterwards killed (A.D. 692) by the famous or infamous Hajj\u00e1j general of Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, the fifth Ommiade, surnamed \"Sweat of a stone\" (skin-flint) and \"Father of Flies,\" from his foul breath. See my Pilgrimage, etc. (iii. 192-194), where are explained the allusions to the Ka'abah and the holy Black Stone.\n\n[FN#369] These lines are part of an elegy on the downfall of one of the Moslem dynasties in Spain, composed in the twelfth century by Ibn Abdun al-Andal\u00fasi. The allusion is to the famous conspiracy of the Kh\u00e1rijites (the first sectarians in Mohammedanism) to kill Ah, Mu'awiyah and Amru (so written but pronounced \"Amr\") al-As, in order to abate intestine feuds m Al-Islam. Ali was slain with a sword-cut by Ibn Muljam a name ever damnable amongst the Persians; Mu'awiyah escaped with a wound and Kharijah, the Chief of Police at Fustat or old Cairo was murdered by mistake for Amru. After this the sectarian wars began.\n\n[FN#370] Arab. \"Sar\u00e1b\"= (Koran, chaps. xxiv.) the reek of the Desert, before explained. It is called \"Lama,\" the shine, the loom, in Al-Hariri. The world is compared with the mirage, the painted eye and the sword that breaks in the sworder's hand.\n\n[FN#371] Arab. \"Duny\u00e1,\" with the common alliteration \"d\u00e1niyah\" (=Pers. \"d\u00fan\"), in prose as well as poetry means the things or fortune of this life opp. to \"Akhirah\"=future life.\n\n[FN#372] Arab. \"Walgh,\" a strong expression primarily denoting the lapping of dogs; here and elsewhere \"to swill, saufen.\"\n\n[FN#373] The lines are repeated from Night ccxxi. I give Lane's version (ii. 162) by way of contrast and\u2014warning.\n\n[FN#374] \"S\u00e1hirah\" is the place where human souls will be gathered on Doom-day: some understand by it the Hell Sa'\u00edr (No. iv.) intended for the Sabians or the Devils generally.\n\n[FN#375] His eyes are faded like Jacob's which, after weeping for Joseph, \"became white with mourning\" (Koran, chaps. xxi.). It is a stock comparison.\n\n[FN#376] The grave.\n\n[FN#377] Arab. \"Saww\u00e1n\" (popularly pronounced Suw\u00e1n) =\"Syenite\" from Syrene; generally applied to silex, granite or any hard stone.\n\n[FN#378] A proceeding fit only for thieves and paupers: \"Alpinism\" was then unknown. \"You come from the mountain\" (al-Jabal) means, \"You are a clod-hopper\"; and \"I will sit upon the mountain\"=turn anchorite or magician. (Pilgrimage i. 106.)\n\n[FN#379] Corresponding with wayside chapels in Catholic countries. The Moslem form would be either a wall with a prayer niche (Mibr\u00e1b) fronting Meccah-wards or a small domed room. These little oratories are often found near fountains, streams or tree-clumps where travellers would be likely to alight. I have described one in Sind (\"Scinde or the Unhappy Valley\" i. 79), and have noted that scrawling on the walls is even more common in the East than in the West; witness the monuments of old Egypt bescribbled by the Greeks and Romans. Even the paws of the Sphinx are covered with such graffiti; and those of Ipsambul or Abu S\u00edmbal have proved treasures to epigraphists.\n\n[FN#380] In tales this characterises a Persian; and Hero Rustam is always so pictured.\n\n[FN#381] The Parsis, who are the representatives of the old Guebres, turn towards the sun and the fire as their Kiblah or point of prayer; all deny that they worship it. But, as in the case of saints' images, while the educated would pray before them for edification (Labia) the ignorant would adore them (Dulia); and would make scanty difference between the \"reverence of a servant\" and the \"reverence of a slave.\" The human sacrifice was quite contrary to Guebre, although not to Hindu, custom; although hate and vengeance might prompt an occasional murder.\n\n[FN#382] These oubliettes are common in old eastern houses as in the medieval Castles of Europe, and many a stranger has met his death in them. They are often so well concealed that even the modern inmates are not aware of their existence.\n\n[FN#383] Arab. \"Bakk\"; hence our \"bug\" whose derivation (like that of \"cat\" \"dog\" and \"hog\") is apparently unknown to the dictionaries, always excepting M. Littr\u00e9's.\n\n[FN#384] i.e. thy beauty is ever increasing.\n\n[FN#385] Alluding, as usual, to the eye-lashes, e.g.\nAn eyelash arrow from an eyebrow bow.\n\n[FN#386] Lane (ii. 168) reads:\u2014\"The niggardly female is protected by her niggardness;\" a change of \"Nah\u00edlah\" (bee-hive) into \"Bakh\u00edlah\" (she skin flint).\n\n[FN#387] Koran iv. 38. The advantages are bodily strength, understanding and the high privilege of Holy War. Thus far, and thus far only, woman amongst Moslems is \"lesser\n\n[FN#388] Arab. \"Amir Y\u00e1kh\u00far,\" a corruption of \"Akhor\"=stable\n(Persian).\n\n[FN#389] A servile name in Persian, meaning \"the brave,\" and a title of honour at the Court of Delhi when following the name. Many English officers have made themselves ridiculous (myself amongst the number) by having it engraved on their seal-rings, e.g. Brown S\u00e1hib Bah\u00e1dur. To write the word \"Behadir\" or \"Bah\u00e1dir\" is to adopt the wretched Turkish corruption.\n\n[FN#390] \"Jerry Sneak\" would be the English reader's comment; but in the East all charges are laid upon women.\n\n[FN#391] Here the formula means \"I am sorry for it, but I couldn't help it.\"\n\n[FN#392] A noble name of the Persian Kings (meaning the planet\nMars) corrupted in Europe to Varanes.\n\n[FN#393] Arab. \"Jall\u00e1b,\" one of the three muharram\u00e1t or forbiddens, the H\u00e1rik al-hajar (burner of stone) the K\u00e1ti' al-shajar (cutter of trees, without reference to Hawarden N. B.) and the B\u00e1yi' al-bashar (seller of men, vulg. Jall\u00e1b). The two former worked, like the Italian Carbonari, in desert places where they had especial opportunities for crime. (Pilgrimage iii. 140.) None of these things must be practiced during Pilgrimage on the holy soil of Al-Hijaz\u2014not including Jeddah.\n\n[FN#394] The verses contain the tenets of the Murjiy sect which attaches infinite importance to faith and little or none to works. Sale (sect. viii.) derives his \"Morgians\" from the \"Jabrians\" (Jabari), who are the direct opponents of the \"Kadarians\" (Kadari), denying free will and free agency to man and ascribing his actions wholly to Allah. Lane (ii. 243) gives the orthodox answer to the heretical question:\u2014\n\nWater could wet him not if God please guard His own; *\nNor need man care though bound of hands in sea he's thrown:\nBut if His Lord decree that he in sea be drowned; *\nHe'll drown albeit in the wild and wold he wone.\n\nIt is the old quarrel between Predestination and Freewill which cannot be solved except by assuming a Law without a Lawgiver.\n\n[FN#395] Our proverb says: Give a man luck and throw him into the sea.\n\n[FN#396] As a rule Easterns, I repeat, cover head and face when sleeping especially in the open air and moonlight. Europeans find the practice difficult, and can learn it only by long habit.\n\n[FN#397] Pers. = a flower-garden. In Galland, Bahram has two daughters, Bostama and Cavam a. In the Bres. Edit. the daughter is \"Bostan\" and the slave-girl \"Kaw\u00e1m.\"\n\n[FN#398] Arab. \"Kah\u00edl\"=eyes which look as if darkened with antimony: hence the name of the noble Arab breed of horses \"Kuhaylat\" (Al-Ajuz, etc.).\n\n[FN#399] \"As'ad\"=more (or most) fortunate.\n\n[FN#400] This is the vulgar belief, although Mohammed expressly disclaimed the power in the Koran (chaps. xiii. 8), \"Thou art commissioned to be a preacher only and not a worker of miracles.\" \"Signs\" (Arab. Ay\u00e1t) may here also mean verses of the Koran, which the Apostle of Allah held to be his standing miracles. He despised the common miracula which in the East are of everyday occurrence and are held to be easy for any holy man. Hume does not believe in miracles because he never saw one. Had he travelled in the East he would have seen (and heard of) so many that his scepticism (more likely that testimony should be false than miracles be true) would have been based on a firmer foundation. It is one of the marvels of our age that whilst two-thirds of Christendom (the Catholics and the \"Orthodox\" Greeks) believe in \"miracles\" occurring not only in ancient but even in our present days, the influential and intelligent third (Protestant) absolutely \"denies the fact.\"\n\n[FN#401] Arab. \"Al-Shah\u00e1dat\u00e1ni\"; testifying the Unity and the\nApostleship.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/6477394", "artist_names": "The Rat Pack (Ft.

THE PERCEPTION OF \u2018THINGS.\u2019 LyricsPERCEPTION AND SENSATION COMPARED.\n\nA PURE sensation we saw above, p. 7, to be an abstraction never realized in adult life. Any quality of a thing which affects our sense organs does also more than that: it arouses processes in the hemispheres which are due to the organization of that organ by past experiences, and the result of which in consciousness are commonly described as ideas which the sensation suggests. The first of these ideas is that of the thing to which the sensible quality belongs. The consciousness of particular material things present to sense is nowadays called perception\" [1] The consciousness of such things may be more or less complete; it may be of the mere name of the thing and its other essential attributes, or it may be of the thing's various remoter relations. It is impossible to draw any sharp line of distinction between the barer and the richer consciousness, because the moment we get beyond the first crude sensation all our consciousness is a matter of suggestion, and the various suggestions shade gradually into each other, being one and all products of the same psychological machinery of association. In the directer consciousness fewer, in the remoter more, associative processes are brought into play.\n\nPerception thus differs from sensation by the consciousness of farther facts associated with the object of the sensation:\n\n\" When I lift my eyes from the paper on which I am writing I see the chairs and tables and walls of my room, each of its proper shape and at its proper distance. I see, from my window, trees and meadows, and horses and oxen, and distant hills. I see each of its proper size, of its proper form, and at its proper distance; and these particulars appear as immediate information of the eye, as the colors which I see by means of it. Yet philosophy has ascertained that we derive nothing from the eye whatever but sensations of color.... How, then, is it that we receive accurate information, by the eye, of size and shape and distance? By association merely. The colors upon a body are different, according to its figure, its shape, and its size. But the sensations of color and what we may here, for brevity, call the sensations of extension, of figure, of distance, have been so often united, felt in conjunction, that the sensation of the color is never experienced without raising the ideas of the extension, the figure, the distance, in such intimate union with it, that they. not only cannot be separated, but are actually supposed to be seen. The sight, as it is called, of figure, or distance, appearing as it does a simple sensation, is in reality a complex state of consciousness -- a sequence in which the antecedent, a sensation of color, and the consequent, a number of ideas, are so closely combined by association that they appear not one idea, but one sensation.\"\n\nThis passage from James Mill [2] gives a clear statement of the doctrine which Berkeley in his Theory of Vision made for the first time an integral part of Psychology. Berkeley compared our visual sensations to the words of a language, which are but signs or occasions for our intellects to pass to what the speaker means. As the sounds called words have no inward affinity with the ideas they signify, so neither have our visual sensations, according to Berkeley, any inward affinity with the things of whose presence they make us aware. Those things are tangible; their real properties, such as shape, size, mass, consistency, position, reveal themselves only to touch. But the visible signs and the tangible significates are by long custom so \"closely twisted, blended, and incorporated together, and the prejudice is so confirmed and riveted in our thoughts by a long tract of time, by the use of language, and want of reflection,\" [3] that we think we see the whole object, tangible and visible alike, in one simple indivisible act.\n\nSensational and reproductive brain-processes combined, then, are what give us the content of our perceptions. Every concrete particular material thing is a conflux of sensible qualities, with which we have become acquainted at various times. Some of these qualities, since they are more constant, interesting, or practically important, we regard as essential constituents of the thing. In a general way, such are the tangible shape, size, mass, etc. Other properties, being more fluctuating, we regard as more or less accidental or inessential. We call the former qualities the reality, the latter its appearances. Thus, I hear a sound, and say 'a horse-car'; but the sound is not the horse-car, it is one of the horse-car's least important manifestations. The real horse-car is a feelable, or at most a feelable and visible, thing which in my imagination the sound calls up. So when I get, as now, a brown eye-picture with lines not parallel, and with angles unlike, and call it my big solid rectangular walnut library-table, that picture is not the table. It is not even like the table as the table is for vision, when rightly seen. It is a distorted perspective view of three of the sides of what I mentally perceive (more or less) in its totality and undistorted shape. The back of the table, its square corners, its size, its heaviness, are features of which I am conscious when I look, almost as I am conscious of its name. The suggestion of the name is of course due to mere custom. But no less is that of the back, the size, weight, squareness, etc.\nNature, as Reid says, is frugal in her operations, and will not be at the expense of a particular instinct to give us that knowledge which experience and habit will soon produce. Reproduced sights and contacts tied together with the present sensation in the unity of a thing with a name, these are the complex objective stuff out of which my actually perceived table is made. Infants must go through a long education of the eye and ear before they can perceive the realities which adults perceive. Every perception is an acquired perception.\" [4]\n\nPerception may then be defined, in Mr. Sully's words, as that process by which the mind\n\n\"supplements a sense-impression by an accompaniment or escort of revived sensations, the whole aggregate of actual and revived sensations being solidified or 'integrated' into the form of a percept, that is, an apparently immediate apprehension or cognition of an object now present in a particular locality or region of space.\" [5]\n\nEvery reader's mind will supply abundant examples of tire process here described; and to write them down would be therefore both unnecessary and tedious. In the chapter on Space we have already discussed some of the more interesting ones; for in our perceptions of shape and position it is really difficult to decide how much of our sense of the object is due to reproductions of past experience, and how much to the immediate sensations of the eye. I shall accordingly confine myself in the rest of this chapter to certain additional generalities connected with the perceptive process.\n\nThe first point is relative to that 'solidification' or 'integration,' whereof Mr. Sully speaks, of the present with the absent and merely represented sensations. Cerebrally taken, these words mean no more than this, that the process aroused in the sense-organ has shot into various paths which habit has already organized in the hemispheres, and that instead of our having the sort of consciousness which would be correlated with the simple sensorial process, we have that which is correlated with this more complex process. This, as it turns out, is the consciousness of that more complex 'object,' the whole 'thing,' instead of being the consciousness of that more simple object, the few qualities or attributes which actually impress our peripheral nerves. This consciousness must have the unity which every 'section' of our stream of thought retains so long as its objective content does not sensibly change. More than this we cannot say; we certainly ought not to say what usually is said by psychologists, and treat the perception as a sum of distinct psychic entities, the present sensation namely, plus a lot of images from the past, all 'integrated' together in a way impossible to describe. The perception is one state of mind or nothing -- as I have already so often said.\n\nIn many cases it is easy to compare the psychic results of the sensational with those of the perceptive process. We then see a marked difference in the way in which the impressed portions of the object are felt, in consequence of being cognized along with the reproduced portion, in the higher state of mind. Their sensible quality changes under our very eye. Take the already-quoted catch, Pas de lieu Rhone que nous: one may read this over and over again without recognizing the sounds to be identical with those of the words paddle your own canoe. As we seize the English meaning the sound itself appears to change. Verbal sounds are usually perceived with their meaning at the moment of being heard. Sometimes, however, the associative irradiations are inhibited for a few moments (the mind being preoccupied with other thoughts) whilst the words linger on the ear as mere echoes of acoustic sensation. Then, usually, their interpretation suddenly occurs. But at that moment one may often surprise a change in the very feel of the word. Our own language would sound very different to us if we heard it without understanding, as we hear a foreign tongue. Rises and falls of voice, odd sibilants and other consonants, would fall on our ear in a way of which we can now form no notion. Frenchmen say that English sounds to them like the gazouillement des oiseaux: -- an impression which it certainly makes on no native ear. Many of us English would describe the sound of Russian in similar terms. All of us are conscious of the strong inflections of voice and explosives and gutturals of German speech in a way in which no German can be conscious of them.\n\nThis is probably the reason why, if we look at an isolated printed word and repeat it long enough, it ends by assuming an entirely unnatural aspect. Let the reader try this with any word on this page. He will soon begin to wonder if it can possibly be the word he has been using all his life with that meaning. It stares at him from the paper like a glass eye, with no speculation in it. Its body is indeed there, but its soul is fled. It is reduced, by this new way of attending to it, to its sensational nudity. We never before attended to it in this way, but habitually got it clad with its meaning the moment we caught sight of it, and rapidly passed from it to the other words of the phrase. We apprehended it, in short, with a cloud of associates, and thus perceiving it, we felt it quite otherwise than as we feel it now divested and alone.\n\nAnother well-known change is when we look at a landscape with our head upside down. Perception is to a certain extent baffled by this manoeuvre; gradations of distance and other space-determinations are made uncertain; the reproductive or associative processes, in short, decline; and, simultaneously with their diminution, the colors grow richer and more varied, and the contrasts of light and shade more marked. The same thing occurs when we turn a painting bottom upward. We lose much of its meaning, but, to compensate for the loss, we feel more freshly the value of the mere tints and shadings, and become aware of any lack of purely sensible harmony or balance which they may show. [6] Just so, if we lie on the floor and look up at the mouth of a person talking behind us. His lower lip here takes the habitual place of the upper one upon our retina, and seems animated by the most extraordinary an unnatural mobility, a mobility which now strikes us because (the associative processes being disturbed by the unaccustomed point of view) we get it as a naked sensation and not as part of a familiar object perceived. On a later page other instances will meet us. For the present these are enough to prove our point. Once more we find ourselves driven to admit that when qualities of an object impress our sense and we thereupon perceive object, the sensation as such of those qualities does not still exist inside of the perception and form a constituent thereof. The sensation is one thing and tile perception another, and neither can take place at the same time with the other, because their cerebral conditions are not the same. They may resemble each other, but in no respect are they identical states of mind.\n\nPERCEPTION IS OF DEFINITE AND PROBABLE THINGS.\n\nThe chief cerebral conditions of perception are the paths of association irradiating from the sense-impression, which may have been already formed. If a certain sensation be strongly associated with the attributes of a certain thing, that thing is almost sure to be perceived when we get the sensation. Examples of such things would be familiar people, places, etc., which we recognize and name at a glance. But where the sensation is associated with more than one reality, so that either of two discrepant sets of residual properties may arise, the perception is doubtful and vacillating, and the most that can then be said of it is that it will be of a PROBABLE thing, of the thing which would most usually have given us that sensation.\n\nIn these ambiguous cases it is interesting to note that perception is rarely abortive; some perception takes place. The two discrepant sets of associates do not neutralize each other or mix and make a blur. That we more commonly get is first one object in its completeness, and then the other in its completeness. In other words, all brain-processes are such as give rise to what we may call FIGURED consciousness. If paths are irradiated at all, they are irradiated in consistent systems, and occasion thoughts of definite objects, not mere hodge-podges of elements. Even where the brain's functions are half thrown out of gear, as in aphasia or dropping asleep, this law of figured consciousness holds good. A person who suddenly gets sleepy whilst reading aloud will read wrong; but instead of emitting a mere broth of syllables, he will make such mistakes as to read 'supper-time' instead of 'sovereign,' 'overthrow' instead of 'opposite, or indeed utter entirely imaginary phrases, composed of several definite words, instead of phrases of the book. So in aphasia: where the disease is mild the patient's mis- takes consist in using entire wrong words instead of right ones. It is only in grave lesions that he becomes quite inarticulate. These facts show how subtle is the associative link; how delicate yet how strong that connection among brain-paths which makes any number of them, once excited together, thereafter tend to vibrate as a systematic whole. A small group of elements, 'this,' common to two systems, A and B, may touch off A or B according as accident decides the next step (see Fig. 47). If it happen that a single point leading from 'this' to B is momentarily a little more pervious than any leading from 'this' to A, then that little advantage will upset the equilibrium in favor of the entire system B. The currents will sweep first through that point and thence into all the paths of B, each increment of advance making A more and more impossible. The thoughts correlated with A and B, in such a case, will have objects different, though similar. The similarity will, however, consist in some very limited feature if the 'this' be small. Thus the faintest sensations will give rise to the perception of definite things if only they resemble those which the things are wont to arouse. In fact, a sensation must be strong and distinct in order not to suggest an object and, if it is a non-descript feeling, really to seem one. The aur\u00e6 of epilepsy, globes of light, fiery vision, roarings in the ears, the sensations which electric currents give rise to when passed through head, these are unfigured because they are strong. Weaker feelings of the same sort would probably suggest objects. Many years ago, after reading daury's book, Le Sommeil et lee R\u00eaves, I began for the first time to observe ideas which faintly hit through the mind at all times ,visions, etc., disconnected with the main stream of thought, but discernible to an attention on the watch for them. A horse's head, a coil of rope, an anchor, are, for example, ideas which have come to me unsolicited whilst I have been writing these latter lines. They can often be explained by subtle links of association, often not at all. But I have not a few times been surprised, after noting some such idea, to find, on shutting my eyes, an after-image left on the retina by some bright or dark object recently looked at, and which had evidently suggested the idea. 'Evidently,' I say, because the general shape, size, and position of object thought -- of and of after-image were the same, although the idea had details which the retinal image lacked. We shall probably never know just what part retinal after-images play in determining the train of our thoughts. Judging by my own experiences I should suspect it of being not insignificant [7]\n\nIllusions Let us now, for brevity's sake, treat A and B in Fig, 47 as if they stood for objects instead of brain-processes. And let us furthermore suppose that A and B are, both of them, objects which might probably excite the sensation which I have called 'this,' but that on the present occasion A and not B is the one which actually does so. If, then, on this occasion 'this' suggests A and not B, the result is a correct perception. But if, on the contrary, 'this' suggests B and not A, the result is a false perception, or, as it is technically called, an illusion. But the process is the same, whether the perception be true or false. Note that in every illusion what is false is what is inferred, not what is immediately given. The 'this,' if it were felt by itself alone, would be all right, it only becomes misleading by what it suggests. If it is a sensation of sight, it may suggest a tactile object, for example, which Inter tactile experiences prove to be not there. The so-called 'fallacy of the senses,' of which the ancient sceptics made so much account, is not fallacy of the senses proper, but rather of the intellect, which interprets wrongly what the senses give. [8]\n\nSo much premised, let us look a little closer at these illusions. They are due to two main causes. The wrong object is perceived either because\n1) Although not on this occasion the real cause, it is yet the habitual, inveterate, or most probable cause of 'this; ' or because\n\n2) The mind is temporarily full of the thought of that object, and therefore 'this' is peculiarly prone to suggest it at this moment. I will give briefly a number of examples under each head. The first head is the more important, because it includes a, number of constant illusions to which all men are subject, and which call only be dispelled by much experience.\n\nIllusions of the First Type.\n\nOne of the oldest instances dates from Aristotle. Cross two fingers and roll a pea, penholder, or other small object between them. It will seem double. Professor Groom Robertson has given the dearest analysis of this illusion. He observes that if the object be brought into contact first with the forefinger and next with the second finger, the two contacts seem to come in at different points of space. The forefinger-touch seems higher, though the finger is really lower; the second-finger-touch seems lower, though the finger is really higher. \"We perceive the contacts as double because we refer them to two distinct parts of space.\" The touched sides of the two fingers are normally not together in space, and customarily never do touch one thing; the one thing which now touches them, therefore, seems in two places, i.e. seems two things. [9]\n\nThere is a whole batch of illusions which come from optical sensations interpreted by us in accordance with our usual rule, although they are now produced by an unusual object. The stereoscope is an example. The eyes see a picture apiece, and the two pictures are a little disparate, the one seen by the right eye being a, view of the object taken from a point slightly to the right of that from which the left eye's picture is taken. Pictures thrown on the two eyes by solid objects present this identical disparity. Whence we react on the sensation in our usual way, and perceive a solid. If the pictures be exchanged we perceive a hollow mould of the object, for a hollow mould would cast just such disparate pictures as these. Wheatstone's instrument, the pseudoscope, allows us to look at solid objects and see with each eye the other eye's picture. We then perceive the solid object hollow, if it be an object which might probably be hollow, but not otherwise. A human face, e.g., never appears hollow to the pseudoscope. In this irregularity of reaction on different objects, some seem hollow, others not; the perceptive process is true to its ,which is always to react on the sensation, in a determinate and figured fashion if possible, and in as probable fashion as the case admits. To couple faces and hollow ness violates all our habits of association. For the same reason it is very easy to make an intaglio cast of a face, or the painted inside of a pasteboard mask, look convex, instead of concave as they are.\n\nOur sense of the position of things with respect to our eye consists in suggestions of how we must move our hand to touch them. Certain places of the image on the retina, certain actively-produced positions of the eyeballs, are normally linked with the sense of every determinate position which an outer thing may come to occupy. Since we perceive the usual position, even if the optical sensation be artificially brought from a different part of space. Prisms warp the light-rays in this way, and throw upon the retina the image of an object situated, say, at spot a of space in the same manner in which (without the prisms) an object situated at spot b would cast its image [sic] Accordingly we feel for the object at b instead of a. If the prism be before one eye only we see the object at b with that eye, and in its right position a with the other -- in other words, we see it double. If both eyes be armed with prisms with their angle towards the right, we pass our hand to the right of all objects when we try rapidly to touch them. And this illusory sense of their position lasts until a new association is fixed, when on removing the prisms a contrary illusion at first occurs. Passive or unintentional changes in the position of the eyeballs seem to be no more kept account of by the mind than prisms are; so we spontaneously make no allowance for them in our perception of distance and movements. Press one of the eyeballs into a strained position with the anger, and objects move and are translocated accordingly, just as when prisms are used.\n\nCurious illusions of movement in objects occur whenever the eyeballs move without our intending it. We shall learn in the following chapter that the original visual feeling of movement is produced by any image passing over the retina. Originally, however, this sensation is definitely referred neither to the object nor to the eyes. Such definite reference grows up later, and obeys certain simple laws. We believe objects to move: 1) whenever we get the retinal movement-feeling, but think our eyes are still; and 2) when- ever we think that our eyes move, but fail to get the retinal movement-feeling. We believe objects to be still, on the contrary, 1) whenever we get the retinal movement-feeling, but think our eyes are moving; and 2) whenever we neither think our eyes are moving, nor get the retinal movement-feeling. Thus the perception of the object's state of motion or rest depends on the notion we frame of our own eye's movement. Now many sorts of stimulation make our eyes move without our knowing it. If we look at a waterfall, river, railroad train, or any body which continuously passes in front of us in the same direction, it carries our eyes with it. This movement can be noticed in our eyes by a by-stander. If the object keep passing towards our left, our eyes keep following whatever moving bit of it may have caught their attention at first, until that bit disappears from view. Then they jerk back to the right again, and catch a new bit, which again they follow to the left, and so on indefinitely. This gives them an oscillating demeanor, slow involuntary rotations leftward alternating with rapid voluntary jerks rightward. Put the oscillations continue for a while after the object has come to a standstill, or the eyes are carried to a new object, and this produces the illusion that things now move in the opposite direction. For are unaware of the slow leftward automatic movements our eyeballs, and think that the retinal movement-sensations thereby aroused must be due to a rightward motion the object seen; whilst the rapid voluntary rightward movements of our eyeballs we interpret as attempts to pursue and catch again those parts of the object which have been slipping away to the left.\n\nExactly similar oscillations of the eyeballs are produced giddiness, with exactly similar results. Giddiness is easiest produced by whirling on our heels. It is a feeling of movement of our own head and body through space, is now pretty well understood to be due to the irritation of the semi-circular canals of the inner ear. [10] When, after whirling, we stop, we seem to be spinning in the reverse direction for a few seconds, and then objects appear to continue whirling in the same direction in which, a moment previous, our body actually whirled. The reason is that our eyes normally tend to maintain their field of view. If we suddenly turn our head leftwards it is hard to make the eyes follow. They roll in their orbits rightwards, by a, sort of compensating inertia. Even though we falsely think our head to be moving leftwards, this consequence occurs, and our eyes move rightwards -- as may be observed in any one with vertigo after whirling. As these movements are unconscious, the retinal movement-feelings which they occasion are naturally referred to the objects seen. And the intermittent voluntary twitches of the eyes towards the left, by which we ever and anon recover them from the extreme rightward positions to which the reflex movement brings them, simply conform and intensify our impression of a leftward-whirling field of view: we seem to ourselves to be periodically pursuing and overtaking the objects in their leftward flight. The whole phenomenon fades out after a few seconds. And it often ceases if we voluntarily fix our eyes upon a given point. [11]\n\n0ptical vertigo, as these illusions of objective movement are called, results sometimes from brain-trouble, intoxications, paralysis, etc. A man will awaken with a, weakness of one of his eye-muscles. An intended orbital rotation will then not produce its expected result in the way of retinal movement-feeling-whence false perceptions, of which one of the most interesting cases will fall to be discussed in later chapters. There is an illusion of movement of the opposite sort, with which every one is familiar at railway stations. Habitually, when we ourselves move forward, our entire field of view glides backward over our retina. When our movement is due to that of the windowed carriage, car, or boat in which we sit, all stationary objects visible through the window give us a sensation of gliding in the opposite direction. Hence, whenever we get this sensation, of a window with all objects visible through it moving in one direction, we react upon it in our customary way, and perceive a stationary field of view, over which the window, and we ourselves inside of it, are passing by a motion of our own. Consequently when another train comes alongside of ours in a station, and fills the entire window, and, after standing still awhile, begins to glide away, we judge that it is our train which is moving, and that the other train is still. If, however, we catch a glimpse of any part of the station through the windows, or between the cars, of the other train, the illusion of our own movement instantly disappears, and we perceive the other train to be the one in motion. This, again, is but making the usual and probable inference from our sensation. [12]\n\nAnother illusion due to movement is explained by Helmholtz. Most wayside objects, houses, trees, etc., look small when seen out of the windows of a swift train. This is because we perceive them in the first instance unduly near. And we perceive them unduly near because of their extra-ordinarily rapid parallactic flight backwards. When we ourselves more forward all objects glide backwards, as aforesaid; but the nearer they are, the more rapid is this apparent translocation. Relative rapidity of passage back-wards is thus so familiarly associated with nearness that when we feel it we perceive nearness. But with a given size of retinal image the nearer an object is, the smaller do judge its actual size to be. Hence in the train, the faster we go, the nearer do the trees and houses seem, and nearer they seem, the smaller do they look. [13]\n\nOther illusions are due to the feeling of convergence being interpreted. When we converge our eyeballs we an approximation of whatever thing we may be at. Whatever things do approach whilst we look at them oblige us, so long as they are not very distant, to converge our eyes. Hence approach of the thing is the probable objective fact when we feel our eyes converging. Now in most persons the internal recti muscles, to which convergence is due, are weaker than the others; and the entirely passive position of the eyeballs, the position which they assume when covered end looking at nothing in particular, is either that of parallelism or of slight divergence. Make a person look with both eyes at some near object, and then screen the object from one of his eyes by a card or book. The chances are that you will see the eye thus screened turn just a little outwards. Remove the screen, and you will now see it turn in as it catches sight of the object again. The other eye meanwhile keeps as it was at first. To most persons, accordingly, all objects seem to come nearer when, after looking at them with one eye, both eyes are used; and they seem to recede during the opposite change. With persons whose external recti muscles are insufficient, the illusions may be of the contrary kind. The size of the retinal image is a fruitful source of illusions. Normally, the retinal image grows larger as the object draws near. But the sensation yielded by this enlargement is also given by any object which really grows in size without changing its distance. Enlargement of retinal image is therefore an ambiguous sign. An opera-glass enlarges the moon. But most persons will tell you that she looks smaller through it, only a great deal nearer and brighter. They read the enlargement as a sign of approach; and the perception of approach makes them actually reverse the sensation which suggests it-by an exaggeration of our habitual custom of making allowance of the apparent enlargement of whatever object approaches us, and reducing it in imagination to its natural size. Similarly, in the theatre the glass brings the stage near, but hardly seems to magnify the people on it.\n\nThe well-known increased apparent size of the moon on the horizon is a result of association and probability. It is seen through vaporous air, and looks dimmer and duskier than when it rides on high; and it is seen over fields, trees, hedges, streams, and the like, which break up the intervening space and make us the better realize the latter's extent Both these causes make the moon seem more distant from us when it is low; and as its visual angle grows no less, deem that it must be a larger body, and we so perceive it. It looks particularly enormous when it comes up directly behind some well-known large object, as a house or tree distant enough to subtend an angle no larger than that the moon itself. [14]\n\nThe feeling of accommodation also gives rise to false perceptions of size. Usually we accommodate our eyes for an object as it approaches us. Usually under these circumstances the object throws a larger retinal image. But believing the object to remain the same, we make allowance for this and treat the entire eye-feeling which we receive significant of nothing but approach. When we relax accommodation and at the same time the retinal image grows smaller, the probable cause is always a receding object. The moment we put on convex glasses, however, the accommodation relaxes, but the retinal image grows larger instead of less. This is what would happen if object, whilst receding, grew. Such a probable object we accordingly perceive, though with a certain vacillation as to the recession, for the growth in apparent size is also a probable sign of approach, and is at moments interpreted accordingly. -- Atropin paralyzes the muscles of accommodation. It is possible to get a dose which will weaken these muscles without laming them altogether. When a known near object is then looked at we have to make the voluntary strain to accommodate, as if it were a great deal nearer; but as its retinal image is not enlarged in proportion to this suggested approach, we deem that it must have grown smaller than usual. In consequence of this so-called micropsy, Aubert relates that he saw a man apparently no larger then a photograph. But the small made the man seem farther off. The real distance was two or three feet, and he seemed against the wall of the room. [15] Of these vacillations we shall have to speak again in the ensuing chapter. [16]\nMrs. C. L. Franklin has recently described and explained with rare acuteness an illusion of which the most curious thing is that it was never noticed before. Take a single pair of crossed lines (Fig. 49), hold them in a horizontal plane before the eyes, and look along them, at such a distance that with the right eye shut, 1, and with the left eye shut, 2, looks like the projection of a vertical line. Look steadily now at the point of intersection of the lines with both eyes open, and you will see a third line sticking up like a pin through the paper at right angles to the plane of the two first lines. The explanation of this illusion is very simple, but so circumstantial that I must refer for it to Mrs. Franklin's own account. [17] Suffice it that images of the two lines fell on 'corresponding' rows of retinal points, and that the illusory vertical line is the only object capable of throwing such images. A variation of the experiment is this:\n\n\"In Fig. 50 the lines are all drawn so as to pass through a common point. With a little trouble one eye can be put into the position of this point -- it is only necessary that the paper be held so that, with one eye shut, the other eye sees all the lines leaning neither to the right nor to the left. After a moment one can fancy the lines to be vertical staffs standing out of the plane of the paper.... This illusion [says Mrs. Franklin] [18] I take to be of purely mental origin. When a line lies anywhere in a plane passing through the apparent vertical meridian of one eye, and is looked at with that eye only.... we have no very good means of knowing how it is directed in that plane.... Now of the lines in nature which lie anywhere within such a plane, by far the a number are vertical lines. Hence we are peculiarly inclined to think that a line which we perceive to be in such a plane is a vertical line. But to see a lot of lines at once, all ready to throw their images upon the vertical meridian, is a thing that has hardly ever happened to except when they all have been vertical lines. Hence when that happens we have a still stronger tendency to think that what we see before us is a group of vertical lines.\"\n\nIn other words, we see, as always, the most probable object. The foregoing may serve as examples of the first type illusions mentioned on page 86. I could cite of course many others, but it would be tedious to enumerate all the thaumatropes and zoetropes, dioramas, and juggler's tricks which they are embodied. In the chapter on Sensation sew that many illusions commonly ranged under this are, physiologically considered, of another sort altogether, and that associative processes, strictly so called, \u00b7 nothing to do with their production.\n\nIllusions of the Second Type.\n\nWe may now turn to illusions of the second of the two type discriminated on page 86. In this type we perceive a wrong object because our mind is full of the thought of it time, and any sensation which is in the least degree connected with it touches off, as it were, a train already laid and gives us a sense that the object is really before us. Here is a familiar example:\n\n\"a sportsman, while shooting woodcock in cover, sees a bird ;the size and color of a woodcock get up and By through the foli- age, not having time to see more than that it is a bird of such a size and color, he immediately supplies by inference the other qualities of a woodcock, and is afterwards disgusted to find that he has shot a thrush. I have done so myself, and could hardly believe that the thrush was the bird I had fired at, so complete was my mental supplement to my visual perception.\" [19]\n\nAs with game, so with enemies, ghosts, and the like Anyone waiting in a dark place and expecting or fearing strongly a certain object will interpret any abrupt sensation to mean that object's presence. The boy playing 'I spy,' the criminal skulking from his pursuers, the superstitious person hurrying through the woods or past the church-yard at midnight, the man lost in the woods, the girl who tremulously has made an evening appointment with her swain, all are subject to illusions of sight and sound which make their hearts beat till they are dispelled. Twenty times a day the lover, perambulating the streets with his preoccupied fancy, will think he perceives his idol's bonnet before him.\n\nThe Proof-reader's Illusion. I remember one night in Boston, whilst waiting for a, 'Mount Auburn' car to bring me to Cambridge, reading most distinctly that name upon the signboard of a car on which (as I afterwards learned) 'North Avenue' was painted. The illusion was so vivid that I could hardly believe my eyes had deceived me. All reading is more or less performed in this way.\n\n\"Practised novel -- or newspaper-readers could not possibly get on so fast if they had to see accurately every single letter of every word in order to perceive the words. More than half of the words come out of their mind, and hardly half from the printed page. Were this not so, did we perceive each letter by itself, typographic errors in well-known words would never be overlooked. Children, whose ideas are not yet ready enough to perceive words at a glance, read them wrong if they are printed wrong, that is, right according to the way of printing. In a foreign language, although it may Be printed with the same letters, we read by so much the more slowly as we do not understand, or are unable promptly to perceive the words. But we notice misprints all the more readily. For this reason Latin and Greek and, still better, Hebrew works are more correctly printed, because the proofs are better corrected, than in German works. Of two friends of mine, one knew much Hebrew, the other little ; the latter, however, gave instruction in Hebrew in a gymnasium; and when he called the other to help correct his pupils' exercises, it turned out that he could find out all sorts little errors better than his friend, because the latter's perception of the words as totals was too swift.\" [20]\n\nTestimony to personal identity is proverbially fallacious for similar reasons. A man has witnessed a rapid crime or accident, and carries away his mental image. Later he is fronted by a prisoner whom he forthwith perceives in light of that image, and recognizes or 'identifies' as participant, although he may never have been near that spot. Similarly at the so-called 'materializing se\u00e9ances which fraudulent mediums give: in a dark room a man sees a gauze-robed figure who in a whisper tells him she is the spirit of his sister, mother, wife, or child, and falls upon is neck. The darkness, the previous forms, and the expectancy have so filled his mind with premonitory images that it is no wonder he perceives what is suggested. These fraudulent 's\u00e9ances' would furnish most precious documents to the psychology of perception, if they could only satisfactorily inquired into. In the hypnotic trance any suggested object is sensibly perceived. In certain subject happens more or less completely after waking from the trance. It would seem that under favorable conditions somewhat similar susceptibility to suggestion may exit certain persons who are not otherwise entranced at all. This suggestibility is greater in the lower senses than the higher. A German observer writes:\n\n\"We know that a weak smell or taste may he very diversely interpreted by us, and that the same sensation will now be named as one thing and the next moment as another. Suppose an agreeable smell of flowers in a room: A visitor will notice it, seek to recognize what it is, and at last perceive more and more distinctly that it is the perfume of roses -- until after all he discovers a bouquet of violets. Then suddenly he recognizes the violet-smell, and wonders how he could possibly have hit upon the roses. -- Just so it is with taste. Try some meat whose visible characteristics are disguised by the mode of cooking, and you will perhaps begin by taking it for venison, and end by being quite certain that it is venison, until you are told that it is mutton; where- upon you get distinctly the mutton flavor. -- In this wise one may make a person taste or smell what one will, if one only makes sure that he shall conceive it beforehand as we wish, by saying to him: 'Doesn't that taste just like, etc.?' or 'Doesn't it smell just like, etc.?' One call cheat whole companies in this way; announce, for instance at a meal, that the meat tastes 'high,' and almost every one who is not animated by a spirit of opposition will discover a flavor of putrescence which in reality is not there at all.\n\n\"In the sense of feeling this phenomenon is less prominent, because we get so close to the object that our sensation of it is never incomplete. Still, examples may be adduced from this sense. On superficially feeling of a cloth, one may confidently declare it for velvet, whilst it is perhaps a long-haired cloth; or a person may perhaps not be able to decide whether he has put on woolen or cotton stockings, and, trying to ascertain this by the feeling on the skin of the feet, he may become aware that he gets the feeling of cotton or wool according as he thinks of the one or the other. When the feeling in our fingers is somewhat blunted by cold, we notice many such phenomena, being then more ex- posed to confound objects-of touch with one another.\" [ 21]\n\nHigh authorities have doubted this power of imagination to falsify present impressions of sense. [22] Yet it unquestionably exists. Within the past fortnight I have been annoyed by a smell, faint but unpleasant, in my library. My annoyance began by an escape of gas from the furnace below stairs. This seemed to get lodged in my imagination as a sort of standard of perception; for, several days after the furnace had been rectified, I perceived the 'same smell' again. It was traced this time to a new pair of India rubber shoes which had been brought in from the shop and laid on a table. It persisted in coming to me for several days, however, in spite of the fact that no other member of the family or visitor noticed anything unpleasant. My impression during part of this time was one of uncertainty whether the smell was imaginary or real; and at last it faded out. Everyone must be able to give instances like this from the smell-sense. When we have paid the faithless plumber pretending to mend our drains, the intellect inhibits nose from perceiving the same unaltered odor, until perhaps several days go by. As regards the ventilation heating of rooms, we are apt to feel for some time as we think we ought to feel. If we believe the ventilator is shut, we feel the room close. On discovering it open, the oppression disappears.\n\nAn extreme instance is given in the following extract:\n\n\"A patient called at my office one day in a state of great excitement from the effects of an offensive odor in the horse-car she had come and which she declared had probably emanated from some very sick person who must have been just carried in it. There could be no doubt that something had affected her seriously, for she was very pale, with nausea, difficulty in breathing, and other evidences of bodily and mental distress. I succeeded, After some difficulty and time, in quieting her, and she left, protesting that the smell was unlike anything she had before experienced and was something dreadful. Leaving my office soon after, it so happened that I found her at the street-corner, waiting for a car: we thus entered the car together. She immediately cal attention to the same sickening odor which she had experienced other car, and began to be affected the same as before, when I pointed out to her that the smell was simply that which always emanates from the straw which has been in stables. She quickly recognized it as the same, when the unpleasant effects which arose while she was possessed with another perception of its character at once passed away.\" [23]\n\nIt is the same with touch. Everyone must have felt the sensible quality change under his hand, as sudden con tact with something moist or hairy, in the dark, awoke a shock of disgust or fear which faded into calm recognition of some familiar object? Even so small a thing as a crumb of potato on the table-cloth, which we pick up, thinking it a crumb of bread, feels horrible for a few moments to our fancy, and different from what it is.\n\nWeight or muscular feeling is a sensation; yet who heard the anecdote of some one to whom Sir Humphry Davy showed the metal sodium which he had just discovered? \"Bless me, how heavy it is!\" said the man; showing that his idea of what metals as a, class ought to be had falsified the sensation he derived from a very light substance. In the sense of hearing, similar mistakes abound. I have already mentioned the hallucinatory effect of mental images of very faint sounds, such as distant clock-strokes (above, p. 71). But even when stronger sensations of sound have been present, everyone must recall some experience in which they have altered their acoustic character as soon as the intellect referred them to a different source. The other day a friend was sitting in my room, when the clock, which has a rich low chime, began to strike. \"Hollo!\" said he, \"hear that hand-organ in the garden,\" and was surprised at finding the real source of the sound. I had myself some years ago a very striking illusion of the sort. Sitting reading late one night, I suddenly heard a most formidable noise proceeding from the upper part of the house, which it seemed to fill. It ceased, and in a moment renewed itself. I went into the hall to listen, but it came no more. Resuming my seat in the room, however, there it was again, low, mighty, alarming, like a rising flood or the avant-courier of an awful gale. It came from all space. Quite startled, I again went into the hall, but it had already ceased once more. On returning a second time to the room, I discovered that it was nothing but the breathing of a little Scotch terrier which lay asleep on the door. The note-worthy thing is that as soon as I recognized what it was, I was compelled to think it a different sound, and could not then hear it as I had heard it a moment before.\n\nIn the anecdotes given by Delb\u0153uf and Reid, this was probably also the case, though it is not so stated. Reid says:\n\n\" I remember that once lying abed, and having been put into a fright, I heard my own heart beat; but I took it to be one knocking at the door, and arose and opened the door oftener than once, before I discovered that the sound was in my own breast.\" (Inquiry, chap. Iv. Delb\u0153uf's story is as follows: 'The illustrious P. J. van Beneden, senior, was walking one evening with a friend along a moody hill near Chaudfontaine. 'Don't you ,hear,' said the friend, 'the noise of a hunt on the mountain?' M. van Beneden listens and distinguishes in fact the giving-tongue of the dogs. They listen some time, expecting from one moment to another to see a deer bound by; but the voice of the dogs seems neither to recede nor approach. At last a countryman comes by, and they ask him who it is that can be hunting at this late hour. But he, pointing to some puddles of water near their feet, replies: 'Yonder little animals are what you hear.' And there were in fact a number of toads of the species Bombinator igneus.... This batrachian emits at the pairing season a silvery or rather crystalline note.... Sad and pure, it is a voice no wise resembling that of hounds giving chase.\" [24]\n\nThe sense of sight, as we have seen in studying Space is pregnant with illusions of both the types considered. No sense gives such fluctuating impressions of the s object as sight does. With no sense are we so apt to treat the sensations immediately given as mere signs; with none is the invocation from memory of a thing, and the consequent perception of the latter, so immediate. The' thing' which we perceive always resembles, as we have seen, the object of some absent object of sensation, usually another optical figure which in our mind has come to be the standard of reality; and it is this incessant reduction of our optical objects to more 'real' forms which has led some authors into the mistake of thinking that the sensation which first apprehend them are originally and natively of any form at all. [25]\n\nOf accidental and occasional illusions of sight amusing examples might be given. Two will suffice. One is a reminiscence of my own. I was lying in my berth steamer listening to the sailors holystone the deck outside; when, on turning my eyes to the window, I perceived perfect distinctness that the chief-engineer of the vessel had entered my state-room, and was standing looking through the window at the men at work upon the guards. Surprised at his intrusion, and also at his intentness and immobility, I remained watching him and wondering how long he would stand thus. At last I spoke; but getting no reply, sat up in my berth, and then saw that what I had taken for the engineer was my own cap and coat hanging on a peg beside the window. The illusion was complete; the engineer was a peculiar-looking mall; and I saw him unmistakably; but after the illusion had vanished I found it hard voluntarily to make the cap and coat look like him at all.\n\nThe following story, which I owe to my friend Prof. Hyatt, is of a probably not uncommon class:\n\n\"During the winter of 1858, while in Venice, I had the somewhat peculiar illusion which you request me to relate. I remember the circumstances very accurately because I have often repeated the story, and have made an effort to keep all the attendant circumstances clear of exaggeration. I was travelling with my mother, and we had taken rooms at a hotel which had been located in an old palace. The room in which I went to bed was large and lofty. The moon was shining brightly, and I remember standing before a draped window, thinking of the romantic nature of the surroundings, remnants of old stories of knights and ladies, and the possibility that even in that room itself love-scenes and sanguinary tragedies might have taken place. The night was so lovely that many of the people were strolling through the narrow lanes or so-called streets, singing as they went, and I laid awake for some time listening to these patrols of serenaders, and of course finally fell asleep. I became aware that some one was leaning over me closely, and that my own breathing was being interfered with; a decided feeling of an unwelcome presence of some sort awakened me. As I opened my eyes I saw, as distinctly as I ever saw any living person, a draped head about a foot or eighteen inches to the right, and just above my bed. The horror which took possession of my young fancy was beyond anything I have ever experienced. The head was covered by a long black veil which floated out into the moonlight, the face itself was pale and beautiful, and the lower part swathed in the white band commonly worn by the nuns of Catholic orders. My hair seemed to rise up, and a profuse perspiration attested the genuineness of the terror which I felt. For a time I lay in this way, and then gradually gaining more command over my superstitious terrors, concluded to try to grapple with the apparition. It remained perfectly distinct until I reached at it sharply with my hand, and then disappeared, to return again, however, as soon as: I sank back into the pillow. The second or third grasp which I made at the head was not followed by a reappearance, and I then saw that the ghost was not a real presence, but depended upon the position of my head. If I moved my eyes either to the left or right of the original position occupied by my head when I awakened, the ghost disappeared, and by returning to about the same position, I could make it reappear with nearly the same intensity as at first. I presently satisfied myself by these experiments that the illusion arose from the effect of the imagination, aided by the actual figure made by a visual section of the moonbeams shining through the lace curtains of the window. If I had given way to the first terror of the situation and covered up my head, I should probably have believed in the reality of the apparition, since I have not by the slightest word, so far as I know, exaggerated the vividness of my feelings.\"\n\nTHE PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS IN PERCEPTION. Enough has now been said to prove the general law of perception, which is this, that whilst part of what we perceive comes through our senses from the object before us (and it may be the larger part) always comes (in Lazarus's phrase) out of our own head.\n\nAt bottom this is only one case (and that the simples case) of the general fact that our nerve-centres are an organ for reacting on sense-impressions, and that our hemisphere in particular, are given us in order that records of our private past experience may co-operate in the reaction. Of course such a general way of stating the fact is vague; and all the those follow the current theory of ideas will be prompt throw this vagueness at it as a reproach. Their way of describing the process goes much more into detail. The sensation they say, awakens 'images' of other sensations associated with it in the past. These images 'fuse,' or are 'combined' by the Ego with the present sensation into a new product, the percept, etc., etc. Something so indistinguishable from this in practical outcome is what really occurs, one may seem fastidious in objecting to such a state, specially if have no rival theory of the elementary processes to propose. And yet, if this notion of images rising and flocking and fusing be mythological (and we have along so considered it), why should we entertain it unless confessedly as a mere figure of speech? As such, of course is convenient and welcome to pass. But if we try to put an exact meaning into it, all we find is that the brain react paths which previous experiences have worn, and make usually perceive the probable thing, i.e., the thing by which on previous occasions the reaction was most frequently aroused. But we can, I think, without danger of being too speculative, be a little more exact than this, and conceive of a physiological reason why the felt quality of an object changes when, instead of being apprehended in a mere sensation, the object is: perceived as a thing. All consciousness seems to depend on a certain slowness of the process in the cortical cells. The rapider currents are, the less feeling they seem to awaken. If a region A, then, be so connected with another region B that every current which enters A immediately drains off into B, we shall not be very strongly conscious of the sort of object that A can make us feel. If B, on the contrary, has no such copious channel of discharge, the excitement will linger there longer ere it diffuses itself elsewhere, and our consciousness of the sort of object that B makes us feel will be strong. Carrying this to an ideal maximum, we may say that if A offer no resistance to the transmission forward of the present, and if the current terminate in B, then, no matter what causes may initiate the current, we shall get no consciousness of the object peculiar to A, but on the contrary a vivid sensation of the object peculiar to B. And this will be true though at other times the connection between A and B might lie less open, and every current then entering A might give us a strong consciousness of A's peculiar object. In other words, just in proportion as associations are habitual, mill the qualities of the suggested thing tend to substitute themselves in consciousness for those of the thing immediately there; or, more briefly, just in proportion as an experience is probable will it tend to be directly felt. In all such experiences the paths lie wide open from the cells first affected to those concerned with the suggested ideas. A circular after-image on the receding wall or ceiling is actually seen as an ellipse, a square after-image of a cross there is seen as slant-legged, etc., because only in the process correlated with the vision of the latter figures do the inward currents find a pause (see the next chapter).\n\nWe must remember this when, in dealing with the eye, we come to point oat the erroneousness of the principle laid down by Reid and Helmholtz that true sensations can never be changed by the suggestions of experience.\n\nA certain illusion of which I have not yet spoken affords additional illustration of this. When we will to execute a movement and the movement for some reason does not occur, unless the sensation of the part's NOT moving is a strong one, we are apt to feel as if the movement had actually taken place. This seems habitually to be the case in an\u00e6esthesia of the moving parts. Close the patient's eyes, hold his an\u00e6esthetic a still, and tell him to raise his hand to his head; and when he opens his eyes he will be astonished to find that movement has not taken place. All reports of anaesthetic cases seem to mention this illusion. Sternberg who wrote on a subject in 1885,[26] lays it down as a law that the intention move is the same thing as the feeling of the motion. We will later see that this is false (Chapter XXV); but it certainly may suggest the feeling of the motion with hallucinatory intensity. Sternberg gives the following experiment, which I find succeeds with at least half of those who it: Rest your palm on the edge of the table with your forefinger hanging over in a position of extreme flexion, and then exert your will to flex it still more. The position the other fingers makes this impossible, and yet if we do not look to see the finger, we think we feel it move. He quotes from Exner a similar experiment with the jaws: Put some hard rubber or other unindentable obstacle between your back teeth and bite hard: you think you feel the jaw move and the front teeth approach each other, though in the nature of things no movement can occur. [27] -- The visual suggestion of the path traversed by the finger-tip as the locus of the movement-feeling in the joint, which we discussed on page 41, is another example of this semi-hallucinatory power of the suggested thing. Amputated people, as we have learned, still feel their lost feet, etc. This is a necessary consequence of the law of specific energies, for if the central region correlated with the foot give rise to any feeling at all it must give rise to the feeling of a foot. [28] But the curious thing is that many of these patients can will the foot to move, and when they have done so, distinctly feel the movement to occur. They can, to use their own language, 'work' or 'wiggle' their lost toes. [29]\n\nNow in all these various cases we are dealing with data which in normal life are inseparably joined. Of all possible experiences, it is hard to imagine any pair more uniformly and incessantly coupled than the volition to move, on the one hand, and the feeling of the changed position of the parts, on the other. From the earliest ancestors of ours which had feet, down to the present day, the movement of the feet must always have accompanied the will to move them; and here, if anywhere, habit's consequences ought to be found. [29] The process of the willing ought, then, to pour into the process of feeling the command effected, and ought to awaken that feeling in a maximal degree provided no other positively contradictory sensation come in at the same time. In most of us, when the will fails of its effect there is a, contradictory sensation. We discern a resistance or the unchanged position of the limb. But neither in an\u00e6sthesia nor in amputation can there be any contradictory sensation in the foot to correct us; so imagination has all the force of fact.\n\nAPPERCEPTION In Germany since Herbart's time Psychology has always I a great deal to say about a process called Apperception. [30] incoming ideas or sensations are said to be 'apperceived ' by 'masses' of ideas already in the mind. It is plain that the process we have been describing as perception is, at this rate, an apperceptive process. So are all recognition, classing, and naming; and passing beyond these simplest suggestions, all farther thoughts about our percepts are apperceptive processes as well. I have myself not used the apperception because it has carried very different meaning in the history of philosophy, [31] and 'psychic reaction,' 'interpretation,' 'conception,' 'assimilation,' 'elaboration,' or simply 'thought,' are perfect synonyms for its Herbartian meaning, widely taken. It is, moreover, hardly worth while pretend to analyze the so-called apperceptive performances beyond the first or perceptive stage, because their variations and degrees are literally innumerable. 'Apperception' a name for the sum-total of the effects of what we have studied as association; and it is obvious that the things which a given experience will suggest to a man depend on what Mr. Lewes calls his entire psychostatical conditions, nature and stock of ideas, or, in other words, his character habits, memory, education, previous experience, and momentary mood. We gain no insight into what really occurs either in the mind or in the brain by calling all these Is the 'apperceiving mass,' though of course this may occasion be convenient. On the whole I am inclined think Mr. Lewes's term of 'assimilation' the most fruitful one yet used. [32]\n\nProfessor H. Steinthal has analyzed apperceptive processes with a, sort of detail which is simply burdensome. [33] His introduction of the matter may, however, be quoted. He begins with an anecdote from a comic paper.\n\n\"In the compartment of a railway-carriage six persons unknown to each other sit in lively conversation. It becomes a matter of regret that one of the company must alight at the next station. One of the others says that he of all things prefers such a meeting with entirely unknown persons, and that on such occasions he is accustomed neither to ask who or what his companions may be nor to tell who or what he is. Another thereupon says that he will undertake to decide this question, if they each and all will answer him an entirely disconnected question. They began. He drew five leaves from his note-book, wrote a question on each, and gave one to each of his companions with the request that he write the answer below. When the leaves were returned to him, he turned, after reading them, without hesitation to the others, and said to the first, 'You are a man of science'; to the second, 'You are a soldier'; to the third, 'You are a philologer'; to the fourth, 'You are a journalist'; to the fifth, 'You are a farmer.' All admitted that he was right, whereupon he got out and left the five behind. Each wished to know what question the others had received; and behold, he had given the same question to each. It ran thus:\n\n\"What being destroys what it has itself brought forth?\n\n\"To this the naturalist had answered, 'natural force'; the soldier, 'war'; the philologist, 'Kronos'; the publicist, 'revolution'; the farmer, 'a boar'. This anecdote, methinks, if not true, is at least splendidly well invented. Its narrator makes the journalist go on to say : 'Therein consists the joke. Each one answers the first thing that occurs to him, [34] and that is whatever is most newly related to his pursuit in life. Every question is a hole-drilling experiment, and the answer is an opening through which one sees into our interiors.'... So do we all. We are all able to recognize the clergyman, the soldier, the scholar, the business man, not only by the cut of their garments and the attitude of their body, but by what they say and how they express it. We guess the place in life of men by the interest which they show and the way in which they show it, by the objects of which they speak, by the point of view from which they regard things, judge them, conceive them, in short by their mode of apperceiving....\n\n\"Every man has one group of ideas which relate to his own person and interests, and another which is connected with society. Each has his group of ideas about plants, religion, law, art, etc., and more especially about the rose, epic poetry, sermons, free trade, and the like. Thus the mental content of every individual, even of the uneducated and of children, consists of masses or circles of knowledge of which each lies within some larger circle, alongside of others similarly included, and of which each includes smaller circles within itself.... The perception of a thing like a horse... is a process between the present horse's picture before our eyes, on the one hand, and those fused or interwoven pictures and ideas of all the horses we have ever seen, on the other;... a process between two factors or momenta, of which one existed before the process and was an old possession of the mind (the group of ideas, or concept, namely), whilst the other is but just presented to the mind, and is the immediately supervening factor (the sense-impression). The former apperceives the latter; the latter is apperceived by the former. Out of their combination an apperception- product arises: the knowledge of the perceived being as a horse. The earlier factor is relatively to the later one active and a prori; the supervening factor is given, a posteriori, factor passive.... We may then define Apperception as the movement of two masses of consciousness (Vorstellungsmassen) against each other so as to produce a cognition.\n\n\"The a priori factor we called active, the a posteriori factor passive, but this is only relatively true.... Although the a priori moment commonly shows itself to be the more powerful, apperception-processes can perfectly well occur in which the new observation transforms or en- riches the apperceiving group of ideas. A child who hitherto has seen - none but four-cornered tables apperceives a round one as a table; but by this the apperceiving mass ('table') is enriched. To his previous knowledge of tables comes this new feature that they need not be four- cornered, but may be round. In the history of science it has happened often enough that some discovery, at the same time that it was apperceived, i.e. brought into connection with the system of our knowledge, transformed the whole system. In principle, however, we must maintain that, although either factor is both active and passive, the a priori factor is almost always the more active of the two.\" [35]\n\nThis account of Steinthal's brings out very clearly the difference between our psychological conceptions and what are called concepts in logic. In logic a concept is unalterable; but what are popularly called our 'conceptions of things' alter by being used. The aim of 'Science' is to attain conceptions so adequate and exact that we shall never need to change them. There is an everlasting struggle in every mind between the tendency to keep unchanged, and the tendency to renovate, its ideas. Our education is a cease-less compromise between the conservative and the progressive factors. Every new experience must be disposed of under some old head. The great point is to find the head which has to be least altered to take it in. Certain Polynesian natives, seeing horses for the first time, called them pigs, that being the nearest head. My child of two played for a week with the first orange that was given him, calling it a 'ball.' He called the first whole eggs he saw 'potatoes' having been accustomed to see his 'eggs' broken into a glass, and his potatoes without the skin. A folding pocket-corkscrew he unhesitatingly called 'bad-scissors.' Hardly any one of us can make new heads easily when fresh experiences come. Most of us grow more and more enslaved to the stock conceptions with which we have once become familiar, and less and less capable of assimilating impressions in any but the old ways. Old-fogyism, in short, is the inevitable terminus to which life sweeps us on. Objects which violate our established habits of 'apperception' are simply not taken account of at all; or, if on some occasion we are forced by dint of argument to admit their existence, twenty-four hours later the admission is as if it were not, and every trace of the unassimilable truth has vanished from our thought. Genius, in truth, means little more than the faculty of perceiving in an unhabitual way.\n\nOn the other hand, nothing is more congenial, from babyhood to the end of life, than to be able to assimilate the new to the old, to meet each threatening violator or burster of our well-known series of concepts, as it comes in, see through its unwontedness, and ticket it off as an old friend in disguise. This victorious assimilation of the new is in fact the type of all intellectual pleasure. The lust for it is curiosity. The relation of the new to the old, before the assimilation is performed, is wonder. We feel neither curiosity nor wonder concerning things so far beyond us that we have no concepts to refer them to or standards by which to measure them.[36] The Fuegians, in Darwin's voy- age, wondered at the small boats, but took the big ship as a 'matter of course.' Only what we partly know already inspires us with a desire to know more. The more elaborate textile fabrics, the vaster works in metal, to most of us are like the air, the water, and the ground, absolute existences which awaken no ideas. It is a matter of course that an engraving or a copper-plate inscription should possess that degree of beauty. But if we are shown a pen-drawing of equal perfection, our personal sympathy with the difficulty of the task makes us immediately wonder at the skill. The old lady admiring the Academician's picture, says to him: \"And is it really all done by hand?\"\n\nIS PERCEPTION UNCONSCIOUS INFERENCE?\n\nA widely-spread opinion (which has been held by such men as Schopenhauer, Spencer, Hartmann, Wundt, Helmholtz, and lately interestingly pleaded for by M. Binet [37]) will have it that perception should be called a sort of reasoning operation, more or less unconsciously and automatically performed. The question seems at first a verbal one, depending on how broadly the term reasoning is to be taken. If, every time a present sign suggests an absent reality to our mind, we make an inference; and if every time we make an inference we reason ; then perception is indubitably reasoning. Only one sees no room in it for any unconscious part. Both associates, the present sign and the contiguous things which it suggests, are above-board, and no intermediary ideas are required. Most of those who have upheld the thesis in question have, however, made a more complex supposition. What they have meant is that perception is a mediate inference, end that the middle term is unconscious. When the sensation which I have called' this ' (p. 83, supra) is felt, they think that some process like the following runs through the mind:\n\n'This' is M;\n\nbut M is A;\n\ntherefore 'this' is A [38]\n\nNow there seem no good grounds for supposing this additional wheel work in the mind. The classification of 'this' as M is itself an act of perception, and should, if all perception were inference, require a still earlier syllogism for its performance, and so backwards in infinitum. The only extrication from this coil would be to represent the process in altered guise, thus:\n\n'This' is like those;\n\nThose are A;\n\nTherefore 'this' is A.\n\nThe major premise here involves no association by contiguity, no naming of those as M, but only a suggestion of unnamed similar images, a recall of analogous past sensations with which the characters that make up A were habitually conjoined. But here again, what grounds of fact are there for admitting this recall? We are quite unconscious of any such images of the past. And the conception of all the forms of association as resultants of the elementary fact of habit-worn paths in the brain makes such images entirely superfluous for explaining the phenomena in point. Since the brain-process of 'this,' the sign of A, has repeatedly been aroused in company with the process of the full object A, direct paths of irradiation from the one to the other must be already established. And although roundabout paths may also be possible, as from 'this' to 'those,' and then from 'those' to 'A' (paths which would lead to practically the same conclusion as the straighter ones), yet there is no ground whatever for assuming them to be traversed now, especially since appearances point the other way. In explicit reasoning, such paths are doubtless traversed in perception they are in all probability closed. So far, then, from perception being a species of reasoning properly so called, both it and reasoning are co-ordinate varieties of that deeper sort of process known psychologically as the association of ideas, and physiologically as the law of habit in the brain. To call perception unconscious reasoning is thus either a useless metaphor, or a positively misleading confusion between two different things.\n\nOne more point and we may leave the subject of Perception. Sir Wm. Hamilton thought that he had discovered a 'great law' which had been wholly overlooked by psychologists, and which, 'simple and universal,' is this: \"Knowledge and Feeling, -- Perception end Sensation, though always coexistent, are always in the inverse ratio of each other.\" Hamilton wrote as if perception and sensation were two coexistent elements entering into a single state of consciousness. Spencer refines upon him by contending that they are two mutually exclusive states of consciousness, not two elements of a single state. If sensation be taken, as both Hamilton and Spencer mainly take it in this discussion, to mean the feeling of pleasure or pain, there is no doubt that the law, however expressed, is true; and that the mind which is strongly conscious of the pleasantness or painfulness of an experience is ipso facto less fitted to observe and analyze its outward cause. [39] Apart from pleasure and pain, however, the law seems but a corollary of the fact that the more concentrated a state of consciousness is, the more vivid it is. When feeling a color, or listening to a tone per se, we get it more intensely, notice it better, than when we are aware of it merely as one among many other properties of a total object. The more diffused cerebral excitement of the perceptive state is probably incompatible with quite as strong an excitement of separate parts as the sensational state comports, So we come back here to our own earlier discrimination between the perceptive and the sensational processes, and to the examples which we gave on pp, 80, 81 [40]\n\nHALLUCINATIONS. Between normal perception and illusion we have seen that there is no break, the process being identically the same in both. The last illusions we considered might fairly be called hallucinations. We must now consider the false perceptions more commonly called by that name [41] In or dinary parlance hallucination is held to differ from illusion in that, whilst there is an object really there in illusion, in hallucination there is no objective stimulus at all. We shall presently see that this supposed absence of objective stimulus in hallucination is a mistake, and that hallucinations are often only extremes of the perception process, in which the secondary cerebral reaction is out of all normal proportion to the peripheral stimulus which occasions the activity. Hallucinations usually appear abruptly and have the character of being forced upon the subject. But they possess various degrees of apparent objectivity. One mistake in limine must be guarded against. They are often talked of as mental images projected outwards by mistake. But where an hallucination is complete, it is much more than a mental image. An hallucination is a strictly sensational form of consciousness, as good and true a sensation as there were a real object there. The object happens not to be there, that is all. The milder degrees of hallucination have been designated as pseudo-hallucinations. Pseudo-hallucinations and hallucinations have been sharply distinguished from each other only within a few years. Dr Kandinsky writes of their difference as follows:\n\n\"In carelessly questioning a patient we may confound his pseudo-hallucinatory perceptions with hallucinations. But to the unconfused consciousness of the patient himself, even though he be imbecile, the identification of the two phenomena is impossible, at least in the sphere of vision. At the moment of having a pseudo-hallucination of sight, the patient feels himself in an entirely different relation to this subjective sensible appearance, from that in which he finds himself whilst subject to a true visual hallucination. The latter is reality itself; the former, on the contrary, remains always a subjective phenomenon which the individual commonly regards either as sent to him as a sign of God's grace, or as artificially induced by his secret persecutors... If he knows by his own experience what a genuine hallucination is, it is quite impossible for him to mistake the pseudo-hallucination for it.... A concrete example will make the difference clear:\n\n\"Dr. N. L....heard one day suddenly amongst the voices of his persecutors ('coming from a hollow space in the midst of the wall') a rather loud voice impressively saying to him: 'Change your national allegiance.' Understanding this to mean that his only hope consisted in ceasing to be subject to the Czar of Russia, he reflected a moment what allegiance would be better, and resolved to become an English subject. At the same moment he saw a pseudo-hallucinatory lion of natural size, which appeared and quickly laid its fore-paws on his shoulders. He had a lively feeling of these paws as a tolerably painful local pressure (complete hallucination of touch). Then the same voice from the wall said: 'Now you have a lion -- now you will rule,' whereupon the patient recollected that the lion was the national emblem of England. The lion appeared to L. very distinct and vivid, but he nevertheless remained conscious, as he afterwards expressed it, that he saw the animal, not with his bodily but with his mental eyes. (After his recovery he called analogous apparitions by the name of 'expressive-plastic ideas.') Accordingly he felt no terror, even though he felt the contact of the claws.... Had the lion been a complete hallucination, the patient, as he himself remarked after recovery would have felt great fear, and very likely screamed or taken to flight. Had it been a simple image of the fancy he would not have connected it with the voices, of whose objective reality he was at the time quite convinced.\" [42]\n\nFrom ordinary images of memory and fancy, pseudo-hallucinations differ in being much more vivid, minute, de- tailed, steady, abrupt, and spontaneous, in the sense that all feeling of our own activity in producing them is lacking. Dr. Kandinsky had a patient who, after taking opium or haschisch, had abundant pseudo-hallucinations and hallucinations. As he also had strong visualizing power and was an educated physician, the three sorts of phenomena could be easily compared. Although projected outwards (usually not farther than the limit of distinctest vision, a foot or so) the pseudo-hallucinations lacked the character of objective reality which the hallucinations possessed, but, unlike the pictures of imagination, it was almost impossible to produce them at will, most of the 'voices' which people hear (whether they give rise to delusions or not) are pseudo-hallucinations. They are described as 'inner' voices, although their character is entirely unlike the inner speech of the subject with himself. I know two persons who hear such inner voices making unforeseen remarks whenever they grow quiet and listen for them. They are a very common incident of delusional insanity, and at last grow into vivid hallucinations. The latter are comparatively frequent occurrences in sporadic form; end certain individuals are liable to have them often. From the results of the 'Census of Hallucinations,' which was begun by Edmund Gurney, it would appear that, roughly speaking, one person at least in every ten is likely to have had a vivid hallucination at some time in his life. [43] The following cases from healthy people will give an idea of what these hallucinations are:\n\n\"When a girl of eighteen, I was one evening engaged in a very painful discussion with an elderly person. My distress was so great that I took up a thick ivory knitting-needle that was lying on the mantelpiece of the parlor and broke it into small pieces as I talked. In the midst of the discussion I was very wishful to know the opinion of a brother with whom I had an unusually close relationship. I turned round and saw him sitting at the further side of a centre-table, with his arms folded (an unusual position with him), but, to my dismay, I per- ceived from the sarcastic expression of his mouth that he was not in sympathy with me, was not 'taking my side,' as I should then have expressed it. The surprise cooled me, and the discussion was dropped.\n\n\"Some minutes after, baring occasion to speak to my brother, I turned towards him, but he was gone. I inquired when he left the room, and was told that he had not been in it, which I did not believe, thinking that he had come in for a minute and had gone out without being noticed. About an hour and a half afterwards he appeared, and convinced me, with some trouble, that he had never been near the house that evening. He is still alive and well.\"\n\nHere is another case:\n\n\"One night in March 1873 or '74, I cannot recollect which year, I was attending on the sick-bed of my mother. About eight o'clock in the evening I went into the dining room to fix a cup of tea, and on turning from the sideboard to the table, on the other side of the table before the fire, which was burning brightly, as was also the gas, I saw standing with his hand clasped to his side in true military fashion a soldier of about thirty years of age, with dark, piercing eyes looking directly into mine. He wore a small cap with standing feather; his costume was also of a soldierly style. He did not strike me as being a spirit, ghost, or anything uncanny, only a living man; but after gazing for fully a minute I realized that it was nothing of earth, for he neither moved his eyes nor his body, and in looking closely I could see the fire beyond. I was of course startled, and yet did not run out of the room. I felt stunned. I walked out rapidly, however, and turning to the servant in the hall asked her if she saw anything. She said not. I went into my mother's room and remained talking for about an hour, but never mentioned the above subject for fear of exciting her, and finally forgot it altogether, returning to the dining-room, still in forgetfulness of what had occurred, but repeating, as above, the turning from sideboard to table in act of preparing more tea. I looked casually towards the fire, and there I saw the soldier again. This time I was entirely alarmed, and fled from the room in haste. I called to my father, but when he came he saw nothing.\"\n\nSometimes more than one sense is affected. The following is a case:\n\n\"In response to your request to write out my experience of Oct. 30, 1888, I will inflict on you a letter.\n\n\"On the day above mentioned, Oct. 30, 1888, I was in -------, where I was teaching. I had performed my regular routine work for the day, and was sitting in my room working out trigonometrical for- mulae. I was expecting every day to hear of the confinement of my wife, and naturally my thoughts for some time had been more or less with her. She was, by the way, in B ----, some fifty miles from me.\n\n\"At the time, however, neither she nor the expected event was in my mind; as I said, I was working out trigonometrical formul\u00e6, and I had been working on trigonometry the entire evening. About eleven o'clock, as I sat there buried in sines, cosines, tangents, cotangents, secants, and cosecants, I felt very distinctly upon my left shoulder a touch, and a slight shake, as if somebody had tried to attract my attention by other means and had failed. Without rising I raised my head, and there between me and the door stood my wife, dressed exactly as I last saw her, some five weeks before. As I turned she said: 'It is a little Herman; he has come.' Something more was said, but this is the only sentence I can recall. To make sure that I was not asleep and dreaming, I rose from the chair, pinched myself and walked toward the figure, which disappeared immediately as I rose. I can give no information as to the length of time occupied by this episode, but I know I was awake, in my usual good health. The touch was very distinct, the figure was absolutely perfect, stood about three feet from the door. which was closed, and had not been opened during the evening. The sound of the voice was unmistakable, and I should have recognized it as my wife's voice even if I had not turned and had not seen the figure at all. The tone was conversational, just as if she would have said the same words had she been actually standing there.\n\n\"In regard to myself, I would say, as I have already intimated, I was in my usual good health; I had not been sick before, nor was I after the occurrence, not so much as a headache having afflicted me.\n\n\"Shortly after the experience above described, I retired for the night and, as I usually do, slept quietly until morning. I did not speculate particularly about the strange appearance of the night before, and though I thought of it some, I did not tell anybody. The following morning I rose, not conscious of having dreamed anything, but I was very firmly impressed with the idea that there was something for me at the telegraph-office. I tried to throw off the impression, for so far as I knew there was no reason for it. Having nothing to do, I went out for a walk; and to help throw off the impression above noted, I walked away from the telegraph-office. As I proceeded, however, the impression became a conviction, and I actually turned about and went to the very place I had resolved not to visit, the telegraph-office. The first person I saw on arriving at said office was the telegraph-operator, who being on terms of intimacy with me, remarked: 'Hello, papa, I've got a telegram for you.' The telegram announced the birth of a boy, weighing nine pounds, and that all were doing well. Now, then, I have no theory at all about the events narrated above; I never had any such experience before nor since; I am no believer in spiritualism, am not in the least superstitious, know very little about ' thought-transference,' 'unconscious cerebration;' etc., etc., but I am absolutely certain about what I have tried to relate.\n\n\"In regard to the remark which I heard, 'It is a little Herman,' etc., I would add that we had previously decided to call the child, if a boy, Herman -- my own name, by the way.\" [44]\n\nThe hallucination sometimes carries a change of the general consciousness with it, so as to appear more like a sudden lapse into a dream. The following case was given me by a man of 43, who bad never anything resembling it before:\n\n\"While sitting at my desk this A. M. reading a circular of the Loyal Legion a very curious thing happened to me, such as I have never experienced. It was perfectly real, so real that it took some minutes to recover from. It seems to me like a direct intromission into some other world. I never had anything approaching it before sale when dreaming at night. I was wide awake, of course. But this was the feeling. I had only just sat down and become interested in the circular, when I seemed to love myself for a minute and then found myself in the top story of a high building very white and shining and clean, with a noble window immediately at the right of where I sat. Through this window I looked out upon a marvellous reach of landscape entirely new. I never had before such a sense of infinity in nature, such superb stretches of light and color and cleanness. I know that for the space of three minutes I was entirely lost, for when I began to come to, so to speak, -- sitting in that other world, I debated for three or four minutes more as to which was dream and which was reality. Sitting there I forgot a faint sense of C.... [the town in which the writer was] [45], away off and dim at first. Then I remember thinking 'Why, I used to live in C....; perhaps I am going back.' Slowly C.... did come back, and I found myself at my desk again. For a few minutes the process of determining where I was was very funny. But the whole experience was perfectly delightful, there was such a sense of brilliancy and clearness and lightness about it. I suppose it lasted in all about seven minutes or ten minutes.\"\n\nThe hallucinations of fever-delirium are a mixture of pseudo-hallucination, true hallucination, and illusion. Those of opium, hasheesh, and belladonna resemble them in this respect. The following vivid account of a fit of hasheesh-delirium has been given me by a friend:\n\n\"I was reading a newspaper, and the indication of the approaching delirium was an inability to keep my mind fixed on the narrative. Directly I lay down upon a sofa there appeared before my eyes several rows of human hands, which oscillated for a moment, revolved and then changed to spoons. The same motions were repeated, the objects changing to wheels, tin soldiers, lamp-posts, brooms, and countless other absurdities. This stage lasted about ten minutes, and during that time it is safe to say that I saw at least a thousand different objects. These whirling images did not appear like the realities of life, but had the character of the secondary images seen in the eye after looking at some brightly-illuminated object. A mere suggestion from the person who was with me in the room was sufficient to call up an image of the thing suggested, while without suggestion there appeared all the common objects of life and many unreal monstrosities, which it is absolutely impossible to describe, and which seemed to be creations of the brain.\n\n\"The character of the symptoms changed rapidly. A sort of wave seemed to pass over me, and I became aware of the fact that my pulse was beating rapidly. I took out my watch, and by exercising considerable will-power managed to time the heart-beats, 135 to the minute.\n\n\"I could feel each pulsation through my whole system, and a curious twitching commenced, which no effort of the mind could stop.\n\n\"There were moments of apparent lucidity, when it seemed as if I could see within myself, and watch the pumping of my heart. A strange fear came over me, a certainty that I should never recover from the effects of the opiate, which was as quickly followed by a feeling of great interest in the experiment, a certainty that the experience was the most novel and exciting that I had ever been through.\n\n\"My mind was in an exceedingly impressionable state. Any place thought of or suggested appeared with all the distinctness of the reality. I thought of the Giant's Causeway in Staffa, and instantly I stood within the portals of Fingal's Cave. Great basaltic columns rose on all aides, while huge wares rolled through the chasm and broke in silence upon the rocky shore. Suddenly there was a roar and blast of sound, and the word 'Ishmaral' was echoing up the cave. At the enunciation of this remarkable word the great columns of basalt changed into Whirling clothes pins and I laughed aloud at the absurdity. \"(I may here state that the word 'Ishmaral' seemed to haunt my other hallucinations, for I remember that I heard it frequently there after.) I next enjoyed a sort of metempsychosis. Any animal or thing that I thought of could be made the being which held my mind. I thought of a fox, and instantly I was transformed into that animal. I could distinctly feel myself a fox, could see my long ears and bushy tail, and by a sort of introvision felt that my complete anatomy was that of a fox. Suddenly the point of vision changed. My eyes seemed to be located at the back of my mouth; I looked out between the parted lips, saw the two rows of pointed teeth, and, closing my mouth with a snap, saw --nothing.\n\n\"I was next transformed into a bombshell, felt my size, weight, and thickness, and experienced the sensation of being shot up out of a giant mortar, looking down upon the earth, bursting and falling back in a shower of iron fragments.\n\n\"Into countless other objects was I transformed, many of them so absurd that I am unable to conceive what suggested them. For example, I was a little china doll, deep down in a bottle of olive oil, next moment a stick of twisted candy, then a skeleton inclosed in a whirling coffin, and so on ad infinitum.\n\n\"Towards the end of the delirium the whirling images appeared again, and I was haunted by a singular creation of the brain, which reappeared every few moments. It was an image of a double-faced doll, with a cylindrical body running down to a point like a peg-top. It was always the same, having a sort of crown on its head, and painted in two colors, green and brown, on a background of blue. The expression of the Janus-like profiles was always the same, as were the adornments of the body. After recovering from the effects of the drug I could not picture to myself exactly how this singular monstrosity appeared, but in subsequent experiences I was always visited by this phantom, and always recognized every detail of its composition. It was like visiting some long-forgotten spot and seeing some sight that had faded from the memory, but which appeared perfectly familiar as soon as looked upon.\n\n\"The effects of the drug lasted about an hour and a half, leaving me a trifle tipsy and dizzy; but after a ten-hour sleep I was myself again, save for a slight inability to keep my mind fixed on any piece of work for any length of time, which remained with me during most of the next day.\"\n\nTHE NEURAL PROCESS IN HALLUCINATION.\n\nExamples of these singular perversions of perception might be multiplied indefinately, but I have no more space. Let us turn to the question of what the physiological process may be to which they are due. It must, of course, consist of an excitement from within of those centres which are active in normal perception, identical in kind and degree with that which real external objects are usually needed to induce. The particular process which cur- rents from the sense-organs arouse would seem under normal circumstances to be arousable in no other way. On p. 72 if. above, we saw that the centres aroused by incoming peripheral currents are probably identical with the centres used in mere imagination; and that the vividness of the sensational kind of consciousness is probably correlated with a discrete degree of intensity in the processes therein aroused. Referring the reader back to that pal sage and to what was more lately said on p. 103 ff., I no proceed to complete my theory of the perceptive process by an analysis of what may most probably be believed take place in hallucination strictly so called.\n\nWe have seen (p. 75) that the free discharge of into each other through associative paths is a likely reason why the maximum intensity of function is not reached when the cells are excited by their neighbors in the cortex. At the end of Chapter XXV we shall return to this conception, and whilst making it still more precise, use it for explaining certain phenomena connected with the will. The idea is that the leakage forward along these paths is too rapid for the inner tension in any centre to accumulate the maximal explosion-point, unless the exciting currents are greater than those which the various portions of cortex supply to each other. Currents from the periphery are (as it seems) the only currents whose energy can vanquish the supra-ideational resistance (so to call it) of the cells, and cause the peculiarly intense sort of disintegration with which the sensational quality is linked. If, however, the leakage forward were to stop, the tension inside certain cells might reach the explosion-point, even though the influence which excited them came only from neighboring cortical parts. Let an empty pail with a leak in its bottom, tipped up against a support so that if it ever became full of water it would upset, represent the resting condition of the centre for a certain sort of feeling. Let water poured into it stand for the currents which are its natural stimulus then the hole in its bottom will, of course, represent the 'paths' by which it transmits its excitement to other associated cells. Now let two other vessels have the fun of supplying it with water. One of these vessels stands any more water than goes out by the leak. The pail consequently never upsets in consequence of the supply from this source. A current of water passes through it and does work elsewhere, but in the pail itself nothing but what stands for ideational activity is aroused. The vessel, however, stands for the peripheral sense-organ, and supplies a stream of water so copious that the pail promptly fills up in spite of the leak, and presently upsets; in other words sensational activity is aroused. But it is obvious that if the leak were plugged, the slower stream of supply would also end by upsetting the pail.\n\nTo apply this to the brain and to thought, if we take a series of processes A B CD E, associated together in that order, and suppose that the current through them is very fluent there will be little intensity anywhere until, perhaps, a pause occurs at E. But the moment the current is, blocked \"anywhere, say between C and D, the process in C must grow more intense, and might even be conceived to explode so as to produce a sensation in the mind instead of an idea. It would seem that some hallucinations are best to be explained in this way. We have in fact a regular series of facts which can all be formulated under the single law that the substantive strength of a state of consciousness bears an inverse proportion to its suggestiveness. It is the halting-places of our thought which are occupied with distinct imagery. Most of the words we utter have no time to awaken images at all; they simply awaken the following words. But when the sentence stops, an image dwells for awhile before the mental eye (see Vol. I. p, 243). Again, whenever the associative processes are reduced and impeded by the approach of unconsciousness, as in falling asleep, or growing faint, or becoming narcotized, we find a concomitant increase in the intensity of whatever partial consciousness may survive. In some people what M. Maury has called 'hypnagogic' [46] hallucinations are the regular concomitant of the process of [p. 125]. falling asleep. Trains of faces, landscapes, etc., pass before the mental eye, first as fancies, then as pseudo-hallucinations, finally as full-hedged hallucinations forming dreams. If we regard association-paths as paths of drainage, then the shutting off of one after another of them as the encroaching cerebral paralysis advances ought to act like the plugging of the hole in the bottom of the pail, and make the activity more intense in those systems of cells that retain an activity at all. The level rises because the currents are not drained away, until at last the full sensational explosion may occur.\n\nThe usual explanation of hypnagogic hallucinations that they are ideas deprived of their ordinary reductives. In somnolescence, sensations being extinct, the mind, it is said, then having no stronger things to compare its ideas with ascribes to these the fulness of reality. At ordinary times the objects of our imagination are reduced to the status subjective facts by the ever-present contrast of our sensations with them. Eliminate the sensations, however, this view supposes, and the 'images' are forthwith 'projected' into the outer world and appear as realities, Thus is the illusion of dreams also explained. This, indeed, after fashion gives an account of the facts. [47] And yet it certainly fails to explain the extraordinary vivacity and completeness of so many of our dreams-fantasms. The process of 'imagining' must (in these cases at least [48]) be not merely relatively, but absolutely and in itself more intense than at other times. The fact is, it is not a process of imaging, but genuine sensational process; and the theory in question therefore false as far as that point is concerned.\n\nDr. Hughlings Jackson's explanation of the epileptic seizure is acknowledged to be masterly. It involves principles exactly like those which I am bringing forward here. The 'loss of consciousness' in epilepsy is due to the most highly organized brain-processes being exhausted and thrown out of gear. The less organized (more instinctive) processes, ordinarily inhibited by the others, are then exalted, so that we get as a mere consequence of relief from the inhibition, the meaningless or maniacal action which so often follows the attack. [49]\n\nSimilarly the subsultus tendinorum or jerking of the muscles which so often startles us when we are on the point of falling asleep, may be interpreted as due to the rise (in certain lower motor centres) of the ordinary 'tonic' tension to the explosion-point, when the inhibition commonly exerted by the higher centres falls too suddenly away.\n\nOne possible condition of hallucination then stands revealed, whatever other conditions there may be. When the normal paths of association between a centre and other centres are thrown out of gear, any activity which may exist in the first centre tends to increase in intensity until finally the point may be reached at which the last inward resistance is overcome, and the full sensational process explodes. [50] Thus it will happen that causes of an amount of activity in brain-cells which would ordinarily result in a weak consciousness may produce a very strong consciousness when the overflow of these cells is stopped by the torpor of the rest of the brain. A slight peripheral irritation, then, if it reaches the centres of consciousness at all during sleep, will give rise to the dream of a violent sensation. All the books about dreaming are full of anecdotes which illustrate this. For example, M, Maury's nose and lips are tickled with a feather while he sleeps. He dreams he is being tortured by having a pitch-plaster applied to his face, torn off, lacerating the skin of nose and lips. Descartes, on being bitten by a flea, dreams of being run through by a sword. A friend tells me, as I write this, of his hair changing its position in his forehead just as he 'dozed off' in his chair a few days since. Instantly he dreamed that some one had struck him a blow. Examples can be quoted ad libitum, but these are enough. [51]\n\nWe seem herewith to have an explanation for a certain number of hallucinations. Whenever the normal forward irradiation of intra-cortical excitement through association-paths is checked, any accidental spontaneous activity or ally peripheral stimulation (however inadequate at other times) by which a brain- centre may be visited, sets up a process off full sensational intensity therein.\n\nIn the hallucinations artificially produced in hypnotic subjects, some degree of peripheral excitement seems usually to be required. The brain is asleep as far as its own spontaneous thinking goes, and the words of the 'magnetizer' then awaken a cortical process which drafts off into itself any currents of a related sort which may come in from the periphery, resulting in a vivid objective perception of the suggested thing. Thus, point to a dot on a sheet of paper, and call it 'General Grant's photograph,' and your subject will see a photograph of the General there instead of the dot. The dot gives objectivity to the appearance, and the suggested notion of the General gives it form. Then magnify the dot by a lens; double it by a, prism or by nudging the eyeball; reflect it in a mirror; turn it upside down; or wipe it out; and the subject will tell you that the 'photograph' has been enlarged, doubled, reflected, turned about, or made to disappear. In M. Binet's language, [52] the dot is the outward point de rep\u00e8re which is needed to give objectivity to your suggestion, and without which the latter will only produce a conception in the subject's mind. [53] M. Binet has shown that such a periphe- [p. 129]. ral point de rep\u00e8re is used in an enormous number, not only of hypnotic hallucinations, but of hallucinations of the insane. These latter are often unilateral; that is, the patient bears the voices always on one side of him, or sees the figure only when a certain one of his eyes is open. In many of these cases if has been distinctly proved that a morbid irritation in the internal ear, or an opacity in the humors of the eye, was the starting point of the current which the patient's diseased acoustic or optical centres clothed with their peculiar products in the way of ideas. Hallucinations produced in this way are 'ILLUSIONS'; and M. Binet's theory, that all Hallucinations must start in the periphery, may be called an attempt to reduce hallucination and illusion to one physiological type, the type, namely, to which normal perception belongs. In every case, according to M. Binet, whether of perception, of hallucination, or of illusion, we get the sensational vividness by means of a current from the peripheral nerves. It may be a mere trace of a current. But that trace is enough to kindle the maximal or supra ideational process so that the object perceived will have the character of externality. What the nature of the object shall be will depend wholly on the particular system of paths in which the process is kindled. Part of the thing in all cases comes from the sense-organ, the rest is furnished by the mind. But we cannot by introspection distinguish between these parts; and our only formula for the result is that the brain has reacted on the impression in the normal way. Just so in the dreams which we have considered, and in the hallucinations of which M. Binet tells, we can only say that the brain has reacted in an abnormal way.\n\nBinet's theory accounts indeed for a multitude of casts, but certainly not for all. The prism does not always double the false appearance,[54] nor does the latter always disappear when the eyes are closed. Dr. Hack Tuke [55] gives several examples in sane people of well-exteriorized hallucinations which could not respond to Binet's tests; and Mr. Edmund Gurney [56] gives a number of reasons why intensity in a cortical process may be expected to result from local pathological activities just as much as its peculiar nature does. For Binet, an abnormally exclusively active part of the cortex gives the nature of what shall appear, whilst a peripheral sense-organ alone can give the intensity sufficient to make it appear projected into real space. But since this intensity is after all but a matter of degree, one does not see why, under rare conditions, the degree in question might not be attained by inner causes exclusively. In that case we should have certain hallucinations centrally initiated alongside of the peripherally initiated hallucinations, which are the only sort that M. Binet's theory allows. It seems plausable on the whole, therefore, that centrally initiated hallucinations can exist. How often they do exist is another question. The existence of hallucinations which affect more than one sense is an argument for central initiation. For grant that the thing seen may have its starting point in the outer world, the voice which it is heard to utter must be due to an influence from the visual region, i.e. must be of central origin.\n\nSporadic cases of hallucination, visiting people only once in a lifetime (which seem to be by far the most frequent type), are on any theory hard to understand in detail. They are often extraordinarily complete; and the fact that many of them are reported as veridical, that is, as coinciding with real events, such as accidents, deaths, etc., of the persons seen, is an additional complication of the phenomenon. The first really scientific study of hallucination in all its possible bearings, on the basis of a large mass of empirical material, was begun by Mr. Edmund Gurney and is continued by other members of the Society for Psychical Research; and the 'Census' is now being applied to several countries under the auspices of the International Congress of Experimental Psychology. It is to be hoped that out of these combined labors something solid will eventually grow. The facts shade off into the phenomena of motor automatism, trance, etc.; and nothing but a wide comparative study can give really instructive results. [57]\n\nThe part played by the peripheral sense-organ in hallucination is just as obscure as we found it in the case of imagination. The things seen often seem opaque and hide the background upon which they are projected. It does not follow from this, however, that the retina is actually involved in the vision. A contrary process going on in the visual centres would prevent the retinal impression made by the outer realities from being felt, and this would in mental terms be equivalent to the hiding of them by the imaginary figure. The negative after-images of mental pictures reported by Meyer and F\u00e9r\u00e9, and the negative after-images of hypnotic hallucinations reported by Binet and others so far constitute the only evidence there is for the retina being involved. But until these after-images a explained in some other way we must admit the possibility of a centrifugal current from the optical centres downwards into the peripheral organ of sight, paradoxical as the co of such a current may appear.\n\n'PERCEPTION-TIME,'\n\nThe time which the perceptive process occupies has been inquired into by various experimenters. Some call it perception-time, some choice-time, some discrimination-time. The results have been already given in Chapter XIII (vol., p. 623 ff.), to which the reader is consequently referred. Dr. Romanes gives an interesting variation of these time-measurements. He found [58]\n\n\"an astonishing difference between different individuals with respect to the rate at which they are able to read. Of course reading implies enormously intricate processes of perception both of the sensuous and of the intellectual order; but if we choose for these observations persons who have been accustomed to read much, we may consider that they are all very much on a par with respect to the amount of practice which they have had, so that the differences in their rates of reading may fairly be attributed to real differences in their rates of forming complex perceptions in rapid succession, and not to any merely accidental differences arising from greater or less facility acquired by special practice.\n\n\"My experiments consisted in marking a brief printed paragraph in a book which had never been read by any of the persons to whom it was to be presented. The paragraph, which contained simple statements of simple facts, was marked on the margin with pencil. The book was then placed before the reader open, the page, however, being covered with a sheet of paper. Having pointed out to the reader upon this sheet of paper what part of the underlying page the marked paragraph occupied, I suddenly removed the sheet of paper with one hand, while I started a chronograph with the other. Twenty seconds being allowed for reading the paragraph (ten lines octave), as soon as the time was up I again suddenly placed the sheet of paper over the printed page, passed the book on to the next render, and repeated the experiment as before. Meanwhile, the first reader, the moment after the book had been removed, wrote down all that he or she could remember having read. End so on with all the other readers.\n\n\"Now the results of a number of experiments conducted on this method were to show, as I have said, astonishing differences in the maximum, rate of reading which is possible to different individuals, all of whom have been accustomed to extensive reading. That is to say, the difference may amount to 4 to 1; or, otherwise stated, in a given time one individual may be able to read four times as much as another. Moreover, it appeared that there was no relationship between slowness of reading and power of assimilation; on the contrary, when all the efforts are directed to assimilating as much as possible in a given time, the rapid readers (as shown by their written notes) usually give a better account of the portions of the paragraph which have been compassed by the slow readers than the latter are able to give; and the most rapid reader I have found is also the best at assimilating. I should further say that there is no relationship between rapidity of perception as thus tested and intellectual activity as tested by the general results of intellectual work; for I have tried the experiment with server highly distinguished men in science and literature, most whom I found to be slow readers.\" [59]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1] The word Perception. however, has been variously used. For historical notices, see Hamilton's Lectures on Metaphysics, ii. 96. For Hamilton perception is the consciousness of external objects (ib. 28). Spencer defines it oddly enough as \"a discerning of the relation or relations between states of consciousness partly presentative and partly representative; which states of consciousness must be themselves known to the extent involved in the knowledge of their relations\" (Psychol., 355).

The familiar noises of house and street keep them in constant trepidation until such time as they either learned the objects which emit them, or have become blunted to them by frequent experience of their innocuity.\n\n[5] Outlines, p. 153\n\n[6] Cf. Helmholtz, Optik, pp. 433, 723, 728, 772; and Spencer, Psychology, vol. n. p. 24q note.\n\n[7] The more or less geometrically regular phantasms which are produced by pressure on the eyeballs. congestion of the head inhalation of an\u00e6sthetics, etc., might again be cited to prove that feint and vague excitements of sense-organs are transformed into figured objects by the brain. only the facts are not quite clearly interpretable; and the figuring may possibly be due to some retinal peculiarity, as yet unexplored. Beautiful patterns, which would do for wall-papers, succeed each other when the eyeballs are long pressed. Goethe's account of his own phantasm of a flower is well known. It came in the middle of his visual held whenever he closed his eyes and depressed his head, ''unfolding itself and developing from its interior new flowers, formed of colored or sometimes green leaves, not natural but of fantastic forms, and symmetrical as the rosettes of sculptors,\" etc. (quoted in M\u00fcler's Physiology, Baly's tr., p. 1397). The fortification -- and zigzag-patterns, which are well-known appearances in the held of view in certain functional disorders, have characteristics (steadiness, coerciveness, blotting out of other objects) suggestive of a retinal origin -- this is why the entire class of phenomena treated of in this note seem to me still doubtfully connected with the cerebral factor in perception of which the text treuts.-- I copy from Taine's book on Intelligence (vol. I. p. 61) the translation of an interesting observation by Prof. M. Lazarus, in which the same effect of an after-image is seen. Lazarus himself proposes the name of 'visionary illusions' for such modifications of ideal pictures by peripheral stimulations (Lehre von den Sinnestiluschunjien, 1867, p. 19). \"I was on the Kaltbad terrace at Rigi, on a very clear afternoon, and attempting to make out the Waldbruder, a rock which stands out from the midst of the gigantic wall of mountains surrounding it, on whose summits we see like a crown the glaciers of Titlis, Uri-Rothsdock, etc. I was looking alternately with the naked eye and with a spy-glass ; but could not distinguish it with the naked eye. For the space of six to ten minutes I had gazed steadfastly upon the mountains, whose color varied according to their several altitudes or declivities between violet, brown, and dark green, and I had fatigued myself to no purpose, when I ceased looking and turned away. At that moment I saw before me (I cannot recollect whether my eyes were shut or open) the figure of an absent friend, like a corpse.... I asked myself at once how I had come to think of my absent friend. -- In a few seconds I regained the thread of my thoughts, which my looking for the Waldbruder had interrupted, and readily found that the idea of my friend had by a very simple necessity introduced itself among them. My recollecting him was thus naturally accounted for. -- But in addition to this, he had appeared as a corpse. How was this? -- At this moment, whether through fatigue or in order to think, I closed my eyes, and found at once the whole field of sight, over a considerable extent, covered with the same corpse-like hue, a greenish-yellow gray. I thought at once that I had here the principle of the desired explanation, and attempted to recall to memory the forms of other persons. And, in fact, these forms too appeared like corpses; standing or sitting, as I wished, all had a corpse-like tint. The persons whom I wished to see did not all appear to me as sensible phantoms; and again, when my eyes were open. I did not see phantoms, or at all events only saw them faintly, of no determined color. -- I then inquired how it was that phantoms of persons were affected by and colored like the visual held surrounding them, how their lines were traced, and if their faces and clothes were of the same color. But it was then too late or perhaps the influence of reflection and examination had been too powerful. All grew suddenly pale, and the subjective phenomenon which might have lasted some minutes longer had disappeared. -- It is plain that here an inward reminiscence, arising in accordance the laws of association, had combined with an optical after-image. excessive excitation of the periphery of the optic nerve. I mean the long-continued preceding sensation of my eyes when contemplating the color of the mountain, had indirectly provoked a subjective and durable sensation, that of the complemenatry color; and my reminiscence, incorporating itself with this subjective sensation, became the corpse-like phantom I have described.\"\n\n[8] Cf. Th. Reid's Intellectual Powers, essay ii. chap. xxii, and A. Binet. in Mind, Ix. 206. M. Binet points out the fact that what is fallaciously inferred is always an object of some other sense than the 'this.' 'Optics' illusions' are generally errors of touch and muscular sensibility, and the fallaciously perceived object and the experiences which correct it are both tactile in these cases\n\n[9] The converse illusion is hard to bring about. The points a and b. being normally in contact, mean to us the same space, and hence it might be supposed that when simultaneously touched, as by a pair of callipers, we should feel but one object, whilst as a matter of fact we feel two. It should be remarked in explanation of this that an object placed between ,fingers in their normal uncrossed position always awakens the sense of two contacts. When the fingers are pressed together we feel one object to be between them. And when the fingers are crossed, and their corresponding points a and b simultaneously pressed, we do get something like the of singleness -- that is, we get a very doubtful doubleness.\n\n[10] Purkinje, Mach, and Breuer are the authors to whom we mainly owe the explanation of the feeling of vertigo. I have found (American Journal of Ontology, Oct. 1882) that in deaf-mutes (whose semi-circular canals are auditory nerves must often be disorganized) there very frequently exists no susceptibility to giddiness or whirling\n\n[11] The involuntary continuance of the eye's motions is not the only cause of the false perception in these cases. There is also a true negative after-image of the original retinal movement-sensations, as we shall see in Chapter XX.\n\n[12] We never, so far as I know, get the converse illusion at a railroad station and believe the other train to move when it is still.\n\n[13] Helmholtz: Physiol.

The internal recti contract whenever we accommodate. They squint and produce double vision when the innervation for accommodation is excessive. To see singly, when straining the atropinized accommodation, the contraction of our internal reci must be neutralized by a correspondingly excessive contraction of the external reci.

Illusions would thus be logical fallacies, if true perceptions were valid syllogisms. They would draw false conclusions front undistributed middle terms.\n\n[39] See Spencer, Psychol. ii. p. 250, note, for physiological hypothesis to account for this fact.\n\n[40] Here is another good example, taken from Helmholtz's Optics, p. 435:\n\n\"The sight of a man walking is a familiar spectacle to us. We perceive it as a connected whole, and at most notice the most striking of its peculiarities. Strong attention is required, and a special choice of the point of\n\nview, in order to feel the perpendicular and lateral oscillations of such a walking figure. We must choose fitting points or lines in the background with which to compare the positions of its head. But if a distant walking man be looked at through all astronomical telescope (which inverts the object), what a singular hopping and rocking appearance he presents! No difficulty now in seeing the body's oscillations, and many other details of the gait.... But, on the other hand, its total character, whether light or clumsy, dignified or graceful, is harder to perceive than in the upright position.\"\n\n[41] Illusions and hallucinations must both be distinguished from delusions. A delusion is a false opinion about a matter of fact, which need not necessarily involve, though it often does involve, false perceptions of sensible things. We may, for example, have religions delusions, medical delusions, delusions about our own importance, about other peoples' characters, etc., ad libitum. The delusions of the insane are apt to affect certain typical forms, often very hard to explain. But in many cases they are certainly theories which the patients invent to account for their abnormal bodily sensations. In other cases they are due to hallucinations of hearing and osight. Dr. Clouston (Clinical Lectures on Mental Disease, lecture ii ad fin.) gives the following special delusions as having been found in about a hundred melancholy female patients who were afflicted in this way. There were delusions of general persecution; being destitute; general suspicion; being followed by the police; being poisoned; being very wicked; being killed; impending death; being conspired against; impending calamity; being defrauded; the soulbeing lost; being preached against in church; having no stomach; being pregnant; having no inside; having a bone in the throat; having neither stomach nor brains; having lost much money; being covered with vermin; being undt to live; letters being written about her; that she will not recover; property being stolen; that she is to be murdered; her children being killed; that she is to be boiled alive; having committed theft; that she is to be starved; the legs being made of glass; that the flesh is boiling; having helms on the head; that the head is severed from the body; being chloroformed; that children are burning; having committed murder; that murders take place around; fear of being hanged; that it is wrong to take food; being called names by persons; being in hell; being acted on by spirits; being tempted of the devil; being a man; being possessed of the devil; the body being transformed; having committed an unpardonable sin; insects coming from the body; unseen agencies working; rape being practised on her; her own identity; having a venereal disease; being on fire; being a fish; being dead; having committed 'suicide of the soul.'\n\n[42] V.

Myers terms 'veridical.'

Taine in his work Intelligence, book ii. chap. i.\n\n[48] Not, of course, in all cases, because the cells remaining active are the: selves on the way to be overpowered by the general (unknown) condition which sleep is due.\n\n[49] For a full account of Jackson's theories, see his 'Croonian Lectures' published in the Brit. Med. Journ. for 1884. Cf. also his remarks in the Discussion of Dr. Mercier's paper on Inhibition in 'Brain,' xi. 381.\n\nThe loss of vivacity in the images in the process of waking, as well as the gain of it in falling asleep, are both well described by M. Taine, who writes (on Intelligence, i. 50, 58) that often in the daytime, when fatigued and seated in a chair; it is sufficient for him to close one eye with a handkerchief when, \"by degrees, the sight of the other eye becomes vague, and it closes. All external sensations are gradually effaced, or cease, at all events, to be remarked; the internal images, on the other hand, feeble and rapid during the state of complete wakefulness, become intense, distinct, colored, steady, and lasting : there is a sort of ecstasy, accompanied by a feeling of expansion and of comfort. Warned by frequent experience, I know that sleep is coming on, and that I must not disturb the rising vision; I remain passive, and in a few minutes it is complete. Architecture, landscapes, moving figures, pass slowly by, and sometimes remain, with incomparable clearness of form and fulness of being; sleep comes on, and I know no more of the real world I am in. Many times, like M. Maury, I have caused myself to be gently roused at different moments of this state, and have thus been able to mark its characters. -- The intense image which seems an external object is hut a more forcible continuation of the feeble image which an instant before I recognized as internal some scrap of a forest, some house, some person which I vaguely imagined on closing my eyes, has in a minute become present to me with full bodily details, seas to change into a complete hallucination. Then, waking up on a hand touching me, I feel the figure decay, lose color and evaporate; what had appeared a substance is reduced toe shadow.... In such a case, I have often seen, for a passing moment, the image grow pale, waste away and evaporate; sometimes, on opening the eyes, a fragment of landscape or the skirt of a dress appears still to float over the fire-irons or on the black hearth.\" This persistence of dream objects for a few moments after the eyes are oppened seems to be no extremely rare experience. Many cases of it have been reported to me directly Compare Muuml;ller's Physiology, Baly's tr., p. 945\n\n[50] I say the 'normal 'paths. bectlnse hallucinations are not incompatible with some paths of association being left. Some hypnotic patients will not only have hallucinations of objects suggested to them, but will amplify them and act out the situation. But the paths here seem excessively narrow, and the reductions which ought to make the hallucination incredible do not occur to the subject's mind. In general, the narrower a train of 'ideas' is, the wider the consciousness is of each. Under ordinary circumstances, the entire brain probably plays a part in draining any centre which may be ideationally active. When the drainage is reduced in any way it probably makes the active process more intense.\n\n[51] M. A. Maury gives a number: op. cit. pp. 126-8.\n\n[52] M. Binet's highly important experiments, which were first published in vol. xvii of the Revue Philosophique (1884), ale also given in full in chapter rx of his and F\u00e9r\u0155 work on 'Animal Magnetism' in the International Scientific Series. Where there is no dot on the paper, nor any other visible mark, the subject's judgment about the 'portrait' would seem to be guided by what he sees happening to the entire sheet\n\n[53] It is a difficult thing to distinguish in a hypnotic patient between a genuine sensorial hallucination of something suggested and a conception of it merely, coupled with belief that it is there. I have been surprised at the vagueness with which such subjects will often trace upon blank paper the outlines of the pictures which they say they 'see' thereupon. On the other hand, you will hear them say that they find no difference between a real flower which you show them and an imaginary flower which you tell them is beside it. When told that one is imaginary and that they must pick out the real one, they sometimes say the choice is impossible, and sometimes they point to the imaginary flower.\n\n[54] Only the other day, in three hypnotized girls, I failed to double an hallucination with a prism. Of course it may not have been a fully-developed hallucination.\n\n[55] Brain, xi. 441.\n\n[56] Mind, x. 161, 316; and Phantasms of the Living (1886), i. 470-488.\n\n[57] In Mr. Gurney's work, just cited, a very large number of eases are critically discussed.\n\n[58] Mental Evolution in Animals, p. 136.\n\n[59] Literature.

"artist": "Medicine_ReMixed", "lyrics": "Why Getting the Flu Shot Won\u2019t Give You The Flu LyricsEverybody is talking about it. It\u2019s shaping up to be one of the worst flu seasons in years. And, with all the commotion It never fails, we hear it every year - \u201cNah man, I don\u2019t mess with the flu shot! The last time I got it, it gave me the flu!\u201d Or, the always classic \u201cWhy would I get that shot again? Last year I got it, and still got the flu!\u201d. With that being said, we decided to sit down and put together a short article on why getting the flu shot won\u2019t give you the flu, but also why it can\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get it either.\nTHE BASICS: Without getting too \u201csciency\u201d on you, lets talk about the flu shot itself. When you get a flu shot, what you\u2019re actually getting is what\u2019s known as a \u201cdead virus\u201d, which means the virus in the shot is, well, dead. \u201cThere is simply no way that the flu vaccine can give you the flu,\u201d says Christine Hay, MD, assistant professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible\u201d (we\u2019ll explain why it\u2019s impossible later).\n\n\u201cWHERE MY DOGS AT?\u201d: At this point, you\u2019re probably wondering to yourself, if what\u2019s in the flu-shot is \u201cdead\u201d then what\u2019s the point of getting it, right? Fair question, and here\u2019s a simple way to think of it. Your body has its own defense against \u201cintruders\u201d (i.e. your immune system), you can think of these as guard dogs, running throughout your body, attacking suspicious looking characters who might otherwise do you harm. These guard dogs have been trained to sniff out your run-of-the-mill \u201chome intruders\u201d, so most of the time when an intruder (playing the role of a virus in our scenario) tries to make its way into your body, your dogs are on the prowl and ready to handle your dirty work!\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem in this hypothetical scenario. Every year the home intruders get a little more clever, and they switch things up. Maybe they ditch the ski mask, its too obvious. Instead, this year they decided to roll with the hoodie instead, it\u2019s a little less suspicious. Now imagine the intruder makes his way inside your house, and it isn\u2019t until he starts wrecking shop that your guard dogs realize \u201cAww snap! We have a problem here!\u201d at which point they jump into action and try their best to control the situation. But, they\u2019re a little late to react to the intruder (they didn\u2019t know what to make of their new disguise at first), and he was able to break a few things and got away with some property.\n\nGranted, the dogs eventually sprung into action, but the damage had already been done. They only upside to this scenario is that if the home intruders come around again, dressed similarly to the recent intruders (i.e. wearing hoodies), your dogs will be ready to spring into action.\n\nFLU-SHOT IN TRAINING: What the flu shot does is basically offer up \u201ctraining\u201d for your guard dogs. The three most common \u201clooks\u201d for home intruders in your neighborhood are identified, rag-doll versions of them are made, and dressed to look exactly like them. The dogs are then introduced to the rag-doll intruders, and trained to attack them on sight! Even if it takes them a little while to be trained (just like it takes the flu shot a few weeks to \u201ckick in\u201d), it\u2019s okay because the rag-dolls pose no threat, they\u2019re not real, just as the dead virus in the flu-shot is not a threat.\nThe idea is this: Now that the guard dogs know what they\u2019re looking for, if and when the actual intruders show up, there will be little to no delay in attacking, and shutting them down! With no time to wreck shop, the bad guys stand little chance to do any harm to the home or the people inside!SO, WHY DID I STILL GET THE FLU LAST YEAR?: Now that you (hopefully) have a little better understanding of why we get flu shots, and how they work, lets talk about why some people still get the flu, despite having received their shot. One explanation is simply that (again, continuing with our guard dog and home intruder analogy from above) the home intruder was not dressed like one of the three included in the vaccine. Makers of the the flu-shots do their best to identify the top three strains they think will most likely be infecting people in your area. However, there is no way they can possibly account for all of the flu strains (just like it would be impossible to guess what every potential home intruder would look like). But, life is all about percentages and odds, so the idea is to stack the odds in your favor: If you\u2019re at risk for catching the flu (which we all are), here are the most likely critters to get you, and here is a vaccine against those strains. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nA more obvious explanation can be that you were exposed to the flu virus before you received your shot, or in the two weeks it takes for the shot to start protecting your body. Lastly, some people just love a good conspiracy theory, and at the first sign of a sniffle or a cough, will mistake their symptoms for the flu instead of what it actually is, a simple cold.\n\nInjury-Duty Insight: There you have it. Now you know how the flu shot works, and even why it sometimes doesn\u2019t. Keep in mind that flu season in the United States tends to start around November and continues to peak all the way through April, so there\u2019s plenty of reason to still go out and get yours, should you want it. Also keep in mind that children (over 6 months) and elderly (over 65 years old) should be first in line to get their shots, because the babies, well their guard dogs are just puppies (they need all the training they can get!) and the older folks, well their guard dogs don\u2019t react as quickly as they used to, so they need all the head-start they can get!Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

Remember LyricsTry to remember the kind of September\nWhen life was slow and oh, so mellow\nTry to remember the kind of September\nWhen grass was green and grain was yellow\nTry to remember the kind of September\nWhen you were a tender and callow fellow\nTry to remember and if you remember the follow\n\nTry to remember when life was so tender\nThat no one wept except the willow\nTry to remember when life was so tender that\nDreams were kept beside your pillow\nTry to remember when life was so tender that\nLove was an ember about to billow\nTry to remember and if you remember then follow\nDeep in December it's nice to remember\nAltho you know the snow will follow\nDeep in December it's nice to remember\nWithout the hurt the heart is hollow\nDeep in December it's nice to remember\nThe fire of September that made us mellow\nDeep in December our hearts should remember and followYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

break us up, tryin' to make you mad\nHe's about to make you lose the best love you've ever had\nOh oh boy, use your head, oh oh boy\n\nListen to your heart & not his words\nI knew from the start that he was against us\nPlease don't think that I've been untrue to you, oh no boy\nAlthough he treats you nice & claims to be your friend\nHe's always askin' me if he can call me now & then\nOh oh boy, use your head, oh oh boy\n(instrumental)\n\nI tell that you must have faith in me\nGive me your trust & I'll never betray you\nBut don't let him say I'm not the girl for you, oh no boy\nHe's only jealous, can't you read between the lines?\nEvery time you turn your back he's tryin' to break your time\nOh oh boy, use your head, oh oh boy, use your head\nDon't let him say bad things about

hurt mine much more\nAnd I've got to explain that it's all over (It's all over now)\nHow do I tell her that I'm in love with you?\nWhat words can I use to say you love me too\nWithout making her cry, am I a no good guy?\nI've got to explain it's all over now (It's all over now)\n[Chorus]\nShould I start a false fight?\n(No, no, that wouldn't do)\nIt wouldn't be right\n(No, no, that wouldn't do)\nShould I just run away?\n(No, no, that wouldn't do)\nI've got to find a way to say it's all over now (It's all over now)\n(It's all over)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow can I tell her about the way we feel?\nAll the happiness we share, yet with her it's like a shield\nThat has been plunged into the ground, so wide I can't get around\nBut I've got to explain it's all over (It's all over now)\n\n[Chorus]\nShould I start a false fight?\n(No, no, that wouldn't do)\nIt wouldn't be right\n(No, no, that wouldn't do)\nShould I just run away?\n(No, no, that wouldn't do)\nI've got to explain

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYes, oh yes, Long Distance, I'll accept the charge, I'll pay\nWhich loved one is calling me, I did not hear you say\nBoth are deep within my heart, her Mom and my Marie\nIt's so good to hear your voice from Memphis, Tennessee\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, you mean so much to me, more than you'll ever know\nSurely, you have not forgot how much I love you so\nIf you would remember, Dear and sometimes talk to me\nMaybe that would reunite our home in Tennessee\n[Guitar solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nLast time I saw you, just before I had to leave\nYou did not want to see me off and promised not to grieve\nMy heart was torn apart as I looked back at my Marie\nAnd there the pieces still remain with you in Tennessee\n\n[Verse 4]\nI guess I should stop talking, after all you placed the call\nBut anyway that I can help, you know I'll help you all\nThen she spoke and asked me to come back and see Marie\nAnd live together in our home in Memphis, TennesseeYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type":

It\u2019s a bigger deal if I drove legal\nOnly thing on my mind is which vodka I\u2019ll rip shots of\nShoving nerd-ass zit-poppers in gym lockers\nIllest hip-hopper and shit-talker, trick-dropper like Vince Offer\nMurder weapon getting cleaned with the Slapchop in the dishwasher\nClean money\u2019s got my dick softer. How quick can it get laundered?\nCalled the nurse\u2019s tits \u201cknockers\u201d and now I gotta switch doctors?\nEvery action I take\u2019s a red flag, like when I did soccer\nI know the first four were rough, girl, but how\u2019d you  like a fifth stalker?\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou see your checkbook?

Not with me, fuck Clippers, I got a razor blade\nThat I\u2019m taking to your skull til I\u2019m shaving brain\nWas a good kid, but from GTA games I was made insane\nNow I\u2019m fucking up more tricks than an inebriated David Blaine\nMaking a noose, got a tight rope like the Wallenda brothers\nDear Woodchipper, thanks for making sure those bodies ain't been recovered\nSuch a nightmare I got the closet monster hiding in the covers\nHey, escort service, the bitch is dead, send another\nDrop some spare clothes in a box and donate books\nThen throw in a match and spill some propane - oops\nI ain't been eating powdered donuts, it\u2019s called cocaine, toots\nKilled my manager then still bitch about how my shows ain't booked\nNovacaine, doc? Shit, I already got liquored and bought pliers\nBut, fuck it, try the I.V., as if it\u2019s possible I got higher\nAll these pills I\u2019m a Tic Tac from foaming like a rottweiler\nTook so much acid earlier, I could just burp and rot iron\nGator bill so high I ain't even got fluids in the dang moat\nBut you\u2019re still getting chucked in, cuz I\u2019m doing it insane, yo\nHating Decibel?

[i]\n\nWho would not laugh, if Lawrence [1], hired to grace [ii]\nHis costly canvas with each flattered face,\nAbused his art, till Nature, with a blush,\nSaw cits grow Centaurs underneath his brush?\nOr, should some limner join, for show or sale,\nA Maid of Honour to a Mermaid's tail? [iii]\nOr low Dubost [2]\u2014as once the world has seen\u2014\nDegrade God's creatures in his graphic spleen?\nNot all that forced politeness, which defends\nFools in their faults, could gag his grinning friends.\nBelieve me, Moschus, like that picture seems [iv]\nThe book which, sillier than a sick man's dreams,\nDisplays a crowd of figures incomplete,\nPoetic Nightmares, without head or feet.\nPoets and painters, as all artists know, [v]\nMay shoot a little with a lengthened bow;\nWe claim this mutual mercy for our task,\nAnd grant in turn the pardon which we ask;\nBut make not monsters spring from gentle dams\u2014\nBirds breed not vipers, tigers nurse not lambs.\n\nA laboured, long Exordium, sometimes tends\n(Like patriot speeches) but to paltry ends; [vi]\nAnd nonsense in a lofty note goes down,\nAs Pertness passes with a legal gown: [vii]\nThus many a Bard describes in pompous strain [viii]\nThe clear brook babbling through the goodly plain:\nThe groves of Granta, and her Gothic halls,\nKing's Coll-Cam's stream-stained windows, and old walls:\nOr, in adventurous numbers, neatly aims\nTo paint a rainbow, or the river Thames. [3]\n\nYou sketch a tree, and so perhaps may shine [ix]\u2014\nBut daub a shipwreck like an alehouse sign;\nYou plan a vase\u2014it dwindles to a pot;\nThen glide down Grub-street\u2014fasting and forgot:\nLaughed into Lethe by some quaint Review,\nWhose wit is never troublesome till\u2014true.\nIn fine, to whatsoever you aspire,\nLet it at least be simple and entire.\nThe greater portion of the rhyming tribe [x]\n(Give ear, my friend, for thou hast been a scribe)\nAre led astray by some peculiar lure. [xi]\nI labour to be brief\u2014become obscure;\nOne falls while following Elegance too fast;\nAnother soars, inflated with Bombast;\nToo low a third crawls on, afraid to fly,\nHe spins his subject to Satiety;\nAbsurdly varying, he at last engraves\nFish in the woods, and boars beneath the waves! [xii]\nUnless your care's exact, your judgment nice,\nThe flight from Folly leads but into Vice;\n\nNone are complete, all wanting in some part,\nLike certain tailors, limited in art.\nFor galligaskins Slowshears is your man [xiii]\nBut coats must claim another artisan. [4]\nNow this to me, I own, seems much the same\nAs Vulcan's feet to bear Apollo's frame;\nOr, with a fair complexion, to expose\nBlack eyes, black ringlets, but\u2014a bottle nose!\nDear Authors! suit your topics to your strength,\nAnd ponder well your subject, and its length;\n\nNor lift your load, before you're quite aware\nWhat weight your shoulders will, or will not, bear.\nBut lucid Order, and Wit's siren voice, [xiv]\nAwait the Poet, skilful in his choice;\nWith native Eloquence he soars along,\nGrace in his thoughts, and Music in his song.\nLet Judgment teach him wisely to combine\nWith future parts the now omitted line:\nThis shall the Author choose, or that reject,\nPrecise in style, and cautious to select;\nNor slight applause will candid pens afford\nTo him who furnishes a wanting word.

Dacier, Mons. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Boileau, and others, have left their dispute on the meaning of this sentence in a tract considerably longer than the poem of Horace. It is printed at the close of the eleventh volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9's Letters, edited by Grouvelle, Paris, 1806. Presuming that all who can construe may venture an opinion on such subjects, particularly as so many who can't have taken the same liberty, I should have held \"my farthing candle\" as awkwardly as another, had not my respect for the wits of Louis 14th's Augustan \"Si\u00e8cle\" induced me to subjoin these illustrious authorities. I therefore offer:\n\nfirstly Boileau: \"Il est difficile de trailer des sujets qui sont \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de tout le monde d'une maniere qui vous les rende propres, ce qui s'appelle s'approprier un sujet par le tour qu'on y donne.\"\n\n2dly, Batteux: \"Mais il est bien difficile de donner des traits propres et individuels aux etres purement possibles.\"\n\n3dly, Dacier: \"Il est difficile de traiter convenablement ces caract\u00e8res que tout le monde peut inventer.\"\n\nMr. S\u00e9vign\u00e9's opinion and translation, consisting of some thirty pages, I omit, particularly as Mr. Grouvelle observes, \"La chose est bien remarquable, aucune de ces diverses interpretations ne parait \u00eatre la veritable.\" But, by way of comfort, it seems, fifty years afterwards, \"Le lumineux Dumarsais\" made his appearance, to set Horace on his legs again, \"dissiper tous les nuages, et concilier tous les dissentiments;\" and I suppose some fifty years hence, somebody, still more luminous, will doubtless start up and demolish Dumarsais and his system on this weighty affair, as if he were no better than Ptolemy or Copernicus and comments of no more consequence than astronomical calculations. I am happy to say, \"la longueur de la dissertation\" of Mr. D. prevents Mr. G. from saying any more on the matter. A better poet than Boileau, and at least as good a scholar as Mr. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, has said,\n\n\"A little learning is a dangerous thing.\"\n\nAnd by the above extract, it appears that a good deal may be rendered as useless to the Proprietors.\n\n[Byron chose the words in question, Difficile,' etc., as a motto for the first five cantos of 'Don Juan']\n\n[Footnote 16: About two years ago a young man named Townsend was announced by Mr. Cumberland, in a review (since deceased) [the 'London Review'], as being engaged in an epic poem to be entitled \"Armageddon.\" The plan and specimen promise much; but I hope neither to offend Mr. Townsend, nor his friends, by recommending to his attention the lines of Horace to which these rhymes allude. If Mr. Townsend succeeds in his undertaking, as there is reason to hope, how much will the world be indebted to Mr. Cumberland for bringing him before the public! But, till that eventful day arrives, it may be doubted whether the premature display of his plan (sublime as the ideas confessedly are) has not,\u2014by raising expectation too high, or diminishing curiosity, by developing his argument,\u2014rather incurred the hazard of injuring Mr. Townsend's future prospects. Mr. Cumberland (whose talents I shall not depreciate by the humble tribute of my praise) and Mr. Townsend must not suppose me actuated by unworthy motives in this suggestion. I wish the author all the success he can wish himself, and shall be truly happy to see epic poetry weighed up from the bathos where it lies sunken with Southey, Cottle, Cowley (Mrs. or Abraham), Ogilvy, Wilkie, Pye, and all the \"dull of past and present days.\" Even if he is not a 'Milton', he may be better than 'Blackmore'; if not a 'Homer', an 'Antimachus'. I should deem myself presumptuous, as a young man, in offering advice, were it not addressed to one still younger. Mr. Townsend has the greatest difficulties to encounter; but in conquering them he will find employment; in having conquered them, his reward. I know too well \"the scribbler's scoff, the critic's contumely;\" and I am afraid time will teach Mr. Townsend to know them better. Those who succeed, and those who do not, must bear this alike, and it is hard to say which have most of it. I trust that Mr. Townsend's share will be from 'envy'; he will soon know mankind well enough not to attribute this expression to malice.

Indeed, the public school penance of \"Long and Short\" is enough to beget an antipathy to poetry for the residue of a man's life, and, perhaps, so far may be an advantage.]\n\n[Footnote 19:\n\n\"'Infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem'.\"\n\nI dare say Mr. Tavell (to whom I mean no affront) will understand me; and it is no matter whether any one else does or no.\u2014To the above events, \"'qu\u00e6que ipse miserrima vidi, et quorum pars magna fui',\" all 'times' and 'terms' bear testimony.

The motion was lost; but many years after, in a speech delivered in the House of Lords, January 2, 1807, he returned to the charge. (See 'Parl. Hist'., 34. 1006, 1010; and 'Parl. Deb'., 8. 286.)

His solo entertainments, in 'The Dish of Tea, An Auction of Pictures', 1747-8 (see his comedy 'Taste'), were the precursors of 'Mathews at Home', and a long line of successors. His farces and curtain-pieces were often \"spiced-up\" with more or less malicious character-sketches of living persons. Among his better known pieces are 'The Minor' (1760), ridiculing Whitefield and the Methodists, and 'The Mayor of Garratt' (1763), in which he played the part of Sturgeon (Byron used this piece, for an illustration in his speech on the Frame-workers Bill, February 27, 1812).

The well-known lines, \"Go, call a coach, and let a coach be called,\" etc., which Scott prefixed to the first chapter of The Antiquary, are from the last scene, in which Bombardinion fights with and kills the King Chrononhotonthologos.

It may be noted that a friend (the Rev. W. Parish), to whom he submitted the MS. of a rejoinder to Pearson's 'Cautions, etc.', advised him to print it, \"especially if you should rather keep down a lash or two which might irritate.\" Simeon was naturally irascible, and, in reply to a friend who had mildly reproved him for some display of temper, signed himself, in humorous penitence, \"Charles proud and irritable.\" (See 'Memoirs of the Life of the Rev.

I refer them to their own pages, where they congratulated themselves on the prospect of a tilt between Mr. Jeffrey and myself, from which some great good was to accrue, provided one or both were knocked on the head. Having survived two years and a half those \"Elegies\" which they were kindly preparing to review, I have no peculiar gusto to give them \"so joyful a trouble,\" except, indeed, \"upon compulsion, Hal;\" but if, as David says in 'The Rivals', it should come to \"bloody sword and gun fighting,\" we \"won't run, will we, Sir Lucius?\" [Byron, writing at Athens, away from his books, misquotes 'The Rivals'.

Had any other set of men expressed such sentiments, I should have smiled, and left them to the \"recording angel;\" but from the pharisees of Christianity decency might be expected. I can assure these brethren, that, publican and sinner as I am, I would not have treated \"mine enemy's dog thus.\" To show them the superiority of my brotherly love, if ever the Reverend Messrs.

A literary friend of mine, walking out one lovely evening last summer, on the eleventh bridge of the Paddington canal, was alarmed by the cry of \"one in jeopardy:\" he rushed along, collected a body of Irish haymakers (supping on butter-milk in an adjacent paddock), procured three rakes, one eel-spear and a landing net, and at last ('horresco referens') pulled out\u2014his own publisher. The unfortunate man was gone for ever, and so was a large quarto wherewith he had taken the leap, which proved, on inquiry, to have been Mr. Southey's last work. Its \"alacrity of sinking\" was so great, that it has never since been heard of; though some maintain that it is at this moment concealed at Alderman Birch's pastry premises, Cornhill. Be this as it may, the coroner's inquest brought in a verdict of \"'Felo de bibliopol\u00e2'\" against a \"quarto unknown;\" and circumstantial evidence being since strong against 'The Curse of Kehama' (of which the above words are an exact description), it will be tried by its peers next session, in Grub-street\u2014Arthur, Alfred, Davideis, Richard Coeur de Lion, Exodus, Exodiad, Epigoniad, Calvary, Fall of Cambria, Siege of Acre, Don Roderick, and Tom Thumb the Great, are the names of the twelve jurors.

By the bye, it is a good deal beneath Scott and Campbell, and not much above Southey, to allow the booby Ballantyne to entitle them, in the 'Edinburgh Annual Register' (of which, by the bye, Southey is editor) \"the grand poetical triumvirate of the day.\" But, on second thoughts, it can be no great degree of praise to be the one-eyed leaders of the blind, though they might as well keep to themselves \"Scott's thirty thousand copies sold,\" which must sadly discomfort poor Southey's unsaleables. Poor Southey, it should seem, is the \"Lepidus\" of this poetical triumvirate.

Jeffrey was counsel for the pursuer, who sought to recover a sum of \u00a35000 lent under a bond. For the defence it was alleged that the money had been entrusted for a particular purpose, namely, the maintenance of an infant. Jeffrey denied the existence of any such claim, and maintained that whatever was scandalous or calumnious in the defence was absolutely untrue. The case, which was not included in the Scottish Law Reports, was probably settled out of court. Evidently the judge held that on technical grounds an action did not lie. Burdett's enemies were not slow in turning the scandal to account.

In 1795, at the instance of his chief, Lord Grenville, he vacated his post, and by way of compensation was created a baronet with a sinecure post as Knight-Marshal of the Royal Household. Thenceforth he devoted himself to literature. In 1796 he wrote the 'Birth and Triumph of Love', by way of letter-press to some elegant designs of the Princess Elizabeth.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.This civil action was brought under 42 U. S. C.  1983 and 1988 to redress the alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights. The complaint, alleging that by means of a 1901 statute of Tennessee apportioning the members of the General Assembly among the State's 95 counties,[1] \"these plaintiffs and others similarly situated, *188 are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by virtue of the debasement of their votes,\" was dismissed by a three-judge court convened under 28 U. S. C.  2281 in the Middle District of Tennessee.[2] The court held that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter and also that no claim was stated upon which relief could be granted. 179 F. Supp. 824. We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal. 364 U. S. 898.[3] We hold that the dismissal was error, and remand the cause to the District Court for trial and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nThe General Assembly of Tennessee consists of the Senate with 33 members and the House of Representatives with 99 members. The Tennessee Constitution provides in Art. II as follows:\"Sec. 3. Legislative authorityTerm of office. The Legislative authority of this State shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives, both dependent on the people; who shall hold their offices for two years from the day of the general election.\"Sec. 4. Census.An enumeration of the qualified voters, and an apportionment of the Representatives in the General Assembly, shall be made in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and within every subsequent term of ten years.\"Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.The number of Representatives shall, at the several *189 periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided, that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.\"Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators.The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no county shall be divided in forming a district.\"Thus, Tennessee's standard for allocating legislative representation among her counties is the total number of qualified voters resident in the respective counties, subject only to minor qualifications.[4] Decennial reapportionment *190 in compliance with the constitutional scheme was effected by the General Assembly each decade from 1871 to 1901. The 1871 apportionment[5] was preceded by an 1870 statute requiring an enumeration.[6] The 1881 apportionment involved three statutes, the first authorizing an enumeration, the second enlarging the Senate from 25 to *191 33 members and the House from 75 to 99 members, and the third apportioning the membership of both Houses.[7] In 1891 there were both an enumeration and an apportionment.[8] In 1901 the General Assembly abandoned separate enumeration in favor of reliance upon the Federal Census and passed the Apportionment Act here in controversy.[9] In the more than 60 years since that action, all proposals in both Houses of the General Assembly for reapportionment have failed to pass.[10]\n*192 Between 1901 and 1961, Tennessee has experienced substantial growth and redistribution of her population. In 1901 the population was 2,020,616, of whom 487,380 were eligible to vote.[11] The 1960 Federal Census reports the State's population at 3,567,089, of whom 2,092,891 are eligible to vote.[12] The relative standings of the counties in terms of qualified voters have changed significantly. It is primarily the continued application of the 1901 Apportionment Act to this shifted and enlarged voting population which gives rise to the present controversy.\n\nIndeed, the complaint alleges that the 1901 statute, even as of the time of its passage, \"made no apportionment of Representatives and Senators in accordance with the constitutional formula . . . , but instead arbitrarily and capriciously apportioned representatives in the Senate and House without reference . . . to any logical or reasonable formula whatever.\"[13] It is further alleged *193 that \"because of the population changes since 1900, and the failure of the Legislature to reapportion itself since 1901,\" the 1901 statute became \"unconstitutional and obsolete.\" Appellants also argue that, because of the composition of the legislature effected by the 1901 Apportionment Act, redress in the form of a state constitutional amendment to change the entire mechanism for reapportioning, or any other change short of that, is difficult or impossible.[14] The complaint concludes that \"these plaintiffs *194 and others similarly situated, are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by virtue of the debasement of their votes.\"[15] They seek a *195 declaration that the 1901 statute is unconstitutional and an injunction restraining the appellees from acting to conduct any further elections under it. They also pray that unless and until the General Assembly enacts a valid reapportionment, the District Court should either decree a reapportionment by mathematical application of the Tennessee constitutional formulae to the most recent Federal Census figures, or direct the appellees to conduct legislative elections, primary and general, at large. They also pray for such other and further relief as may be appropriate.I.THE DISTRICT COURT'S OPINION AND ORDER OF DISMISSAL.Because we deal with this case on appeal from an order of dismissal granted on appellees' motions, precise identification *196 of the issues presently confronting us demands clear exposition of the grounds upon which the District Court rested in dismissing the case. The dismissal order recited that the court sustained the appellees' grounds \"(1) that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, and (2) that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted . . . .\"\n\nIn the setting of a case such as this, the recited grounds embrace two possible reasons for dismissal:\n\nFirst: That the facts and injury alleged, the legal bases invoked as creating the rights and duties relied upon, and the relief sought, fail to come within that language of Article III of the Constitution and of the jurisdictional statutes which define those matters concerning which United States District Courts are empowered to act;\n\nSecond: That, although the matter is cognizable and facts are alleged which establish infringement of appellants' rights as a result of state legislative action departing from a federal constitutional standard, the court will not proceed because the matter is considered unsuited to judicial inquiry or adjustment.\n\nWe treat the first ground of dismissal as \"lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter.\" The second we consider to result in a failure to state a justiciable cause of action.\n\nThe District Court's dismissal order recited that it was issued in conformity with the court's per curiam opinion. The opinion reveals that the court rested its dismissal upon lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and lack of a justiciable cause of action without attempting to distinguish between these grounds. After noting that the plaintiffs challenged the existing legislative apportionment in Tennessee under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, and summarizing the supporting allegations and the relief requested, the court stated that\"The action is presently before the Court upon the defendants' motion to dismiss predicated upon three *197 grounds: first, that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter; second, that the complaints fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and third, that indispensable party defendants are not before the Court.\" 179 F. Supp., at 826.The court proceeded to explain its action as turning on the case's presenting a \"question of the distribution of political strength for legislative purposes.\" For,\"From a review of [numerous Supreme Court] . . . decisions there can be no doubt that the federal rule, as enunciated and applied by the Supreme Court, is that the federal courts, whether from a lack of jurisdiction or from the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial consideration, will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment.\" 179 F. Supp., at 826.The court went on to express doubts as to the feasibility of the various possible remedies sought by the plaintiffs. 179 F. Supp., at 827-828. Then it made clear that its dismissal reflected a view not of doubt that violation of constitutional rights was alleged, but of a court's impotence to correct that violation:\"With the plaintiffs' argument that the legislature of Tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state constitution and of the rights of the plaintiffs the Court entirely agrees. It also agrees that the evil is a serious one which should be corrected without further delay. But even so the remedy in this situation clearly does not lie with the courts. It has long been recognized and is accepted doctrine that there are indeed some rights guaranteed by the Constitution for the violation of which the courts cannot give redress.\" 179 F. Supp., at 828.In light of the District Court's treatment of the case, we hold today only (a) that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (b) that a justiciable cause of *198 action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief; and (c) because appellees raise the issue before this Court, that the appellants have standing to challenge the Tennessee apportionment statutes.[16] Beyond noting that we have no cause at this stage to doubt the District Court will be able to fashion relief if violations of constitutional rights are found, it is improper now to consider what remedy would be most appropriate if appellants prevail at the trial.II.JURISDICTION OF THE SUBJECT MATTER.The District Court was uncertain whether our cases withholding federal judicial relief rested upon a lack of federal jurisdiction or upon the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial considerationwhat we have designated \"nonjusticiability.\" The distinction between the two grounds is significant. In the instance of nonjusticiability, consideration of the cause is not wholly and immediately foreclosed; rather, the Court's inquiry necessarily proceeds to the point of deciding whether the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded. In the instance of lack of jurisdiction the cause either does not \"arise under\" the Federal Constitution, laws or treaties (or fall within one of the other enumerated categories of Art. III,  2), or is not a \"case or controversy\" within the meaning of that section; or the cause is not one described by any jurisdictional statute. Our conclusion, see pp. 208-237. infra, that this cause presents no nonjusticiable \"political question\" settles the only possible doubt that it is a case or controversy. Under the present heading of \"Jurisdiction *199 of the Subject Matter\" we hold only that the matter set forth in the complaint does arise under the Constitution and is within 28 U. S. C.  1343.\n\nArticle III,  2, of the Federal Constitution provides that \"The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority . . . .\" It is clear that the cause of action is one which \"arises under\" the Federal Constitution. The complaint alleges that the 1901 statute effects an apportionment that deprives the appellants of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Dismissal of the complaint upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter would, therefore, be justified only if that claim were \"so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit,\" Newburyport Water Co. v. Newburyport, 193 U. S. 561, 579, or \"frivolous,\" Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 683.[17] That the claim is unsubstantial must be \"very plain.\" Hart v. Keith Vaudeville Exchange, 262 U. S. 271, 274. Since the District Court obviously and correctly did not deem the asserted federal constitutional claim unsubstantial and frivolous, it should not have dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter. And of course no further consideration of the merits of the claim is relevant to a determination of the court's jurisdiction of the subject matter. We said in an earlier voting case from Tennessee: \"It is obvious . . . that the court, in dismissing for want of jurisdiction, was controlled by what it deemed to be the want of merit in the averments which were made in the complaint as to the violation of the Federal right. But as the very nature of the controversy was Federal, and, therefore, *200 jurisdiction existed, whilst the opinion of the court as to the want of merit in the cause of action might have furnished ground for dismissing for that reason, it afforded no sufficient ground for deciding that the action was not one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U. S. 487, 493. \"For it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.\" Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 682. See also Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, 263 U. S. 291, 305-308.\n\nSince the complaint plainly sets forth a case arising under the Constitution, the subject matter is within the federal judicial power defined in Art. III,  2, and so within the power of Congress to assign to the jurisdiction of the District Courts. Congress has exercised that power in 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3):\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law[18] to be commenced by any person . . . [t]o redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States . . . .\"[19]*201 An unbroken line of our precedents sustains the federal courts' jurisdiction of the subject matter of federal constitutional claims of this nature. The first cases involved the redistricting of States for the purpose of electing Representatives to the Federal Congress. When the Ohio Supreme Court sustained Ohio legislation against an attack for repugnancy to Art. I,  4, of the Federal Constitution, we affirmed on the merits and expressly refused to dismiss for want of jurisdiction \"In view . . . of the subject-matter of the controversy and the Federal characteristics which inhere in it . . . .\" Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565, 570. When the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of a suit to enjoin the Secretary of State of Minnesota from acting under Minnesota redistricting legislation, we reviewed the constitutional merits of the legislation and reversed the State Supreme Court. Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355. And see companion cases from the New York Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court, Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U. S. 375; Carroll v. Becker, 285 U. S. 380. When a three-judge District Court, exercising jurisdiction under the predecessor of 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3), permanently enjoined officers of the State of Mississippi from conducting an election of Representatives under a Mississippi redistricting act, we reviewed the federal questions on the merits and reversed the District Court. Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1, reversing 1 F. Supp. 134. A similar decree of a District Court, exercising jurisdiction under the same statute, concerning a Kentucky redistricting act, was *202 reviewed and the decree reversed. Mahan v. Hume, 287 U. S. 575, reversing 1 F. Supp. 142.[20]\n\nThe appellees refer to Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, as authority that the District Court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter. Appellees misconceive the holding of that case. The holding was precisely contrary to their reading of it. Seven members of the Court participated in the decision. Unlike many other cases in this field which have assumed without discussion that there was jurisdiction, all three opinions filed in Colegrove discussed the question. Two of the opinions expressing the views of four of the Justices, a majority, flatly held that there was jurisdiction of the subject matter. MR. JUSTICE BLACK joined by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice Murphy stated: \"It is my judgment that the District Court had jurisdiction . . . ,\" citing the predecessor of 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3), and Bell v. Hood, supra. 328 U. S., at 568. Mr. Justice Rutledge, writing separately, expressed agreement with this conclusion. 328 U. S., at 564, 565, n. 2. Indeed, it is even questionable that the opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, joined by Justices Reed and Burton, doubted jurisdiction of the subject matter. Such doubt would have been inconsistent with the professed willingness to turn the decision on either the majority or concurring views in Wood v. Broom, supra. 328 U. S., at 551.\n\nSeveral subsequent cases similar to Colegrove have been decided by the Court in summary per curiam statements. None was dismissed for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter. Cook v. Fortson, 329 U. S. 675; Turman v. *203 Duckworth, ibid.; Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804;[21]Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940; Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916; Cox v. Peters, 342 U. S. 936; Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912; Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920; Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991; Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U. S. 916; Matthews v. Handley, 361 U. S. 127.[22]\n\nTwo cases decided with opinions after Colegrove likewise plainly imply that the subject matter of this suit is within District Court jurisdiction. In MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, the District Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction, which had been invoked under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3), a suit to enjoin enforcement of the requirement that nominees for state-wide elections be supported by a petition signed by a minimum number of persons from at least 50 of the State's 102 counties. This Court's disagreement with that action is clear since the Court affirmed the judgment after a review of the merits and concluded that the particular claim there was without merit. In South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, we affirmed the dismissal of an attack on the Georgia \"county unit\" system but founded our action on a ground that plainly would not have been reached if the lower court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, which allegedy existed under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3). The express words of our holding were that \"Federal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity powers in cases posing *204 political issues arising from a state's geographical distribution of electoral strength among its political subdivisions.\" 339 U. S., at 277.\n\nWe hold that the District Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of the federal constitutional claim asserted in the complaint.III.STANDING.A federal court cannot \"pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.\" Liverpool Steamship Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U. S. 33, 39. Have the appellants alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions? This is the gist of the question of standing. It is, of course, a question of federal law.\nThe complaint was filed by residents of Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Montgomery, and Shelby Counties. Each is a person allegedly qualified to vote for members of the General Assembly representing his county.[23] These appellants sued \"on their own behalf and on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties, and further, on behalf of all voters of the State of Tennessee who *205 are similarly situated . . . .\"[24] The appellees are the Tennessee Secretary of State, Attorney General, Coordinator of Elections, and members of the State Board of Elections; the members of the State Board are sued in their own right and also as representatives of the County Election Commissioners whom they appoint.[25]\n*206 We hold that the appellants do have standing to maintain this suit. Our decisions plainly support this conclusion. Many of the cases have assumed rather than articulated the premise in deciding the merits of similar claims.[26] And Colegrove v. Green, supra, squarely held that voters who allege facts showing disadvantage to themselves as individuals have standing to sue.[27] A number *207 of cases decided after Colegrove recognized the standing of the voters there involved to bring those actions.[28]\n\nThese appellants seek relief in order to protect or vindicate an interest of their own, and of those similarly situated. Their constitutional claim is, in substance, that the 1901 statute constitutes arbitrary and capricious state action, offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment in its irrational disregard of the standard of apportionment prescribed by the State's Constitution or of any standard, effecting a gross disproportion of representation to voting population. The injury which appellants assert is that this classification disfavors the voters in the counties in which they reside, placing them in a position of constitutionally unjustifiable inequality vis-a-vis voters *208 in irrationally favored counties. A citizen's right to a vote free of arbitrary impairment by state action has been judicially recognized as a right secured by the Constitution, when such impairment resulted from dilution by a false tally, cf. United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299; or by a refusal to count votes from arbitrarily selected precincts, cf. United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383, or by a stuffing of the ballot box, cf. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371; United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S. 385.\n\nIt would not be necessary to decide whether appellants' allegations of impairment of their votes by the 1901 apportionment will, ultimately, entitle them to any relief, in order to hold that they have standing to seek it. If such impairment does produce a legally cognizable injury, they are among those who have sustained it. They are asserting \"a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes,\" Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S., at 438, not merely a claim of \"the right, possessed by every citizen, to require that the Government be administered according to law . . . .\" Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126, 129; compare Leser v. Garnett, 258 U. S. 130. They are entitled to a hearing and to the District Court's decision on their claims. \"The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.\" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163.IV.JUSTICIABILITY.In holding that the subject matter of this suit was not justiciable, the District Court relied on Colegrove v. Green, supra, and subsequent per curiam cases.[29] The *209 court stated: \"From a review of these decisions there can be no doubt that the federal rule . . . is that the federal courts . . . will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment.\" 179 F. Supp., at 826. We understand the District Court to have read the cited cases as compelling the conclusion that since the appellants sought to have a legislative apportionment held unconstitutional, their suit presented a \"political question\" and was therefore nonjusticiable. We hold that this challenge to an apportionment presents no nonjusticiable \"political question.\" The cited cases do not hold the contrary.\n\nOf course the mere fact that the suit seeks protection of a political right does not mean it presents a political question. Such an objection \"is little more than a play upon words.\" Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536, 540. Rather, it is argued that apportionment cases, whatever the actual wording of the complaint, can involve no federal constitutional right except one resting on the guaranty of a republican form of government,[30] and that complaints based on that clause have been held to present political questions which are nonjusticiable.\n\nWe hold that the claim pleaded here neither rests upon nor implicates the Guaranty Clause and that its justiciability is therefore not foreclosed by our decisions of cases involving that clause. The District Court misinterpreted Colegrove v. Green and other decisions of this Court on which it relied. Appellants' claim that they are being denied equal protection is justiciable, and if *210 \"discrimination is sufficiently shown, the right to relief under the equal protection clause is not diminished by the fact that the discrimination relates to political rights.\" Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1, 11. To show why we reject the argument based on the Guaranty Clause, we must examine the authorities under it. But because there appears to be some uncertainty as to why those cases did present political questions, and specifically as to whether this apportionment case is like those cases, we deem it necessary first to consider the contours of the \"political question\" doctrine.\n\nOur discussion, even at the price of extending this opinion, requires review of a number of political question cases, in order to expose the attributes of the doctrine attributes which, in various settings, diverge, combine, appear, and disappear in seeming disorderliness. Since that review is undertaken solely to demonstrate that neither singly nor collectively do these cases support a conclusion that this apportionment case is nonjusticiable, we of course do not explore their implications in other contexts. That review reveals that in the Guaranty Clause cases and in the other \"political question\" cases, it is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the Federal Government, and not the federal judiciary's relationship to the States, which gives rise to the \"political question.\"\n\nWe have said that \"In determining whether a question falls within [the political question] category, the approriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination are dominant considerations.\" Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 454-455. The nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers. Much confusion results from the capacity of the \"political question\" label to obscure the need for *211 case-by-case inquiry. Deciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. To demonstrate this requires no less than to analyze representative cases and to infer from them the analytical threads that make up the political question doctrine. We shall then show that none of those threads catches this case.\n\nForeign relations: There are sweeping statements to the effect that all questions touching foreign relations are political questions.[31] Not only does resolution of such issues frequently turn on standards that defy judicial application, or involve the exercise of a discretion demonstrably committed to the executive or legislature;[32] but many such questions uniquely demand single-voiced statement of the Government's views.[33] Yet it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance. Our cases in this field seem invariably to show a discriminating analysis of the particular question posed, in terms of the history of its management by the political branches, of its susceptibility to judicial handling in the light of its nature and posture in the specific case, and of the possible consequences *212 of judicial action. For example, though a court will not ordinarily inquire whether a treaty has been terminated, since on that question \"governmental action . . . must be regarded as of controlling importance,\" if there has been no conclusive \"governmental action\" then a court can construe a treaty and may find it provides the answer. Compare Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 285, with Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts v. New Haven, 8 Wheat. 464, 492-495.[34] Though a court will not undertake to construe a treaty in a manner inconsistent with a subsequent federal statute, no similar hesitancy obtains if the asserted clash is with state law. Compare Whitney v. Robertson; 124 U. S. 190, with Kolovrat v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 187.\n\nWhile recognition of foreign governments so strongly defies judicial treatment that without executive recognition a foreign state has been called \"a republic of whose existence we know nothing,\"[35] and the judiciary ordinarily follows the executive as to which nation has sovereignty over disputed territory,[36] once sovereignty over an area is politically determined and declared, courts may examine the resulting status and decide independently whether a statute applies to that area.[37] Similarly, recognition of belligerency abroad is an executive responsibility, but if the executive proclamations fall short of an explicit answer, a court may construe them seeking, for example, to determine whether the situation is such that statutes designed to assure American neutrality have *213 become operative. The Three Friends, 166 U. S. 1, 63, 66. Still again, though it is the executive that determines a person's status as representative of a foreign government, Ex parte Hitz, 111 U. S. 766, the executive's statements will be construed where necessary to determine the court's jurisdiction, In re Baiz, 135 U. S. 403. Similar judicial action in the absence of a recognizedly authoritative executive declaration occurs in cases involving the immunity from seizure of vessels owned by friendly foreign governments. Compare Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578, with Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U. S. 30, 34-35.\n\nDates of duration of hostilities: Though it has been stated broadly that \"the power which declared the necessity is the power to declare its cessation, and what the cessation requires,\" Commercial Trust Co. v. Miller, 262 U. S. 51, 57, here too analysis reveals isolable reasons for the presence of political questions, underlying this Court's refusal to review the political departments' determination of when or whether a war has ended. Dominant is the need for finality in the political determination, for emergency's nature demands \"A prompt and unhesitating obedience,\" Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 30 (calling up of militia). Moreover, \"the cessation of hostilities does not necessarily end the war power. It was stated in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & W. Co., 251 U. S. 146, 161, that the war power includes the power `to remedy the evils which have arisen from its rise and progress' and continues during that emergency. Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 507.\" Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking Co., 331 U. S. 111, 116. But deference rests on reason, not habit.[38] The question in a particular case may not seriously implicate considerations of finalitye. g., a public program of importance *214 (rent control) yet not central to the emergency effort.[39] Further, clearly definable criteria for decision may be available. In such case the political question barrier falls away: \"[A] Court is not at liberty to shut its eyes to an obvious mistake, when the validity of the law depends upon the truth of what is declared. . . . [It can] inquire whether the exigency still existed upon which the continued operation of the law depended.\" Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U. S. 543, 547-548.[40] Compare Woods v. Miller Co., 333 U. S. 138. On the other hand, even in private litigation which directly implicates no feature of separation of powers, lack of judicially discoverable standards and the drive for even-handed application may impel reference to the political departments' determination of dates of hostilities' beginning and ending. The Protector, 12 Wall. 700.\n\nValidity of enactments: In Coleman v. Miller, supra, this Court held that the questions of how long a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution remained open to ratification, and what effect a prior rejection had on a subsequent ratification, were committed to congressional resolution and involved criteria of decision that necessarily escaped the judicial grasp.[41] Similar considerations apply to the enacting process: \"The respect due to coequal and independent departments,\" and the need for finality and certainty about the status of a statute contribute to judicial reluctance to inquire whether, as passed, it complied with all requisite formalities. Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 672, 676-677; see Leser v. Garnett, 258 U. S. 130, 137. But it is not true that courts will never delve *215 into a legislature's records upon such a quest: If the enrolled statute lacks an effective date, a court will not hesitate to seek it in the legislative journals in order to preserve the enactment. Gardner v. The Collector, 6 Wall. 499. The political question doctrine, a tool for maintenance of governmental order, will not be so applied as to promote only disorder.\n\nThe status of Indian tribes: This Court's deference to the political departments in determining whether Indians are recognized as a tribe, while it reflects familiar attributes of political questions,[42]United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 419, also has a unique element in that \"the relation of the Indians to the United States is marked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions which exist no where else. . . . [The Indians are] domestic dependent nations . . . in a state of pupilage. Their relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian.\" The Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 16, 17.[43] Yet, here too, there is no blanket rule. While *216 \" `It is for [Congress] . . . , and not for the courts, to determine when the true interests of the Indian require his release from [the] condition of tutelage' . . . , it is not meant by this that Congress may bring a community or body of people within the range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe . . . .\" United States v. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28, 46. Able to discern what is \"distinctly Indian,\" ibid., the courts will strike down *217 any heedless extension of that label. They will not stand impotent before an obvious instance of a manifestly unauthorized exercise of power.\nIt is apparent that several formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question, although each has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the separation of powers. Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\n\nUnless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for nonjusticiability on the ground of a political question's presence. The doctrine of which we treat is one of \"political questions,\" not one of \"political cases.\" The courts cannot reject as \"no law suit\" a bona fide controversy as to whether some action denominated \"political\" exceeds constitutional authority. The cases we have reviewed show the necessity for discriminating inquiry into the precise facts and posture of the particular case, and the impossibility of resolution by any semantic cataloguing.\n\nBut it is argued that this case shares the characteristics of decisions that constitute a category not yet considered, cases concerning the Constitution's guaranty, in Art. IV, *218  4, of a republican form of government. A conclusion as to whether the case at bar does present a political question cannot be confidently reached until we have considered those cases with special care. We shall discover that Guaranty Clause claims involve those elements which define a \"political question,\" and for that reason and no other, they are nonjusticiable. In particular, we shall discover that the nonjusticiability of such claims has nothing to do with their touching upon matters of state governmental organization.\n\nRepublican form of government: Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, though in form simply an action for damages for trespass was, as Daniel Webster said in opening the argument for the defense, \"an unusual case.\"[44] The defendants, admitting an otherwise tortious breaking and entering, sought to justify their action on the ground that they were agents of the established lawful government of Rhode Island, which State was then under martial law to defend itself from active insurrection; that the plaintiff was engaged in that insurrection; and that they entered under orders to arrest the plaintiff. The case arose \"out of the unfortunate political differences which agitated the people of Rhode Island in 1841 and 1842,\" 7 How., at 34, and which had resulted in a situation wherein two groups laid competing claims to recognition as the lawful government.[45] The plaintiff's right to *219 recover depended upon which of the two groups was entitled to such recognition; but the lower court's refusal to receive evidence or hear argument on that issue, its charge to the jury that the earlier established or \"charter\" government was lawful, and the verdict for the defendants, were affirmed upon appeal to this Court.\n\nChief Justice Taney's opinion for the Court reasoned as follows: (1) If a court were to hold the defendants' acts unjustified because the charter government had no legal existence during the period in question, it would follow that all of that government's actionslaws enacted, taxes collected, salaries paid, accounts settled, sentences passedwere of no effect; and that \"the officers who carried their decisions into operation [were] answerable as trespassers, if not in some cases as criminals.\"[46] There was, of course, no room for application of any doctrine of de facto status to uphold prior acts of an officer not authorized de jure, for such would have defeated the plaintiff's very action. A decision for the plaintiff would inevitably have produced some significant measure of chaos, a consequence to be avoided if it could be done without abnegation of the judicial duty to uphold the Constitution.\n\n(2) No state court had recognized as a judicial responsibility settlement of the issue of the locus of state governmental authority. Indeed, the courts of Rhode Island had in several cases held that \"it rested with the political power to decide whether the charter government had been displaced or not,\" and that that department had acknowledged no change.\n\n*220 (3) Since \"[t]he question relates, altogether, to the constitution and laws of [the] . . . State,\" the courts of the United States had to follow the state courts' decisions unless there was a federal constitutional ground for overturning them.[47]\n\n(4) No provision of the Constitution could be or had been invoked for this purpose except Art. IV,  4, the Guaranty Clause. Having already noted the absence of standards whereby the choice between governments could be made by a court acting independently, Chief Justice Taney now found further textual and practical reasons for concluding that, if any department of the United States was empowered by the Guaranty Clause to resolve the issue, it was not the judiciary:\"Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State. For as the United States guarantee to each State a republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the State before it can determine whether it is republican or not. And when the senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the councils of the Union, the authority of the government under which they are appointed, as well as its republican character, is recognized by the proper constitutional authority. And its decision is binding on every other department of the government, and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal. It is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue; and . . . Congress was not called upon to decide the controversy. Yet the right to decide is placed there, and not in the courts.*221 \"So, too, as relates to the clause in the above-mentioned article of the Constitution, providing for cases of domestic violence. It rested with Congress, too, to determine upon the means proper to be adopted to fulfill this guarantee. . . . [B]y the act of February 28, 1795, [Congress] provided, that, `in case of an insurrection in any State against the government thereof, it shall be lawful for the President of the United States, on application of the legislature of such State or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened), to call forth such number of the militia of any other State or States, as may be applied for, as he may judge sufficient to suppress such insurrection.'\"By this act, the power of deciding whether the exigency had arisen upon which the government of the United States is bound to interfere, is given to the President. . . .\"After the President has acted and called out the militia, is a Circuit Court of the United States authorized to inquire whether his decision was right? . . . If the judicial power extends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitution of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and not of order. . . .\"It is true that in this case the militia were not called out by the President. But upon the application of the governor under the charter government, the President recognized him as the executive power of the State, and took measures to call out the militia to support his authority if it should be found necessary for the general government to interfere . . . . [C]ertainly no court of the United States, with a knowledge of this decision, would have been justified in recognizing the opposing party as the lawful government *222. . . . In the case of foreign nations, the government acknowledged by the President is always recognized in the courts of justice. . . .\" 7 How., at 42-44.Clearly, several factors were thought by the Court in Luther to make the question there \"political\": the commitment to the other branches of the decision as to which is the lawful state government; the unambiguous action by the President, in recognizing the charter government as the lawful authority; the need for finality in the executive's decision; and the lack of criteria by which a court could determine which form of government was republican.[48]\n*223 But the only significance that Luther could have for our immediate purposes is in its holding that the Guaranty Clause is not a repository of judicially manageable standards which a court could utilize independently in order to identify a State's lawful government. The Court has since refused to resort to the Guaranty Clausewhich alone had been invoked for the purposeas the source of a constitutional standard for invalidating state action. See Taylor & Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U. S. 548 (claim that Kentucky's resolution of contested gubernatorial election deprived voters of republican government held nonjusticiable); Pacific States Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118 (claim that initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable); Kiernan v. Portland, 223 U. S. 151 (claim that municipal charter amendment per municipal initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable); *224 Marshall v. Dye, 231 U. S. 250 (claim that Indiana's constitutional amendment procedure negated republican government held nonjusticiable); O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U. S. 244 (claim that delegation to court of power to form drainage districts negated republican government held \"futile\"); Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565 (claim that invalidation of state reapportionment statute per referendum negates republican government held nonjusticiable);[49]Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S. 219 (claim that workmen's compensation violates republican government held nonjusticiable); Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, 281 U. S. 74 (claim that rule requiring invalidation of statute by all but one justice of state court negated republican government held nonjusticiable); Highland Farms Dairy v. Agnew, 300 U. S. 608 (claim that delegation to agency of power to control milk prices violated republican government, rejected).\n\nJust as the Court has consistently held that a challenge to state action based on the Guaranty Clause presents no justiciable question so has it held, and for the same reasons, that challenges to congressional action on the ground of inconsistency with that clause present no justiciable question. In Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, the State sought by an original bill to enjoin execution of the Reconstruction Acts, claiming that it already possessed \"A republican State, in every political, legal, constitutional, and juridical sense,\" and that enforcement of the new Acts \"Instead of keeping the guaranty against a forcible overthrow of its government by foreign invaders or domestic insurgents, . . . is destroying that very government by force.\"[50] Congress had clearly refused to *225 recognize the republican character of the government of the suing State.[51] It seemed to the Court that the only constitutional claim that could be presented was under the Guaranty Clause, and Congress having determined that the effects of the recent hostilities required extraordinary measures to restore governments of a republican form, this Court refused to interfere with Congress' action at the behest of a claimant relying on that very guaranty.[52]\n\nIn only a few other cases has the Court considered Art. IV,  4, in relation to congressional action. It has refused to pass on a claim relying on the Guaranty Clause to establish that Congress lacked power to allow the States to employ the referendum in passing on legislation redistricting for congressional seats. Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, supra. And it has pointed out that Congress is not required to establish republican government in the territories before they become States, and before they have attained a sufficient population to warrant a *226 popularly elected legislature. Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U. S. 244, 278-279 (dictum).[53]\n\nWe come, finally, to the ultimate inquiry whether our precedents as to what constitutes a nonjusticiable \"political question\" bring the case before us under the umbrella of that doctrine. A natural beginning is to note whether any of the common characteristics which we have been able to identify and label descriptively are present. We find none: The question here is the consistency of state action with the Federal Constitution. We have no question decided, or to be decided, by a political branch of government coequal with this Court. Nor do we risk embarrassment of our government abroad, or grave disturbance at home[54] if we take issue with Tennessee as to the constitutionality of her action here challenged. Nor need the appellants, in order to succeed in this action, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking. Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar, and it has been open to courts since the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to determine, if on the particular facts they must, that a discrimination reflects no policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.\n\nThis case does, in one sense, involve the allocation of political power within a State, and the appellants *227 might conceivably have added a claim under the Guaranty Clause. Of course, as we have seen, any reliance on that clause would be futile. But because any reliance on the Guaranty Clause could not have succeeded it does not follow that appellants may not be heard on the equal protection claim which in fact they tender. True, it must be clear that the Fourteenth Amendment claim is not so enmeshed with those political question elements which render Guaranty Clause claims nonjusticiable as actually to present a political question itself. But we have found that not to be the case here.\n\nIn this connection special attention is due Pacific States Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118. In that case a corporation tax statute enacted by the initiative was attacked ostensibly on three grounds: (1) due process; (2) equal protection; and (3) the Guaranty Clause. But it was clear that the first two grounds were invoked solely in aid of the contention that the tax was invalid by reason of its passage:\"The defendant company does not contend here that it could not have been required to pay a license tax. It does not assert that it was denied an opportunity to be heard as to the amount for which it was taxed, or that there was anything inhering in the tax or involved intrinsically in the law which violated any of its constitutional rights. If such questions had been raised they would have been justiciable, and therefore would have required the calling into operation of judicial power. Instead, however, of doing any of these things, the attack on the statute here made is of a wholly different character. Its essentially political nature is at once made manifest by understanding that the assault which the contention here advanced makes it [sic] not on the tax as a tax, but on the State as a State. It is addressed to the *228 framework and political character of the government by which the statute levying the tax was passed. It is the government, the political entity, which (reducing the case to its essence) is called to the bar of this court, not for the purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power assailed, on the ground that its exertion has injuriously affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy to some constitutional limitation, but to demand of the State that it establish its right to exist as a State, republican in form.\" 223 U. S., at 150-151.The due process and equal protection claims were held nonjusticiable in Pacific States not because they happened to be joined with a Guaranty Clause claim, or because they sought to place before the Court a subject matter which might conceivably have been dealt with through the Guaranty Clause, but because the Court believed that they were invoked merely in verbal aid of the resolution of issues which, in its view, entailed political questions. Pacific States may be compared with cases such as Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S. 219, wherein the Court refused to consider whether a workmen's compensation act violated the Guaranty Clause but considered at length, and rejected, due process and equal protection arguments advanced against it; and O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U. S. 244, wherein the Court refused to consider whether Nebraska's delegation of power to form drainage districts violated the Guaranty Clause, but went on to consider and reject the contention that the action against which an injunction was sought was not a taking for a public purpose.\n\nWe conclude then that the nonjusticiability of claims resting on the Guaranty Clause which arises from their embodiment of questions that were thought \"political,\" can have no bearing upon the justiciability of the equal protection claim presented in this case. Finally, we *229 emphasize that it is the involvement in Guaranty Clause claims of the elements thought to define \"political questions,\" and no other feature, which could render them nonjusticiable. Specifically, we have said that such claims are not held nonjusticiable because they touch matters of state governmental organization. Brief examination of a few cases demonstrates this.\n\nWhen challenges to state action respecting matters of \"the administration of the affairs of the State and the officers through whom they are conducted\"[55] have rested on claims of constitutional deprivation which are amenable to judicial correction, this Court has acted upon its view of the merits of the claim. For example, in Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U. S. 135, we reversed the Nebraska Supreme Court's decision that Nebraska's Governor was not a citizen of the United States or of the State and therefore could not continue in office. In Kennard v. Louisiana ex rel. Morgan, 92 U. S. 480, and Foster v. Kansas ex rel. Johnston, 112 U. S. 201, we considered whether persons had been removed from public office by procedures consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment's due process guaranty, and held on the merits that they had. And only last Term, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, we applied the Fifteenth Amendment to strike down a redrafting of municipal boundaries which effected a discriminatory impairment of voting rights, in the face of what a majority of the Court of Appeals thought to be a sweeping commitment to state legislatures of the power to draw and redraw such boundaries.[56]\nGomillion was brought by a Negro who had been a resident of the City of Tuskegee, Alabama, until the municipal boundaries were so recast by the State Legislature *230 as to exclude practically all Negroes. The plaintiff claimed deprivation of the right to vote in municipal elections. The District Court's dismissal for want of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. This Court unanimously reversed. This Court's answer to the argument that States enjoyed unrestricted control over municipal boundaries was:\"Legislative control of municipalities, no less than other state power, lies within the scope of relevant limitations imposed by the United States Constitution.. . . The opposite conclusion, urged upon us by respondents, would sanction the achievement by a State of any impairment of voting rights whatever so long as it was cloaked in the garb of the realignment of political subdivisions. `It is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus be manipulated out of existence.' \" 364 U. S., at 344-345.To a second argument, that Colegrove v. Green, supra, was a barrier to hearing the merits of the case, the Court responded that Gomillion was lifted \"out of the so-called `political' arena and into the conventional sphere of constitutional litigation\" because here was discriminatory treatment of a racial minority violating the Fifteenth Amendment.\"A statute which is alleged to have worked unconstitutional deprivations of petitioners' rights is not immune to attack simply because the mechanism employed by the legislature is a redefinition of municipal boundaries. . . . While in form this is merely an act redefining metes and bounds, if the allegations are established, the inescapable human effect of this essay in geometry and geography is to despoil colored citizens, and only colored citizens, of *231 their theretofore enjoyed voting rights. That was not Colegrove v. Green.\"When a State exercises power wholly within the domain of state interest, it is insulated from federal judicial review. But such insulation is not carried over when state power is used as an instrument for circumventing a federally protected right.\" 364 U. S., at 347.[57]We have not overlooked such cases as In re Sawyer, 124 U. S. 200, and Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U. S. 487, which held that federal equity power could not be exercised to enjoin a state proceeding to remove a public officer. But these decisions explicitly reflect only a traditional limit upon equity jurisdiction, and not upon federal courts' power to inquire into matters of state governmental organization. This is clear not only from the opinions in those cases, but also from White v. Berry, 171 U. S. 366, which, relying on Sawyer, withheld federal equity from staying removal of a federal officer. Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586, simply dismissed an appeal from an unsuccessful suit to upset a State's removal procedure, on the ground that the constitutional claim presentedthat a jury trial was necessary if the removal procedure was to comport with due process requirementswas frivolous. Finally, in Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U. S. 548, where losing candidates attacked the constitutionality of Kentucky's resolution of a contested gubernatorial election, the Court refused to consider the merits of a claim posited upon *232 the Guaranty Clause, holding it presented a political question, but also held on the merits that the ousted candidates had suffered no deprivation of property without due process of law.[58]\n\nSince, as has been established, the equal protection claim tendered in this case does not require decision of any political question, and since the presence of a matter affecting state government does not render the case nonjusticiable, it seems appropriate to examine again the reasoning by which the District Court reached its conclusion that the case was nonjusticiable.\n\nWe have already noted that the District Court's holding that the subject matter of this complaint was nonjusticiable relied upon Colegrove v. Green, supra, and later cases. Some of those concerned the choice of members of a state legislature, as in this case; others, like Colegrove itself and earlier precedents, Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U. S. 375, and Carroll v. Becker, 285 U. S. 380, concerned the choice of Representatives in the Federal Congress. Smiley, Koenig and Carroll settled the issue in favor of justiciability of questions of congressional redistricting. The Court followed these precedents in Colegrove although over the dissent of three of the seven Justices who participated in that decision. On the issue of justiciability, all four Justices comprising a majority relied upon Smiley v. Holm, but in two opinions, one for three Justices, 328 U. S., at 566, 568, and a separate one by Mr. Justice Rutledge, 328 U. S., at 564. The argument that congressional redistricting problems presented a \"political question\" the resolution of which was confided to Congress might have been rested upon Art. I,  4, Art. I,  5, Art. I,  2, and Amendment *233 XIV,  2. Mr. Justice Rutledge said: \"But for the ruling in Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, I should have supposed that the provisions of the Constitution, Art. I,  4, that \"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for . . . Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations . . .'; Art. I,  2 [but see Amendment XIV,  2], vesting in Congress the duty of apportionment of representatives among the several states `according to their respective Numbers'; and Art. I,  5, making each House the sole judge of the qualifications of its own members, would remove the issues in this case from justiciable cognizance. But, in my judgment, the Smiley case rules squarely to the contrary, save only in the matter of degree. . . . Assuming that that decision is to stand, I think . . . that its effect is to rule that this Court has power to afford relief in a case of this type as against the objection that the issues are not justiciable.\" 328 U. S., at 564-565. Accordingly, Mr. Justice Rutledge joined in the conclusion that the case was justiciable, although he held that the dismissal of the complaint should be affirmed. His view was that \"The shortness of the time remaining [before forthcoming elections] makes it doubtful whether action could, or would, be taken in time to secure for petitioners the effective relief they seek. . . . I think, therefore, the case is one in which the Court may properly, and should, decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed and I join in that disposition of the cause.\" 328 U. S., at 565-566.[59]\n*234 Article I,  2, 4, and 5, and Amendment XIV,  2, relate only to congressional elections and obviously do not govern apportionment of state legislatures. However, our decisions in favor of justiciability even in light of those provisions plainly afford no support for the District Court's conclusion that the subject matter of this controversy presents a political question. Indeed, the refusal to award relief in Colegrove resulted only from the controlling view of a want of equity. Nor is anything contrary to be found in those per curiams that came after Colegrove. This Court dismissed the appeals in Cook v. Fortson and Turman v. Duckworth, 329 U. S. 675, as moot. MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, held only that in that case equity would not act to void the State's requirement that there be at least a minimum of support for nominees *235 for state-wide office, over at least a minimal area of the State. Problems of timing were critical in Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916, dismissing for want of a substantial federal question a three-judge court's dismissal of the suit as prematurely brought, 102 F. Supp. 708; and in Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U. S. 916, denying mandamus sought to compel the convening of a three-judge court movants urged the Court to advance consideration of their case, \"Inasmuch as the mere lapse of time before this case can be reached in the normal course of . . . business may defeat the cause, and inasmuch as the time problem is due to the inherent nature of the case . . . .\" South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, like Colegrove appears to be a refusal to exercise equity's powers; see the statement of the holding, quoted, supra, p. 203. And Cox v. Peters, 342 U. S. 936, dismissed for want of a substantial federal question the appeal from the state court's holding that their primary elections implicated no \"state action.\" See 208 Ga. 498, 67 S. E. 2d 579. But compare Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461.\n\nTedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940, indicates solely that no substantial federal question was raised by a state court's refusal to upset the districting of city council seats, especially as it was urged that there was a rational justification for the challenged districting. See 43 So. 2d 514. Similarly, in Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912, it was certain only that the state court had refused to issue a discretionary writ, original mandamus in the Supreme Court. That had been denied without opinion, and of course it was urged here that an adequate state ground barred this Court's review. And in Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40, the Supreme Court of Tennessee held that it could not invalidate the very statute at issue in the case at bar, but its holding rested on its state law of remedies, i. e., the state view of *236 de facto officers,[60] and not on any view that the norm for legislative apportionment in Tennessee is not numbers of qualified voters resident in the several counties. Of course this Court was there precluded by the adequate state ground, and in dismissing the appeal, 352 U. S. 920, we cited Anderson, supra, as well as Colegrove. Nor does the Tennessee court's decision in that case bear upon this, for just as in Smith v. Holm, 220 Minn. 486, 19 N. W. 2d 914, and Magraw v. Donovan, 163 F. Supp. 184, 177 F. Supp. 803, a state court's inability to grant relief does not bar a federal court's assuming jurisdiction to inquire into alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights. Problems of relief also controlled in Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991, affirming the District Court's refusal to mandamus the Governor to call a session of the legislature, to mandamus the legislature then to apportion, and if they did not comply, to mandamus the State Supreme Court to do so. And Matthews v. Handley, 361 U. S. 127, affirmed a refusal to strike down the State's gross income tax statuteurged on the ground that the legislature was malapportionedthat had rested on the adequacy of available state legal remedies for suits involving that tax, including challenges to its constitutionality. Lastly, Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804, in which Mr. Justice Rutledge concurred in this Court's refusal to note the appeal from a dismissal for want of equity, is sufficiently explained by his statement in Cook v. Fortson, supra: \"The discretionary exercise or nonexercise of equitable or declaratory judgment jurisdiction. . . in one case is not precedent in another case *237 where the facts differ.\" 329 U. S., at 678, n. 8. (Citations omitted.)\n\nWe conclude that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection present a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which appellants are entitled to a trial and a decision. The right asserted is within the reach of judicial protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER did not participate in the decision of this case.MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.While I join the opinion of the Court and, like the Court, do not reach the merits, a word of explanation is necessary.[1] I put to one side the problems of \"political\" *242 questions involving the distribution of power between this Court, the Congress, and the Chief Executive. We have here a phase of the recurring problem of the relation of the federal courts to state agencies. More particularly, the question is the extent to which a State may weight one person's vote more heavily than it does another's.\n\nSo far as voting rights are concerned, there are large gaps in the Constitution. Yet the right to vote is inherent in the republican form of government envisaged by Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution. The House and now the Senateare chosen by the people. The time, manner, and place of elections of Senators and Representatives are left to the States (Article I, Section 4, Clause 1; Amendment XVII) subject to the regulatory power of Congress. A \"republican form\" of government is guaranteed each State by Article IV, Section 4, and each is likewise promised protection against invasion.[2]Ibid. *243 That the States may specify the qualifications for voters is implicit in Article I, Section 2, Clause 1, which provides that the House of Representatives shall be chosen by the *244 people and that \"the Electors (voters) in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors (voters) of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.\" The same provision, contained in the Seventeenth Amendment, governs the election of Senators. Within limits those qualifications may be fixed by state law. See Lassiter v. Northampton Election Board, 360 U. S. 45, 50-51. Yet, as stated in Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651, 663-664, those who vote for members of Congress do not \"owe their right to vote to the State law in any sense which makes the exercise of the right to depend exclusively on the law of the State.\" The power of Congress to prescribe the qualifications for voters and thus override state law is not in issue here. It is, however, clear that by reason of the commands of the Constitution there are several qualifications that a State may not require.\n\nRace, color, or previous condition of servitude is an impermissible standard by reason of the Fifteenth Amendment, and that alone is sufficient to explain Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339. See Taper, Gomillion versus Lightfoot (1962), pp. 12-17.\n\nSex is another impermissible standard by reason of the Nineteenth Amendment.\n\nThere is a third barrier to a State's freedom in prescribing qualifications of voters and that is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the provision invoked here. And so the question is, may a State weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another?\n\nThe traditional test under the Equal Protection Clause has been whether a State has made \"an invidious discrimination,\" as it does when it selects \"a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment.\" See Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535, 541. Universal equality is not *245 the test; there is room for weighting. As we stated in Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 489, \"The prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination.\"\n\nI agree with my Brother CLARK that if the allegations in the complaint can be sustained a case for relief is established. We are told that a single vote in Moore County, Tennessee, is worth 19 votes in Hamilton County, that one vote in Stewart or in Chester County is worth nearly eight times a single vote in Shelby or Knox County. The opportunity to prove that an \"invidious discrimination\" exists should therefore be given the appellants.\n\nIt is said that any decision in cases of this kind is beyond the competence of courts. Some make the same point as regards the problem of equal protection in cases involving racial segregation. Yet the legality of claims and conduct is a traditional subject for judicial determination. Adjudication is often perplexing and complicated. An example of the extreme complexity of the task can be seen in a decree apportioning water among the several States. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589, 665. The constitutional guide is often vague, as the decisions under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses show. The problem under the Equal Protection Clause is no more intricate. See Lewis, Legislative Apportionment and the Federal Courts, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 1057, 1083-1084.\n\nThere are, of course, some questions beyond judicial competence. Where the performance of a \"duty\" is left to the discretion and good judgment of an executive officer, the judiciary will not compel the exercise of his discretion one way or the other (Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 109), for to do so would be to take over the office. Cf. Federal Communications Comm'n v. Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134, 145.\n\n*246 Where the Constitution assigns a particular function wholly and indivisibly[3] to another department, the federal judiciary does not intervene. Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U. S. 297, 302. None of those cases is relevant here.\n\n*247 There is no doubt that the federal courts have jurisdiction of controversies concerning voting rights. The Civil Rights Act gives them authority to redress the deprivation \"under color of any State law\" of any \"right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens . . . .\" 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3). And 28 U. S. C.  1343 (4) gives the federal courts authority to award damages or issue an injunction to redress the violation of \"any Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights, including the right to vote.\" (Italics added.) The element of state action covers a wide range. For as stated in United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 326:\"Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law, is action taken `under color of' state law.\" And see Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167.The right to vote in both federal and state elections was protected by the judiciary long before that right received the explicit protection it is now accorded by  1343 (4). Discrimination against a voter on account of race has been penalized (Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651) or struck down. Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649; Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461. Fraudulent acts that dilute the votes of some *248 have long been held to be within judicial cognizance. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371. The \"right to have one's vote counted\" whatever his race or nationality or creed was held in United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383, 386, to be \"as open to protection by Congress as the right to put a ballot in a box.\" See also United States v. Classic, supra, 324-325; United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S. 385.\n\nChief Justice Holt stated in Ashby v. White, 2 Ld. Raym. 938, 956 (a suit in which damages were awarded against election officials for not accepting the plaintiff's vote, 3 Ld. Raym. 320) that:\"To allow this action will make publick officers more careful to observe the constitution of cities and boroughs, and not to be so partial as they commonly are in all elections, which is indeed a great and growing mischief, and tends to the prejudice of the peace of the nation.\"The same prophylactic effect will be produced here, as entrenched political regimes make other relief as illusory in this case as a petition to Parliament in Ashby v. White would have been.[4]\n*249 Intrusion of the Federal Government into the election machinery of the States has taken numerous formsinvestigations (Hannah v. Larche, 363 U. S. 420); criminal proceedings (Ex parte Siebold, supra; Ex parte Yarbrough, supra; United States v. Mosley, supra; United States v. Classic, supra); collection of penalties (Smith v. Allwright, supra); suits for declaratory relief and for an injunction (Terry v. Adams, supra); suits by the United States under the Civil Rights Act to enjoin discriminatory practices. United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17.\n\nAs stated by Judge McLaughlin in Dyer v. Kazuhisa Abe, 138 F. Supp. 220, 236 (an apportionment case in Hawaii which was reversed and dismissed as moot, 256 F. 2d 728):\"The whole thrust of today's legal climate is to end unconstitutional discrimination. It is ludicrous to preclude judicial relief when a mainspring of representative government is impaired. Legislators have no immunity from the Constitution. The legislatures of our land should be made as responsive to the Constitution of the United States as are the citizens who elect the legislators.\"With the exceptions of Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549; MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281; South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, and the decisions they spawned, the Court has never thought that protection of voting rights *250 was beyond judicial cognizance. Today's treatment of those cases removes the only impediment to judicial cognizance of the claims stated in the present complaint.\n\nThe justiciability of the present claims being established, any relief accorded can be fashioned in the light of well-known principles of equity.[5]\n*251MR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring.One emerging from the rash of opinions with their accompanying clashing of views may well find himself suffering a mental blindness. The Court holds that the appellants have alleged a cause of action. However, it refuses to award relief herealthough the facts are undisputed and fails to give the District Court any guidance whatever. One dissenting opinion, bursting with words that go through so much and conclude with so little, contemns the majority action as \"a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past.\" Another describes the complaint as merely asserting conclusory allegations that Tennessee's apportionment is \"incorrect,\" \"arbitrary,\" \"obsolete,\" and \"unconstitutional.\" I believe it can be shown that this case is distinguishable from earlier cases dealing with the distribution of political power by a State, that a patent violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution has been shown, and that an appropriate remedy may be formulated.I.I take the law of the case from MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281 (1948), which involved an attack under the Equal Protection Clause upon an Illinois election statute. The Court decided that case on its merits without hindrance from the \"political question\" doctrine. Although the statute under attack was upheld, it is clear *252 that the Court based its decision upon the determination that the statute represented a rational state policy. It stated:\"It would be strange indeed, and doctrinaire, for this Court, applying such broad constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection of the laws, to deny a State the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses, in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls not available to the former.\" Id., at 284. (Emphasis supplied.)The other cases upon which my Brethren dwell are all distinguishable or inapposite. The widely heralded case of Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549 (1946), was one not only in which the Court was bobtailed but in which there was no majority opinion. Indeed, even the \"political question\" point in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion was no more than an alternative ground.[1] Moreover, the appellants did not present an equal protection argument.[2] While it has served as a Mother Hubbard to most of the subsequent cases, I feel it was in that respect illcast and for all of these reasons put it to one side.[3] Likewise, *253 I do not consider the Guaranty Clause cases based on Art. I,  4, of the Constitution, because it is not invoked here and it involves different criteria, as the Court's opinion indicates. Cases resting on various other considerations not present here, such as Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991 (1957) (lack of equity); Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920 (1956) (adequate state grounds supporting the state judgment); Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912 (1952) (adequate state grounds); Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916 (1952) (failure to exhaust state procedures), are of course not controlling. Finally, the Georgia county-unit-system cases, such as South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276 (1950), reflect the viewpoint of MacDougall, i. e., to refrain from intervening where there is some rational policy behind the State's system.[4]II.The controlling facts cannot be disputed. It appears from the record that 37% of the voters of Tennessee elect 20 of the 33 Senators while 40% of the voters elect 63 of the 99 members of the House. But this might not on its face be an \"invidious discrimination,\" Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, 348 U. S. 483, 489 (1955), for a \"statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\" McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 426 (1961).\n\nIt is true that the apportionment policy incorporated in Tennessee's Constitution, i. e., state-wide numerical equality of representation with certain minor qualifications,[5] is a rational one. On a county-by-county comparison *254 a districting plan based thereon naturally will have disparities in representation due to the qualifications. But this to my mind does not raise constitutional problems, for the overall policy is reasonable. However, the root of the trouble is not in Tennessee's Constitution, for admittedly its policy has not been followed. The discrimination lies in the action of Tennessee's Assembly in allocating legislative seats to counties or districts created by it. Try as one may, Tennessee's apportionment just cannot be made to fit the pattern cut by its Constitution. This was the finding of the District Court. The policy of the Constitution referred to by the dissenters, therefore, is of no relevance here. We must examine what the Assembly has done.[6] The frequency and magnitude of the inequalities in the present districting admit of no policy whatever. An examination of Table I accompanying this opinion, post, p. 262, conclusively reveals that the apportionment picture in Tennessee is a topsy-turvical of gigantic proportions. This is not to say that some of the disparity cannot be explained, but when the entire table is examinedcomparing the voting strength of counties of like population as well as contrasting that of the smaller with the larger countiesit leaves but one conclusion, namely that Tennessee's apportionment is a crazy quilt without rational basis. At the risk of being accused of picking out a few of the horribles I shall allude to a series of examples that are taken from Table I.\n\nAs is admitted, there is a wide disparity of voting strength between the large and small counties. Some *255 samples are: Moore County has a total representation of two[7] with a population (2,340) of only one-eleventh of Rutherford County (25,316) with the same representation; Decatur County (5,563) has the same representation as Carter (23,303) though the latter has four times the population; likewise, Loudon County (13,264), Houston (3,084), and Anderson County (33,990) have the same representation, i. e., 1.25 each. But it is said that in this illustration all of the under-represented counties contain municipalities of over 10,000 population and they therefore should be included under the \"urban\" classification, rationalizing this disparity as an attempt to effect a rural-urban political balance. But in so doing one is caught up in the backlash of his own bull whip, for many counties have municipalities with a population exceeding 10,000, yet the same invidious discrimination is present.

Since discrimination is present among counties of like population, the plan is neither consistent nor rational. It discriminates horizontally creating gross disparities between rural areas themselves as well as between urban areas themselves,[8] still maintaining the wide vertical disparity already pointed out between rural and urban.\n\nIt is also insisted that the representation formula used above (see n. 7) is \"patently deficient\" because \"it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district.\" This is a strange claim coming from those who rely on the proposition that \"the voice of every voter\" need not have \"approximate equality.\" Indeed, representative government, as they say, is not necessarily one of \"bare numbers.\" The use of floterial districts in our political system is not ordinarily based on the theory that the floterial representative is splintered among the counties of his district per relative population. His function is to represent the whole district. However, I shall meet the charge on its own ground and by use of its \"adjusted *257 `total representation' \" formula show that the present apportionment is loco. For example, compare some \"urban\" areas of like population, using the HARLAN formula:CountyPopulationRepresentationWashington36,9672.65Madison37,2454.87Carter23,3031.48Greene23,6492.05Maury24,5563.81Coffee13,4062.32Hamblen14,0901.07And now, using the same formula, compare some so-called \"rural\" areas of like population:CountyPopulationRepresentation>Moore2,3401.23Pickett2,5650.22Stewart5,2381.60Cheatham5,2630.74Chester6,3911.36Grundy6,5400.69Smith8,7312.04Unicoi8,7870.40And for counties with similar representation but with gross differences in population, take:CountyPopulationRepresentationSullivan55,7124.07Maury24,5563.81Blount30,3532.12Coffee13,4062.32These cannot be \"distorted effects,\" for here the same formula proposed by the dissenters is used and the result is even \"a crazier\" quilt.\n\n*258 The truth is thatalthough this case has been here for two years and has had over six hours' argument (three times the ordinary case) and has been most carefully considered over and over again by us in Conference and individuallyno one, not even the State nor the dissenters, has come up with any rational basis for Tennessee's apportionment statute.\n\nNo oneexcept the dissenters advocating the HARLAN \"adjusted `total representation' \" formulacontends that mathematical equality among voters is required by the Equal Protection Clause. But certainly there must be some rational design to a State's districting. The discrimination here does not fit any patternas I have said, it is but a crazy quilt. My Brother HARLAN contends that other proposed apportionment plans contain disparities. Instead of chasing those rabbits he should first pause long enough to meet appellants' proof of discrimination by showing that in fact the present plan follows a rational policy. Not being able to do this, he merely counters with such generalities as \"classic legislative judgment,\" no \"significant discrepancy,\" and \"de minimis departures.\" I submit that even a casual glance at the present apportionment picture shows these conclusions to be entirely fanciful. If present representation has a policy at all, it is to maintain the status quo of invidious discrimination at any cost. Like the District Court, I conclude that appellants have met the burden of showing \"Tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state constitution and of the [federal] rights of the plaintiffs. . . .\"III.Although I find the Tennessee apportionment statute offends the Equal Protection Clause, I would not consider intervention by this Court into so delicate a field if there were any other relief available to the people of Tennessee. But the majority of the people of Tennessee have no *259 \"practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls\" to correct the existing \"invidious discrimination.\" Tennessee has no initiative and referendum. I have searched diligently for other \"practical opportunities\" present under the law. I find none other than through the federal courts. The majority of the voters have been caught up in a legislative strait jacket. Tennessee has an \"informed, civically militant electorate\" and \"an aroused popular conscience,\" but it does not sear \"the conscience of the people's representatives.\" This is because the legislative policy has riveted the present seats in the Assembly to their respective constituencies, and by the votes of their incumbents a reapportionment of any kind is prevented. The people have been rebuffed at the hands of the Assembly; they have tried the constitutional convention route, but since the call must originate in the Assembly it, too, has been fruitless. They have tried Tennessee courts with the same result,[9] and Governors have fought the tide only to flounder. It is said that there is recourse in Congress and perhaps that may be, but from a practical standpoint this is without substance. To date Congress has never undertaken such a task in any State. We therefore must conclude that the people of Tennessee are stymied and without judicial intervention will be saddled with the present discrimination in the affairs of their state government.IV.Finally, we must consider if there are any appropriate modes of effective judicial relief. The federal courts are of course not forums for political debate, nor should they *260 resolve themselves into state constitutional convention or legislative assemblies. Nor should their jurisdiction be exercised in the hope that such a declaration as is made today may have the direct effect of bringing on legislative action and relieving the courts of the problem of fashioning relief. To my mind this would be nothing less than blackjacking the Assembly into reapportioning the State. If judicial competence were lacking to fashion an effective decree, I would dismiss this appeal. However, like the Solicitor General of the United States, I see no such difficulty in the position of this case. One plan might be to start with the existing assembly districts, consolidate some of them, and award the seats thus released to those counties suffering the most egregious discrimination. Other possibilities are present and might be more effective. But the plan here suggested would at least release the strangle hold now on the Assembly and permit it to redistrict itself.\n\nIn this regard the appellants have proposed a plan based on the rationale of state-wide equal representation. Not believing that numerical equality of representation throughout a State is constitutionally required, I would not apply such a standard albeit a permissive one. Nevertheless, the dissenters attack it by the application of the HARLAN \"adjusted `total representation' \" formula. The result is that some isolated inequalities are shown, but this in itself does not make the proposed plan irrational or place it in the \"crazy quilt\" category. Such inequalities, as the dissenters point out in attempting to support the present apportionment as rational, are explainable. Moreover, there is no requirement that any plan have mathematical exactness in its application. Only where, as here, the total picture reveals incommensurables of both magnitude and frequency can it be said that there is present an invidious discrimination.\n\n*261 In view of the detailed study that the Court has given this problem, it is unfortunate that a decision is not reached on the merits. The majority appears to hold, at least sub silentio, that an invidious discrimination is present, but it remands to the three-judge court for it to make what is certain to be that formal determination. It is true that Tennessee has not filed a formal answer. However, it has filed voluminous papers and made extended arguments supporting its position. At no time has it been able to contradict the appellants' factual claims; it has offered no rational explanation for the present apportionment; indeed, it has indicated that there are none known to it. As I have emphasized, the case proceeded to the point before the three-judge court that it was able to find an invidious discrimination factually present, and the State has not contested that holding here. In view of all this background I doubt if anything more can be offered or will be gained by the State on remand, other than time. Nevertheless, not being able to muster a court to dispose of the case on the merits, I concur in the opinion of the majority and acquiesce in the decision to remand. However, in fairness I do think that Tennessee is entitled to have my idea of what it faces on the record before us and the trial court some light as to how it might proceed.\n\nAs John Rutledge (later Chief Justice) said 175 years ago in the course of the Constitutional Convention, a chief function of the Court is to secure the national rights.[10] Its decision today supports the proposition for which our forebears fought and many died, namely, that to be fully conformable to the principle of right, the form of government must be representative.[11] That is the keystone upon which our government was founded *262 and lacking which no republic can survive. It is well for this Court to practice self-restraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication, but never in its history have those principles received sanction where the national rights of so many have been so clearly infringed for so long a time. National respect for the courts is more enhanced through the forthright enforcement of those rights rather than by rendering them nugatory through the interposition of subterfuges. In my view the ultimate decision today is in the greatest tradition of this Court.\n\nTABLE 1County>1950 Voting PopulationPresent total representation using J.

JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.The separate writings of my dissenting and concurring Brothers stray so far from the subject of today's decision as to convey, I think, a distressingly inaccurate impression of what the Court decides. For that reason, I think it appropriate, in joining the opinion of the Court, to emphasize in a few words what the opinion does and does not say.\n\nThe Court today decides three things and no more: \"(a) that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (b) that a justiciable cause of action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief; and (c) . . . that the appellants have standing to challenge the Tennessee apportionment statutes.\" Ante, pp. 197-198.\n\nThe complaint in this case asserts that Tennessee's system of apportionment is utterly arbitrarywithout any possible justification in rationality. The District Court did not reach the merits of that claim, and this Court quite properly expresses no view on the subject. Contrary to the suggestion of my Brother HARLAN, the Court does not say or imply that \"state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter.\" Post, p. 332. The Court does not say or imply that there is anything in the Federal Constitution \"to prevent a State, acting not irrationally, from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests, temper, and customs of its people.\" Post, p. 334. And contrary to the suggestion of my Brother DOUGLAS, the Court most assuredly does not decide the question, \"may a State weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another?\" Ante, p. 244.\n\nIn MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause does not \"deny a State the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative *266 as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses, in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls not available to the former.\" 335 U. S., at 284. In case after case arising under the Equal Protection Clause the Court has said what it said again only last Termthat \"the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others.\" McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425. In case after case arising under that Clause we have also said that \"the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it.\" Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U. S. 580, 584.\n\nToday's decision does not turn its back on these settled precedents. I repeat, the Court today decides only: (1) that the District Court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (2) that the complaint presents a justiciable controversy; (3) that the appellants have standing. My Brother CLARK has made a convincing prima facie showing that Tennessee's system of apportionment is in fact utterly arbitrarywithout any possible justification in rationality. My Brother HARLAN has, with imagination and ingenuity, hypothesized possibly rational bases for Tennessee's system. But the merits of this case are not before us now. The defendants have not yet had an opportunity to be heard in defense of the State's system of apportionment; indeed, they have not yet even filed an answer to the complaint. As in other cases, the proper place for the trial is in the trial court, not here.MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.The Court today reverses a uniform course of decision established by a dozen cases, including one by which the very claim now sustained was unanimously rejected *267 only five years ago. The impressive body of rulings thus cast aside reflected the equally uniform course of our political history regarding the relationship between population and legislative representationa wholly different matter from denial of the franchise to individuals because of race, color, religion or sex. Such a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past in asserting destructively novel judicial power demands a detailed analysis of the role of this Court in our constitutional scheme. Disregard of inherent limits in the effective exercise of the Court's \"judicial Power\" not only presages the futility of judicial intervention in the essentially political conflict of forces by which the relation between population and representation has time out of mind been and now is determined. It may well impair the Court's position as the ultimate organ of \"the supreme Law of the Land\" in that vast range of legal problems, often strongly entangled in popular feeling, on which this Court must pronounce. The Court's authoritypossessed of neither the purse nor the swordultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction. Such feeling must be nourished by the Court's complete detachment, in fact and in appearance, from political entanglements and by abstention from injecting itself into the clash of political forces in political settlements.\n\nA hypothetical claim resting on abstract assumptions is now for the first time made the basis for affording illusory relief for a particular evil even though it foreshadows deeper and more pervasive difficulties in consequence. The claim is hypothetical and the assumptions are abstract because the Court does not vouchsafe the lower courtsstate and federalguidelines for formulating specific, definite, wholly unprecedented remedies for the inevitable litigations that today's umbrageous disposition is bound to stimulate in connection with politically motivated reapportionments in so many States. In *268 such a setting, to promulgate jurisdiction in the abstract is meaningless. It is as devoid of reality as \"a brooding omnipresence in the sky,\" for it conveys no intimation what relief, if any, a District Court is capable of affording that would not invite legislatures to play ducks and drakes with the judiciary. For this Court to direct the District Court to enforce a claim to which the Court has over the years consistently found itself required to deny legal enforcement and at the same time to find it necessary to withhold any guidance to the lower court how to enforce this turnabout, new legal claim, manifests an odd indeed an esotericconception of judicial propriety. One of the Court's supporting opinions, as elucidated by commentary, unwittingly affords a disheartening preview of the mathematical quagmire (apart from divers judicially inappropriate and elusive determinants) into which this Court today catapults the lower courts of the country without so much as adumbrating the basis for a legal calculus as a means of extrication. Even assuming the indispensable intellectual disinterestedness on the part of judges in such matters, they do not have accepted legal standards or criteria or even reliable analogies to draw upon for making judicial judgments. To charge courts with the task of accommodating the incommensurable factors of policy that underlie these mathematical puzzles is to attribute, however flatteringly, omnicompetence to judges. The Framers of the Constitution persistently rejected a proposal that embodied this assumption and Thomas Jefferson never entertained it.\n\nRecent legislation, creating a district appropriately described as \"an atrocity of ingenuity,\" is not unique. Considering the gross inequality among legislative electoral units within almost every State, the Court naturally shrinks from asserting that in districting at least substantial equality is a constitutional requirement enforceable *269 by courts.[*] Room continues to be allowed for weighting. This of course implies that geography, economics, urban-rural conflict, and all the other non-legal factors which have throughout our history entered into political districting are to some extent not to be ruled out in the undefined vista now opened up by review in the federal courts of state reapportionments. To some extentaye, there's the rub. In effect, today's decision empowers the courts of the country to devise what should constitute the proper composition of the legislatures of the fifty States. If state courts should for one reason or another find themselves unable to discharge this task, the duty of doing so is put on the federal courts or on this Court, if State views do not satisfy this Court's notion of what is proper districting.\n\nWe were soothingly told at the bar of this Court that we need not worry about the kind of remedy a court could effectively fashion once the abstract constitutional right to have courts pass on a state-wide system of electoral districting is recognized as a matter of judicial rhetoric, because legislatures would heed the Court's admonition. This is not only a euphoric hope. It implies a sorry *270 confession of judicial impotence in place of a frank acknowledgement that there is not under our Constitution a judicial remedy for every political mischief, for every undesirable exercise of legislative power. The Framers carefully and with deliberate forethought refused so to enthrone the judiciary. In this situation, as in others of like nature, appeal for relief does not belong here. Appeal must be to an informed, civically militant electorate. In a democratic society like ours, relief must come through an aroused popular conscience that sears the conscience of the people's representatives. In any event there is nothing judicially more unseemly nor more self-defeating than for this Court to make in terrorem pronouncements, to indulge in merely empty rhetoric, sounding a word of promise to the ear, sure to be disappointing to the hope.\n\nThis is the latest in the series of cases in which the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment have been invoked in federal courts as restrictions upon the power of the States to allocate electoral weight among the voting populations of their various geographical subdivisions.[1] The present action, which *271 comes here on appeal from an order of a statutory three-judge District Court dismissing amended complaints seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, challenges the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann., 1955  3-101 to 3-109, which apportion state representative and senatorial seats among Tennessee's ninety-five counties.\n\nThe original plaintiffs, citizens and qualified voters entitled to vote for members of the Tennessee Legislature in the several counties in which they respectively reside, bring this action in their own behalf and \"on behalf of all other voters in the State of Tennessee,\" or, as they alternatively assert, \"on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties, and further, on behalf of all voters of the State of Tennessee who are similarly situated.\" The cities of Knoxville and Chattanooga, and the Mayor of Nashvilleon his own behalf as a qualified voter and, pursuant to an authorizing resolution by the Nashville City Council, as a representative of all the city's residentswere permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff.[2] The defendants are executive officials charged with statutory duties in connection with state elections.[3]\n*272 The original plaintiffs' amended complaint avers, in substance, the following.[4] The Constitution of the State of Tennessee declares that \"elections shall be free and equal,\" provides that no qualifications other than age, citizenship and specified residence requirements shall be attached to the right of suffrage, and prohibits denying to any person the suffrage to which he is entitled except upon conviction of an infamous crime. Art. I,  5; Art. IV,  1. It requires an enumeration of qualified voters within every term of ten years after 1871 and an apportionment of representatives and senators among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified voters in each[5] at the time of each decennial *273 enumeration. Art. II,  4, 5, 6. Notwithstanding these provisions, the State Legislature has not reapportioned itself since 1901. The Reapportionment Act of that year, Tenn. Acts 1901, c. 122, now Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  3-101 to 3-109,[6] was unconstitutional when enacted, because not preceded by the required enumeration of qualified voters and because it allocated legislative seats arbitrarily, unequally and discriminatorily, as measured by the 1900 federal census. Moreover, irrespective of the question of its validity in 1901, it is asserted that the Act became \"unconstitutional and obsolete\" in 1911 by virtue of the decennial reapportionment requirement of the Tennessee Constitution. Continuing a \"purposeful and systematic plan to discriminate against a geographical class of persons,\" recent Tennessee Legislatures have failed, as did their predecessors, to enact reapportionment legislation, although a number of bills providing for reapportionment have been introduced. Because of population shifts since 1901, the apportionment fixed by the Act of that year and still in effect is not proportionate to population, denies to the counties in which the plaintiffs *274 live an additional number of representatives to which they are entitled, and renders plaintiffs' votes \"not as effective as the votes of the voters residing in other senatorial and representative districts . . . .\" Plaintiffs \"suffer a debasement of their votes by virtue of the incorrect, arbitrary, obsolete and unconstitutional apportionment of the General Assembly . . . ,\" and the totality of the malapportionment's effectwhich permits a minority of about thirty-seven percent of the voting population of the State to control twenty of the thirty-three members of Tennessee's Senate, and a minority of forty percent of the voting population to control sixty-three of the ninety-nine members of the Houseresults in \"a distortion of the constitutional system\" established by the Federal and State Constitutions, prevents the General Assembly \"from being a body representative of the people of the State of Tennessee, . . .\" and is \"contrary to the basic principle of representative government . . . ,\" and \"contrary to the philosophy of government in the United States and all Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence . . . .\"\n\nExhibits appended to the complaint purport to demonstrate the extent of the inequalities of which plaintiffs complain. Based upon \"approximate voting population,\"[7] these set forth figures showing that the State *275 Senator from Tennessee's most populous senatorial district represents five and two-tenths times the number of voters represented by the Senator from the least populous district, while the corresponding ratio for most and least populous House districts is more than eighteen to one. The General Assembly thus apportioned has discriminated against the underrepresented counties and in favor of the overrepresented counties in the collection and distribution of various taxes and tax revenues, notably in the distribution of school and highway-improvement funds,[8] this discrimination being \"made possible and effective\" by the Legislature's failure to reapportion itself. Plaintiffs conclude that election of the State Legislature pursuant to the apportionment fixed by the 1901 Act violates the Tennessee Constitution and deprives them of due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Their prayer below was for a declaratory judgment striking down the Act, an injunction restraining defendants from any acts necessary to the holding of elections in the districts prescribed by Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  3-101 to 3-109, until such time as the legislature is reapportioned \"according to the *276 Constitution of the State of Tennessee,\" and an order directing defendants to declare the next primary and general elections for members of the Tennessee Legislature on an at-large basisthe thirty-three senatorial candidates and the ninety-nine representative candidates receiving the highest number of votes to be declared elected.[9]\n\nMotions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter and for failure to state a claim were made and granted, 179 F. Supp. 824, the District Court relying upon this Court's series of decisions beginning with Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, rehearing denied, 329 U. S. 825, motion for reargument before the full bench denied, 329 U. S. 828. The original and intervening plaintiffs bring the case here on appeal. 364 U. S. 898. In this Court they have altered their request for relief, suggesting a \"step-by-step approach.\" The first step is a remand to the District Court with directions to vacate the order dismissing the complaint and to enter an order retaining jurisdiction, providing \"the necessary spur to legislative action . . . .\" If this proves insufficient, appellants will ask the \"additional spur\" of an injunction prohibiting elections under the 1901 Act, or a declaration of the Act's unconstitutionality, or both. Finally, all other means failing, the District Court is invited by the plaintiffs, greatly daring, to order an election at large or redistrict the State itself or through a master. The Solicitor General of the United States, who has filed a brief amicus and argued in favor of reversal, asks the Court on this appeal to hold only that the District Court has \"jurisdiction\" and may properly exercise it to entertain the plaintiffs' claims on the merits. This would leave to that court after remand the questions of the challenged statute's *277 constitutionality and of some undefined, unadumbrated relief in the event a constitutional violation is found. After an argument at the last Term, the case was set down for reargument, 366 U. S. 907, and heard this Term.I.In sustaining appellants' claim, based on the Fourteenth Amendment, that the District Court may entertain this suit, this Court's uniform course of decision over the years is overruled or disregarded. Explicitly it begins with Colegrove v. Green, supra, decided in 1946, but its roots run deep in the Court's historic adjudicatory process.\n\nColegrove held that a federal court should not entertain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief to adjudicate the constitutionality, under the Equal Protection Clause and other federal constitutional and statutory provisions, of a state statute establishing the respective districts for the State's election of Representatives to the Congress. Two opinions were written by the four Justices who composed the majority of the seven sitting members of the Court. Both opinions joining in the result in Colegrove v. Green agreed that considerations were controlling which dictated denial of jurisdiction though not in the strict sense of want of power. While the two opinions show a divergence of view regarding some of these considerations, there are important points of concurrence. Both opinions demonstrate a predominant concern, first, with avoiding federal judicial involvement in matters traditionally left to legislative policy making; second, with respect to the difficultyin view of the nature of the problems of apportionment and its history in this countryof drawing on or devising judicial standards for judgment, as opposed to legislative determinations, of the part which mere numerical equality among voters should play as a criterion for the allocation of *278 political power; and, third, with problems of finding appropriate modes of reliefparticularly, the problem of resolving the essentially political issue of the relative merits of at-large elections and elections held in districts of unequal population.\n\nThe broad applicability of these considerationssummarized in the loose shorthand phrase, \"political question\" in cases involving a State's apportionment of voting power among its numerous localities has led the Court, since 1946, to recognize their controlling effect in a variety of situations. (In all these cases decision was by a full Court.) The \"political question\" principle as applied in Colegrove has found wide application commensurate with its function as \"one of the rules basic to the federal system and this Court's appropriate place within that structure.\" Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U. S. 549, 570. In Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804, litigants brought suit in a Federal District Court challenging as offensive to the Equal Protection Clause Illinois' state legislative-apportionment laws. They pointed to state constitutional provisions requiring decennial reapportionment and allocation of seats in proportion to population, alleged a failure to reapportion for more than forty-five yearsduring which time extensive population shifts had rendered the legislative districts grossly unequaland sought declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to all elections to be held thereafter. After the complaint was dismissed by the District Court, this Court dismissed an appeal for want of a substantial federal question. A similar District Court decision was affirmed here in Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991. And cf. Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916. In Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940, the Court declined to hear, for want of a substantial federal question, the claim that the division of a municipality into voting districts of unequal population for the selection for councilmen fell *279 afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment, and in Cox v. Peters, 342 U. S. 936, rehearing denied, 343 U. S. 921, it found no substantial federal question raised by a state court's dismissal of a claim for damages for \"devaluation\" of plaintiff's vote by application of Georgia's county-unit system in a primary election for the Democratic gubernatorial candidate. The same Georgia system was subsequently attacked in a complaint for declaratory judgment and an injunction; the federal district judge declined to take the requisite steps for the convening of a statutory three-judge court; and this Court, in Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U. S. 916, denied a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the district judge to act. In MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, 283, the Court noted that \"To assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government,\" and, citing the Colegrove cases, declined to find in \"such broad constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection of the laws,\" id., at 284, a warrant for federal judicial invalidation of an Illinois statute requiring as a condition for the formation of a new political party the securing of at least two hundred signatures from each of fifty counties. And in South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, another suit attacking Georgia's county-unit law, it affirmed a District Court dismissal, saying\"Federal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity powers in cases posing political issues arising from a state's geographical distribution of electoral strength among its political subdivisions.\" Id., at 277.Of course it is important to recognize particular, relevant diversities among comprehensively similar situations. Appellants seek to distinguish several of this Court's prior decisions on one or another groundColegrove v. *280 Green on the ground that federal, not state, legislative apportionment was involved; Remmey v. Smith on the ground that state judicial remedies had not been tried; Radford v. Gary on the ground that Oklahoma has the initiative, whereas Tennessee does not. It would only darken counsel to discuss the relevance and significance of each of these assertedly distinguishing factors here and in the context of this entire line of cases. Suffice it that they do not serve to distinguish Colegrove v. Barrett, supra, which is on all fours with the present case, or to distinguish Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920, in which the full Court without dissent, only five years ago, dismissed on authority of Colegrove v. Green and Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912, an appeal from the Supreme Court of Tennessee in which a precisely similar attack was made upon the very statute now challenged. If the weight and momentum of an unvarying course of carefully considered decisions are to be respected, appellants' claims are foreclosed not only by precedents governing the exact facts of the present case but are themselves supported by authority the more persuasive in that it gives effect to the Colegrove principle in distinctly varying circumstances in which state arrangements allocating relative degrees of political influence among geographic groups of voters were challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment.II.The Colegrove doctrine, in the form in which repeated decisions have settled it, was not an innovation. It represents long judicial thought and experience. From its earliest opinions this Court has consistently recognized a class of controversies which do not lend themselves to judicial standards and judicial remedies. To classify the various instances as \"political questions\" is rather a form *281 of stating this conclusion than revealing of analysis.[10] Some of the cases so labelled have no relevance here. But from others emerge unifying considerations that are compelling.\n\n1. The cases concerning war or foreign affairs, for example, are usually explained by the necessity of the country's speaking with one voice in such matters. While this concern alone undoubtedly accounts for many of the decisions,[11] others do not fit the pattern. It would hardly embarrass the conduct of war were this Court to determine, in connection with private transactions between litigants, the date upon which war is to be deemed terminated. But the Court has refused to do so. See, e. g., The Protector, 12 Wall. 700; Brown v. Hiatts, 15 wall. 177; Adger v. Alston, 15 Wall. 555; Williams v. Bruffy, 96 U. S. 176, 192-193. It does not suffice to explain such cases as Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U. S. 160deferring to political determination the question of the duration of war for purposes of the Presidential power to deport alien enemiesthat judicial intrusion would seriously *282 impede the President's power effectively to protect the country's interests in time of war. Of course, this is true; but the precise issue presented is the duration of the time of war which demands the power. Cf. Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19; Lamar v. Browne, 92 U. S. 187, 193; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., 251 U. S. 146; Kahn v. Anderson, 255 U. S. 1. And even for the purpose of determining the extent of congressional regulatory power over the tribes and dependent communities of Indians, it is ordinarily for Congress, not the Court, to determine whether or not a particular Indian group retains the characteristics constitutionally requisite to confer the power.[12]E. g., United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407; Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286; United States v. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28. A controlling factor in such cases is that, decision respecting these kinds of complex matters of policy being traditionally committed not to courts but to the political agencies of government for determination by criteria of political expediency, there exists no standard ascertainable by settled judicial experience or process by reference to which a political decision affecting the question at issue between the parties can be judged. Where the question arises in the course of a litigation involving primarily the adjudication of other issues between the litigants, the Court accepts as a basis for adjudication the political departments' decision of it. But where its determination is the sole function to be served by the exercise of the judicial power, the Court will not entertain the action. See Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc., v. Waterman S. S. Corp., *283 333 U. S. 103. The dominant consideration is \"the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination . . . .\" Mr. Chief Jusice Hughes, for the Court, in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 454-455. Compare United States v. Rogers, 4 How. 567, 572, with Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515.[13]\n\nThis may be, like so many questions of law, a matter of degree. Questions have arisen under the Constitution to which adjudication gives answer although the criteria for decision are less than unwavering bright lines. Often in these cases illumination was found in the federal structures established by, or the underlying presuppositions of, the Constitution. With respect to such questions, the Court has recognized that, concerning a particular power of Congress put in issue, \". . . effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes.\" Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 120. It is also true that even regarding the duration of war and the status of Indian tribes, referred to above as subjects ordinarily committed exclusively to the non-judicial branches, the Court has suggested that some limitations exist upon the range within which the decisions of those branches will be permitted to go unreviewed. See United States v. Sandoval, supra, at 46; cf. Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U. S. 543. But this is merely to acknowledge that particular circumstances may differ so greatly in degree as to differ thereby in kind, and that, although within a certain range of cases on a continuum, no standard of distinction can be found to tell between them, other cases will fall above or below the range. The doctrine of political questions, like any other, is not to *284 be applied beyond the limits of its own logic, with all the quiddities and abstract disharmonies it may manifest. See the disposition of contentions based on logically distorting views of Colegrove v. Green and Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339.\n\n2. The Court has been particularly unwilling to intervene in matters concerning the structure and organization of the political institutions of the States. The abstention from judicial entry into such areas has been greater even than that which marks the Court's ordinary approach to issues of state power challenged under broad federal guarantees. \"We should be very reluctant to decide that we had jurisdiction in such a case, and thus in an action of this nature to supervise and review the political administration of a state government by its own officials and through its own courts. The jurisdiction of this court would only exist in case there had been . . . such a plain and substantial departure from the fundamental principles upon which our government is based that it could with truth and propriety be said that if the judgment were suffered to remain, the party aggrieved would be deprived of his life, liberty or property in violation of the provisions of the Federal Constitution.\" Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586, 596. See Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U. S. 548; Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U. S. 487; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1. Cf. In re Sawyer, 124 U. S. 200, 220-221.\n\nWhere, however, state law has made particular federal questions determinative of relations within the structure of state government, not in challenge of it, the Court has resolved such narrow, legally defined questions in proper proceedings. See Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U. S. 135. In such instances there is no conflict between state policy and the exercise of federal judicial *285 power. This distinction explains the decisions in Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355; Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U. S. 375; and Carroll v. Becker, 285 U. S. 380, in which the Court released state constitutional provisions prescribing local lawmaking procedures from misconceived restriction of superior federal requirements. Adjudication of the federal claim involved in those cases was not one demanding the accommodation of conflicting interests for which no readily accessible judicial standards could be found. See McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S. 1, in which, in a case coming here on writ of error from the judgment of a state court which had entertained it on the merits, the Court treated as justiciable the claim that a State could not constitutionally select its presidential electors by districts, but held that Art. II,  1, cl. 2, of the Constitution left the mode of choosing electors in the absolute discretion of the States. Cf. Pope v. Williams, 193 U. S. 621; Breedlove v. Suttles, 302 U. S. 277. To read with literalness the abstracted jurisdictional discussion in the McPherson opinion reveals the danger of conceptions of \"justiciability\" derived from talk and not from the effective decision in a case. In probing beneath the surface of cases in which the Court has declined to interfere with the actions of political organs of government, of decisive significance is whether in each situation the ultimate decision has been to intervene or not to intervene. Compare the reliance in South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, on MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, and the \"jurisdictional\" form of the opinion in Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586, 596, supra.\n\n3. The cases involving Negro disfranchisement are no exception to the principle of avoiding federal judicial intervention into matters of state government in the absence of an explicit and clear constitutional imperative. For here the controlling command of Supreme Law is plain and unequivocal. An end of discrimination against *286 the Negro was the compelling motive of the Civil War Amendments. The Fifteenth expresses this in terms, and it is no less true of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth. Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 67-72; Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 306-307; Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536, 541. Thus the Court, in cases involving discrimination against the Negro's right to vote, has recognized not only the action at law for damages,[14] but, in appropriate circumstances, the extraordinary remedy of declaratory or injunctive relief.[15]Schnell v. Davis, 336 U. S. 933; Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461.[16] Injunctions in these cases, it should be noted, would not have restrained state-wide general elections. Compare Giles v. Harris, 189 U. S. 475.\n\n4. The Court has refused to exercise its jurisdiction to pass on \"abstract questions of political power, of sovereignty, of government.\" Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 485. See Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 258 U. S. 158, 162; New Jersey v. Sargent, 269 U. S. 328, 337. The \"political question\" doctrine, in this aspect, reflects the policies underlying the requirement of \"standing\": that the litigant who would challenge official *287 action must claim infringement of an interest particular and personal to himself, as distinguished from a cause of dissatisfaction with the general frame and functioning of governmenta complaint that the political institutions are awry. See Stearns v. Wood, 236 U. S. 75; Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126; United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 89-91. What renders cases of this kind non-justiciable is not necessarily the nature of the parties to them, for the Court has resolved other issues between similar parties;[17] nor is it the nature of the legal question involved, for the same type of question has been adjudicated when presented in other forms of controversy.[18] The crux of the matter is that courts are not fit instruments of decision where what is essentially at stake is the composition of those large contests of policy traditionally fought out in non-judicial forums, by which governments and the actions of governments are made and unmade. See Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700; White v. Hart, 13 Wall. 646; Phillips v. Payne, 92 U. S. 130; Marsh v. Burroughs, 1 Woods 463, 471-472 (Bradley, Circuit Justice); cf. Wilson v. Shaw, 204 U. S. 24; but see Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559. Thus, where the Cherokee Nation sought by an original motion to restrain the State of Georgia from the enforcement of laws which assimilated Cherokee territory to the State's counties, abrogated Cherokee law, and abolished Cherokee government, the Court held that such a claim was not judicially cognizable. Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1.[19] And in Georgia *288 v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, the Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a bill by the State of Georgia seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Reconstruction Acts on the ground that the command by military districts which they established extinguished existing state government and replaced it with a form of government unauthorized by the Constitution:[20]\"That these matters, both as stated in the body of the bill; and, in the prayers for relief, call for the judgment of the court upon political questions, and, upon rights, not of persons or property, but of a political character, will hardly be denied. For the rights for the protection of which our authority is invoked, are the rights of sovereignty, of political jurisdiction, of government, of corporate existence as a State, with all its constitutional powers and privileges. No case of private rights or private property infringed, or in danger of actual or threatened infringement, is presented by the bill, in a judicial form, for the judgment of the court.\" Id., at 77.[21]*289 5. The influence of these converging considerations the caution not to undertake decision where standards meet for judicial judgment are lacking, the reluctance to interfere with matters of state government in the absence of an unquestionable and effectively enforceable mandate, the unwillingness to make courts arbiters of the broad issues of political organization historically committed to other institutions and for whose adjustment the judicial process is ill-adaptedhas been decisive of the settled line of cases, reaching back more than a century, which holds that Art. IV,  4, of the Constitution, guaranteeing to the States \"a Republican Form of Government,\"[22] is not enforceable through the courts. E. g., O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U. S. 244; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S. 219; Cochran v. Board of Education, 281 U. S. 370; Highland Farms Dairy, Inc., v. Agnew, 300 U. S. 608.[23] Claims resting on this specific *290 guarantee of the Constitution have been held nonjusticiable which challenged state distribution of powers between the legislative and judicial branches, Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, 281 U. S. 74, state delegation of power to municipalities, Kiernan v. Portland, Oregon, 223 U. S. 151, state adoption of the referendum as a legislative institution, Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565, 569, and state restriction upon the power of state constitutional amendment, Marshall v. Dye, 231 U. S. 250, 256-257. The subject was fully considered in Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118, in which the Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a writ of error attacking a state license-tax statute enacted by the initiative, on the claim that this mode of legislation was inconsistent with a Republican Form of Government and violated the Equal Protection Clause and other federal guarantees. After nothing \". . . the ruinous destruction of legislative authority in matters purely political which would necessarily be occasioned by giving sanction *291 to the doctrine which underlies and would be necessarily involved in sustaining the propositions contended for,\"[24] the Court said:\". . . [The] essentially political nature [of this claim] is at once made manifest by understanding that the assault which the contention here advanced makes it [sic] not on the tax as a tax, but on the State as a State. It is addressed to the framework and political character of the government by which the statute levying the tax was passed. It is the government, the political entity, which (reducing the case to its essence) is called to the bar of this court, not for the purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power assailed, on the ground that its exertion *292 has injuriously affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy to some constitutional limitation, but to demand of the State that it establish its right to exist as a State, republican in form.\" Id., at 150-151.The starting point of the doctrine applied in these cases is, of course, Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1. The case arose out of the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island in 1841-1842. Rhode Island, at the time of the separation from England, had not adopted a new constitution but had continued, in its existence as an independent State, under its original royal Charter, with certain statutory alterations. This frame of government provided no means for amendment of the fundamental law; the right of suffrage was to be prescribed by legislation, which limited it to freeholders. In the 1830's, largely because of the growth of towns in which there developed a propertied class whose means were not represented by freehold estates, dissatisfaction arose with the suffrage qualifications of the charter government. In addition, population shifts had caused a dated apportionment of seats in the lower house to yield substantial numerical inequality of political influence, even among qualified voters. The towns felt themselves underrepresented, and agitation began for electoral reform. When the charter government failed to respond, popular meetings of those who favored the broader suffrage were held and delegates elected to a convention which met and drafted a state constitution. This constitution provided for universal manhood suffrage (with certain qualifications); and it was to be adopted by vote of the people at elections at which a similarly expansive franchise obtained. This new scheme of government was ratified at the polls and declared effective by the convention, but the government elected and organized under it, with Dorr at its head, never came to power. The *293 charter government denied the validity of the convention, the constitution and its government and, after an insignificant skirmish, routed Dorr and his followers. It meanwhile provided for the calling of its own convention, which drafted a constitution that went peacefully into effect in 1843.[25]\nLuther v. Borden was a trespass action brought by one of Dorr's supporters in a United States Circuit Court to recover damages for the breaking and entering of his house. The defendants justified under military orders pursuant to martial law declared by the charter government, and plaintiff, by his reply, joined issue on the legality of the charter government subsequent to the adoption of the Dorr constitution. Evidence offered by the plaintiff tending to establish that the Dorr government was the rightful government of Rhode Island was rejected by the Circuit Court; the court charged the jury that the charter government was lawful; and on a verdict for defendants, plaintiff brought a writ of error to this Court.\n\nThe Court, through Mr. Chief Justice Taney, affirmed. After noting that the issue of the charter government's legality had been resolved in that government's favor by the state courts of Rhode Islandthat the state courts, deeming the matter a political one unfit for judicial determination, had declined to entertain attacks upon the existence and authority of the charter governmentthe Chief Justice held that the courts of the United States must follow those of the State in this regard. Id., at 39-40. It was recognized that the compulsion to follow *294 state law would not apply in a federal court in the face of a superior command found in the Federal Constitution, ibid., but no such command was found. The Constitution, the Court saidreferring to the Guarantee Clause of the Fourth Article\". . . as far as it has provided for an emergency of this kind, and authorized the general government to interfere in the domestic concerns of a State, has treated the subject as political in its nature, and placed the power in the hands of that department.\" Id., at 42.\"Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State. For as the United States guarantee to each State a republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the State before it can determine whether it is republican or not. And when the senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the councils of the Union, the authority of the government under which they are appointed, as well as its republican character, is recognized by the proper constitutional authority. And its decision is binding on every other department of the government, and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal. It is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue; and as no senators or representatives were elected under the authority of the government of which Mr. Dorr was the head, Congress was not called upon to decide the controversy. Yet the right to decide is placed there, and not in the courts.\" Ibid.[26]*295 In determining this issue non-justiciable, the Court was sensitive to the same considerations to which its later decisions have given the varied applications already discussed. It adverted to the delicacy of judicial intervention into the very structure of government.[27] It acknowledged that tradition had long entrusted questions of this nature to non-judicial processes,[28] and that judicial processes were unsuited to their decision.[29] The absence of guiding standards for judgment was critical, for the question whether the Dorr constitution had been rightfully adopted depended, in part, upon the extent of the franchise to be recognizedthe very point of contention over which rebellion had been fought.\". . . [I]f the Circuit Court had entered upon this inquiry, by what rule could it have determined the qualification of voters upon the adoption or rejection of the proposed constitution, unless there was some previous law of the State to guide it? It is the province of a court to expound the law, not to make it. And certainly it is no part of the judicial functions of any court of the United States to prescribe the qualification of voters in a State, giving the right to those to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State, or taking it away from those to whom it is given; nor has it the right to determine what political privileges *296 the citizens of a State are entitled to, unless there is an established constitution or law to govern its decision.\" Id., at 41.Mr. Justice Woodbury (who dissented with respect to the effect of martial law) agreed with the Court regarding the inappropriateness of judicial inquiry into the issues:\"But, fortunately for our freedom from political excitements in judicial duties, this court can never with propriety be called on officially to be the umpire in questions merely political. The adjustment of these questions belongs to the people and their political representatives, either in the State or general government. These questions relate to matters not to be settled on strict legal principles. They are adjusted rather by inclination,or prejudice or compromise, often. Some of them succeed or are defeated even by public policy alone, or mere naked power, rather than intrinsic right. . . .\"Another evil, alarming and little foreseen, involved in regarding these as questions for the final arbitrament of judges would be, that in such an event all political privileges and rights would, in a dispute among the people, depend on our decision finally. . . . [D]isputed points in making constitutions, depending often, as before shown, on policy, inclination, popular resolves, and popular will, . . . if the people, in the distribution of powers under the constitution, should ever think of making judges supreme arbiters in political controversies, when not selected by nor, frequently, amenable to them, nor at liberty to follow such various considerations in their judgments as belong to mere political questions, they will dethrone themselves and lose one of their own invaluable birthrights; building up in this way slowly, but surelya new sovereign power in the *297 republic, in most respects irresponsible and unchangeable for life, and one more dangerous, in theory at least, than the worst elective oligarchy in the worst of times. . . .\" Id., at 51-53.[30]III.The present case involves all of the elements that have made the Guarantee Clause cases non-justiciable. It is, in effect, a Guarantee Clause claim masquerading under a different label. But it cannot make the case more fit for judicial action that appellants invoke the Fourteenth Amendment rather than Art. IV,  4, where, in fact, the gist of their complaint is the sameunless it can be found that the Fourteenth Amendment speaks with greater particularity to their situation. We have been admonished to avoid \"the tyranny of labels.\" Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 114. Art. IV,  4, is not committed by express constitutional terms to Congress. It is the nature of the controversies arising under it, nothing else, which has made it judicially unenforceable. Of course, if a controversy falls within judicial power, it depends \"on how he [the plaintiff] casts his action,\" Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, 366 U. S. 656, 662, whether he brings himself within a jurisdictional statute. But where judicial competence is wanting, it cannot be created by invoking one clause of the Constitution rather than another. When what was essentially a Guarantee Clause claim was sought to be laid, as well, under the Equal Protection Clause in Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, supra, the Court had no difficulty in \"dispelling *298 any mere confusion resulting from forms of expression and considering the substance of things . . . .\" 223 U. S., at 140.\n\nHere appellants attack \"the State as a State,\" precisely as it was perceived to be attacked in the Pacific States case, id., at 150. Their complaint is that the basis of representation of the Tennessee Legislature hurts them. They assert that \"a minority now rules in Tennessee,\" that the apportionment statute results in a \"distortion of the constitutional system,\" that the General Assembly is no longer \"a body representative of the people of the State of Tennessee,\" all \"contrary to the basic principle of representative government . . . .\" Accepting appellants' own formulation of the issue, one can know this handsaw from a hawk. Such a claim would be non-justiciable not merely under Art. IV,  4, but under any clause of the Constitution, by virtue of the very fact that a federal court is not a forum for political debate. Massachusetts v. Mellon, supra.\n\nBut appellants, of course, do not rest on this claim simpliciter. In invoking the Equal Protection Clause, they assert that the distortion of representative government complained of is produced by systematic discrimination against them, by way of \"a debasement of their votes . . . .\" Does this characterization, with due regard for the facts from which it is derived, add anything to appellants' case?[31]\n\nAt first blush, this charge of discrimination based on legislative underrepresentation is given the appearance of *299 a more private, less impersonal claim, than the assertion that the frame of government is askew. Appellants appear as representatives of a class that is prejudiced as a class, in contradistinction to the polity in its entirety. However, the discrimination relied on is the deprivation of what appellants conceive to be their proportionate share of political influence. This, of course, is the practical effect of any allocation of power within the institutions of government. Hardly any distribution of political authority that could be assailed as rendering government non-republican would fail similarly to operate to the prejudice of some groups, and to the advantage of others, within the body politic. It would be ingenuous not to see, or consciously blind to deny, that the real battle over the initiative and referendum, or over a delegation of power to local rather than state-wide authority, is the battle between forces whose influence is disparate among the various organs of government to whom power may be given. No shift of power but works a corresponding shift in political influence among the groups composing a society.\n\nWhat, then, is this question of legislative apportionment? Appellants invoke the right to vote and to have their votes counted.[32] But they are permitted to vote and their votes are counted. They go to the polls, they cast their ballots, they send their representatives to the state *300 councils. Their complaint is simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerfulin short, that Tennessee has adopted a basis of representation with which they are dissatisfied. Talk of \"debasement\" or \"dilution\" is circular talk. One cannot speak of \"debasement\" or \"dilution\" of the value of a vote until there is first defined a standard of reference as to what a vote should be worth. What is actually asked of the Court in this case is to choose among competing bases of representationultimately, really, among competing theories of political philosophyin order to establish an appropriate frame of government for the State of Tennessee and thereby for all the States of the Union.\n\nIn such a matter, abstract analogies which ignore the facts of history deal in unrealities; they betray reason. This is not a case in which a State has, through a device however oblique and sophisticated, denied Negroes or Jews or redheaded persons a vote, or given them only a third or a sixth of a vote. That was Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339. What Tennessee illustrates is an old and still widespread method of representationrepresentation by local geographical division, only in part respective of populationin preference to others, others, forsooth, more appealing. Appellants contest this choice and seek to make this Court the arbiter of the disagreement. They would make the Equal Protection Clause the charter of adjudication, asserting that the equality which it guarantees comports, if not the assurance of equal weight to every voter's vote, at least the basic conception that representation ought to be proportionate to population, a standard by reference to which the reasonableness of apportionment plans may be judged.\n\nTo find such a political conception legally enforceable in the broad and unspecific guarantee of equal protection is to rewrite the Constitution. See Luther v. Borden, supra. Certainly, \"equal protection\" is no more secure *301 a foundation for judicial judgment of the permissibility of varying forms of representative government than is \"Republican Form.\" Indeed since \"equal protection of the laws\" can only mean an equality of persons standing in the same relation to whatever governmental action is challenged, the determination whether treatment is equal presupposes a determination concerning the nature of the relationship. This, with respect to apportionment, means an inquiry into the theoretic base of representation in an acceptably republican state. For a court could not determine the equal-protection issue without in fact first determining the Republican-Form issue, simply because what is reasonable for equal-protection purposes will depend upon what frame of government, basically, is allowed. To divorce \"equal protection\" from \"Republican Form\" is to talk about half a question.\n\nThe notion that representation proportioned to the geographic spread of population is so universally accepted as a necessary element of equality between man and man that it must be taken to be the standard of a political equality preserved by the Fourteenth Amendmentthat it is, in appellants' words \"the basic principle of representative government\"is, to put it bluntly, not true. However desirable and however desired by some among the great political thinkers and framers of our government, it has never been generally practiced, today or in the past. It was not the English system, it was not the colonial system, it was not the system chosen for the national government by the Constitution, it was not the system exclusively or even predominantly practiced by the States at the time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is not predominantly practiced by the States today. Unless judges, the judges of this Court, are to make their private views of political wisdom the measure of the Constitutionviews which in all honesty cannot but give the appearance, if not reflect the reality, of *302 involvement with the business of partisan politics so inescapably a part of apportionment controversiesthe Fourteenth Amendment, \"itself a historical product,\" Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., 260 U. S. 22, 31, provides no guide for judicial oversight of the representation problem.1. Great Britain.Writing in 1958, Professor W. J. M. Mackenzie aptly summarized the British history of the principle of representation proportioned to population: \" `Equal electoral districts' formed part of the programme of radical reform in England in the 1830s, the only part of that programme which has not been realised.\"[33] Until the late nineteenth century, the sole base of representation (with certain exceptions not now relevant) was the local geographical unit: each county or borough returned its fixed number of members, usually two for the English units, regardless of population.[34] Prior to the Reform Act of 1832, this system was marked by the almost total disfranchisement of the populous northern industrial centers, which had grown to significant size at the advent of the Industrial Revolution and had not been granted borough representation, and by the existence of the rotten borough, playing its substantial part in the Crown's struggle for continued control of the Commons.[35] In 1831, ten southernmost English counties, numbering three and a quarter million people, had two hundred and thirty-five parliamentary representatives, while the six northernmost counties, with more than three and a half million people, had sixty-eight.[36] It was said that one hundred and eighty persons appointed three hundred and *303 fifty members in the Commons.[37] Less than a half century earlier, Madison in the Federalist had remarked that half the House was returned by less than six thousand of the eight million people of England and Scotland.[38]\n\nThe Act of 1832, the product of a fierce partisan political struggle and the occasion of charges of gerrymandering not without foundation,[39] effected eradication of only the most extreme numerical inequalities of the unreformed system. It did not adopt the principle of representation based on population, but merely disfranchised certain among the rotten borough and enfranchised most of the urban centersstill quite without regard to their relative numbers.[40] In the wake of the Act there remained substantial electoral inequality: the boroughs of Cornwall were represented sixteen times as weightily, judged by population, as the county's eastern division; the average ratio of seats to population in ten agricultural counties was four and a half times that in ten manufacturing divisions; Honiton, with about three thousand inhabitants, was equally represented with Liverpool, which had four hundred thousand.[41] In 1866 apportionment by population began to be advocated generally in the House, but was not made the basis of the redistribution of 1867, although the act of that year did apportion representation more evenly, gauged by the population standard.[42] Population shifts increased the surviving inequalities; by 1884 the representation ratio *304 in many small boroughs was more than twenty-two times that of Birmingham or Manchester, forty-to-one disparities could be found elsewhere, and, in sum, in the 1870's and 1880's, a fourth of the electorate returned two-thirds of the members of the House.[43]\n\nThe first systematic English attempt to distribute seats by population was the Redistribution Act of 1885.[44] The statute still left ratios of inequality of as much as seven to one,[45] which had increased to fifteen to one by 1912.[46] In 1918 Parliament again responded to \"shockingly bad\" conditions of inequality,[47] and to partisan political inspiration,[48] by redistribution.[49] In 1944, redistribution was put on a periodic footing by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act of that year,[50] which committed a continuing primary responsibility for reapportioning the Commons to administrative agencies (Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively).[51] The Commissions, having regard to certain rules prescribed for their guidance, are to prepare at designated intervals reports for the Home Secretary's submission to Parliament, along with the draft of an Order in Council to give effect to the *305 Commissions' recommendations. The districting rules adopt the basic principle of representation by population, although the principle is significantly modified by directions to respect local geographic boundaries as far as practicable, and by discretion to take account of special geographical conditions, including the size, shape and accessibility of constituencies. Under the original 1944 Act, the rules provided that (subject to the exercise of the discretion respecting special geographical conditions and to regard for the total size of the House of Commons as prescribed by the Act) so far as practicable, the single-member districts should not deviate more than twenty-five percent from the electoral quota (population divided by number of constituencies). However, apparently at the recommendation of the Boundary Commission for England, the twenty-five percent standard was eliminated as too restrictive in 1947, and replaced by the flexible provision that constituencies are to be as near the electoral quota as practicable, a rule which is expressly subordinated both to the consideration of special geographic conditions and to that of preserving local boundaries.[52] Free of the twenty-five percent rule, the Commissions drew up plans of distribution in which inequalities among the districts run, in ordinary cases, as high as two to one and, in the case of a few extraordinary constituencies, three to one.[53] The action of the Boundary Commission for England was twice challenged in the courts in 1954the claim being that the Commission had violated statutory rules *306 prescribing the standards for its judgmentand in both cases the Judges declined to intervene. In Hammersmith Borough Council v. Boundary Commission for England,[54] Harman, J., was of opinion that the nature of the controversy and the scheme of the Acts made the matter inappropriate for judicial interference, and in Harper v. Home Secretary,[55] the Court of Appeal, per Evershed, M. R., quoting Harman, J., with approval, adverting to the wide range of discretion entrusted to the Commission under the Acts, and remarking the delicate character of the parliamentary issues in which it was sought to engage the court, reached the same conclusion.[56]\n\nThe House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1958,[57] made two further amendments to the law. Responsive to the recommendation of the Boundary Commission for England,[58] the interval permitted between Commission reports was more than doubled, to a new maximum of fifteen years.[59] And at the suggestion of the same Commission that \"It would ease the future labours of the Commission and remove much local irritation if Rule 5 [requiring that the electorate of each constituency be as near the electoral quota as practicable] were to be so amended as to allow us to make recommendations preserving the status quo in any area where such a course appeared to be desirable and not inconsistent *307 with the broad intention of the Rules,\"[60] the Commissions were directed to consider the inconvenience attendant upon the alteration of constituencies, and the local ties which such alteration might break. The Home Secretary's view of this amendment was that it worked to erect \"a presumption against making changes unless there is a very strong case for them.\"[61]2. The Colonies and the Union.For the guiding political theorists of the Revolutionary generation, the English system of representation, in its most salient aspects of numerical inequality, was a model to be avoided, not followed.[62] Nevertheless, the basic English principle of apportioning representatives among the local governmental entities, towns or counties, rather than among units of approximately equal population, had early taken root in the colonies.[63] In some, as in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, numbers of electors were taken into account, in a rough fashion, by allotting increasing fixed quotas of representatives to several towns or classes of towns graduated by population, but in most of the colonies delegates were allowed to the local units without respect to numbers.[64] This resulted in grossly unequal electoral units.[65] The representation ratio in one North Carolina county was more than eight times that in another.[66] Moreover, American rotten boroughs had appeared,[67] and apportionment was made an instrument first in the political *308 struggles between the King or the royal governors and the colonial legislatures,[68] and, later, between the older tidewater regions in the colonies and the growing interior.[69] Madison in the Philadelphia Convention adverted to the \"inequality of the Representation in the Legislatures of particular States, . . .\"[70] arguing that it was necessary to confer on Congress the power ultimately to regulate the times, places and manner of selecting Representatives,[71] in order to forestall the overrepresented counties' securing themselves a similar overrepresentation in the national councils. The example of South Carolina, where Charleston's overrepresentation was a continuing bone of contention between the tidewater and the back country, was cited by Madison in the Virginia Convention and by King in the Massachusetts Convention, in support of the same power, and King also spoke of the extreme numerical inequality arising from Connecticut's town-representation system.[72]\n\nSuch inequalities survived the constitutional period. The United States Constitution itself did not largely adopt the principle of numbers. Apportionment of the national legislature among the States was one of the most difficult problems for the Convention;[73] its solution involving State representation in the Senate[74] and the three-fifths compromise in the House[75]left neither chamber apportioned proportionately to population. *309 Within the States, electoral power continued to be allotted to favor the tidewater.[76] Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, recorded the \"very unequal\" representation there: individual counties differing in population by a ratio of more than seventeen to one elected the same number of representatives, and those nineteen thousand of Virginia's fifty thousand men who lived between the falls of the rivers and the seacoast returned half the State's senators and almost half its delegates.[77] In South Carolina in 1790, the three lower districts, with a white population of less than twenty-nine thousand elected twenty senators and seventy assembly members; while in the uplands more than one hundred and eleven thousand white persons elected seventeen senators and fifty-four assemblymen.[78]\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, the demands of the interior became more insistent. The apportionment quarrel in Virginia was a major factor in precipitating the calling of a constitutional convention in 1829. Bitter animosities racked the convention, threatening the State with disunion. At last a compromise which gave the three hundred and twenty thousand people of the west thirteen senators, as against the nineteen senators returned by the three hundred sixty-three thousand people of the east, commanded agreement. It was adopted at the polls but left the western counties so dissatisfied that there were threats of revolt and realignment with the State of Maryland.[79]\n\nMaryland, however, had her own numerical disproportions. In 1820, one representative vote in Calvert County *310 was worth five in Frederick County, and almost two hundred thousand people were represented by eighteen members, while fifty thousand others elected twenty.[80] This was the result of the county-representation system of allotment. And, except for Massachusetts which, after a long struggle, did adopt representation by population at the mid-century, a similar town-representation principle continued to prevail in various forms throughout New England, with all its attendant, often gross inequalities.[81]3. The States at the time of ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and those later admitted. The several state conventions throughout the first half of the nineteenth century were the scenes of fierce sectional and party strifes respecting the geographic allocation of representation.[82] Their product was a wide variety of apportionment methods which recognized the element of population in differing ways and degrees. Particularly pertinent to appraisal of the contention that the Fourteenth Amendment embodied a standard limiting the freedom of the States with regard to the principles and bases of local legislative apportionment is an examination of the apportionment provisions of the thirty-three States which ratified the Amendment between 1866 and 1870, at their respective times of ratification. These may be considered in two groups: (A) the ratifying States other than the ten Southern States whose constitutions, at the time of ratification or shortly thereafter, were the work of the Reconstruction Act conventions;[83] and *311 (B) the ten Reconstruction-Act States. All thirty-three are significant, because they demonstrate how unfounded is the assumption that the ratifying States could have agreed on a standard apportionment theory or practice, and how baseless the suggestion that by voting for the Equal Protection Clause they sought to establish a test mold for apportionment whichif appellants' argument is soundstruck down sub silentio not a few of their own state constitutional provisions. But the constitutions of the ten Reconstruction-Act States have an added importance, for it is scarcely to be thought that the Congress which was so solicitous for the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment as to make the readmission of the late rebel States to Congress turn on their respective ratifications of it, would have approved constitutions whichagain, under appellants' theorycontemporaneously offended the Amendment.A. Of the twenty-three ratifying States of the first group, seven or eight had constitutions which demanded or allowed apportionment of both houses on the basis of population,[84] unqualifiedly or with only qualifications respecting the preservation of local boundaries.[85] Three *312 more apportioned on what was essentially a population base, but provided that in one house counties having a specified fraction of a ratioa moiety or two-thirds should have a representative.[86] Since each of these three States limited the size of their chambers, the fractional rule could operateand, at least in Michigan, has in fact operated[87]to produce substantial numerical inequalities *313 in favor of the sparsely populated counties.[88] Iowa favored her small counties by the rule that no more than four counties might be combined in a representative district,[89] and New York and Kansas compromised population and county-representation principles by assuring every county, regardless of the number of its inhabitants, at least one seat in their respective Houses.[90]\n\nOhio and Maine recognized the factor of numbers by a different device. The former gave a House representative to each county having half a ratio, two representatives for a ratio and three-quarters, three representatives for three ratios, and a single additional representative for each additional ratio.[91] The latter, after apportioning among counties on a population base, gave each town of fifteen hundred inhabitants one representative, each town of three thousand, seven hundred and fifty inhabitants two representatives, and so on in increasing intervals to twenty-six thousand, two hundred and fifty inhabitants towns of that size or larger receiving the maximum permitted number of representatives: seven.[92] The departure from numerical equality under these systems is apparent: in Maine, assuming the incidence of towns in *314 all categories, representative ratios would differ by factors of two and a half to one, at a minimum. Similarly, Missouri gave each of its counties, however small, one representative, two representatives for three ratios, three representatives for six ratios, and one additional representative for each three ratios above six.[93] New Hampshire allotted a representative to each town of one hundred and fifty ratable male polls of voting age and one more representative for each increment of three hundred above that figure;[94] its Senate was not apportioned by population but among districts based on the proportion of direct taxes paid.[95] In Pennsylvania, the basis of apportionment in both houses was taxable inhabitants; and in the House every county of at least thirty-five hundred taxables had a representative, nor could more than three counties be joined in forming a representative district; while in the Senate no city or county could have more than four of the State's twenty-five to thirty-three senators.[96]\n\nFinally, four States apportioned at least one House with no regard whatever to population. In Connecticut[97] and Vermont[98] representation in the House was on a town basis; Rhode Island gave one senator to each of its towns or cities,[99] and New Jersey, one to each of its counties.[100]*315 Nor, in any of these States, was the other House apportioned on a strict principle of equal numbers: Connecticut gave each of its counties a minimum of two senators[101] and Vermont, one;[102] New Jersey assured each county a representative;[103] and in Rhode Island, which gave at least one representative to each town or city, no town or city could have more than one-sixth of the total number in the House.[104]B. Among the ten late Confederate States affected by the Reconstruction Acts, in only four did it appear that apportionment of both state legislative houses would or might be based strictly on population.[105] In North Carolina,[106] South Carolina,[107] Louisiana,[108] and Alabama,[109] each county (in the case of Louisiana, each parish) was assured at least one seat in the lower House irrespective of numbersa distribution which exhausted, respectively, *316 on the basis of the number of then-existing counties, three-quarters, one-quarter, two-fifths and three-fifths of the maximum possible number of representatives, before a single seat was available for assignment on a population basis; and in South Carolina, moreover, the Senate was composed of one member elected from each county, except that Charleston sent two.[110] In Florida's House, each county had one seat guaranteed and an additional seat for every thousand registered voters up to a maximum of four representatives;[111] while Georgia, whose Senate seats were distributed among forty-four single-member districts each composed of three contiguous counties,[112] assigned representation in its House as follows: three seats to each of the six most populous counties, two to each of the thirty-one next most populous, one to each of the remaining ninety-five.[113] As might be expected, the one-representative-per-county minimum pattern has proved incompatible with numerical equality,[114] and Georgia's *317 county-clustering system has produced representative-ratio disparities, between the largest and smallest counties, of more than sixty to one.[115]C.\nThe constitutions[116] of the thirteen States which Congress admitted to the Union after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment showed a similar pattern. Six of them required or permitted apportionment of both Houses by population, subject only to qualifications concerning local boundaries.[117] Wyoming, apportioning by population, guaranteed to each of its counties at least one seat in each House,[118] and Idaho, which prescribed (after the first legislative session) that apportionment should be \"as may be provided by law,\" gave each county at least one representative.[119] In Oklahoma, House members were apportioned among counties so as to give one *318 seat for half a ratio, two for a ratio and three-quarters, and one for each additional ratio up to a maximum of seven representatives per county.[120] Montana required reapportionment of its House on the basis of periodic enumerations according to ratios to be fixed by law[121] but its counties were represented as counties in the Senate, each county having one senator.[122] Alaska[123] and Hawaii[124] each apportioned a number of senators among constitutionally fixed districts; their respective Houses were to be periodically reapportioned by population, subject to a moiety rule in Alaska[125] and to Hawaii's guarantee of one representative to each of four constitutionally designated areas.[126] The Arizona Constitution assigned representation to each county in each house, giving one or two senators and from one to seven representatives to each, and making no provision for reapportionment.[127]\n*319 4. Contemporary apportionment. Detailed recent studies are available to describe the present-day constitutional and statutory status of apportionment in the fifty States.[128] They demonstrate a decided twentieth-century trend away from population as the exclusive base of representation. Today, only a dozen state constitutions provide for periodic legislative reapportionment of both houses by a substantially unqualified application of the population standard,[129] and only about a dozen more prescribe such reapportionment for even a single chamber. \"Specific provision for county representation in at least one house of the state legislature has been increasingly adopted since the end of the 19th century. . . .\"[130] More than twenty States now guarantee each county at least one seat in one of their houses regardless of population, and in nine others county or town units are given equal representation in one legislative branch, whatever the number of each unit's inhabitants. Of course, numerically considered, \"These provisions invariably result in over-representation of the least populated areas. . . .\"[131] And in an effort to curb the political dominance of metropolitan regions, at least ten States now limit the maximum entitlement of any single county (or, in some cases, city) *320 in one legislative houseanother source of substantial numerical disproportion.[132]\n\nMoreover, it is common knowledge that the legislatures have not kept reapportionment up to date, even where state constitutions in terms require it.[133] In particular, the pattern of according greater per capita representation to rural, relatively sparsely populated areasthe same pattern which finds expression in various state constitutional provisions,[134] and which has been given effect in England and elsewhere[135]has, in some of the States, been made the law by legislative inaction in the face of *321 population shifts.[136] Throughout the country, urban and suburban areas tend to be given higher representation ratios than do rural areas.[137]\n\nThe stark fact is that if among the numerous widely varying principles and practices that control state legislative apportionment today there is any generally prevailing feature, that feature is geographic inequality in relation to the population standard.[138] Examples could be endlessly multiplied. In New Jersey, counties of *322 thirty-five thousand and of more than nine hundred and five thousand inhabitants respectively each have a single senator.[139] Representative districts in Minnesota range from 7,290 inhabitants to 107,246 inhabitants.[140] Ratios of senatorial representation in California vary as much as two hundred and ninety-seven to one.[141] In Oklahoma, the range is ten to one for House constituencies and roughly sixteen to one for Senate constituencies.[142] Colebrook, Connecticutpopulation 592elects two House representatives; Hartfordpopulation 177,397also elects two.[143] The first, third and fifth of these examples are the products of constitutional provisions which subordinate population to regional considerations in apportionment; the second is the result of legislative inaction; the fourth derives from both constitutional and legislative sources. A survey made in 1955, in sum, reveals that less than thirty percent of the population inhabit districts sufficient to elect a House majority in thirteen States and a Senate majority in nineteen States.[144] These figures show more than individual variations from a generally accepted standard of electoral equality. They show that there is notas there has never beena standard by *323 which the place of equality as a factor in apportionment can be measured.\n\nManifestly, the Equal Protection Clause supplies no clearer guide for judicial examination of apportionment methods than would the Guarantee Clause itself. Apportionment, by its character, is a subject of extraordinary complexity, involvingeven after the fundamental theoretical issues concerning what is to be represented in a representative legislature have been fought out or compromised considerations of geography, demography, electoral convenience, economic and social cohesions or divergencies among particular local groups, communications, the practical effects of political institutions like the lobby and the city machine, ancient traditions and ties of settled usage, respect for proven incumbents of long experience and senior status, mathematical mechanics, censuses compiling relevant data, and a host of others.[145]*324 Legislative responses throughout the country to the reapportionment demands of the 1960 Census have glaringly confirmed that these are not factors that lend themselves to evaluations of a nature that are the staple of judicial determinations or for which judges are equipped to adjudicate by legal training or experience or native wit. And this is the more so true because in every strand of this complicated, intricate web of values meet the contending forces of partisan politics.[146] The practical significance of apportionment is that the next election results may differ because of it. Apportionment battles are overwhelmingly party or intra-party contests.[147] It will add a virulent source of friction and tension in federal-state relations to embroil the federal judiciary in them.[148]\n*325IV.Appellants, however, contend that the federal courts may provide the standard which the Fourteenth Amendment lacks by reference to the provisions of the constitution of Tennessee. The argument is that although the same or greater disparities of electoral strength may be suffered to exist immune from federal judicial review in States where they result from apportionment legislation consistent with state constitutions, the Tennessee Legislature may not abridge the rights which, on its face, its own constitution appears to give, without by that act denying equal protection of the laws. It is said that the law of Tennessee, as expressed by the words of its written constitution, has made the basic choice among policies in favor of representation proportioned to population, and that it is no longer open to the State to allot its voting power on other principles.\n\nThis reasoning does not bear analysis. Like claims invoking state constitutional requirement have been rejected here and for good reason. It is settled that whatever federal consequences may derive from a discrimination worked by a state statute must be the same as if the same discrimination were written into the *326 State's fundamental law. Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, 310 U. S. 362. And see Castillo v. McConnico, 168 U. S. 674; Coulter v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 196 U. S. 599, 608-609; Owensboro Waterworks Co. v. Owensboro, 200 U. S. 38; Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U. S. 312, 316-317; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1, 11. Appellants complain of a practice which, by their own allegations, has been the law of Tennessee for sixty years. They allege that the Apportionment Act of 1901 created unequal districts when passed and still maintains unequal districts. They allege that the Legislature has since 1901 purposefully retained unequal districts. And the Supreme Court of Tennessee has refused to invalidate the law establishing these unequal districts. Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40; appeal dismissed here in 352 U. S. 920. In these circumstances, what was said in the Browning case, supra, at 369, clearly governs this case:\". . . Here, according to petitioner's own claim, all the organs of the state are conforming to a practice, systematic, unbroken for more than forty years, and now questioned for the first time. It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of `laws' to what is found written on the statute books, and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it. Settled state practice cannot supplant constitutional guarantees, but it can establish what is state law. The Equal Protection Clause did not write an empty formalism into the Constitution. Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy, such as those of which petitioner complains, are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text. . . . [T]he Equal Protection Clause is not a command of candor. . . .\"*327 Tennessee's law and its policy respecting apportionment are what 60 years of practice show them to be, not what appellants cull from the unenforced and, according to its own judiciary, unenforceable words of its Constitution. The statute comes here on the same footing, therefore, as would the apportionment laws of New Jersey, California or Connecticut,[149] and is unaffected by its supposed repugnance to the state constitutional language on which appellants rely.[150]\n\nIn another aspect, however, the Kidd v. McCanless case, supra, introduces a factor peculiar to this litigation, which only emphasizes the duty of declining the exercise of federal judicial jurisdiction. In all of the apportionment cases which have come before the Court, a consideration which has been weighty in determining their non-justiciability has been the difficulty or impossibility of devising effective judicial remedies in this class of case. An injunction restraining a general election unless the legislature reapportions would paralyze the critical centers of a State's political system and threaten political dislocation whose consequences are not foreseeable. A declaration devoid *328 of implied compulsion of injunctive or other relief would be an idle threat.[151] Surely a Federal District Court could not itself remap the State: the same complexities which impede effective judicial review of apportionment a fortiori make impossible a court's consideration of these imponderables as an original matter. And the choice of elections at large as opposed to elections by district, however unequal the districts, is a matter of sweeping political judgment having enormous political implications, the nature and reach of which are certainly beyond the informed understanding of, and capacity for appraisal by, courts.\n\nIn Tennessee, moreover, the McCanless case has closed off several among even these unsatisfactory and dangerous modes of relief. That case was a suit in the state courts attacking the 1901 Reapportionment Act and seeking a declaration and an injunction of the Act's enforcement or, alternatively, a writ of mandamus compelling state election officials to hold the elections at large, or, again alternatively, a decree of the court reapportioning the State. The Chancellor denied all coercive relief, but entertained the suit for the purpose of rendering a declaratory judgment. It was his view that despite an invalidation of the statute under which the present legislature was elected, that body would continue to possess de facto authority to reapportion, and that therefore the maintaining of the suit did not threaten the disruption of the government. The Tennessee Supreme Court agreed that no coercive relief could be granted; in particular, it said, \"There is no provision of law for election of our General Assembly by an election at large over the State.\" 200 Tenn., at 277, 292 S. W. 2d, at 42. Thus, a legislature elected at *329 large would not be the legally constituted legislative authority of the State. The court reversed, however, the Chancellor's determination to give declaratory relief, holding that the ground of demurrer which asserted that a striking down of the statute would disrupt the orderly process of government should have been sustained:\"(4) It seems obvious and we therefore hold that if the Act of 1901 is to be declared unconstitutional, then the de facto doctrine cannot be applied to maintain the present members of the General Assembly in office. If the Chancellor is correct in holding that this statute has expired by the passage of the decade following its enactment then for the same reason all prior apportionment acts have expired by a like lapse of time and are non-existent. Therefore we would not only not have any existing members of the General Assembly but we would have no apportionment act whatever under which a new election could be held for the election of members to the General Assembly......\"The ultimate result of holding this Act unconstitutional by reason of the lapse of time would be to deprive us of the present Legislature and the means of electing a new one and ultimately bring about the destruction of the State itself.\" 200 Tenn., at 281-282, 292 S. W. 2d, at 44.A federal court enforcing the Federal Constitution is not, to be sure, bound by the remedial doctrines of the state courts. But it must consider as pertinent to the propriety or impropriety of exercising its jurisdiction those state-law effects of its decree which it cannot itself control. A federal court cannot provide the authority requisite to make a legislature the proper governing body of the State of Tennessee. And it cannot be doubted that the striking *330 down of the statute here challenged on equal protection grounds, no less than on grounds of failure to reapportion decennially, would deprive the State of all valid apportionment legislation andunder the ruling in McCanlessdeprive the State of an effective law-based legislative branch. Just such considerations, among others here present, were determinative in Luther v. Borden and the Oregon initiative cases.[152]\n\nAlthough the District Court had jurisdiction in the very restricted sense of power to determine whether it could adjudicate the claim, the case is of that class of political controversy which, by the nature of its subject, is unfit for federal judicial action. The judgment of the District Court, in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, should therefore be affirmed.Dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins.The dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, in which I join, demonstrates the abrupt departure the majority makes from judicial history by putting the federal courts into this area of state concernsan area which, in this instance, the Tennessee state courts themselves have refused to enter.\n\nIt does not detract from his opinion to say that the panorama of judicial history it unfolds, though evincing a steadfast underlying principle of keeping the federal courts out of these domains, has a tendency, because of variants in expression, to becloud analysis in a given case. With due respect to the majority, I think that has happened here.\n\nOnce one cuts through the thicket of discussion devoted to \"jurisdiction,\" \"standing,\" \"justiciability,\" and \"political *331 question,\" there emerges a straightforward issue which, in my view, is determinative of this case. Does the complaint disclose a violation of a federal constitutional right, in other words, a claim over which a United States District Court would have jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3) and 42 U. S. C.  1983? The majority opinion does not actually discuss this basic question, but, as one concurring Justice observes, seems to decide it \"sub silentio.\" Ante, p. 261. However, in my opinion, appellants' allegations, accepting all of them as true, do not, parsed down or as a whole, show an infringement by Tennessee of any rights assured by the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, I believe the complaint should have been dismissed for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., Rule 12 (b) (6).\n\nIt is at once essential to recognize this case for what it is. The issue here relates not to a method of state electoral apportionment by which seats in the federal House of Representatives are allocated, but solely to the right of a State to fix the basis of representation in its own legislature. Until it is first decided to what extent that right is limited by the Federal Constitution, and whether what Tennessee has done or failed to do in this instance runs afoul of any such limitation, we need not reach the issues of \"justiciability\" or \"political question\" or any of the other considerations which in such cases as Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, led the Court to decline to adjudicate a challenge to a state apportionment affecting seats in the federal House of Representatives, in the absence of a controlling Act of Congress. See also Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1.\n\nThe appellants' claim in this case ultimately rests entirely on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is asserted that Tennessee has violated the Equal Protection Clause by maintaining in effect a *332 system of apportionment that grossly favors in legislative representation the rural sections of the State as against its urban communities. Stripped to its essentials the complaint purports to set forth three constitutional claims of varying breadth:(1) The Equal Protection Clause requires that each vote cast in state legislative elections be given approximately equal weight.(2) Short of this, the existing apportionment of state legislators is so unreasonable as to amount to an arbitrary and capricious act of classification on the part of the Tennessee Legislature, which is offensive to the Equal Protection Clause.(3) In any event, the existing apportionment is rendered invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment because it flies in the face of the Tennessee Constitution.For reasons given in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion, ante, pp. 325-327, the last of these propositions is manifestly untenable, and need not be dealt with further. I turn to the other two.I.I can find nothing in the Equal Protection Clause or elsewhere in the Federal Constitution which expressly or impliedly supports the view that state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter. Not only is that proposition refuted by history, as shown by my Brother FRANKFURTER, but it strikes deep into the heart of our federal system. Its acceptance would require us to turn our backs on the regard which this Court has always shown for the judgment of state legislatures and courts on matters of basically local concern.\n\n*333 In the last analysis, what lies at the core of this controversy is a difference of opinion as to the function of representative government. It is surely beyond argument that those who have the responsibility for devising a system of representation may permissibly consider that factors other than bare numbers should be taken into account. The existence of the United States Senate is proof enough of that. To consider that we may ignore the Tennessee Legislature's judgment in this instance because that body was the product of an asymmetrical electoral apportionment would in effect be to assume the very conclusion here disputed. Hence we must accept the present form of the Tennessee Legislature as the embodiment of the State's choice, or, more realistically, its compromise, between competing political philosophies. The federal courts have not been empowered by the Equal Protection Clause to judge whether this resolution of the State's internal political conflict is desirable or undesirable, wise or unwise.\n\nWith respect to state tax statutes and regulatory measures, for example, it has been said that the \"day is gone when this Court uses the . . . Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws . . . because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.\" Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 488. I would think it all the more compelling for us to follow this principle of self-restraint when what is involved is the freedom of a State to deal with so intimate a concern as the structure of its own legislative branch. The Federal Constitution imposes no limitation on the form which a state government may take other than generally committing to the United States the duty to guarantee to every State \"a Republican Form of Government.\" And, as my Brother FRANKFURTER so conclusively proves (ante, pp. 308-317), no intention to fix immutably the *334 means of selecting representatives for state governments could have been in the minds of either the Founders or the draftsmen of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn short, there is nothing in the Federal Constitution to prevent a State, acting not irrationally, from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests, temper, and customs of its people. I would have thought this proposition settled by MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, in which the Court observed (at p. 283) that to \"assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government,\" and reaffirmed by South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276. A State's choice to distribute electoral strength among geographical units, rather than according to a census of population, is certainly no less a rational decision of policy than would be its choice to levy a tax on property rather than a tax on income. Both are legislative judgments entitled to equal respect from this Court.II.The claim that Tennessee's system of apportionment is so unreasonable as to amount to a capricious classification of voting strength stands up no better under dispassionate analysis.\n\nThe Court has said time and again that the Equal Protection Clause does not demand of state enactments either mathematical identity or rigid equality. E. g., Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522, 527-528, and authorities there cited; McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425-426. All that is prohibited is \"invidious discrimination\" bearing no rational relation to any permissible policy of the State. Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., supra, at 489. And in deciding whether such discrimination has been practiced by a State, it must be borne in mind that a \"statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived *335 to justify it.\" McGowan v. Maryland, supra. It is not inequality alone that calls for a holding of unconstitutionality; only if the inequality is based on an impermissible standard may this Court condemn it.\n\nWhat then is the basis for the claim made in this case that the distribution of state senators and representatives is the product of capriciousness or of some constitutionally prohibited policy? It is not that Tennessee has arranged its electoral districts with a deliberate purpose to dilute the voting strength of one race, cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, or that some religious group is intentionally underrepresented. Nor is it a charge that the legislature has indulged in sheer caprice by allotting representatives to each county on the basis of a throw of the dice, or of some other determinant bearing no rational relation to the question of apportionment. Rather, the claim is that the State Legislature has unreasonably retained substantially the same allocation of senators and representatives as was established by statute in 1901, refusing to recognize the great shift in the population balance between urban and rural communities that has occurred in the meantime.\n\nIt is further alleged that even as of 1901 the apportionment was invalid, in that it did not allocate state legislators among the counties in accordance with the formula set out in Art. II,  5, of the Tennessee Constitution. In support of this the appellants have furnished a Table which indicates that as of 1901 six counties were overrepresented and 11 were underrepresented. But that Table in fact shows nothing in the way of significant discrepancy; in the instance of each county it is only one representative who is either lacking or added. And it is further perfectly evident that the variations are attributable to nothing more than the circumstance that the then enumeration of voters resulted in fractional remainders with respect to which the precise formula of the Tennessee Constitution was in some *336 instances slightly disregarded. Unless such de minimis departures are to be deemed of significance, these statistics certainly provide no substantiation for the charge that the 1901 apportionment was arbitrary and capricious. Indeed, they show the contrary.\n\nThus reduced to its essentials, the charge of arbitrariness and capriciousness rests entirely on the consistent refusal of the Tennessee Legislature over the past 60 years to alter a pattern of apportionment that was reasonable when conceived.\n\nA Federal District Court is asked to say that the passage of time has rendered the 1901 apportionment obsolete to the point where its continuance becomes vulnerable under the Fourteenth Amendment. But is not this matter one that involves a classic legislative judgment? Surely it lies within the province of a state legislature to conclude that an existing allocation of senators and representatives constitutes a desirable balance of geographical and demographical representation, or that in the interest of stability of government it would be best to defer for some further time the redistribution of seats in the state legislature.\n\nIndeed, I would hardly think it unconstitutional if a state legislature's expressed reason for establishing or maintaining an electoral imbalance between its rural and urban population were to protect the State's agricultural interests from the sheer weight of numbers of those residing in its cities. A State may, after all, take account of the interests of its rural population in the distribution of tax burdens, e. g., American Sugar Rfg. Co. v. Louisiana, 179 U. S. 89, and recognition of the special problems of agricultural interests has repeatedly been reflected in federal legislation, e. g., Capper-Volstead Act, 42 Stat. 388; Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 31. Even the exemption of agricultural activities from state criminal statutes of otherwise general application has not been deemed offensive to the Equal Protection Clause. *337 Tigner v. Texas, 310 U. S. 141. Does the Fourteenth Amendment impose a stricter limitation upon a State's apportionment of political representatives to its central government? I think not. These are matters of local policy, on the wisdom of which the federal judiciary is neither permitted nor qualified to sit in judgment.\n\nThe suggestion of my Brother FRANKFURTER that courts lack standards by which to decide such cases as this, is relevant not only to the question of \"justiciability,\" but also, and perhaps more fundamentally, to the determination whether any cognizable constitutional claim has been asserted in this case. Courts are unable to decide when it is that an apportionment originally valid becomes void because the factors entering into such a decision are basically matters appropriate only for legislative judgment. And so long as there exists a possible rational legislative policy for retaining an existing apportionment, such a legislative decision cannot be said to breach the bulwark against arbitrariness and caprice that the Fourteenth Amendment affords. Certainly, with all due respect, the facile arithmetical argument contained in Part II of my Brother CLARK'S separate opinion (ante, pp. 253-258) provides no tenable basis for considering that there has been such a breach in this instance. (See the Appendix to this opinion.)\n\nThese conclusions can hardly be escaped by suggesting that capricious state action might be found were it to appear that a majority of the Tennessee legislators, in refusing to consider reapportionment, had been actuated by self-interest in perpetuating their own political offices or by other unworthy or improper motives. Since Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, was decided many years ago, it has repeatedly been pointed out that it is not the business of the federal courts to inquire into the personal motives of legislators. E. g., Arizona v. California, 283 U. S. 423, 455 & n. 7. The function of the federal judiciary ends in *338 matters of this kind once it appears, as I think it does here on the undisputed facts, that the state action complained of could have rested on some rational basis. (See the Appendix to this opinion.)\n\nIt is my view that the majority opinion has failed to point to any recognizable constitutional claim alleged in this complaint. Indeed, it is interesting to note that my Brother STEWART is at pains to disclaim for himself, and to point out that the majority opinion does not suggest, that the Federal Constitution requires of the States any particular kind of electoral apportionment, still less that they must accord to each voter approximately equal voting strength. Concurring opinion, ante, p. 265. But that being so, what, may it be asked, is left of this complaint? Surely the bare allegations that the existing Tennessee apportionment is \"incorrect,\" \"arbitrary,\" \"obsolete\" and \"unconstitutional\"amounting to nothing more than legal conclusionsdo not themselves save the complaint from dismissal. See Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1; Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U. S. 651. Nor do those allegations shift to the appellees the burden of proving the constitutionality of this state statute; as is so correctly emphasized by my Brother STEWART (ante, p. 266), this Court has consistently held in cases arising under the Equal Protection Clause that \" `the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it.' Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U. S. 580, 584.\" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the appellants do not suggest that they could show at a trial anything beyond the matters previously discussed in this opinion, which add up to nothing in the way of a supportable constitutional challenge against this statute. And finally, the majority's failure to come to grips with the question whether the complaint states a claim cognizable under the Federal Constitutionan issue necessarily presented by appellees' motion to dismiss *339 does not of course furnish any ground for permitting this action to go to trial.\n\nFrom a reading of the majority and concurring opinions one will not find it difficult to catch the premises that underlie this decision. The fact that the appellants have been unable to obtain political redress of their asserted grievances appears to be regarded as a matter which should lead the Court to stretch to find some basis for judicial intervention. While the Equal Protection Clause is invoked, the opinion for the Court notably eschews explaining how, consonant with past decisions, the undisputed facts in this case can be considered to show a violation of that constitutional provision. The majority seems to have accepted the argument, pressed at the bar, that if this Court merely asserts authority in this field, Tennessee and other \"malapportioning\" States will quickly respond with appropriate political action, so that this Court need not be greatly concerned about the federal courts becoming further involved in these matters. At the same time the majority has wholly failed to reckon with what the future may hold in store if this optimistic prediction is not fulfilled. Thus, what the Court is doing reflects more an adventure in judicial experimentation than a solid piece of constitutional adjudication. Whether dismissal of this case should have been for want of jurisdiction or, as is suggested in Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 682-683, for failure of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the judgment of the District Court was correct.\n\nIn conclusion, it is appropriate to say that one need not agree, as a citizen, with what Tennessee has done or failed to do, in order to deprecate, as a judge, what the majority is doing today. Those observers of the Court who see it primarily as the last refuge for the correction of all inequality or injustice, no matter what its nature or source, will no doubt applaud this decision and its break *340 with the past. Those who consider that continuing national respect for the Court's authority depends in large measure upon its wise exercise of self-restraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication, will view the decision with deep concern.\n\nI would affirm.APPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE HARLAN.THE INADEQUACY OF ARITHMETICAL FORMULAS AS MEASURES OF THE RATIONALITY OF TENNESSEE'S APPORTIONMENT.Two of the three separate concurring opinions appear to concede that the Equal Protection Clause does not guarantee to each state voter a vote of approximately equal weight for the State Legislature. Whether the existing Tennessee apportionment is constitutional is recognized to depend only on whether it can find \"any possible justification in rationality\" (ante, p. 265); it is to be struck down only if \"the discrimination here does not fit any pattern\" (ante, p. 258).\n\nOne of the concurring opinions, that of my Brother STEWART, suggests no reasons which would justify a finding that the present distribution of state legislators is unconstitutionally arbitrary. The same is true of the majority opinion. My Brother CLARK, on the other hand, concludes that \"the apportionment picture in Tennessee is a topsy-turvical of gigantic proportions\" (ante, p. 254), solely on the basis of certain statistics presented in the text of his separate opinion and included in a more extensive Table appended thereto. In my view, that analysis is defective not only because the \"total representation\" formula set out in footnote 7 of the opinion (ante, p. 255), rests on faulty mathematical foundations, but, more basically, because the approach taken wholly *341 ignores all other factors justifying a legislative determination of the sort involved in devising a proper apportionment for a State Legislature.\n\nIn failing to take any of such other matters into account and in focusing on a particular mathematical formula which, as will be shown, is patently unsound, my Brother CLARK'S opinion has, I submit, unwittingly served to bring into bas-relief the very reasons that support the view that this complaint does not state a claim on which relief could be granted. For in order to warrant holding a state electoral apportionment invalid under the Equal Protection Clause, a court, in line with well-established constitutional doctrine, must find that none of the permissible policies and none of the possible formulas on which it might have been based could rationally justify particular inequalities.I.At the outset, it cannot be denied that the apportionment rules explicitly set out in the Tennessee Constitution are rational. These rules are based on the following obviously permissible policy determinations: (1) to utilize counties as electoral units; (2) to prohibit the division of any county in the composition of electoral districts; (3) to allot to each county that has a substantial voting populationat least two-thirds of the average voting population per countya separate \"direct representative\"; (4) to create \"floterial\" districts (multicounty representative districts) made up of more than one county; and (5) to require that such districts be composed of adjoining counties.[1] Such a framework unavoidably *342 leads to unreliable arithmetic inequalities under any mathematical formula whereby the counties' \"total representation\" is sought to be measured. It particularly results in egregiously deceptive disparities if the formula proposed in my Brother CLARK'S opinion is applied.\n\nThat formula computes a county's \"total representation\" by adding (1) the number of \"direct representatives\" the county is entitled to elect; (2) a fraction of any other seats in the Tennessee House which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a \"floterial district\"; (3) triple the number of senators the county is entitled to elect alone; and (4) triple a fraction of any seats in the Tennessee Senate which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a multicounty senatorial district. The fractions used for items (2) and (4) are computed by allotting to each county in a combined district an equal share of the House or Senate seat, regardless of the voting population of each of the counties that make up the election district.[2]\n*343 This formula is patently deficient in that it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district. As a result, the formula unrealistically assigns to Moore County one-third of a senator, in addition to its direct representative (ante, p. 255), although it must be obvious that Moore's voting strength in the Eighteenth Senatorial District is almost negligible. Since Moore County could cast only 2,340 votes of a total eligible vote of 30,478 in the senatorial district, it should in truth be considered as represented by one-fifteenth of a senator. Assuming, arguendo, that any \"total representation\" figure is of significance, Moore's \"total representation\" should be 1.23, not 2.[3]\n\nThe formula suggested by my Brother CLARK must be adjusted regardless whether one thinks, as I assuredly do not, that the Federal Constitution requires that each vote be given equal weight. The correction is necessary simply to reflect the real facts of political life. It may, of course, be true that the floterial representative's \"function *344 is to represent the whole district\" (ante, p. 256). But can it be gainsaid that so long as elections within the district are decided not by a county-unit system, in which each county casts one vote, but by adding the total number of individual votes cast for each candidate, the concern of the elected representatives will primarily be with the most populous counties in the district?II.I do not mean to suggest that any mathematical formula, albeit an \"adjusted\" one, would be a proper touchstone to measure the rationality of the present or of appellants' proposed apportionment plan. For, as the Table appended to my Brother CLARK'S opinion so conclusively shows, whether one applies the formula he suggests or one that is adjusted to reflect proportional voting strength within an election district, no plan of apportionment consistent with the principal policies of the Tennessee Constitution could provide proportionately equal \"total representation\" for each of Tennessee's 95 counties.\n\nThe pattern suggested by the appellants in Exhibits \"A\" and \"B\" attached to their complaint is said to be a \"fair distribution\" which accords with the Tennessee Constitution, and under which each of the election districts represents approximately equal voting population. But even when tested by the \"adjusted\" formula, the plan reveals gross \"total representation\" disparities that would make it appear to be a \"crazy quilt.\" For example, Loudon County, with twice the voting population of Humphreys County would have less representation than Humphreys, and about one-third the representation of Warren County, which has only 73 more voters. Among the more populous counties, similar discrepancies would appear. Although Anderson County has only somewhat over 10% more voters than Blount County, it would have *345 approximately 75% more representation. And Blount would have approximately two-thirds the representation of Montgomery County, which has about 13% less voters.[4]III.The fault with a purely statistical approach to the case at hand lies not with the particular mathematical formula used, but in the failure to take account of the fact that a multitude of legitimate legislative policies, along with circumstances of geography and demography, could account for the seeming electoral disparities among counties. The principles set out in the Tennessee Constitution are just some of those that were deemed significant. Others may have been considered and accepted by those entrusted with the responsibility for Tennessee's apportionment. And for the purposes of judging constitutionality under the Equal Protection Clause it must be remembered that what is controlling on the issue of \"rationality\" is not what the State Legislature may actually have considered but what it may be deemed to have considered.\n\nFor example, in the list of \"horribles\" cited by my Brother CLARK (ante, p. 255), all the \"underrepresented\" counties are semiurban: all contain municipalities of over 10,000 population.[5] This is not to say, however, that the *346 presence of any such municipality within a county necessarily demands that its proportional representation be reduced in order to render it consistent with an \"urban versus rural\" plan of apportionment. Other considerations may intervene and outweigh the Legislature's desire to distribute seats so as to achieve a proper balance between urban and rural interests. The size of a county, in terms of its total area, may be a factor.[6] Or the location within a county of some major industry may be thought to call for dilution of voting strength.[7] Again, the combination of certain smaller counties with their more heavily populated neighbors in senatorial or \"floterial\" districts may result in apparent arithmetic inequalities.[8]\n\nMore broadly, the disparities in electoral strength among the various counties in Tennessee, both those relied upon by my Brother CLARK and others, may be *347 accounted for by various economic,[9] political,[10] and geographic[11] considerations. No allegation is made by the appellants that the existing apportionment is the result of any other forces than are always at work in any legislative process; and the record, briefs, and arguments in this Court themselves attest to the fact that the appellants could put forward nothing further at a trial.\n\nBy disregarding the wide variety of permissible legislative considerations that may enter into a state electoral apportionment my Brother CLARK has turned a highly complex process into an elementary arithmetical puzzle. *348 It is only by blinking reality that such an analysis can stand and that the essentially legislative determination can be made the subject of judicial inquiry.IV.Apart from such policies as those suggested which would suffice to justify particular inequalities, there is a further consideration which could rationally have led the Tennessee Legislature, in the exercise of a deliberate choice, to maintain the status quo. Rigidity of an apportionment pattern may be as much a legislative policy decision as is a provision for periodic reapportionment. In the interest of stability, a State may write into its fundamental law a permanent distribution of legislators among its various election districts, thus forever ignoring shifts in population. Indeed, several States have achieved this result by providing for minimum and maximum representation from various political subdivisions such as counties, districts, cities, or towns. See Harvey, Reapportionments of State Legislatures Legal Requirements, 17 Law & Contemp. Probs. (1952), 364, 368-372.\n\nIt is said that one cannot find any rational standard in what the Tennessee Legislature has failed to do over the past 60 years. But surely one need not search far to find rationality in the Legislature's continued refusal to recognize the growth of the urban population that has accompanied the development of industry over the past half decade. The existence of slight disparities between rural areas does not overcome the fact that the foremost apparent legislative motivation has been to preserve the electoral strength of the rural interests notwithstanding shifts in population. And I understand it to be conceded by at least some of the majority that this policy is not *349 rendered unconstitutional merely because it favors rural voters.\n\nOnce the electoral apportionment process is recognized for what it isthe product of legislative give-and-take and of compromise among policies that often conflict the relevant constitutional principles at once put these appellants out of the federal courts.NOTES[1]  Public Acts of Tennessee, c. 122 (1901), now Tenn. Code Ann.  3-101 to 3-107. The full text of the 1901 Act as amended appears in an Appendix to this opinion, post, p. 237.\n\n[2]  The three-judge court was convened pursuant to the order of a single district judge, who, after he had reviewed certain decisions of this Court and found them distinguishable in features \"that may ultimately prove to be significant,\" held that the complaint was not so obviously without merit that he would be justified in refusing to convene a three-judge court. 175 F. Supp. 649, 652.\n\n[3]  We heard argument first at the 1960 Term and again at this Term when the case was set over for reargument. 366 U. S. 907.\n\n[4]  A county having less than, but at least two-thirds of, the population required to choose a Representative is allocated one Representative. See also Tenn. Const., Art. II,  6. A common and much more substantial departure from the number-of-voters or total-population standard is the guaranty of at least one seat to each county. See, e. g., Kansas Const., Art. 2,  2; N. J. Const., Art. 4,  3,  1.\n\nWhile the Tennessee Constitution speaks of the number of \"qualified voters,\" the exhibits attached to the complaint use figures based on the number of persons 21 years of age and over. This basis seems to have been employed by the General Assembly in apportioning legislative seats from the outset. The 1870 statute providing for the first enumeration, Acts of 1870 (1st Sess.), c. 107, directed the courts of the several counties to select a Commissioner to enumerate \"all the male inhabitants of their respective counties, who are twenty-one years of age and upward, who shall be resident citizens of their counties on the first day of January, 1871 . . . .\" Reports compiled in the several counties on this basis were submitted to the General Assembly by the Secretary of State and were used in the first apportionment. Appendix to Tenn. S. J., 1871, 41-43. Yet such figures would not reflect the numbers of persons qualified to exercise the franchise under the then-governing qualifications: (a) citizenship; (b) residence in the State 12 months, and in the county 6 months; (c) payment of poll taxes for the preceding year unless entitled to exemption. Acts of 1870 (2d Sess.), c. 10. (These qualifications continued at least until after 1901. See Shan. Tenn. Code Ann.,  1167, 1220 (1896; Supp. 1904).) Still, when the General Assembly directed the Secretary of State to do all he could to obtain complete reports from the counties, the Resolution spoke broadly of \"the impossibility of . . . [redistricting] without the census returns of the voting population from each county . . . .\" Tenn. S. J., 1871, 46-47, 96. The figures also showed a correlation with Federal Census figures for 1870. The Census reported 259,016 male citizens 21 and upward in Tennessee. Ninth Census of the United States, 1870, Statistics of the Population 635 (1872). The Tennessee Secretary of State's Report, with 15 counties not reported, gave a figure of 237,431. Using the numbers of actual votes in the last gubernatorial election for those 15 counties, the Secretary arrived at a total of 250,025. Appendix to Tenn. S. J., 1871, 41-43. This and subsequent history indicate continued reference to Census figures and finally in 1901, abandonment of a state enumeration in favor of the use of Census figures. See notes 7, 8, 9, infra. See also Williams, Legislative Apportionment in Tennessee, 20 Tenn. L. Rev. 235, 236, n. 6.

J., 1959, 909-930; and \"A Documented Survey of Legislative Apportionment in Tennessee, 1870-1957,\" which is attached as exhibit 2 to the intervening complaint of Mayor West of Nashville, both prepared by the Tennessee State Historian, Dr. Robert H. White. Examples of preliminary steps are: In 1911, the Senate called upon the Redistricting Committee to make an enumeration of qualified voters and to use the Federal Census of 1910 as the basis. Acts of 1911, S. J. Res. No. 60, p. 315. Similarly, in 1961, the Senate called for appointment of a select committee to make an enumeration of qualified voters. Acts of 1961, S. J. Res. No. 47. In 1955, the Senate called for a study of reapportionment. Tenn. S. J., 1955, 224; but see id., at 1403. Similarly, in 1961, the House directed the State Legislative Council to study methods of reapportionment. Acts of 1961, H. J. Res. No. 65.\n\n[11]  Twelfth Census of the United States, 1900, Population (Part 1) 39 (1901); (Part 2) 202 (1902).\n\n[12]  United States Census of Population: 1960, General Population CharacteristicsTennessee, Table 16 (1961).\n\n[13]  In the words of one of the intervening complaints, the apportionment was \"wholly arbitrary, . . . and, indeed, based upon no lawfully pertinent factor whatever.\"\n\n[14]  The appellants claim that no General Assembly constituted according to the 1901 Act will submit reapportionment proposals either to the people or to a Constitutional Convention. There is no provision for popular initiative in Tennessee. Amendments proposed in the Senate or House must first be approved by a majority of all members of each House and again by two-thirds of the members in the General Assembly next chosen. The proposals are then submitted to the people at the next general election in which a Governor is to be chosen. Alternatively, the legislature may submit to the people at any general election the question of calling a convention to consider specified proposals. Such as are adopted at a convention do not, however, become effective unless approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting separately on each proposed change or amendment at an election fixed by the convention. Conventions shall not be held oftener than once in six years. Tenn. Const., Art. XI,  3. Acts of 1951, c. 130,  3, and Acts of 1957, c. 340,  3, provided that delegates to the 1953 and 1959 conventions were to be chosen from the counties and floterial districts just as are members of the State House of Representatives. The General Assembly's call for a 1953 Constitutional Convention originally contained a provision \"relating to the appointment [sic] of representatives and senators\" but this was excised. Tenn. H. J., 1951, 784. A Resolution introduced at the 1959 Constitutional Convention and reported unfavorably by the Rules Committee of the Convention was as follows:\n\n\"By Mr. Chambliss (of Hamilton County), Resolution No. 12 Relative to Convention considering reapportionment, which is as follows:\n\n\"WHEREAS, there is a rumor that this Limited Convention has been called for the purpose of postponing for six years a Convention that would make a decision as to reapportionment; and\n\n\"WHEREAS, there is pending in the United States Courts in Tennessee a suit under which parties are seeking, through decree, to compel reapportionment; and\n\n\"WHEREAS, it is said that this Limited Convention, which was called for limited consideration, is yet a Constitutional Convention within the language of the Constitution as to Constitutional Conventions, forbidding frequent Conventions in the last sentence of Article Eleven, Section 3, second paragraph, more often than each six years, to-wit:\n\n\"`No such Convention shall be held oftener than once in six years.'\n\n\"NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That it is the consensus of opinion of the members of this Convention that since this is a Limited Convention as hereinbefore set forth another Convention could be had if it did not deal with the matters submitted to this Limited Convention.\n\n\"BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That it is the consensus of opinion of this Convention that a Convention should be called by the General Assembly for the purpose of considering reapportionment in order that a possibility of Court enforcement being forced on the Sovereign State of Tennessee by the Courts of the National Government may be avoided.\n\n\"BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this Convention be adjourned for two years to meet again at the same time set forth in the statute providing for this Convention, and that it is the consensus of opinion of this body that it is within the power of the next General Assembly of Tennessee to broaden the powers of this Convention and to authorize and empower this Convention to consider a proper amendment to the Constitution that will provide, when submitted to the electorate, a method of reapportionment.\" Tenn. Constitutional Convention of 1959, The Journal and Debates, 35, 278.\n\n[15]  It is clear that appellants' federal constitutional claims rest exclusively on alleged violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their primary claim is that the 1901 statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of that amendment. There are allegations invoking the Due Process Clause but from the argument and the exhibits it appears that the Due Process Clause argument is directed at certain tax statutes. Insofar as the claim involves the validity of those statutes under the Due Process Clause we find it unnecessary to decide its merits. And if the allegations regarding the tax statutes are designed as the framework for proofs as to the effects of the allegedly discriminatory apportionment, we need not rely upon them to support our holding that the complaint states a federal constitutional claim of violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Whether, when the issue to be decided is one of the constitutional adequacy of this particular apportionment, taxation arguments and exhibits as now presented add anything, or whether they could add anything however presented, is for the District Court in the first instance to decide.\n\nThe complaint, in addition to the claims under the Federal Constitution, also alleges rights, and the General Assembly's duties, under the Tennessee Constitution. Since we hold that appellants haveif it develops at trial that the facts support the allegationsa cognizable federal constitutional cause of action resting in no degree on rights guaranteed or putatively guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution, we do not consider, let alone enforce, rights under a State Constitution which go further than the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment. Lastly, we need not assess the legal significance, in reaching our conclusion, of the statements of the complaint that the apportionment effected today under the 1901 Act is \"contrary to the philosophy of government in the United States and all Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence . . . .\"\n\n[16]  We need not reach the question of indispensable parties because the District Court has not yet decided it.\n\n[17]  The accuracy of calling even such dismissals \"jurisdictional\" was questioned in Bell v. Hood. See 327 U. S., at 683.\n\n[18]  42 U. S. C.  1983 provides: \"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\"\n\n[19]  This Court has frequently sustained District Court jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3) or its predecessors to entertain suits to redress deprivations of rights secured against state infringement by the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Douglas v. Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157; Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117; cf. Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536; Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167; Egan v. Aurora, 365 U. S. 514.\n\n[20]  Since that case was not brought to the Court until after the election had been held, the Court cited not only Wood v. Broom, but also directed dismissal for mootness, citing Brownlow v. Schwartz, 261 U. S. 216.\n\n[21]  Compare Boeing Aircraft Co. v. King County, 330 U. S. 803 (\"the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction\"). See Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 440.\n\n[22]  Matthews did affirm a judgment that may be read as a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, 179 F. Supp. 470. However, the motion to affirm also rested on the ground of failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Cf. text following, on MacDougall v. Green. And see text, infra, p. 236.\n\n[23]  The Mayor of Nashville suing \"on behalf of himself and all residents of the City of Nashville, Davidson County, . . .\" and the Cities of Chattanooga (Hamilton County) and Knoxville (Knox County), each suing on behalf of its residents, were permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff. Since they press the same claims as do the initial plaintiffs, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the intervenors would have standing to maintain this action in their asserted representative capacities.\n\n[24]  The complaint also contains an averment that the appellants sue \"on their own behalf and on behalf of all other voters in the State of Tennessee.\" (Emphasis added.) This may be read to assert a claim that voters in counties allegedly over-represented in the General Assembly also have standing to complain. But it is not necessary to decide that question in this case.\n\n[25]  The duties of the respective appellees are alleged to be as follows:\n\n\"Defendant, Joe C. Carr, is the duly elected, qualified and acting Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville in said State, and as such he is charged with the duty of furnishing blanks, envelopes and information slips to the County Election Commissioners, certifying the results of elections and maintaining the records thereof; and he is further ex officio charged, together with the Governor and the Attorney General, with the duty of examining the election returns received from the County Election Commissioners and declaring the election results, by the applicable provisions of the Tennessee Code Annotated, and by Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1949, inter alia.\n\n\"Defendant, George F. McCanless, is the duly appointed and acting Attorney General of the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville in said State, and is charged with the duty of advising the officers of the State upon the law, and is made by Section 23-1107 of the Tennessee Code Annotated a necessary party defendant in any declaratory judgment action where the constitutionality of statutes of the State of Tennessee is attacked, and he is ex-officio charged, together with the Governor and the Secretary of State, with the duty of declaring the election results, under Section 2-140 of the Tennessee Code Annotated.\n\n\"Defendant, Jerry McDonald, is the duly appointed Coordinator of Elections in the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville, Tennessee, and as such official, is charged with the duties set forth in the public law enacted by the 1959 General Assembly of Tennessee creating said office.\n\n\"Defendant, Dr. Sam Coward, James Alexander, and Hubert Brooks are the duly appointed and qualified members constituting the State Board of Elections, and as such they are charged with the duty of appointing the Election Commissioners for all the counties of the State of Tennessee, the organization and supervision of the biennial elections as provided by the Statutes of Tennessee, Chapter 9 of Title 2 of the Tennessee Code Annotated, Sections 2-901, et seq.\n\n\"That this action is brought against the aforenamed defendants in their representative capacities, and that said Election Commissioners are sued also as representatives of all of the County Election Commissioners in the State of Tennessee, such persons being so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the court; that there is a common question of law involved, namely, the constitutionality of Tennessee laws set forth in the Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 3-101 through Section 3-109, inclusive; that common relief is sought against all members of said Election Commissions in their official capacities, it being the duties of the aforesaid County Election Commissioners, within their respective jurisdictions, to appoint the judges of elections, to maintain the registry of qualified voters of said County, certify the results of elections held in said County to the defendants State Board of Elections and Secretary of State, and of preparing ballots and taking other steps to prepare for and hold elections in said Counties by virtue of Sections 2-1201, et seq. of Tennessee Code Annotated, and Section 2-301, et seq. of Tennessee Code Annotated, and Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1949, inter alia.\"\n\nThe question whether the named defendants are sufficient parties remains open for consideration on remand.\n\n[26]  Smiley v. Holm, supra, at 361 (\" `citizen, elector and taxpayer' of the State\"); Koenig v. Flynn, supra, at 379 (\" `citizens and voters' of the State\") Wood v. Broom, supra, at 4 (\"citizen of Mississippi, a qualified elector under its laws, and also qualified to be a candidate for election as representative in Congress\"); cf. Carroll v. Becker, supra (candidate for office).\n\n[27]  Mr. Justice Rutledge was of the view that any question of standing was settled in Smiley v. Holm, supra; MR. JUSTICE BLACK stated \"that appellants had standing to sue, since the facts alleged show that they have been injured as individuals.\" He relied on Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 438, 467. See 328 U. S. 564, 568.\n\nCommentators have suggested that the following statement in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion might imply a view that appellants there had no standing: \"This is not an action to recover for damage because of the discriminatory exclusion of a plaintiff from rights enjoyed by other citizens. The basis for the suit is not a private wrong, but a wrong suffered by Illinois as a polity.\" 328 U. S., at 552. See Jaffe, Standing to Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 1265, 1298 (1961); Lewis, Legislative Apportionment and the Federal Courts, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 1057, 1081-1083 (1958). But since the opinion goes on to consider the merits, it seems that this statement was not intended to intimate any view that the plaintiffs in that action lacked standing. Nor do the cases cited immediately after the above quotation deal with standing. See especially Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268, 272-273.\n\n[28]  MacDougall v.

Braden, 16 How. 635, 657.\n\n[43]  This case, so frequently cited for the broad proposition that the status of an Indian tribe is a matter for the political departments, is in fact a noteworthy example of the limited and precise impact of a political question. The Cherokees brought an original suit in this Court to enjoin Georgia's assertion of jurisdiction over Cherokee territory and abolition of Cherokee government and laws. Unquestionably the case lay at the vortex of most fiery political embroilment. See 1 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 729-779. But in spite of some broader language in separate opinions, all that the Court held was that it possessed no original jurisdiction over the suit: for the Cherokees could in no view be considered either a State of this Union or a \"foreign state.\" Chief Justice Marshall treated the question as one of de novo interpretation of words in the Constitution. The Chief Justice did say that \"The acts of our government plainly recognize the Cherokee nation as a state, and the courts are bound by those acts,\" but here he referred to their existence \"as a state, as a distinct political society, separated from others . . . .\" From there he went to \"A question of much more difficulty . . . . Do the Cherokees constitute a foreign state in the sense of the constitution?\" Id., at 16. Thus, while the Court referred to \"the political\" for the decision whether the tribe was an entity, a separate polity, it held that whether being an entity the tribe had such status as to be entitled to sue originally was a judicially soluble issue: criteria were discoverable in relevant phrases of the Constitution and in the common understanding of the times. As to this issue, the Court was not hampered by problems of the management of unusual evidence or of possible interference with a congressional program. Moreover, Chief Justice Marshall's dictum that \"It savours too much of the exercise of political power to be within the proper province of the judicial department,\" id., at 20, was not addressed to the issue of the Cherokees' status to sue, but rather to the breadth of the claim asserted and the impropriety of the relief sought. Compare Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 77. The Chief Justice made clear that if the issue of the Cherokees' rights arose in a customary legal context, \"a proper case with proper parties,\" it would be justiciable. Thus, when the same dispute produced a case properly brought, in which the right asserted was one of protection under federal treaties and laws from conflicting state law, and the relief sought was the voiding of a conviction under that state law, the Court did void the conviction. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515. There, the fact that the tribe was a separate polity served as a datum contributing to the result, and despite the consequences in a heated federal-state controversy and the opposition of the other branches of the National Government, the judicial power acted to reverse the State Supreme Court. An example of similar isolation of a political question in the decision of a case is Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, see infra.\n\n[44]  7 How., at 29. And see 11 The Writings and Speeches of Daniel Webster 217 (1903).\n\n[45]  See Mowry, The Dorr War (1901), and its exhaustive bibliography. And for an account of circumstances surrounding the decicion here, see 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 185-195.\n\nDorr himself, head of one of the two groups and held in a Rhode Island jail under a conviction for treason, had earlier sought a decision from the Supreme Court that his was the lawful government. His application for original habeas corpus in the Supreme Court was denied because the federal courts then lacked authority to issue habeas for a prisoner held under a state court sentence. Ex parte Dorr, 3 How. 103.\n\n[46]  7 How., at 39.\n\n[47]  Id., at 39, 40.\n\n[48]  Even though the Court wrote of unrestrained legislative and executive authority under this Guaranty, thus making its enforcement a political question, the Court plainly implied that the political question barrier was no absolute: \"Unquestionably a military government, established as the permanent government of the State, would not be a republican government, and it would be the duty of Congress to overthrow it.\" 7 How., at 45. Of course, it does not necessarily follow that if Congress did not act, the Court would. For while the judiciary might be able to decide the limits of the meaning of \"republican form,\" and thus the factor of lack of criteria might fall away, there would remain other possible barriers to decision because of primary commitment to another branch, which would have to be considered in the particular fact setting presented.\n\nThat was not the only occasion on which this Court indicated that lack of criteria does not obliterate the Guaranty's extreme limits: \"The guaranty is of a republican form of government. No particular government is designated as republican, neither is the exact form to be guaranteed, in any manner especially designated. Here, as in other parts of the instrument, we are compelled to resort elsewhere to ascertain what was intended.\n\n\"The guaranty necessarily implies a duty on the part of the States themselves to provide such a government. All the States had governments when the Constitution was adopted. In all the people participated to some extent, through their representatives elected in the manner specially provided. These governments the Constitution did not change. They were accepted precisely as they were, and it is, therefore, to be presumed that they were such as it was the duty of the States to provide. Thus we have unmistakable evidence of what was republican in form, within the meaning of that term as employed in the Constitution.\" Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 175-176. There, the question was whether a government republican in form could deny the vote to women.\n\nIn re Duncan, 139 U. S. 449, upheld a murder conviction against a claim that the relevant codes had been invalidly enacted. The Court there said:\n\n\"By the Constitution, a republican form of government is guaranteed to every State in the Union, and the distinguishing feature of that form is the right of the people to choose their own officers for governmental administration, and pass their own laws in virtue of the legislative power reposed in representative bodies, whose legitimate acts may be said to be those of the people themselves; but, while the people are thus the source of political power, their governments, National and State, have been limited by written constitutions, and they have themselves thereby set bounds to their own power, as against the sudden impulses of mere majorities.\" 139 U. S., at 461. But the Court did not find any of these fundamental principles violated.\n\n[49]  But cf. Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), 253 U. S. 221; National Prohibition Cases, 253 U. S. 350.\n\n[50]  6 Wall., at 65, 66.\n\n[51]  The First Reconstruction Act opened: \"Whereas no legal State governments . . . now exists [sic] in the rebel States of . . . Georgia [and] Mississippi . . . ; and whereas it is necessary that peace and good order should be enforced in said States until loyal and republican State governments can be legally established: . . .\" 14 Stat. 428. And see 15 Stat. 2, 14.\n\n[52]  In Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, the State sought to enjoin the President from executing the Acts, alleging that his role was purely ministerial. The Court held that the duties were in no sense ministerial, and that although the State sought to compel inaction rather than action, the absolute lack of precedent for any such distinction left the case one in which \"general principles . . . forbid judicial interference with the exercise of Executive discretion.\" 4 Wall., at 499. See also Mississippi v. Stanton, 154 U. S. 554; and see 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 463.\n\nFor another instance of congressional action challenged as transgressing the Guaranty Clause, see The Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 125-126, overruled, Graves v. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466.\n\n[53]  On the other hand, the implication of the Guaranty Clause in a case concerning congressional action does not always preclude judicial action. It has been held that the clause gives Congress no power to impose restrictions upon a State's admission which would undercut the constitutional mandate that the State be on an equal footing. Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559. And in Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, although Congress had determined that the State's government was not republican in form, the State's standing to bring an original action in this Court was sustained.\n\n[54]  See, infra, p. 235, considering Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920.\n\n[55]  Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U. S. 135, 183 (Field, J., dissenting).\n\n[56]  Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 270 F. 2d 594, relying upon, inter alia, Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161.\n\n[57]  The Court's opinion was joined by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, noting his adherence to the dissents in Colegrove and South v. Peters, supra; and the judgment was concurred in by MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, who wrote that the decision should rest on the Equal Protection Clause rather than on the Fifteenth Amendment, since there had been not solely a denial of the vote (if there had been that at all) but also a \"fencing out\" of a racial group.\n\n[58]  No holding to the contrary is to be found in Cave v. Newell, 246 U. S. 650, dismissing a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Missouri, 272 Mo. 653, 199 S. W. 1014; or in Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1.\n\n[59]  The ground of Mr. Justice Rutledge's vote to affirm is further explained in his footnote 3, 328 U. S., at 566: \" `The power of a court of equity to act is a discretionary one. . . . Where a federal court of equity is asked to interfere with the enforcement of state laws, it should do so only \"to prevent irreparable injury which is clear and imminent.\" ' American Federation of Labor v. Watson, 327 U. S. 582, 593 and cases cited.\"\n\nNo constitutional questions, including the question whether voters have a judicially enforceable constitutional right to vote at elections of congressmen from districts of equal population, were decided in Colegrove. Six of the participating Justices reached the questions but divided three to three on their merits. Mr. Justice Rutledge believed that it was not necessary to decide them. He said: \"There is [an alternative to constitutional decision] in this case. And I think the gravity of the constitutional questions raised so great, together with the possibilities for collision [with the political departments of the Government], that the admonition [against avoidable constitutional decision] is appropriate to be followed here. Other reasons support this view, including the fact that, in my opinion, the basic ruling and less important ones in Smiley v. Holm, supra, would otherwise be brought into question.\" 328 U. S., at 564-565. He also joined with his brethren who shared his view that the issues were justiciable in considering that Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1, decided no constitutional questions but \"the Court disposed of the cause on the ground that the 1929 Reapportionment Act, 46 Stat. 21, did not carry forward the requirements of the 1911 Act, 37 Stat. 13, and declined to decide whether there was equity in the bill.\" 328 U. S., at 565; see also, id., at 573. We agree with this view of Wood v. Broom.\n\n[60]  See also Buford v. State Board of Elections, 206 Tenn. 480, 334 S. W. 2d 726; State ex rel. Sanborn v. Davidson County Board of Election Comm'rs, No. 36,391 Tenn. Sup. Ct., Oct. 29, 1954 (unreported); 8 Vand. L. Rev. 501 (1955).DOUGLAS CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES[1]  I feel strongly that many of the cases cited by the Court and involving so-called \"political\" questions were wrongly decided.\n\nIn joining the opinion, I do not approve those decisions but only construe the Court's opinion in this case as stating an accurate historical account of what the prior cases have held.\n\n[2]  The statements in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 42, that this guaranty is enforceable only by Congress or the Chief Executive is not maintainable. Of course the Chief Executive, not the Court, determines how a State will be protected against invasion. Of course each House of Congress, not the Court, is \"the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members.\" Article I, Section 5, Clause 1. But the abdication of all judicial functions respecting voting rights (7 How., at 41), however justified by the peculiarities of the charter form of government in Rhode Island at the time of Dorr's Rebellion, states no general principle. It indeed is contrary to the cases discussed in the body of this opinionthe modern decisions of the Court that give the full panoply of judicial protection to voting rights. Today we would not say with Chief Justice Taney that it is no part of the judicial function to protect the right to vote of those \"to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State.\" Ibid.\n\nMoreover, the Court's refusal to examine the legality of the regime of martial law which had been laid upon Rhode Island (id., at 45-46) is indefensible, as Mr. Justice Woodbury maintained in his dissent. Id., at 59 et seq. Today we would ask with him: \". . . who could hold for a moment, when the writ of habeas corpus cannot be suspended by the legislature itself, either in the general government or most of the States, without an express constitutional permission, that all other writs and laws could be suspended, and martial law substituted for them over the whole State or country, without any express constitutional license to that effect, in any emergency?\" Id., at 67.\n\nJustice Woodbury went on to say:\n\n\"It would be alarming enough to sanction here an unlimited power, exercised either by legislatures, or the executive, or courts, when all our governments are themselves governments of limitations and checks, and of fixed and known laws, and the people a race above all others jealous of encroachments by those in power. And it is far better that those persons should be without the protection of the ordinary laws of the land who disregard them in an emergency, and should look to a grateful country for indemnity and pardon, than to allow, beforehand, the whole frame of jurisprudence to be overturned, and every thing placed at the mercy of the bayonet.\n\n\"No tribunal or department in our system of governments ever can be lawfully authorized to dispense with the laws, like some of the tyrannical Stuarts, or to repeal, or abolish, or suspend the whole body of them; or, in other words, appoint an unrestrained military dictator at the head of armed men.\n\n\"Whatever stretches of such power may be ventured on in great crises, they cannot be upheld by the laws, as they prostrate the laws and ride triumphant over and beyond them, however the Assembly of Rhode Island, under the exigency, may have hastily supposed that such a measure in this instance was constitutional. It is but a branch of the omnipotence claimed by Parliament to pass bills of attainder, belonging to the same dangerous and arbitrary family with martial law.\" Id., at 69-70.\n\nWhat he wrote was later to become the tradition, as expressed by Chief Justice Hughes in Sterling v. Constantin, 287 U. S. 378, 401: \"What are the allowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in a particular case, are judicial questions.\"\n\n[3]  The category of the \"political\" question is, in my view, narrower than the decided cases indicate. \"Even the English courts have held that a resolution of one House of Parliament does not change the law (Stockdale v. Hansard (1839), 9 A. & E. 1; and Bowles v. Bank of England (No. 2) [1913] 1 Ch. 57), and these decisions imply that the House of Commons acting alone does not constitute the `Parliament' recognized by the English courts.\" 103 Sol. Jour. 995, 996. The Court in Bowles v. Bank of England, [1913] 1 Ch. 57, 84-85, stated: \"By the statute 1 W. & M., usually known as the Bill of Rights, it was finally settled that there could be no taxation in this country except under authority of an Act of Parliament. The Bill of Rights still remains unrepealed, and no practice or custom, however prolonged, or however acquiesced in on the part of the subject, can be relied on by the Crown as justifying any infringement of its provisions. It follows that, with regard to the powers of the Crown to levy taxation, no resolution, either of the Committee for Ways and Means or of the House itself, has any legal effect whatever. Such resolutions are necessitated by a parliamentary procedure adopted with a view to the protection of the subject against the hasty imposition of taxes, and it would be strange to find them relied on as justifying the Crown in levying a tax before such tax is actually imposed by Act of Parliament.\"\n\nIn The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S. 655, the Court undertook a review of the veto provisions of the Constitution and concluded that the measure in litigation had not become a law. Cf. Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433.\n\nGeorgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, involved the application of the Reconstruction Acts to Georgialaws which destroyed by force the internal regime of that State. Yet the Court refused to take jurisdiction. That question was no more \"political\" than a host of others we have entertained. See, e. g., Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579; Alabama v. Texas, 347 U. S. 272.\n\nToday would this Court hold nonjusticiable or \"political\" a suit to enjoin a Governor who, like Fidel Castro, takes everything into his own hands and suspends all election laws?\n\nGeorgia v. Stanton, supra, expresses a philosophy at war with Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, and Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304. The dominance of the civilian authority has been expressed from the beginning. See Wise v. Withers, 3 Cranch 331, 337; Sterling v. Constantin, supra, note 2.\n\n[4]  We are told by the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers in an amicus brief:\n\n\"Regardless of the fact that in the last two decades the United States has become a predominantly urban country where well over two-thirds of the population now lives in cities or suburbs, political representation in the majority of state legislatures is 50 or more years behind the times. Apportionments made when the greater part of the population was located in rural communities are still determining and undermining our elections.\n\n\"As a consequence, the municipality of 1960 is forced to function in a horse and buggy environment where there is little political recognition of the heavy demands of an urban population. These demands will become even greater by 1970 when some 150 million people will be living in urban areas.\n\n\"The National Institute of Municipal Law Officers has for many years recognized the wide-spread complaint that by far the greatest preponderance of state representatives and senators are from rural areas which, in the main, fail to become vitally interested in the increasing difficulties now facing urban administrators.\n\n\"Since World War II, the explosion in city and suburban population has created intense local problems in education, transportation, and housing. Adequate handling of these problems has not been possible to a large extent, due chiefly to the political weakness of municipalities. This situation is directly attributable to considerable under-representation of cities in the legislatures of most states.\" Amicus brief, pp. 2-3.\n\n[5]  The recent ruling by the Iowa Supreme Court that a legislature, though elected under an unfair apportionment scheme, is nonetheless a legislature empowered to act (Cedar Rapids v. Cox, 252 Iowa 948, 964, 108 N. W. 2d 253, 262-263; cf. Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40) is plainly correct.\n\nThere need be no fear of a more disastrous collision between federal and state agencies here than where a federal court enjoins gerrymandering based on racial lines. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, supra.\n\nThe District Court need not undertake a complete reapportionment. It might possibly achieve the goal of substantial equality merely by directing respondent to eliminate the egregious injustices. Or its conclusion that reapportionment should be made may in itself stimulate legislative action. That was the result in Asbury Park Press v. Woolley, 33 N. J. 1, 161 A. 2d 705, where the state court ruled it had jurisdiction:\n\n\"If by reason of passage of time and changing conditions the reapportionment statute no longer serves its original purpose of securing to the voter the full constitutional value of his franchise, and the legislative branch fails to take appropriate restorative action, the doors of the courts must be open to him. The law-making body cannot by inaction alter the constitutional system under which it has its own existence.\" 33 N. J., at 14, 161 A. 2d, at 711. The court withheld its decision on the merits in order that the legislature might have an opportunity to consider adoption of a reapportionment act. For the sequel see Application of Lamb, 67 N. J. Super. 39, 46-47, 169 A. 2d 822, 825-826.\n\nReapportionment was also the result in Magraw v. Donovan, 159 F. Supp. 901, where a federal three-judge District Court took jurisdiction, saying, 163 F. Supp. 184, 187:\n\n\"Here it is the unmistakable duty of the State Legislature to reapportion itself periodically in accordance with recent population changes. . . . Early in January 1959 the 61st Session of the Minnesota Legislature will convene, all of the members of which will be newly elected on November 4th of this year. The facts which have been presented to us will be available to them. It is not to be presumed that the Legislature will refuse to take such action as is necessary to comply with its duty under the State Constitution. We defer decision on all the issues presented (including that of the power of this Court to grant relief), in order to afford the Legislature full opportunity to `heed the constitutional mandate to redistrict.' \"\n\nSee 177 F. Supp. 803, where the case was dismissed as moot, the State Legislature having acted.CLARK CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES[1]  The opinion stated at 551 that the Court \"could also dispose of this case on the authority of Wood v. Broom [287 U. S. 1 (1932)].\" Wood v. Broom involved only the interpretation of a congressional reapportionment Act.\n\n[2]  Similarly, the Equal Protection Clause was not invoked in Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940 (1950).\n\n[3]  I do not read the later case of Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804 (1947), as having rejected the equal protection argument adopted here. That was merely a dismissal of an appeal where the equal protection point was mentioned along with attacks under three other constitutional provisions, two congressional Acts, and three state constitutional provisions.\n\n[4]  Georgia based its election system on a consistent combination of political units and population, giving six unit votes to the eight most populous counties, four unit votes to the 30 counties next in population, and two unit votes to each of the remaining counties.\n\n[5]  See Part I of the Appendix to MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S dissent, post, p. 341.\n\n[6]  It is suggested that the districting is not unconstitutional since it was established by a statute that was constitutional when passed some 60 years ago. But many Assembly Sessions since that time have deliberately refused to change the original act, and in any event \"[a] statute [constitutionally] valid when enacted may become invalid by change in the conditions to which it is applied.\" Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Walters, 294 U. S. 405, 415 (1935).\n\n[7]  \"Total representation\" indicates the combined representation in the State Senate (33 members) and the State House of Representatives (99 members) in the Assembly of Tennessee. Assuming a county has one representative, it is credited in this calculation with 1/99. Likewise, if the same county has one-third of a senate seat, it is credited with another 1/99, and thus such a county, in our calculation, would have a \"total representation\" of two; if a county has one representative and one-sixth of a senate seat, it is credited with 1.5/99, or 1.50. It is this last figure that I use here in an effort to make the comparisons clear. The 1950 rather than the 1960 census of voting population is used to avoid the charge that use of 1960 tabulations might not have allowed sufficient time for the State to act. However, the 1960 picture is even more irrational than the 1950 one.\n\n[8]  Of course this was not the case in the Georgia county unit system, South v. Peters, supra, or the Illinois initiative plan, MacDougall v. Green, supra, where recognized political units having independent significance were given minimum political weight.\n\n[9]  It is interesting to note that state judges often rest their decisions on the ground that this Court has precluded adjudication of the federal claim. See, e. g., Scholle v. Secretary of State, 360 Mich. 1, 104 N. W. 2d 63 (1960).\n\n[10]  1 Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, 124.\n\n[11]  Kant, Perpetual Peace.\n\n[*]  It is worth reminding that the problem of legislative apportionment is not one dividing North and South. Indeed, in the present House of Representatives, for example, Michigan's congressional districts are far less representative of the numbers of inhabitants, according to the 1960 census, than are Louisiana's. Michigan's Sixteenth District, which is 93.1% urban, contains 802,994 persons and its Twelfth, which is 47.6% urban, contains 177,431one-fifth as many persons. Louisiana's most populous district, the Sixth, is 53.6% urban and contains 536,029 persons, and its least populous, the Eighth, 36.7% urban, contains 263,850nearly half. Gross disregard of any assumption that our political system implies even approximation to the notion that individual votes in the various districts within a State should have equal weight is as true, e. g., of California, Illinois, and Ohio as it is of Georgia. See United States Department of Commerce, Census Release, February 24, 1962, CB62-23.FRANKFURTER DISSENT FOOTNOTES[1]  See Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1; Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.

Supp. 184 (D. C. D. Minn.); cf. Dyer v. Kazuhisa Abe, 138 F. Supp. 220 (D. C. D. Hawaii). And see Keogh v. Neely, 50 F. 2d 685 (C. A. 7th Cir.).\n\n[2]  Although the motion to intervene by the Mayor of Nashville asserted an interest in the litigation in only a representative capacity, the complaint which he subsequently filed set forth that he was a qualified voter who also sued in his own behalf. The municipalities of Knoxville and Chattanooga purport to represent their residents. Since the claims of the municipal intervenors do not differ materially from those of the parties who sue as individual voters, the Court need not now determine whether the municipalities are proper parties to this proceeding. See, e. g., Stewart v. Kansas City, 239 U. S. 14.\n\n[3]  The original complaint named as defendants Tennessee's Secretary of State, Attorney General, Coordinator of Elections, and the three members of the State Board of Elections, seeking to make the Board members representatives of all the State's County Election Commissioners. The prayer in an intervening complaint by the City of Knoxville, that the Commissioners of Elections of Knox County be added as parties defendant seems not to have been acted on by the court below. Defendants moved to dismiss, inter alia, on the ground of failure to join indispensable parties, and they argue in this Court that only the County Election Commissioners of the ninety-five counties are the effective administrators of Tennessee's elections laws, and that none of the defendants have substantial duties in connection therewith. The District Court deferred ruling on this ground of the motion. Inasmuch as it involves questions of local law more appropriately decided by judges sitting in Tennessee than by this Court, and since in any event the failure to join County Election Commissioners in this action looking to prospective relief could be corrected, if necessary, by amendment of the complaints, the issue does not concern the Court on this appeal.\n\n[4]  Jurisdiction is predicated upon R. S.  1979, 42 U. S. C.  1983, and 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3).\n\n[5]  However, counties having two-thirds of the ratio required for a Representative are entitled to seat one member in the House, and there are certain geographical restrictions upon the formation of Senate districts. The applicable provisions of Article II of the Tennessee Constitution are:\n\n\"Sec. 4. Census.An enumeration of the qualified voters, and an apportionment of the Representatives in the General Assembly, shall be made in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and within every subsequent term of ten years.\"\n\n\"Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.The number of Representatives shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.\"\n\n\"Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators.The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no county shall be divided in forming a district.\"\n\n[6]  It is alleged that certain amendments to the Act of 1901 made only minor modifications of that Act, adjusting the boundaries of individual districts in a manner not material to plaintiffs' claims.\n\n[7]  The exhibits do not reveal the source of the population figures which they set forth, but it appears that the figures were taken from the United States Census of Population, 1950, Volume II, Part 42 (Tennessee), Table 41, at 76-91. These census figures represent the total population over twenty-one years of age in each Tennessee county; they do not purport to enumerate \"qualified voters\" or \"qualified electors,\" the measure of apportionment prescribed by the Tennessee Constitution. See note 5, supra. To qualify to vote in Tennessee, in addition to fulfilling the age requirement, an individual must be a citizen of the United States, a resident of the State for twelve months and of the county where he offers his vote for six months next preceding the election, and must not be under the disqualification attaching to conviction for certain offenses. Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  2-201, 2-205. The statistics found in the United States Census of Population, 1950, Volume II, Part 42 (Tennessee), Table 42, at 92-97, suggest that the residence requirement, in particular, may be an unknown variable of considerable significance. Appellants do not suggest a means by which a court, on the basis of the federal census figures, can determine the number of qualified voters in the various Tennessee counties.\n\n[8]  The \"county aid funds\" derived from a portion of a state gasoline privilege tax, for example, are distributed among the counties as follows: one-half equally among the ninety-five counties, one-quarter on the basis of area, one-quarter on the basis of population, to be used by county authorities in the building, repairing and improving of county roads and bridges. Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  54-403. Appellants urge that this distribution is discriminatory.\n\n[9]  Plaintiffs also suggested, as an alternative to at-large elections, that the District Court might itself redistrict the State. They did not, however, expressly pray such relief.\n\n[10]  See Bickel, Foreword: The Passive Virtues, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 40, 45 et seq. (1961).\n\n[11]  See, e. g., United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 634, 635; The Divina Pastora, 4 Wheat. 52; Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415; Kennett v. Chambers, 14 How. 38; Doe v. Braden, 16 How. 635; Jones v. United States, 137 U. S. 202; Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270; Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U. S. 447; Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U. S. 297; Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578; Clark v. Allen, 331 U. S. 503. Compare Foster and Elam v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, with United States v. Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691. Of course, judgment concerning the \"political\" nature of even a controversy affecting the Nation's foreign affairs is not a simple mechanical matter, and certain of the Court's decisions have accorded scant weight to the consideration of unity of action in the conduct of external relations. Compare Vermilya-Brown Co. v. Connell, 335 U. S. 377, with United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203.\n\n[12]  Obviously, this is the equivalent of saying that the characteristics are not \"constitutionally requisite\" in a judicially enforceable sense. The recognition of their necessity as a condition of legislation is left, as is observance of certain other constitutional commands, to the conscience of the non-judicial organs. Cf. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66.\n\n[13]  Also compare the Coleman case and United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, with Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), 253 U. S. 221. See the National Prohibition Cases, 253 U. S. 350; and consider the Court's treatment of the several contentions in Leser v. Garnett, 258 U. S. 130.\n\n[14]  E. g., Myers v. Anderson, 238 U. S. 368; Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73; Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649. The action for damages for improperly rejecting an elector's vote had been given by the English law since the time of Ashby v. White, 1 Brown's Cases in Parliament 62; 2 Ld. Raym. 938; 3 Ld. Raym. 320, a case which in its own day precipitated an intra-parliamentary war of major dimensions. See 6 Hansard, Parliamentary History of England (1810), 225-324, 376-436. Prior to the racial-discrimination cases, this Court had recognized the action, by implication, in dictum in Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U. S. 487, and Wiley v. Sinkler, 179 U. S. 58, both respecting federal elections.\n\n[15]  Cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339.\n\n[16]  By statute an action for preventive relief is now given the United States in certain voting cases. 71 Stat. 637, 42 U. S. C.  1971 (c), amending R. S.  2004. See United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17; United States v. Thomas, 362 U. S. 58.\n\n[17]  Compare Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, and cases following, with Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50.\n\n[18]  Compare Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, with Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 20, 28 (Mr. Justice Johnson, concurring), 51 and 75 (Mr. Justice Thompson, dissenting).\n\n[19]  This was an alternative ground of Chief Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court. Id., at 20. The question which Marshall reserved as \"unnecessary to decide,\" ibid., was not the justiciability of the bill in this aspect, but the \"more doubtful\" question whether that \"part of the bill which respects the land occupied by the Indians, and prays the aid of the court to protect their possession,\" might be entertained. Ibid. Mr. Justice Johnson, concurring, found the controversy non-justiciable and would have put the ruling solely on this ground, id., at 28, and Mr. Justice Thompson, in dissent, agreed that much of the matter in the bill was not fit for judicial determination. Id., at 51, 75.\n\n[20]  Cf. Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475.\n\n[21]  Considerations similar to those which determined the Cherokee Nation case and Georgia v. Stanton no doubt explain the celebrated decision in Nabob of the Carnatic v. East India Co., 1 Ves. jun. *371; 2 Ves. jun. *56, rather than any attribution of a portion of British sovereignty, in respect of Indian affairs, to the company. The reluctance of the English Judges to involve themselves in contests of factional political power is of ancient standing. In The Duke of York's Claim to the Crown, 5 Rotuli Parl. 375, printed in Wambaugh, Cases on Constitutional Law (1915), 1, the role which the Judges were asked to play appears to have been rather that of advocates than of judges, but the answer which they returned to the Lords relied on reasons equally applicable to either role.\n\n[22]  \"The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.\"\n\n[23]  Cf. the cases holding that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes no such restriction upon the form of a State's governmental organization as will permit persons affected by government action to complain that in its organization principles of separation of powers have been violated. E. g., Dreyer v. Illinois, 187 U. S. 71; Soliah v. Heskin, 222 U. S. 522; Houck v. Little River Drainage District, 239 U. S. 254. The same consistent refusal of this Court to find that the Federal Constitution restricts state power to design the structure of state political institutions is reflected in the cases rejecting claims arising out of the States' creation, alteration, or destruction of local subdivisions or their powers, insofar as these claims are made by the subdivisions themselves, see Laramie County v. Albany County, 92 U. S. 307; Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil & Gas Co., 250 U. S. 394; Trenton v. New Jersey, 262 U. S. 182; Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 270 U. S. 378, 389-390; Williams v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 289 U. S. 36, or by the whole body of their residents who share only a general, undifferentiated interest in their preservation. See Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161. The policy is also given effect by the denial of \"standing\" to persons seeking to challenge state action as infringing the interest of some separate unit within the State's administrative structurea denial which precludes the arbitrament by federal courts of what are only disputes over the local allocation of government functions and powers. See, e. g., Smith v. Indiana, 191 U. S. 138; Braxton County Court v. West Virginia, 208 U. S. 192; Marshall v. Dye, 231 U. S. 250; Stewart v. Kansas City, 239 U. S. 14.\n\n[24]  223 U. S., at 141. \". . . [T]he contention, if held to be sound, would necessarily affect the validity, not only of the particular statute which is before us, but of every other statute passed in Oregon since the adoption of the initiative and referendum. And indeed the propositions go further than this, since in their essence they assert that there is no governmental function, legislative or judicial, in Oregon, because it cannot be assumed, if the proposition be well founded, that there is at one and the same time one and the same government which is republican in form and not of that character.\" Compare Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 38-39:\n\n\". . . For, if this court is authorized to enter upon this inquiry as proposed by the plaintiff, and it should be decided that the charter government had no legal existence during the period of time above mentioned,if it had been annulled by the adoption of the opposing government,then the laws passed by its legislature during that time were nullities; its taxes wrongfully collected; its salaries and compensation to its officers illegally paid; its public accounts improperly settled; and the judgments and sentences of its courts in civil and criminal cases null and void, and the officers who carried their decisions into operation answerable as trespassers, if not in some cases as criminals.\n\n\"When the decision of this court might lead to such results, it becomes its duty to examine very carefully its own powers before it undertakes to exercise jurisdiction.\"\n\n[25]  See Bowen, The Recent Contest in Rhode Island (1844); Frieze, A Concise History of the Efforts to Obtain an Extension of Suffrage in Rhode Island; From the Year 1811 to 1842 (2d ed. 1842); Mowry, The Dorr War (1901); Wayland, The Affairs of Rhode Island (2d ed. 1842).\n\n[26]  The Court reasoned, with respect to the guarantee against domestic violence also contained in Art. IV,  4, that this, too, was an authority committed solely to Congress; that Congress had empowered the President, not the courts, to enforce it; and that it was inconceivable that the courts should assume a power to make determinations in the premises which might conflict with those of the Executive. It noted further that, in fact, the President had recognized the governor of the charter government as the lawful authority in Rhode Island, although it had been unnecessary to call out the militia in his support.\n\n[27]  See note 24, supra.\n\n[28]  Id., at 39, 46-47.\n\n[29]  Id., at 41-42.\n\n[30]  In evaluating the Court's determination not to inquire into the authority of the charter government, it must be remembered that, throughout the country, Dorr \"had received the sympathy of the Democratic press. His cause, therefore, became distinctly a party issue.\" 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed. 1937), 186.\n\n[31]  Appellants also allege discrimination in the legislature's allocation of certain tax burdens and benefits. Whether or not such discrimination would violate the Equal Protection Clause if the tax statutes were challenged in a proper proceeding, see Dane v. Jackson, 256 U. S. 589; cf. Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Wallace, 288 U. S. 249, 268, these recitative allegations do not affect the nature of the controversy which appellants' complaints present.\n\n[32]  Appellants would find a \"right\" to have one's ballot counted on authority of United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383; United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299; United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S. 385. All that these cases hold is that conspiracies to commit certain sharp election practices which, in a federal election, cause ballots not to receive the weight which the law has in fact given them, may amount to deprivations of the constitutionally secured right to vote for federal officers. But see United States v. Bathgate, 246 U. S. 220. The cases do not so much as suggest that there exists a constitutional limitation upon the relative weight to which the law might properly entitle respective ballots, even in federal elections.\n\n[33]  Mackenzie, Free Elections (1958) (hereafter, Mackenzie), 108.\n\n[34]  Ogg, English Government and Politics (2d ed. 1936) (hereafter, Ogg), 248-250, 257; Seymour, Electoral Reform in England and Wales (1915) (hereafter, Seymour), 46-47.\n\n[35]  Ogg 257-259; Seymour 45-52; Carpenter, The Development of American Political Thought (1930) (hereafter, Carpenter), 45-46.\n\n[36]  Ogg 258.\n\n[37]  Seymour 51.\n\n[38]  The Federalist, No. 56 (Wright ed. 1961), at 382.

Some counted all inhabitants, e. g., N. J. Const., 1844, Art. IV,  3; some, only white inhabitants, e. g., Ill. Const., 1848, Art. III,  8; some, male inhabitants over twenty-one, e. g., Ind. Const., 1851, Art. IV,  4-5; some, qualified voters, e. g., Tenn. Const., 1834, Art. II,  4 to 6; some excluded aliens, e. g., N. Y. Const., 1846, Art. III,  4, 5 (and untaxed persons of color); some excluded untaxed Indians and military personnel, e. g., Neb. Const., 1866-1867, Art. II,  3. For present purposes these differences, although not unimportant as revealing fundamental divergences in representation theory, will be disregarded.\n\n[85]  Ore. Const., 1857, Art. IV,  5, 6, 7; Ill. Const., 1848, Art. III,  8, 9; Ind. Const., 1851, Art. IV,  4, 5, 6; Minn. Const., 1857, Art. IV,  2; Wis. Const., 1848, Art. IV,  3 to 5; Mass. Const., 1780, Amends. XXI, XXII; Neb. Const., 1866-1867, Art. II,  3. All of these but Minnesota made provision for periodic reapportionment. Nevada's Constitution of 1864, Art. XV,  13, provided that the federal censuses and interim state decennial enumerations should serve as the bases of representation for both houses, but did not expressly require either numerical equality or reapportionment at fixed intervals.\n\nSeveral of these constitutions contain provisions which forbid splitting counties or which otherwise require recognition of local boundaries. See, e. g., the severe restriction in Ill. Const., 1848, Art. III,  9. Such provisions will almost inevitably produce numerical inequalities. See, for example, University of Oklahoma, Bureau of Government Research, Legislative Apportionment in Oklahoma (1956), 21-23. However, because their effect in this regard will turn on idiosyncratic local factors, and because other constitutional provisions are a more significant source of inequality, these provisions are here disregarded.\n\n[86]  Tenn. Const., 1834, Art. II,  4 to 6 (two-thirds of a ratio entitles a county to one representative in the House); W. Va. Const., 1861-1863, Art. IV,  4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (one-half of a ratio entitles a county to one representative in the House); Mich. Const., 1850, Art. IV,  2 to 4 (one-half of a ratio entitles each county thereafter organized to one representative in the House). In Oregon and Iowa a major-fraction rule applied which gave a House seat not only to counties having a moiety of a single ratio, but to all counties having more than half a ratio in excess of the multiple of a ratio. Ore. Const., 1857, Art. IV,  6, note 85, supra; Iowa Const., 1857, Art. III,  33, 34, 35, 37, note 89, infra.\n\n[87]  See Bone, States Attempting to Comply with Reapportionment Requirements, 17 Law & Contemp. Prob. 387, 391 (1952).\n\n[88]  It also appears, although the section is not altogether clear, that the provisions of West Virginia's Constitution controlling apportionment of senators would operate in favor of the State's less populous regions by limiting any single county to a maximum of two senators.

The extent of legislative authority to alter the apportionment is unclear, but it appears that the three-tiered structure is meant to be permanent.\n\n[114]  See, e. g., Durfee, Apportionment of Representation in the Legislature: A Study of State Constitutions, 43 Mich.

The Colorado and Utah Constitutions provide for reapportionment \"according to ratios to be fixed by law\" after periodic census and enumeration. In New Mexico the legislature is authorized, but not commanded, to reapportion periodically. North Dakota does not in terms demand equality in House representation; members are to be assigned among the several senatorial districts, which are of equal population.\n\n[118]  Wyo.

There will be politics in reapportionment as long as a representative form of government exists . . . .\n\n\"It is impossible to draw a district boundary line without that line's having some political significance. . . .\"\n\n[147]  See, e. g., Celler, Congressional ApportionmentPast, Present, and Future, 17 Law & Contemp. Prob. 268 (1952), speaking of the history of congressional apportionment:\n\n\". . . A mere reading of the debates [from the Constitutional Convention down to contemporary Congresses] on this question of apportionment reveals the conflicting interests of the large and small states and the extent to which partisan politics permeates the entire problem.\"\n\n[148]  See Standards for Congressional Districts (Apportionment), Hearings before Subcommittee No. 2 of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 23, concerning a proposed provision for judicial enforcement of certain standards in the laying out of districts:\n\n\"Mr. KASEM. You do not think that that [a provision embodying the language: `in as compact form as practicable'] might result in a decision depending upon the political inclinations of the judge?\n\n\"Mr. CELLER. Are you impugning the integrity of our Federal judiciary?\n\n\"Mr. KASEM. No; I just recognize their human frailties.\" For an instance of a court torn, in fact or fancy, over the political issues involved in reapportionment, see State ex rel. Lashly v. Becker, 290 Mo. 560, 235 S. W. 1017, and especially the dissenting opinion of Higbee, J., 290 Mo., at 613, 235 S. W., at 1037.\n\n[149]  See text at notes 139-143, supra.\n\n[150]  Decisions of state courts which have entertained apportionment cases under their respective state constitutions do not, of course, involve the very different considerations relevant to federal judicial intervention. State-court adjudication does not involve the delicate problems of federal-state relations which would inhere in the exercise of federal judicial power to impose restrictions upon the States' shaping of their own governmental institutions. Moreover, state constitutions generally speak with a specificity totally lacking in attempted utilization of the generalities of the Fourteenth Amendment to apportionment matters. Some expressly commit apportionment to state judicial review, see, e. g., N. Y. Const., 1938, Art. III,  5, and even where they do not, they do precisely fix the criteria for judicial judgment respecting the allocation of representative strength within the electorate. See, e. g., Asbury Park Press. Inc., v. Woolley. 33 N. J. 1, 161 A. 2d 705.\n\n[151]  Appellants' suggestion that, although no relief may need be given, jurisdiction ought to be retained as a \"spur\" to legislative action does not merit discussion.\n\n[152]  See note 24, supra.HARLAN APPENDIX FOOTNOTES[1]  The relevant provisions of the Tennessee Constitution are Art. II,  5 and 6:\n\n\"Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.The number of Representatives shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided, that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.\n\n\"Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators.The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no counties shall be divided in forming a district.\"\n\n[2]  This formula is not clearly spelled out in the opinion, but it is necessarily inferred from the figures that are presented. Knox County, for example, is said to have a \"total representation\" of 7.25. It elects (1) three direct representatives (value 3.00); (2) one representative from a two-county district (value .50); (3) one direct senator (value 3.00); and (4) one senator in a four-county district (value .75). See Appendix to opinion of MR. JUSTICE CLARK, ante, pp. 262-264.\n\n[3]  If this \"adjusted\" formula for measuring \"total representation\" is applied to the other \"horribles\" cited in the concurring opinion (ante, p. 255), it reveals that these countieswhich purportedly have equal \"total representation\" but distinctly unequal voting population do not have the same \"total representation\" at all. Rather than having the same representation as Rutherford County, Moore County has only about 40% of what Rutherford has. Decatur County has only 55% of the representation of Carter County. While Loudon and Anderson Counties are substantially underrepresented, this is because of their proximity to Knox County, which outweighs their votes in the Sixth Senatorial District and in the Eighth Floterial District.\n\n[4]  These disparities are as serious, if not more so, when my Brother CLARK'S formula is applied to the appellants' proposal. For example, if the seven counties chosen by him as illustrative are examined as they would be represented under the appellants' distribution, Moore County, with a voting population of 2,340, is given more electoral strength than Decatur County, with a voting population of 5,563. Carter County (voting population 23,302) has 20% more \"total representation\" than Anderson County (voting population 33,990), and 33% more than Rutherford County (voting population 25,316).\n\n[5]  Murfreesboro, Rutherford County (pop. 16,017); Elizabethton, Carter County (pop. 10,754); Oak Ridge, Anderson County (pop. 27,387). Tennessee Blue Book, 1960, pp. 143-149.\n\n[6]  For example, Carter and Washington Counties are each approximately 60% as large as Maury and Madison Counties in terms of square miles, and this may explain the disparity between their \"total representation\" figures.\n\n[7]  For example, in addition to being \"semi-urban,\" Blount County is the location of the City of Alcoa, where the Aluminum Company of America has located a large aluminum smelting and rolling plant. This may explain the difference between its \"total representation\" and that of Gibson County, which has no such large industry and contains no municipality as large as Maryville.\n\n[8]  For example, Chester County (voting population 6,391) is one of those that is presently said to be overrepresented. But under the appellants' proposal, Chester would be combined with populous Madison County in a \"floterial district\" and with four others, including Shelby County, in a senatorial district. Consequently, its total representation according to the Appendix to my Brother CLARK'S opinion would be .19. (Ante, p. 262.) This would have the effect of disenfranchising all the county's voters. Similarly, Rhea County's almost 9,000 voters would find their voting strength so diluted as to be practically nonexistent.\n\n[9]  For example, it is primarily the eastern portion of the State that is complaining of malapportionment (along with the Cities of Memphis and Nashville). But the eastern section is where industry is principally located and where population density, even outside the large urban areas, is highest. Consequently, if Tennessee is apportioning in favor of its agricultural interests, as constitutionally it was entitled to do, it would necessarily reduce representation from the east.\n\n[10]  For example, sound political reasons surely justify limiting the legislative chambers to workable numbers; in Tennessee, the House is set at 99 and the Senate at 33. It might have been deemed desirable, therefore, to set a ceiling on representation from any single county so as not to deprive others of individual representation. The proportional discrepancies among the four counties with large urban centers may be attributable to a conscious policy of limiting representation in this manner.\n\n[11]  For example, Moore County is surrounded by four counties each of which has sufficient voting population to exceed two-thirds of the average voting population per county (which is the standard prescribed by the Tennessee Constitution for the assignment of a direct representative), thus qualifying for direct representatives. Consequently Moore County must be assigned a representative of its own despite its small voting population because it cannot be joined with any of its neighbors in a multicounty district, and the Tennessee Constitution prohibits combining it with nonadjacent counties.

M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.\n\n\u2014Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?\n\n\u2014Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?\n\n\u2014Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.\n\n\u2014What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane\u2014old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him\u2014lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.\n\u2014Circumcised? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.\n\n\u2014That the lay you're on now? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?\n\nFor nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.\n\u2014Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Not taking anything between drinks, says I.\n\n\u2014What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.\n\n\u2014Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.\n\n\u2014Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.\n\n\u2014Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?\n\u2014Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.\n\n\u2014-What was that, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.\n\nSo we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.\n\nIn Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.\n\nAnd there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.\n\nI dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!\n\nAnd by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.\n\nSo we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.\n\n\u2014There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.\n\nThe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.\n\n\u2014Stand and deliver, says he.\n\n\u2014That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.\n\u2014Pass, friends, says he.\n\nThen he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:\n\n\u2014What's your opinion of the times?\n\nDoing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.\n\n\u2014I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.\n\nSo begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:\n\n\u2014Foreign wars is the cause of it.\n\nAnd says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:\n\n\u2014It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.\n\n\u2014Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.\n\n\u2014Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Wine of the country, says he.\n\n\u2014What's yours? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.\n\n\u2014Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.\n\n\u2014Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?\n\nAnd with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.\n\nThe figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.\n\nHe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S. Fursa, S. Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn't, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L. Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W. Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O'Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.\n\nSo anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.\n\n\u2014And there's more where that came from, says he.\n\n\u2014Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.\n\n\u2014I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.\n\nWho comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.\n\n\u2014For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.\n\nAnd he starts reading them out:\n\n\u2014Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...\n\n\u2014I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.\n\n\u2014Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, honourable person.\n\n\u2014Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.\n\nAh! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.\n\nAnd lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.\n\nLittle Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.\n\n\u2014Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...\n\nAnd he doubled up.\n\n\u2014Take a what? says I.\n\n\u2014Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.\n\n\u2014O hell! says I.\n\nThe bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.\n\n\u2014Bi i dho husht, says he.\n\n\u2014Who? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.\n\n\u2014When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...\n\nAnd he started laughing.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?\n\n\u2014Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.\n\nTerence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.\n\nThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\n\nBut he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.\n\n\u2014What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.\n\nSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.\n\n\u2014Are you codding? says I.\n\n\u2014Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.\n\nSo Joe took up the letters.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.\n\nSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:\n\n\u2014How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?\n\n\u2014I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...\n\n\u2014You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?\n\n\u2014With Dignam, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is it Paddy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Why?\n\n\u2014Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.\n\n\u2014Who's dead? says Bob Doran.\n\n\u2014You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?\n\n\u2014What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?\n\n\u2014Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.\n\n\u2014Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\n\n\u2014Paddy? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says Alf.\n\nBegob he was what you might call flabbergasted.\n\nIn the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.\n\nAssurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.\n\nHe is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.\n\n\u2014There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.\n\nAnd, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.\n\nLittle Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.\n\nAnd says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:\n\n\u2014Who said Christ is good?\n\n\u2014I beg your parsnips, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.\n\nBut Bob Doran shouts out of him.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.\n\nTerry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.\n\n\u2014The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.\n\nThe tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.\n\n\u2014The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.\n\nAnd mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.\n\nOld Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.\n\n\u2014Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.\n\nSo Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.\n\n\u2014O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?\n\nAnd he starts reading out one.\n\n7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.\n\nHonoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...\n\n\u2014Show us, Joe, says I.\n\n\u2014... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...\n\n\u2014Jesus, says I.\n\n\u2014... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...\n\nThe citizen made a grab at the letter.\n\n\u2014Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.\nH. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.\n\n\u2014And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?\n\nSo they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.\n\n\u2014Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.\n\nAnd Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.\n\n\u2014They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.\n\nAnd he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.\n\nIn the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.\n\nSo they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.\n\n\u2014There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.\n\n\u2014That so? says Joe.\n\n\u2014God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in\n\nKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.\n\n\u2014Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.\n\n\u2014That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...\n\nAnd then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.\n\nThe distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.\n\nSo of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:\n\n\u2014Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!\n\nArrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.\n\nAnd the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b\u00e9zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!\n\n\u2014The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...\n\n\u2014Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.\n\nThe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petit\u00e9patant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Vir\u00e1ga Kis\u00e1szony Putr\u00e1pesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.\n\nQuietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate\u2014short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fianc\u00e9e an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:\n\n\u2014God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.\n\nSo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.\n\nSo howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.\n\n\u2014Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.\n\n\u2014No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.\n\nSo he calls the old dog over.\n\n\u2014What's on you, Garry? says he.\n\nThen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.\n\nAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.\n\nThe curse of my curses\nSeven days every day\nAnd seven dry Thursdays\nOn you, Barney Kiernan,\nHas no sup of water\nTo cool my courage,\nAnd my guts red roaring\nAfter Lowry's lights.\n\nSo he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.\n\nGob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:\n\n\u2014Could you make a hole in another pint?\n\n\u2014Could a swim duck? says I.\n\n\u2014Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.\n\n\u2014Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.\n\n\u2014Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?\n\n\u2014Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.\n\n\u2014Whose admirers? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.\n\nThen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.\n\nSo Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.\n\n\u2014Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.\n\n\u2014No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.\n\n\u2014Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.\n\nAnd off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.\n\nSo Terry brought the three pints.\n\n\u2014Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.\n\n\u2014Slan leat, says he.\n\n\u2014Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.\n\nGob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.\n\n\u2014Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Friend of yours, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?\n\n\u2014I won't mention any names, says Alf.\n\n\u2014I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.\n\n\u2014Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.\n\nSo Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.\n\nGa Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.\n\n\u2014Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.\n\n\u2014Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.\n\n\u2014Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.\n\n\u2014That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?\n\n\u2014Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?\n\nMr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.\n\nMr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?\n\nMr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)\n\nMr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.\n\nMr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.\n\n(Ironical opposition cheers.)\n\nThe speaker: Order! Order!\n\n(The house rises. Cheers.)\n\n\u2014There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?\n\n\u2014Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.\n\n\u2014Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.\n\n\u2014Is that really a fact? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?\n\nSo off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.\n\nA most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.\n\nAmongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.\n\n\u2014Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?\n\n\u2014No, says Joe.\n\n\u2014I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Who? Blazes? says Joe.\n\nAnd says Bloom:\n\n\u2014What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.\n\n\u2014Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.\n\n\u2014We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.\n\n\u2014-True for you, says Joe.\n\nAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:\n\n\u2014Now, don't you think, Bergan?\n\n\u2014Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.\n\nIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.\n\n\u2014He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.\n\n\u2014He is, says Joe. Isn't he?\n\n\u2014Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.\n\n\u2014Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.\n\n\u2014My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.\n\nHe's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.\n\nHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.\n\nPride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.\n\nAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.\n\n\u2014Hello, Ned.\n\n\u2014Hello, Alf.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack.\n\n\u2014Hello, Joe.\n\n\u2014God save you, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?\n\n\u2014Half one, says Ned.\n\nSo J. J. ordered the drinks.\n\n\u2014Were you round at the court? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.\n\n\u2014Hope so, says Ned.\n\nNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.\n\n\u2014Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.\n\n\u2014Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.\n\n\u2014Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.\n\n\u2014Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.\n\n\u2014Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.\n\n\u2014Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.\n\n\u2014Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.\n\n\u2014Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.\n\n\u2014How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...\n\n\u2014Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.\n\n\u2014Nor good red herring, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.\n\nBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.\n\n\u2014And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.\n\nSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.\n\n\u2014Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Good health, Ned, says J. J.\n\n\u2014-There he is again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Where? says Alf.\n\nAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.\n\n\u2014How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Remanded, says J. J.\n\nOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.\n\n\u2014Who tried the case? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Recorder, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\n\n\u2014Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.\n\nAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:\n\n\u2014A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?\n\n\u2014Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\n\n\u2014And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.\n\nAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.\n\n\u2014Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.\n\nSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.\n\n\u2014Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.\n\n\u2014Rely on me, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.\n\n\u2014O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.\n\n\u2014Consider that done, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Very kind of you, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.\n\n\u2014Decree nisi, says J. J.\n\nAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.\n\n\u2014A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.\n\n\u2014And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\n\n\u2014Give us a squint at her, says I.\n\nAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.\n\n\u2014O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!\n\n\u2014There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?\n\nSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.\n\n\u2014Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?\n\nO'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.\n\n\u2014It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.\n\nSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.\n\n\u2014Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.\n\n\u2014The European family, says J. J....\n\n\u2014They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\n\nAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!\n\nHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.\n\n\u2014What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.\n\n\u2014Gold cup, says he.\n\n\u2014Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.\n\n\u2014And Bass's mare? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.\n\n\u2014I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.\n\n\u2014Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.\n\nSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.\n\n\u2014Not there, my child, says he.\n\n\u2014Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.\n\nAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.\n\n\u2014Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.\n\n\u2014Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?\n\n\u2014As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...\n\n\u2014Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.\n\n\u2014Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.\n\nThe fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.\n\n\u2014And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\n\n\u2014And will again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.\n\nAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.\n\n\u2014Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?\n\n\u2014An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\u2014Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.\n\nHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.\n\n\u2014But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?\n\n\u2014I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.\n\nSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.\n\n\u2014A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\n\nThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.\n\n\u2014That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.\n\nThe fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.\n\n\u2014On which the sun never rises, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.\n\nThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.\n\n\u2014But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?\n\nDidn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.\n\n\u2014We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.\n\n\u2014Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...\n\n\u2014We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.\n\n\u2014Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?\n\n\u2014The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Fran\u00e7ais, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.\n\n\u2014And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?\n\nJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.\n\n\u2014Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!\n\n\u2014And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.\n\n\u2014They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.\n\nAnd says J. J.:\n\n\u2014Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.\n\n\u2014Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says he. I will.\n\n\u2014You? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.\n\n\u2014Repeat that dose, says Joe.\n\nBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.\n\n\u2014Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.\n\n\u2014But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014What is it? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.\n\n\u2014By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years.\n\nSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:\n\n\u2014Or also living in different places.\n\n\u2014That covers my case, says Joe.\n\n\u2014What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.\n\nThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\n\n\u2014After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.\n\n\u2014Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.\n\nThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave\u2014all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.\n\n\u2014Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?\n\n\u2014That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.\n\n\u2014And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.\n\nGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.\n\n\u2014Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\n\n\u2014Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.\n\nThat's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.\n\n\u2014But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.\n\nWho's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.\n\n\u2014A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.\n\n\u2014Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.\n\n\u2014That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.\n\nLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.\n\n\u2014Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.\n\n\u2014Hurrah, there, says Joe.\n\n\u2014The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.\n\nAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\n\n\u2014We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\nSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:\n\n\u2014A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.\n\n\u2014Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.\n\n\u2014Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\n\n\u2014Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.\n\n\u2014And a very good initial too, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is?\n\n\u2014Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.\n\n\u2014I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels.\n\n\u2014Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?\n\n\u2014That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.\n\n\u2014There you are, says Terry.\n\nGoodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\n\nSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one.\n\n\u2014Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.\n\nSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense.\n\nOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.\n\n\u2014Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!\n\nSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\n\nMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\n\n\u2014Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\n\n\u2014Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\n\n\u2014Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.\n\n\u2014How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?\n\nAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.\n\n\u2014Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.\n\n\u2014Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?\n\nMine host bowed again as he made answer:\n\n\u2014What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?\n\n\u2014Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!\n\n\u2014Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.\n\nSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.\n\n\u2014Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.\n\n\u2014Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?\n\n\u2014That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.\n\n\u2014Who made those allegations? says Alf.\n\n\u2014I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.\n\n\u2014And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow?\n\n\u2014Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.\n\n\u2014Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.\n\n\u2014Who is Junius? says J. J.\n\n\u2014We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.\n\n\u2014He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.\n\n\u2014Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.\n\n\u2014That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!\n\n\u2014Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother.\n\n\u2014Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.\n\n\u2014O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\n\n\u2014En ventre sa m\u00e8re, says J. J.\n\n\u2014Do you call that a man? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014And who does he suspect? says the citizen.\n\nGob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.\n\n\u2014Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.\n\n\u2014A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\n\n\u2014Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.\n\n\u2014Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.\n\n\u2014You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.\n\n\u2014Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.\n\n\u2014Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.\n\n\u2014Amen, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And I'm sure He will, says Joe.\n\nAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.\n\n\u2014Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.\n\n\u2014Qui fecit coelum et terram.\n\n\u2014Dominus vobiscum.\n\n\u2014Et cum spiritu tuo.\n\nAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:\n\n\u2014Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.\n\n\u2014And so say all of us, says Jack.\n\n\u2014Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.\n\n\u2014Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.\n\nI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.\n\n\u2014I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not...\n\n\u2014No, says Martin, we're ready.\n\nCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,\n\n\u2014Beg your pardon, says he.\n\n\u2014Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret.\n\nAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\n\n\u2014Bye bye all, says Martin.\n\nAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\n\n\u2014-Off with you, says\n\nMartin to the jarvey.\n\nThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.\n\nBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\n\n\u2014Let me alone, says he.\n\nAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:\n\n\u2014Three cheers for Israel!\n\nArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.\n\nAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:\n\n\u2014Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!\n\nAnd says he:\n\n\u2014Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.\n\n\u2014He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.\n\n\u2014Whose God? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.\n\nGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\n\n\u2014By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.\n\nBy Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.\n\n\u2014Stop! Stop! says Joe.\n\nA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great \u00e9clat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy's March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra, kedves bar\u00e1ton! Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra! Gone but not forgotten.\n\nGob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre:\n\n\u2014Where is he till I murder him?\n\nAnd Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.\n\n\u2014Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.\n\nBut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other way and off with him.\n\n\u2014Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!\n\nBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\n\nThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of d\u00e9bris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R. C. S. I.\n\nYou never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.\n\n\u2014Did I kill him, says he, or what?\n\nAnd he shouting to the bloody dog:\n\n\u2014After him, Garry! After him, boy!\n\nAnd the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.\n\nWhen, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai! And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1696912", "artist_names": "\u200bThe Everly Brothers", "full_title": "The Ferris Wheel by\u00a0\u200bThe\u00a0Everly Brothers", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/2d7b69693796206dace6afd6c4f69b74.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2d7b69693796206dace6afd6c4f69b74.747x747x1.jpg", "id": 1696912, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429904441, "path": "/The-everly-brothers-the-ferris-wheel-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-everly-brothers-the-ferris-wheel-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1965, "month": 1, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "January 1965", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 1965", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/2d7b69693796206dace6afd6c4f69b74.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2d7b69693796206dace6afd6c4f69b74.747x747x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "The Ferris Wheel", "title_with_featured": "The Ferris Wheel", "updated_by_human_at": 1646817591, "url": "https://genius.com/The-everly-brothers-the-ferris-wheel-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/44139", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f1bea76bd837ee54f1a00d36dfb05e23.1000x563x1.jpg", "id": 44139, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/64945eb6f723abe47bf2b088b177e0c1.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "t", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "\u200bThe Everly Brothers", "slug": "The-everly-brothers", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-everly-brothers"}, "artist": "\u200bThe Everly Brothers", "lyrics": "The Ferris Wheel LyricsI'll ride the roller coaster or the carousel\nI like the spider and the diving bell\nBut since she's gone I don't like so well\nThe Ferris Wheel\n\nI'll ride the rock-o plane or the Tilt-a-Whirl\nIt wasn't on these rides I lost my girl\nWay up high is where I lost her\nOn the Ferris Wheel\n\nPretty Ferris Wheel\nBy your coloured lights\nI saw someone steal\nA kiss from her that night\nI'll pay my fare and ride the bumper cars\nThose funny cars won't make the teardrops start\nBut way up there is where she broke my heart\nOn the Ferris Wheel\nOn the Ferris Wheel\nOn the Ferris Wheel...You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/6998162", "artist_names": "Genius", "full_title": "October 2022 Singles Release Calendar by\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.999x999x1.png", "id": 6998162, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 498964, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1669618874, "path": "/Genius-october-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "pyongs_count": 2, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Genius-october-2022-singles-release-calendar-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2022, "month": 10, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "October 2022", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Oct. 2022", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.999x999x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 18918}, "title": "October 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "title_with_featured": "October 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "updated_by_human_at": 1669618874, "url": "https://genius.com/Genius-october-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/204611", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/822a5f872a1fcfe377695dc0046c6bc6.900x176x1.jpg", "id": 204611, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0ca83e3130e1303a7f78ba351e3091cd.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Genius", "slug": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Genius", "iq": 77869}, "artist": "Genius", "lyrics": "October 2022 Singles Release Calendar Lyrics10/1\nDRAM -

The Agony) LyricsIII. THE AGONY\n\nIn the early days of December an old man of some seventy years of age pursued his way along the Rue de Varenne, in spite of the falling rain. He peered up at the door of each house, trying to discover the address of the Marquis Raphael de Valentin, in a simple, childlike fashion, and with the abstracted look peculiar to philosophers. His face plainly showed traces of a struggle between a heavy mortification and an authoritative nature; his long, gray hair hung in disorder about a face like a piece of parchment shriveling in the fire. If a painter had come upon this curious character, he would, no doubt, have transferred him to his sketchbook on his return, a thin, bony figure, clad in black, and have inscribed beneath it: \"Classical poet in search of a rhyme.\" When he had identified the number that had been given to him, this reincarnation of Rollin knocked meekly at the door of a splendid mansion.\n\n\"Is Monsieur Raphael in?\" the worthy man inquired of the Swiss in livery.\n\n\"My Lord the Marquis sees nobody,\" said the servant, swallowing a huge morsel that he had just dipped in a large bowl of coffee.\n\n\"There is his carriage,\" said the elderly stranger, pointing to a fine equipage that stood under the wooden canopy that sheltered the steps before the house, in place of a striped linen awning. \"He is going out; I will wait for him.\"\n\n\"Then you might wait here till to-morrow morning, old boy,\" said the Swiss. \"A carriage is always waiting for monsieur. Please to go away. If I were to let any stranger come into the house without orders, I should lose an income of six hundred francs.\"\nA tall old man, in a costume not unlike that of a subordinate in the Civil Service, came out of the vestibule and hurried part of the way down the steps, while he made a survey of the astonished elderly applicant for admission.\n\n\"What is more, here is M. Jonathan,\" the Swiss remarked; \"speak to him.\"\n\nFellow-feeling of some kind, or curiosity, brought the two old men together in a central space in the great entrance-court. A few blades of grass were growing in the crevices of the pavement; a terrible silence reigned in that great house. The sight of Jonathan's face would have made you long to understand the mystery that brooded over it, and that was announced by the smallest trifles about the melancholy place.\n\nWhen Raphael inherited his uncle's vast estate, his first care had been to seek out the old and devoted servitor of whose affection he knew that he was secure. Jonathan had wept tears of joy at the sight of his young master, of whom he thought he had taken a final farewell; and when the marquis exalted him to the high office of steward, his happiness could not be surpassed. So old Jonathan became an intermediary power between Raphael and the world at large. He was the absolute disposer of his master's fortune, the blind instrument of an unknown will, and a sixth sense, as it were, by which the emotions of life were communicated to Raphael.\n\n\"I should like to speak with M. Raphael, sir,\" said the elderly person to Jonathan, as he climbed up the steps some way, into a shelter from the rain.\n\n\"To speak with my Lord the Marquis?\" the steward cried. \"He scarcely speaks even to me, his foster-father!\"\n\n\"But I am likewise his foster-father,\" said the old man. \"If your wife was his foster-mother, I fed him myself with the milk of the Muses. He is my nursling, my child, carus alumnus! I formed his mind, cultivated his understanding, developed his genius, and, I venture to say it, to my own honor and glory. Is he not one of the most remarkable men of our epoch? He was one of my pupils in two lower forms, and in rhetoric. I am his professor.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir, then you are M. Porriquet?\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir, but\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" Jonathan called to two underlings, whose voices broke the monastic silence that shrouded the house.\n\n\"But is the Marquis ill, sir?\" the professor continued.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" Jonathan replied, \"Heaven only knows what is the matter with my master. You see, there are not a couple of houses like ours anywhere in Paris. Do you understand? Not two houses. Faith, that there are not. My Lord the Marquis had this hotel purchased for him; it formerly belonged to a duke and a peer of France; then he spent three hundred thousand francs over furnishing it. That's a good deal, you know, three hundred thousand francs! But every room in the house is a perfect wonder. 'Good,' said I to myself when I saw this magnificence; 'it is just like it used to be in the time of my lord, his late grandfather; and the young marquis is going to entertain all Paris and the Court!' Nothing of the kind! My lord refused to see any one whatever. 'Tis a funny life that he leads, M. Porriquet, you understand. An inconciliable life. He rises every day at the same time. I am the only person, you see, that may enter his room. I open all the shutters at seven o'clock, summer or winter. It is all arranged very oddly. As I come in I say to him:\n\n\"'You must get up and dress, my Lord Marquis.'\n\"Then he rises and dresses himself. I have to give him his dressing-gown, and it is always after the same pattern, and of the same material. I am obliged to replace it when it can be used no longer, simply to save him the trouble of asking for a new one. A queer fancy! As a matter of fact, he has a thousand francs to spend every day, and he does as he pleases, the dear child. And besides, I am so fond of him that if he gave me a box on the ear on one side, I should hold out the other to him! The most difficult things he will tell me to do, and yet I do them, you know! He gives me a lot of trifles to attend to, that I am well set to work! He reads the newspapers, doesn't he? Well, my instructions are to put them always in the same place, on the same table. I always go at the same hour and shave him myself; and don't I tremble! The cook would forfeit the annuity of a thousand crowns that he is to come into after my lord's death, if breakfast is not served inconciliably at ten o'clock precisely. The menus are drawn up for the whole year round, day after day. My Lord the Marquis has not a thing to wish for. He has strawberries whenever there are any, and he has the earliest mackerel to be had in Paris. The programme is printed every morning. He knows his dinner by rote. In the next place, he dresses himself at the same hour, in the same clothes, the same linen, that I always put on the same chair, you understand? I have to see that he always has the same cloth; and if it should happen that his coat came to grief (a mere supposition), I should have to replace it by another without saying a word about it to him. If it is fine, I go in and say to my master:\n\n\"'You ought to go out, sir.'\n\n\"He says Yes, or No. If he has a notion that he will go out, he doesn't wait for his horses; they are always ready harnessed; the coachman stops there inconciliably, whip in hand, just as you see him out there. In the evening, after dinner, my master goes one day to the Opera, the other to the Ital\u2014\u2014no, he hasn't yet gone to the Italiens, though, for I could not find a box for him until yesterday. Then he comes in at eleven o'clock precisely, to go to bed. At any time in the day when he has nothing to do, he reads\u2014he is always reading, you see\u2014it is a notion he has. My instructions are to read the Journal de la Librairie before he sees it, and to buy new books, so that he finds them on his chimney-piece on the very day that they are published. I have orders to go into his room every hour or so, to look after the fire and everything else, and to see that he wants nothing. He gave me a little book, sir, to learn off by heart, with all my duties written in it\u2014a regular catechism! In summer I have to keep a cool and even temperature with blocks of ice and at all seasons to put fresh flowers all about. He is rich! He has a thousand francs to spend every day; he can indulge his fancies! And he hadn't even necessaries for so long, poor child! He doesn't annoy anybody; he is as good as gold; he never opens his mouth, for instance; the house and garden are absolutely silent. In short, my master has not a single wish left; everything comes in the twinkling of an eye, if he raises his hand, and instanter. Quite right, too. If servants are not looked after, everything falls into confusion. You would never believe the lengths he goes about things. His rooms are all\u2014what do you call it?\u2014er\u2014er\u2014en suite. Very well; just suppose, now, that he opens his room door or the door of his study; presto! all the other doors fly open of themselves by a patent contrivance; and then he can go from one end of the house to the other and not find a single door shut; which is all very nice and pleasant and convenient for us great folk! But, on my word, it cost us a lot of money! And, after all, M. Porriquet, he said to me at last:\n\n\"'Jonathan, you will look after me as if I were a baby in long clothes,' Yes, sir, 'long clothes!' those were his very words. 'You will think of all my requirements for me.' I am the master, so to speak, and he is the servant, you understand? The reason of it? Ah, my word, that is just what nobody on earth knows but himself and God Almighty. It is quite inconciliable!\"\n\n\"He is writing a poem!\" exclaimed the old professor.\n\n\"You think he is writing a poem, sir? It's a very absorbing affair, then! But, you know, I don't think he is. He often tells me that he wants to live like a vergetation; he wants to vergetate. Only yesterday he was looking at a tulip while he was dressing, and he said to me:\n\n\"'There is my own life\u2014I am vergetating, my poor Jonathan.' Now, some of them insist that that is monomania. It is inconciliable!\"\n\n\"All this makes it very clear to me, Jonathan,\" the professor answered, with a magisterial solemnity that greatly impressed the old servant, \"that your master is absorbed in a great work. He is deep in vast meditations, and has no wish to be distracted by the petty preoccupations of ordinary life. A man of genius forgets everything among his intellectual labors. One day the famous Newton\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Newton?\u2014oh, ah! I don't know the name,\" said Jonathan.\n\n\"Newton, a great geometrician,\" Porriquet went on, \"once sat for twenty-four hours leaning his elbow on the table; when he emerged from his musings, he was a day out in his reckoning, just as if he had been sleeping. I will go to see him, dear lad; I may perhaps be of some use to him.\"\n\n\"Not for a moment!\" Jonathan cried. \"Not though you were King of France\u2014I mean the real old one. You could not go in unless you forced the doors open and walked over my body. But I will go and tell him you are here, M. Porriquet, and I will put it to him like this, 'Ought he to come up?' And he will say Yes or No. I never say, 'Do you wish?' or 'Will you?' or 'Do you want?' Those words are scratched out of the dictionary. He let out at me once with a 'Do you want to kill me?' he was so very angry.\"\n\nJonathan left the old schoolmaster in the vestibule, signing to him to come no further, and soon returned with a favorable answer. He led the old gentleman through one magnificent room after another, where every door stood open. At last Porriquet beheld his pupil at some distance seated beside the fire.\n\nRaphael was reading the paper. He sat in an armchair wrapped in a dressing-gown with some large pattern on it. The intense melancholy that preyed upon him could be discerned in his languid posture and feeble frame; it was depicted on his brow and white face; he looked like some plant bleached by darkness. There was a kind of effeminate grace about him; the fancies peculiar to wealthy invalids were also noticeable. His hands were soft and white, like a pretty woman's; he wore his fair hair, now grown scanty, curled about his temples with a refinement of vanity.\nThe Greek cap that he wore was pulled to one side by the weight of its tassel; too heavy for the light material of which it was made. He had let the paper-knife fall at his feet, a malachite blade with gold mounting, which he had used to cut the leaves of the book. The amber mouthpiece of a magnificent Indian hookah lay on his knee; the enameled coils lay like a serpent in the room, but he had forgotten to draw out its fresh perfume. And yet there was a complete contradiction between the general feebleness of his young frame and the blue eyes, where all his vitality seemed to dwell; an extraordinary intelligence seemed to look out from them and to grasp everything at once.\n\nThat expression was painful to see. Some would have read despair in it, and others some inner conflict terrible as remorse. It was the inscrutable glance of helplessness that must perforce consign its desires to the depths of its own heart; or of a miser enjoying in imagination all the pleasures that his money could procure for him, while he declines to lessen his hoard; the look of a bound Prometheus, of the fallen Napoleon of 1815, when he learned at the Elysee the strategical blunder that his enemies had made, and asked for twenty-four hours of command in vain; or rather it was the same look that Raphael had turned upon the Seine, or upon his last piece of gold at the gaming-table only a few months ago.\n\nHe was submitting his intelligence and his will to the homely common-sense of an old peasant whom fifty years of domestic service had scarcely civilized. He had given up all the rights of life in order to live; he had despoiled his soul of all the romance that lies in a wish; and almost rejoiced at thus becoming a sort of automaton. The better to struggle with the cruel power that he had challenged, he had followed Origen's example, and had maimed and chastened his imagination.\n\nThe day after he had seen the diminution of the Magic Skin, at his sudden accession of wealth, he happened to be at his notary's house. A well-known physician had told them quite seriously, at dessert, how a Swiss attacked by consumption had cured himself. The man had never spoken a word for ten years, and had compelled himself to draw six breaths only, every minute, in the close atmosphere of a cow-house, adhering all the time to a regimen of exceedingly light diet. \"I will be like that man,\" thought Raphael to himself. He wanted life at any price, and so he led the life of a machine in the midst of all the luxury around him.\n\nThe old professor confronted this youthful corpse and shuddered; there seemed something unnatural about the meagre, enfeebled frame. In the Marquis, with his eager eyes and careworn forehead, he could hardly recognize the fresh-cheeked and rosy pupil with the active limbs, whom he remembered. If the worthy classicist, sage critic, and general preserver of the traditions of correct taste had read Byron, he would have thought that he had come on a Manfred when he looked to find Childe Harold.\n\n\"Good day, pere Porriquet,\" said Raphael, pressing the old schoolmaster's frozen fingers in his own damp ones; \"how are you?\"\n\n\"I am very well,\" replied the other, alarmed by the touch of that feverish hand. \"But how about you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am hoping to keep myself in health.\"\n\n\"You are engaged in some great work, no doubt?\"\n\n\"No,\" Raphael answered. \"Exegi monumemtum, pere Porriquet; I have contributed an important page to science, and have now bidden her farewell for ever. I scarcely know where my manuscript is.\"\n\n\"The style is no doubt correct?\" queried the schoolmaster. \"You, I hope, would never have adopted the barbarous language of the new school, which fancies it has worked such wonders by discovering Ronsard!\"\n\n\"My work treats of physiology pure and simple.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, there is no more to be said,\" the schoolmaster answered. \"Grammar must yield to the exigencies of discovery. Nevertheless, young man, a lucid and harmonious style\u2014the diction of Massillon, of M. de Buffon, of the great Racine\u2014a classical style, in short, can never spoil anything\u2014\u2014But, my friend,\" the schoolmaster interrupted himself, \"I was forgetting the object of my visit, which concerns my own interests.\"\n\nToo late Raphael recalled to mind the verbose eloquence and elegant circumlocutions which in a long professorial career had grown habitual to his old tutor, and almost regretted that he had admitted him; but just as he was about to wish to see him safely outside, he promptly suppressed his secret desire with a stealthy glance at the Magic Skin. It hung there before him, fastened down upon some white material, surrounded by a red line accurately traced about its prophetic outlines. Since that fatal carouse, Raphael had stifled every least whim, and had lived so as not to cause the slightest movement in the terrible talisman. The Magic Skin was like a tiger with which he must live without exciting its ferocity. He bore patiently, therefore, with the old schoolmaster's prolixity.\n\nPorriquet spent an hour in telling him about the persecutions directed against him ever since the Revolution of July. The worthy man, having a liking for strong governments, had expressed the patriotic wish that grocers should be left to their counters, statesmen to the management of public business, advocates to the Palais de Justice, and peers of France to the Luxembourg; but one of the popularity-seeking ministers of the Citizen King had ousted him from his chair, on an accusation of Carlism, and the old man now found himself without pension or post, and with no bread to eat. As he played the part of guardian angel to a poor nephew, for whose schooling at Saint Sulpice he was paying, he came less on his own account than for his adopted child's sake, to entreat his former pupil's interest with the new minister. He did not ask to be reinstated, but only for a position at the head of some provincial school.\n\nQRaphael had fallen a victim to unconquerable drowsiness by the time that the worthy man's monotonous voice ceased to sound in his ears. Civility had compelled him to look at the pale and unmoving eyes of the deliberate and tedious old narrator, till he himself had reached stupefaction, magnetized in an inexplicable way by the power of inertia.\n\n\"Well, my dear pere Porriquet,\" he said, not very certain what the question was to which he was replying, \"but I can do nothing for you, nothing at all. I wish very heartily that you may succeed\u2014\u2014\"\n\nAll at once, without seeing the change wrought on the old man's sallow and wrinkled brow by these conventional phrases, full of indifference and selfishness, Raphael sprang to his feet like a startled roebuck. He saw a thin white line between the black piece of hide and the red tracing about it, and gave a cry so fearful that the poor professor was frightened by it.\n\n\"Old fool! Go!\" he cried. \"You will be appointed as headmaster! Couldn't you have asked me for an annuity of a thousand crowns rather than a murderous wish? Your visit would have cost me nothing. There are a hundred thousand situations to be had in France, but I have only one life. A man's life is worth more than all the situations in the world.\u2014Jonathan!\"\n\nJonathan appeared.\n\n\"This is your doing, double-distilled idiot! What made you suggest that I should see M. Porriquet?\" and he pointed to the old man, who was petrified with fright. \"Did I put myself in your hands for you to tear me in pieces? You have just shortened my life by ten years! Another blunder of this kind, and you will lay me where I have laid my father. Would I not far rather have possessed the beautiful Foedora? And I have obliged that old hulk instead\u2014that rag of humanity! I had money enough for him. And, moreover, if all the Porriquets in the world were dying of hunger, what is that to me?\"\n\nRaphael's face was white with anger; a slight froth marked his trembling lips; there was a savage gleam in his eyes. The two elders shook with terror in his presence like two children at the sight of a snake. The young man fell back in his armchair, a kind of reaction took place in him, the tears flowed fast from his angry eyes.\n\n\"Oh, my life!\" he cried, \"that fair life of mine. Never to know a kindly thought again, to love no more; nothing is left to me!\"\n\nHe turned to the professor and went on in a gentle voice\u2014\"The harm is done, my old friend. Your services have been well repaid; and my misfortune has at any rate contributed to the welfare of a good and worthy man.\"\n\nHis tones betrayed so much feeling that the almost unintelligible words drew tears from the two old men, such tears as are shed over some pathetic song in a foreign tongue.\n\n\"He is epileptic,\" muttered Porriquet.\n\n\"I understand your kind intentions, my friend,\" Raphael answered gently. \"You would make excuses for me. Ill-health cannot be helped, but ingratitude is a grievous fault. Leave me now,\" he added. \"To-morrow or the next day, or possibly to-night, you will receive your appointment; Resistance has triumphed over Motion. Farewell.\"\n\nThe old schoolmaster went away, full of keen apprehension as to Valentin's sanity. A thrill of horror ran through him; there had been something supernatural, he thought, in the scene he had passed through. He could hardly believe his own impressions, and questioned them like one awakened from a painful dream.\n\n\"Now attend to me, Jonathan,\" said the young man to his old servant. \"Try to understand the charge confided to you.\"\n\n\"Yes, my Lord Marquis.\"\n\n\"I am as a man outlawed from humanity.\"\n\n\"Yes, my Lord Marquis.\"\n\n\"All the pleasures of life disport themselves round my bed of death, and dance about me like fair women; but if I beckon to them, I must die. Death always confronts me. You must be the barrier between the world and me.\"\n\n\"Yes, my Lord Marquis,\" said the old servant, wiping the drops of perspiration from his wrinkled forehead. \"But if you don't wish to see pretty women, how will you manage at the Italiens this evening? An English family is returning to London, and I have taken their box for the rest of the season, and it is in a splendid position\u2014superb; in the first row.\"\n\nRaphael, deep in his own deep musings, paid no attention to him.\n\n\"Do you see that splendid equipage, a brougham painted a dark brown color, but with the arms of an ancient and noble family shining from the panels? As it rolls past, all the shop-girls admire it, and look longingly at the yellow satin lining, the rugs from la Savonnerie, the daintiness and freshness of every detail, the silken cushions and tightly-fitting glass windows. Two liveried footmen are mounted behind this aristocratic carriage; and within, a head lies back among the silken cushions, the feverish face and hollow eyes of Raphael, melancholy and sad. Emblem of the doom of wealth! He flies across Paris like a rocket, and reaches the peristyle of the Theatre Favart. The passers-by make way for him; the two footmen help him to alight, an envious crowd looking on the while.\"\n\n\"What has that fellow done to be so rich?\" asks a poor law-student, who cannot listen to the magical music of Rossini for lack of a five-franc piece.\n\nRaphael walked slowly along the gangway; he expected no enjoyment from these pleasures he had once coveted so eagerly. In the interval before the second act of Semiramide he walked up and down in the lobby, and along the corridors, leaving his box, which he had not yet entered, to look after itself. The instinct of property was dead within him already. Like all invalids, he thought of nothing but his own sufferings. He was leaning against the chimney-piece in the greenroom. A group had gathered about it of dandies, young and old, of ministers, of peers without peerages, and peerages without peers, for so the Revolution of July had ordered matters. Among a host of adventurers and journalists, in fact, Raphael beheld a strange, unearthly figure a few paces away among the crowd. He went towards this grotesque object to see it better, half-closing his eyes with exceeding superciliousness.\n\n\"What a wonderful bit of painting!\" he said to himself. The stranger's hair and eyebrows and a Mazarin tuft on the chin had been dyed black, but the result was a spurious, glossy, purple tint that varied its hues according to the light; the hair had been too white, no doubt, to take the preparation. Anxiety and cunning were depicted in the narrow, insignificant face, with its wrinkles incrusted by thick layers of red and white paint. This red enamel, lacking on some portions of his face, strongly brought out his natural feebleness and livid hues. It was impossible not to smile at this visage with the protuberant forehead and pointed chin, a face not unlike those grotesque wooden figures that German herdsmen carve in their spare moments.\n\nAn attentive observer looking from Raphael to this elderly Adonis would have remarked a young man's eyes set in a mask of age, in the case of the Marquis, and in the other case the dim eyes of age peering forth from behind a mask of youth. Valentin tried to recollect when and where he had seen this little old man before. He was thin, fastidiously cravatted, booted and spurred like one-and-twenty; he crossed his arms and clinked his spurs as if he possessed all the wanton energy of youth. He seemed to move about without constraint or difficulty. He had carefully buttoned up his fashionable coat, which disguised his powerful, elderly frame, and gave him the appearance of an antiquated coxcomb who still follows the fashions.\n\nFor Raphael this animated puppet possessed all the interest of an apparition. He gazed at it as if it had been some smoke-begrimed Rembrandt, recently restored and newly framed. This idea found him a clue to the truth among his confused recollections; he recognized the dealer in antiquities, the man to whom he owed his calamities!\n\nA noiseless laugh broke just then from the fantastical personage, straightening the line of his lips that stretched across a row of artificial teeth. That laugh brought out, for Raphael's heated fancy, a strong resemblance between the man before him and the type of head that painters have assigned to Goethe's Mephistopheles. A crowd of superstitious thoughts entered Raphael's sceptical mind; he was convinced of the powers of the devil and of all the sorcerer's enchantments embodied in mediaeval tradition, and since worked up by poets. Shrinking in horror from the destiny of Faust, he prayed for the protection of Heaven with all the ardent faith of a dying man in God and the Virgin. A clear, bright radiance seemed to give him a glimpse of the heaven of Michael Angelo or of Raphael of Urbino: a venerable white-bearded man, a beautiful woman seated in an aureole above the clouds and winged cherub heads. Now he had grasped and received the meaning of those imaginative, almost human creations; they seemed to explain what had happened to him, to leave him yet one hope.\n\nBut when the greenroom of the Italiens returned upon his sight he beheld, not the Virgin, but a very handsome young person. The execrable Euphrasia, in all the splendor of her toilette, with its orient pearls, had come thither, impatient for her ardent, elderly admirer. She was insolently exhibiting herself with her defiant face and glittering eyes to an envious crowd of stockbrokers, a visible testimony to the inexhaustible wealth that the old dealer permitted her to squander.\n\nRaphael recollected the mocking wish with which he had accepted the old man's luckless gift, and tasted all the sweets of revenge when he beheld the spectacle of sublime wisdom fallen to such a depth as this, wisdom for which such humiliation had seemed a thing impossible. The centenarian greeted Euphrasia with a ghastly smile, receiving her honeyed words in reply. He offered her his emaciated arm, and went twice or thrice round the greenroom with her; the envious glances and compliments with which the crowd received his mistress delighted him; he did not see the scornful smiles, nor hear the caustic comments to which he gave rise.\n\n\"In what cemetery did this young ghoul unearth that corpse of hers?\" asked a dandy of the Romantic faction.\n\nEuphrasia began to smile. The speaker was a slender, fair-haired youth, with bright blue eyes, and a moustache. His short dress coat, hat tilted over one ear, and sharp tongue, all denoted the species.\n\n\"How many old men,\" said Raphael to himself, \"bring an upright, virtuous, and hard-working life to a close in folly! His feet are cold already, and he is making love.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" exclaimed Valentin, stopping the merchant's progress, while he stared hard at Euphrasia, \"have you quite forgotten the stringent maxims of your philosophy?\"\n\n\"Ah, I am as happy now as a young man,\" said the other, in a cracked voice. \"I used to look at existence from a wrong standpoint. One hour of love has a whole life in it.\"\n\nThe playgoers heard the bell ring, and left the greenroom to take their places again. Raphael and the old merchant separated. As he entered his box, the Marquis saw Foedora sitting exactly opposite to him on the other side of the theatre. The Countess had probably only just come, for she was just flinging off her scarf to leave her throat uncovered, and was occupied with going through all the indescribable manoeuvres of a coquette arranging herself. All eyes were turned upon her. A young peer of France had come with her; she asked him for the lorgnette she had given him to carry. Raphael knew the despotism to which his successor had resigned himself, in her gestures, and in the way she treated her companion. He was also under the spell no doubt, another dupe beating with all the might of a real affection against the woman's cold calculations, enduring all the tortures from which Valentin had luckily freed himself.\n\nFoedora's face lighted up with indescribable joy. After directing her lorgnette upon every box in turn, to make a rapid survey of all the dresses, she was conscious that by her toilette and her beauty she had eclipsed the loveliest and best-dressed women in Paris. She laughed to show her white teeth; her head with its wreath of flowers was never still, in her quest of admiration. Her glances went from one box to another, as she diverted herself with the awkward way in which a Russian princess wore her bonnet, or over the utter failure of a bonnet with which a banker's daughter had disfigured herself.\n\nAll at once she met Raphael's steady gaze and turned pale, aghast at the intolerable contempt in her rejected lover's eyes. Not one of her exiled suitors had failed to own her power over them; Valentin alone was proof against her attractions. A power that can be defied with impunity is drawing to its end. This axiom is as deeply engraved on the heart of woman as in the minds of kings. In Raphael, therefore, Foedora saw the deathblow of her influence and her ability to please. An epigram of his, made at the Opera the day before, was already known in the salons of Paris. The biting edge of that terrible speech had already given the Countess an incurable wound. We know how to cauterize a wound, but we know of no treatment as yet for the stab of a phrase. As every other woman in the house looked by turns at her and at the Marquis, Foedora would have consigned them all to the oubliettes of some Bastille; for in spite of her capacity for dissimulation, her discomfiture was discerned by her rivals. Her unfailing consolation had slipped from her at last. The delicious thought, \"I am the most beautiful,\" the thought that at all times had soothed every mortification, had turned into a lie.\n\nAt the opening of the second act a woman took up her position not very far from Raphael, in a box that had been empty hitherto. A murmur of admiration went up from the whole house. In that sea of human faces there was a movement of every living wave; all eyes were turned upon the stranger lady. The applause of young and old was so prolonged, that when the orchestra began, the musicians turned to the audience to request silence, and then they themselves joined in the plaudits and swelled the confusion. Excited talk began in every box, every woman equipped herself with an opera glass, elderly men grew young again, and polished the glasses of their lorgnettes with their gloves. The enthusiasm subsided by degrees, the stage echoed with the voices of the singers, and order reigned as before. The aristocratic section, ashamed of having yielded to a spontaneous feeling, again assumed their wonted politely frigid manner. The well-to-do dislike to be astonished at anything; at the first sight of a beautiful thing it becomes their duty to discover the defect in it which absolves them from admiring it,\u2014the feeling of all ordinary minds. Yet a few still remained motionless and heedless of the music, artlessly absorbed in the delight of watching Raphael's neighbor.\n\nValentin noticed Taillefer's mean, obnoxious countenance by Aquilina's side in a lower box, and received an approving smirk from him. Then he saw Emile, who seemed to say from where he stood in the orchestra, \"Just look at that lovely creature there, close beside you!\" Lastly, he saw Rastignac, with Mme. de Nucingen and her daughter, twisting his gloves like a man in despair, because he was tethered to his place, and could not leave it to go any nearer to the unknown fair divinity.\n\nRaphael's life depended upon a covenant that he had made with himself, and had hitherto kept sacred. He would give no special heed to any woman whatever; and the better to guard against temptation, he used a cunningly contrived opera-glass which destroyed the harmony of the fairest features by hideous distortions. He had not recovered from the terror that had seized on him in the morning when, at a mere expression of civility, the Magic Skin had contracted so abruptly. So Raphael was determined not to turn his face in the direction of his neighbor. He sat imperturbable as a duchess with his back against the corner of the box, thereby shutting out half of his neighbor's view of the stage, appearing to disregard her, and even to be unaware that a pretty woman sat there just behind him.\n\nHis neighbor copied Valentin's position exactly; she leaned her elbow on the edge of her box and turned her face in three-quarter profile upon the singers on the stage, as if she were sitting to a painter. These two people looked like two estranged lovers still sulking, still turning their backs upon each other, who will go into each other's arms at the first tender word.\n\nNow and again his neighbor's ostrich feathers or her hair came in contact with Raphael's head, giving him a pleasurable thrill, against which he sternly fought. In a little while he felt the touch of the soft frill of lace that went round her dress; he could hear the gracious sounds of the folds of her dress itself, light rustling noises full of enchantment; he could even feel her movements as she breathed; with the gentle stir thus imparted to her form and to her draperies, it seemed to Raphael that all her being was suddenly communicated to him in an electric spark. The lace and tulle that caressed him imparted the delicious warmth of her bare, white shoulders. By a freak in the ordering of things, these two creatures, kept apart by social conventions, with the abysses of death between them, breathed together and perhaps thought of one another. Finally, the subtle perfume of aloes completed the work of Raphael's intoxication. Opposition heated his imagination, and his fancy, become the wilder for the limits imposed upon it, sketched a woman for him in outlines of fire. He turned abruptly, the stranger made a similar movement, startled no doubt at being brought in contact with a stranger; and they remained face to face, each with the same thought.\n\n\"Pauline!\"\n\n\"M. Raphael!\"\n\nEach surveyed the other, both of them petrified with astonishment. Raphael noticed Pauline's daintily simple costume. A woman's experienced eyes would have discerned and admired the outlines beneath the modest gauze folds of her bodice and the lily whiteness of her throat. And then her more than mortal clearness of soul, her maidenly modesty, her graceful bearing, all were unchanged. Her sleeve was quivering with agitation, for the beating of her heart was shaking her whole frame.\n\n\"Come to the Hotel de Saint-Quentin to-morrow for your papers,\" she said. \"I will be there at noon. Be punctual.\"\n\nShe rose hastily, and disappeared. Raphael thought of following Pauline, feared to compromise her, and stayed. He looked at Foedora; she seemed to him positively ugly. Unable to understand a single phrase of the music, and feeling stifled in the theatre, he went out, and returned home with a full heart.\n\n\"Jonathan,\" he said to the old servant, as soon as he lay in bed, \"give me half a drop of laudanum on a piece of sugar, and don't wake me to-morrow till twenty minutes to twelve.\"\n\n\"I want Pauline to love me!\" he cried next morning, looking at the talisman the while in unspeakable anguish.\n\nThe skin did not move in the least; it seemed to have lost its power to shrink; doubtless it could not fulfil a wish fulfilled already.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Raphael, feeling as if a mantle of lead had fallen away, which he had worn ever since the day when the talisman had been given to him; \"so you are playing me false, you are not obeying me, the pact is broken! I am free; I shall live. Then was it all a wretched joke?\" But he did not dare to believe in his own thought as he uttered it.\n\nHe dressed himself as simply as had formerly been his wont, and set out on foot for his old lodging, trying to go back in fancy to the happy days when he abandoned himself without peril to vehement desires, the days when he had not yet condemned all human enjoyment. As he walked he beheld Pauline\u2014not the Pauline of the Hotel Saint-Quentin, but the Pauline of last evening. Here was the accomplished mistress he had so often dreamed of, the intelligent young girl with the loving nature and artistic temperament, who understood poets, who understood poetry, and lived in luxurious surroundings. Here, in short, was Foedora, gifted with a great soul; or Pauline become a countess, and twice a millionaire, as Foedora had been. When he reached the worn threshold, and stood upon the broken step at the door, where in the old days he had had so many desperate thoughts, an old woman came out of the room within and spoke to him.\n\n\"You are M. Raphael de Valentin, are you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, good mother,\" he replied.\n\n\"You know your old room then,\" she replied; \"you are expected up there.\"\n\n\"Does Mme. Gaudin still own the house?\" Raphael asked.\n\n\"Oh no, sir. Mme. Gaudin is a baroness now. She lives in a fine house of her own on the other side of the river. Her husband has come back. My goodness, he brought back thousands and thousands. They say she could buy up all the Quartier Saint-Jacques if she liked. She gave me her basement room for nothing, and the remainder of her lease. Ah, she's a kind woman all the same; she is no more proud to-day than she was yesterday.\"\n\nRaphael hurried up the staircase to his garret; as he reached the last few steps he heard the sounds of a piano. Pauline was there, simply dressed in a cotton gown, but the way that it was made, like the gloves, hat, and shawl that she had thrown carelessly upon the bed, revealed a change of fortune.\n\n\"Ah, there you are!\" cried Pauline, turning her head, and rising with unconcealed delight.\n\nRaphael went to sit beside her, flushed, confused, and happy; he looked at her in silence.\n\n\"Why did you leave us then?\" she asked, dropping her eyes as the flush deepened on his face. \"What became of you?\"\n\n\"Ah, I have been very miserable, Pauline; I am very miserable still.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" she said, filled with pitying tenderness. \"I guessed your fate yesterday when I saw you so well dressed, and apparently so wealthy; but in reality? Eh, M. Raphael, is it as it always used to be with you?\"\n\nValentin could not restrain the tears that sprang to his eyes.\n\n\"Pauline,\" he exclaimed, \"I\u2014\u2014\"\n\nHe went no further, love sparkled in his eyes, and his emotion overflowed his face.\n\n\"Oh, he loves me! he loves me!\" cried Pauline.\n\nRaphael felt himself unable to say one word; he bent his head. The young girl took his hand at this; she pressed it as she said, half sobbing and half laughing:\u2014\n\n\"Rich, rich, happy and rich! Your Pauline is rich. But I? Oh, I ought to be very poor to-day. I have said, times without number, that I would give all the wealth upon this earth for those words, 'He loves me!' O my Raphael! I have millions. You like luxury, you will be glad; but you must love me and my heart besides, for there is so much love for you in my heart. You don't know? My father has come back. I am a wealthy heiress. Both he and my mother leave me completely free to decide my own fate. I am free\u2014do you understand?\"\n\nSeized with a kind of frenzy, Raphael grasped Pauline's hands and kissed them eagerly and vehemently, with an almost convulsive caress. Pauline drew her hands away, laid them on Raphael's shoulders, and drew him towards her. They understood one another\u2014in that close embrace, in the unalloyed and sacred fervor of that one kiss without an afterthought\u2014the first kiss by which two souls take possession of each other.\n\n\"Ah, I will not leave you any more,\" said Pauline, falling back in her chair. \"I do not know how I come to be so bold!\" she added, blushing.\n\n\"Bold, my Pauline? Do not fear it. It is love, love true and deep and everlasting like my own, is it not?\"\n\n\"Speak!\" she cried. \"Go on speaking, so long your lips have been dumb for me.\"\n\n\"Then you have loved me all along?\"\n\n\"Loved you? Mon Dieu! How often I have wept here, setting your room straight, and grieving for your poverty and my own. I would have sold myself to the evil one to spare you one vexation! You are MY Raphael to-day, really my own Raphael, with that handsome head of yours, and your heart is mine too; yes, that above all, your heart\u2014O wealth inexhaustible! Well, where was I?\" she went on after a pause. \"Oh yes! We have three, four, or five millions, I believe. If I were poor, I should perhaps desire to bear your name, to be acknowledged as your wife; but as it is, I would give up the whole world for you, I would be your servant still, now and always. Why, Raphael, if I give you my fortune, my heart, myself to-day, I do no more than I did that day when I put a certain five-franc piece in the drawer there,\" and she pointed to the table. \"Oh, how your exultation hurt me then!\"\n\n\"Oh, why are you rich?\" Raphael cried; \"why is there no vanity in you? I can do nothing for you.\"\n\nHe wrung his hands in despair and happiness and love.\n\n\"When you are the Marquise de Valentin, I know that the title and the fortune for thee, heavenly soul, will not be worth\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"One hair of your head,\" she cried.\n\n\"I have millions too. But what is wealth to either of us now? There is my life\u2014ah, that I can offer, take it.\"\n\n\"Your love, Raphael, your love is all the world to me. Are your thoughts of me? I am the happiest of the happy!\"\n\n\"Can any one overhear us?\" asked Raphael.\n\n\"Nobody,\" she replied, and a mischievous gesture escaped her.\n\n\"Come, then!\" cried Valentin, holding out his arms.\n\nShe sprang upon his knees and clasped her arms about his neck.\n\n\"Kiss me!\" she cried, \"after all the pain you have given me; to blot out the memory of the grief that your joys have caused me; and for the sake of the nights that I spent in painting hand-screens\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Those hand-screens of yours?\"\n\n\"Now that we are rich, my darling, I can tell you all about it. Poor boy! how easy it is to delude a clever man! Could you have had white waistcoats and clean shirts twice a week for three francs every month to the laundress? Why, you used to drink twice as much milk as your money would have paid for. I deceived you all round\u2014over firing, oil, and even money. O Raphael mine, don't have me for your wife, I am far too cunning!\" she said laughing.\n\n\"But how did you manage?\"\n\n\"I used to work till two o'clock in the morning; I gave my mother half the money made by my screens, and the other half went to you.\"\n\nThey looked at one another for a moment, both bewildered by love and gladness.\n\n\"Some day we shall have to pay for this happiness by some terrible sorrow,\" cried Raphael.\n\n\"Perhaps you are married?\" said Pauline. \"Oh, I will not give you up to any other woman.\"\n\n\"I am free, my beloved.\"\n\n\"Free!\" she repeated. \"Free, and mine!\"\n\nShe slipped down upon her knees, clasped her hands, and looked at Raphael in an enthusiasm of devotion.\n\n\"I am afraid I shall go mad. How handsome you are!\" she went on, passing her fingers through her lover's fair hair. \"How stupid your Countess Foedora is! How pleased I was yesterday with the homage they all paid to me! SHE has never been applauded. Dear, when I felt your arm against my back, I heard a vague voice within me that cried, 'He is there!' and I turned round and saw you. I fled, for I longed so to throw my arms about you before them all.\"\n\n\"How happy you are\u2014you can speak!\" Raphael exclaimed. \"My heart is overwhelmed; I would weep, but I cannot. Do not draw your hand away. I could stay here looking at you like this for the rest of my life, I think; happy and content.\"\n\n\"O my love, say that once more!\"\n\n\"Ah, what are words?\" answered Valentin, letting a hot tear fall on Pauline's hands. \"Some time I will try to tell you of my love; just now I can only feel it.\"\n\n\"You,\" she said, \"with your lofty soul and your great genius, with that heart of yours that I know so well; are you really mine, as I am yours?\"\n\n\"For ever and ever, my sweet creature,\" said Raphael in an uncertain voice. \"You shall be my wife, my protecting angel. My griefs have always been dispelled by your presence, and my courage revived; that angelic smile now on your lips has purified me, so to speak. A new life seems about to begin for me. The cruel past and my wretched follies are hardly more to me than evil dreams. At your side I breathe an atmosphere of happiness, and I am pure. Be with me always,\" he added, pressing her solemnly to his beating heart.\n\n\"Death may come when it will,\" said Pauline in ecstasy; \"I have lived!\"\n\nHappy he who shall divine their joy, for he must have experienced it.\n\n\"I wish that no one might enter this dear garret again, my Raphael,\" said Pauline, after two hours of silence.\n\n\"We must have the door walled up, put bars across the window, and buy the house,\" the Marquis answered.\n\n\"Yes, we will,\" she said. Then a moment later she added: \"Our search for your manuscripts has been a little lost sight of,\" and they both laughed like children.\n\n\"Pshaw! I don't care a jot for the whole circle of the sciences,\" Raphael answered.\n\n\"Ah, sir, and how about glory?\"\n\n\"I glory in you alone.\"\n\n\"You used to be very miserable as you made these little scratches and scrawls,\" she said, turning the papers over.\n\n\"My Pauline\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I am your Pauline\u2014and what then?\"\n\n\"Where are you living now?\"\n\n\"In the Rue Saint Lazare. And you?\"\n\n\"In the Rue de Varenne.\"\n\n\"What a long way apart we shall be until\u2014\u2014\" She stopped, and looked at her lover with a mischievous and coquettish expression.\n\n\"But at the most we need only be separated for a fortnight,\" Raphael answered.\n\n\"Really! we are to be married in a fortnight?\" and she jumped for joy like a child.\n\n\"I am an unnatural daughter!\" she went on. \"I give no more thought to my father or my mother, or to anything in the world. Poor love, you don't know that my father is very ill? He returned from the Indies in very bad health. He nearly died at Havre, where we went to find him. Good heavens!\" she cried, looking at her watch; \"it is three o'clock already! I ought to be back again when he wakes at four. I am mistress of the house at home; my mother does everything that I wish, and my father worships me; but I will not abuse their kindness, that would be wrong. My poor father! He would have me go to the Italiens yesterday. You will come to see him to-morrow, will you not?\"\n\n\"Will Madame la Marquise de Valentin honor me by taking my arm?\"\n\n\"I am going to take the key of this room away with me,\" she said. \"Isn't our treasure-house a palace?\"\n\n\"One more kiss, Pauline.\"\n\n\"A thousand, mon Dieu!\" she said, looking at Raphael. \"Will it always be like this? I feel as if I were dreaming.\"\n\nThey went slowly down the stairs together, step for step, with arms closely linked, trembling both of them beneath their load of joy. Each pressing close to the other's side, like a pair of doves, they reached the Place de la Sorbonne, where Pauline's carriage was waiting.\n\n\"I want to go home with you,\" she said. \"I want to see your own room and your study, and to sit at the table where you work. It will be like old times,\" she said, blushing.\n\nShe spoke to the servant. \"Joseph, before returning home I am going to the Rue de Varenne. It is a quarter-past three now, and I must be back by four o'clock. George must hurry the horses.\" And so in a few moments the lovers came to Valentin's abode.\n\n\"How glad I am to have seen all this for myself!\" Pauline cried, creasing the silken bed-curtains in Raphael's room between her fingers. \"As I go to sleep, I shall be here in thought. I shall imagine your dear head on the pillow there. Raphael, tell me, did no one advise you about the furniture of your hotel?\"\n\n\"No one whatever.\"\n\n\"Really? It was not a woman who\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Pauline!\"\n\n\"Oh, I know I am fearfully jealous. You have good taste. I will have a bed like yours to-morrow.\"\n\nQuite beside himself with happiness, Raphael caught Pauline in his arms.\n\n\"Oh, my father!\" she said; \"my father\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"I will take you back to him,\" cried Valentin, \"for I want to be away from you as little as possible.\"\n\n\"How loving you are! I did not venture to suggest it\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Are you not my life?\"\n\nIt would be tedious to set down accurately the charming prattle of the lovers, for tones and looks and gestures that cannot be rendered alone gave it significance. Valentin went back with Pauline to her own door, and returned with as much happiness in his heart as mortal man can know.\n\nWhen he was seated in his armchair beside the fire, thinking over the sudden and complete way in which his wishes had been fulfilled, a cold shiver went through him, as if the blade of a dagger had been plunged into his breast\u2014he thought of the Magic Skin, and saw that it had shrunk a little. He uttered the most tremendous of French oaths, without any of the Jesuitical reservations made by the Abbess of Andouillettes, leant his head against the back of the chair, and sat motionless, fixing his unseeing eyes upon the bracket of the curtain pole.\n\n\"Good God!\" he cried; \"every wish! Every desire of mine! Poor Pauline!\u2014\u2014\"\n\nHe took a pair of compasses and measured the extent of existence that the morning had cost him.\n\n\"I have scarcely enough for two months!\" he said.\n\nA cold sweat broke out over him; moved by an ungovernable spasm of rage, he seized the Magic Skin, exclaiming:\n\n\"I am a perfect fool!\"\n\nHe rushed out of the house and across the garden, and flung the talisman down a well.\n\n\"Vogue la galere,\" cried he. \"The devil take all this nonsense.\"\n\nSo Raphael gave himself up to the happiness of being beloved, and led with Pauline the life of heart and heart. Difficulties which it would be somewhat tedious to describe had delayed their marriage, which was to take place early in March. Each was sure of the other; their affection had been tried, and happiness had taught them how strong it was. Never has love made two souls, two natures, so absolutely one. The more they came to know of each other, the more they loved. On either side there was the same hesitating delicacy, the same transports of joy such as angels know; there were no clouds in their heaven; the will of either was the other's law.\n\nWealthy as they both were, they had not a caprice which they could not gratify, and for that reason had no caprices. A refined taste, a feeling for beauty and poetry, was instinct in the soul of the bride; her lover's smile was more to her than all the pearls of Ormuz. She disdained feminine finery; a muslin dress and flowers formed her most elaborate toilette.\n\nPauline and Raphael shunned every one else, for solitude was abundantly beautiful to them. The idlers at the Opera, or at the Italiens, saw this charming and unconventional pair evening after evening. Some gossip went the round of the salons at first, but the harmless lovers were soon forgotten in the course of events which took place in Paris; their marriage was announced at length to excuse them in the eyes of the prudish; and as it happened, their servants did not babble; so their bliss did not draw down upon them any very severe punishment.\n\nOne morning towards the end of February, at the time when the brightening days bring a belief in the nearness of the joys of spring, Pauline and Raphael were breakfasting together in a small conservatory, a kind of drawing-room filled with flowers, on a level with the garden. The mild rays of the pale winter sunlight, breaking through the thicket of exotic plants, warmed the air somewhat. The vivid contrast made by the varieties of foliage, the colors of the masses of flowering shrubs, the freaks of light and shadow, gladdened the eyes. While all the rest of Paris still sought warmth from its melancholy hearth, these two were laughing in a bower of camellias, lilacs, and blossoming heath. Their happy faces rose above lilies of the valley, narcissus blooms, and Bengal roses. A mat of plaited African grass, variegated like a carpet, lay beneath their feet in this luxurious conservatory. The walls, covered with a green linen material, bore no traces of damp. The surfaces of the rustic wooden furniture shone with cleanliness. A kitten, attracted by the odor of milk, had established itself upon the table; it allowed Pauline to bedabble it in coffee; she was playing merrily with it, taking away the cream that she had just allowed the kitten to sniff at, so as to exercise its patience, and keep up the contest. She burst out laughing at every antic, and by the comical remarks she constantly made, she hindered Raphael from perusing the paper; he had dropped it a dozen times already. This morning picture seemed to overflow with inexpressible gladness, like everything that is natural and genuine.\n\nRaphael, still pretending to read his paper, furtively watched Pauline with the cat\u2014his Pauline, in the dressing-gown that hung carelessly about her; his Pauline, with her hair loose on her shoulders, with a tiny, white, blue-veined foot peeping out of a velvet slipper. It was pleasant to see her in this negligent dress; she was delightful as some fanciful picture by Westall; half-girl, half-woman, as she seemed to be, or perhaps more of a girl than a woman, there was no alloy in the happiness she enjoyed, and of love she knew as yet only its first ecstasy. When Raphael, absorbed in happy musing, had forgotten the existence of the newspaper, Pauline flew upon it, crumpled it up into a ball, and threw it out into the garden; the kitten sprang after the rotating object, which spun round and round, as politics are wont to do. This childish scene recalled Raphael to himself. He would have gone on reading, and felt for the sheet he no longer possessed. Joyous laughter rang out like the song of a bird, one peal leading to another.\n\n\"I am quite jealous of the paper,\" she said, as she wiped away the tears that her childlike merriment had brought into her eyes. \"Now, is it not a heinous offence,\" she went on, as she became a woman all at once, \"to read Russian proclamations in my presence, and to attend to the prosings of the Emperor Nicholas rather than to looks and words of love!\"\n\n\"I was not reading, my dear angel; I was looking at you.\"\n\nJust then the gravel walk outside the conservatory rang with the sound of the gardener's heavily nailed boots.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, my Lord Marquis\u2014and yours, too, madame\u2014if I am intruding, but I have brought you a curiosity the like of which I never set eyes on. Drawing a bucket of water just now, with due respect, I got out this strange salt-water plant. Here it is. It must be thoroughly used to water, anyhow, for it isn't saturated or even damp at all. It is as dry as a piece of wood, and has not swelled a bit. As my Lord Marquis certainly knows a great deal more about things than I do, I thought I ought to bring it, and that it would interest him.\"\n\nTherewith the gardener showed Raphael the inexorable piece of skin; there were barely six square inches of it left.\n\n\"Thanks, Vaniere,\" Raphael said. \"The thing is very curious.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with you, my angel; you are growing quite white!\" Pauline cried.\n\n\"You can go, Vaniere.\"\n\n\"Your voice frightens me,\" the girl went on; \"it is so strangely altered. What is it? How are you feeling? Where is the pain? You are in pain!\u2014Jonathan! here! call a doctor!\" she cried.\n\n\"Hush, my Pauline,\" Raphael answered, as he regained composure. \"Let us get up and go. Some flower here has a scent that is too much for me. It is that verbena, perhaps.\"\n\nPauline flew upon the innocent plant, seized it by the stalk, and flung it out into the garden; then, with all the might of the love between them, she clasped Raphael in a close embrace, and with languishing coquetry raised her red lips to his for a kiss.\n\n\"Dear angel,\" she cried, \"when I saw you turn so white, I understood that I could not live on without you; your life is my life too. Lay your hand on my back, Raphael mine; I feel a chill like death. The feeling of cold is there yet. Your lips are burning. How is your hand?\u2014Cold as ice,\" she added.\n\n\"Mad girl!\" exclaimed Raphael.\n\n\"Why that tear? Let me drink it.\"\n\n\"O Pauline, Pauline, you love me far too much!\"\n\n\"There is something very extraordinary going on in your mind, Raphael! Do not dissimulate. I shall very soon find out your secret. Give that to me,\" she went on, taking the Magic Skin.\n\n\"You are my executioner!\" the young man exclaimed, glancing in horror at the talisman.\n\n\"How changed your voice is!\" cried Pauline, as she dropped the fatal symbol of destiny.\n\n\"Do you love me?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do I love you? Is there any doubt?\"\n\n\"Then, leave me, go away!\"\n\nThe poor child went.\n\n\"So!\" cried Raphael, when he was alone. \"In an enlightened age, when we have found out that diamonds are a crystallized form of charcoal, at a time when everything is made clear, when the police would hale a new Messiah before the magistrates, and submit his miracles to the Academie des Sciences\u2014in an epoch when we no longer believe in anything but a notary's signature\u2014that I, forsooth, should believe in a sort of Mene, Tekel, Upharsin! No, by Heaven, I will not believe that the Supreme Being would take pleasure in torturing a harmless creature.\u2014Let us see the learned about it.\"\n\nBetween the Halle des Vins, with its extensive assembly of barrels, and the Salpetriere, that extensive seminary of drunkenness, lies a small pond, which Raphael soon reached. All sorts of ducks of rare varieties were there disporting themselves; their colored markings shone in the sun like the glass in cathedral windows. Every kind of duck in the world was represented, quacking, dabbling, and moving about\u2014a kind of parliament of ducks assembled against its will, but luckily without either charter or political principles, living in complete immunity from sportsmen, under the eyes of any naturalist that chanced to see them.\n\n\"That is M. Lavrille,\" said one of the keepers to Raphael, who had asked for that high priest of zoology.\n\nThe Marquis saw a short man buried in profound reflections, caused by the appearance of a pair of ducks. The man of science was middle-aged; he had a pleasant face, made pleasanter still by a kindly expression, but an absorption in scientific ideas engrossed his whole person. His peruke was strangely turned up, by being constantly raised to scratch his head; so that a line of white hair was left plainly visible, a witness to an enthusiasm for investigation, which, like every other strong passion, so withdraws us from mundane considerations, that we lose all consciousness of the \"I\" within us. Raphael, the student and man of science, looked respectfully at the naturalist, who devoted his nights to enlarging the limits of human knowledge, and whose very errors reflected glory upon France; but a she-coxcomb would have laughed, no doubt, at the break of continuity between the breeches and striped waistcoat worn by the man of learning; the interval, moreover, was modestly filled by a shirt which had been considerably creased, for he stooped and raised himself by turns, as his zoological observations required.\n\nAfter the first interchange of civilities, Raphael thought it necessary to pay M. Lavrille a banal compliment upon his ducks.\n\n\"Oh, we are well off for ducks,\" the naturalist replied. \"The genus, moreover, as you doubtless know, is the most prolific in the order of palmipeds. It begins with the swan and ends with the zin-zin duck, comprising in all one hundred and thirty-seven very distinct varieties, each having its own name, habits, country, and character, and every one no more like another than a white man is like a negro. Really, sir, when we dine off a duck, we have no notion for the most part of the vast extent\u2014\u2014\"\n\nHe interrupted himself as he saw a small pretty duck come up to the surface of the pond.\n\n\"There you see the cravatted swan, a poor native of Canada; he has come a very long way to show us his brown and gray plumage and his little black cravat! Look, he is preening himself. That one is the famous eider duck that provides the down, the eider-down under which our fine ladies sleep; isn't it pretty? Who would not admire the little pinkish white breast and the green beak? I have just been a witness, sir,\" he went on, \"to a marriage that I had long despaired of bringing about; they have paired rather auspiciously, and I shall await the results very eagerly. This will be a hundred and thirty-eighth species, I flatter myself, to which, perhaps, my name will be given. That is the newly matched pair,\" he said, pointing out two of the ducks; \"one of them is a laughing goose (anas albifrons), and the other the great whistling duck, Buffon's anas ruffina. I have hesitated a long while between the whistling duck, the duck with white eyebrows, and the shoveler duck (anas clypeata). Stay, that is the shoveler\u2014that fat, brownish black rascal, with the greenish neck and that coquettish iridescence on it. But the whistling duck was a crested one, sir, and you will understand that I deliberated no longer. We only lack the variegated black-capped duck now. These gentlemen here, unanimously claim that that variety of duck is only a repetition of the curve-beaked teal, but for my own part,\"\u2014and the gesture he made was worth seeing. It expressed at once the modesty and pride of a man of science; the pride full of obstinacy, and the modesty well tempered with assurance.\n\n\"I don't think it is,\" he added. \"You see, my dear sir, that we are not amusing ourselves here. I am engaged at this moment upon a monograph on the genus duck. But I am at your disposal.\"\n\nWhile they went towards a rather pleasant house in the Rue du Buffon, Raphael submitted the skin to M. Lavrille's inspection.\n\n\"I know the product,\" said the man of science, when he had turned his magnifying glass upon the talisman. \"It used to be used for covering boxes. The shagreen is very old. They prefer to use skate's skin nowadays for making sheaths. This, as you are doubtless aware, is the hide of the raja sephen, a Red Sea fish.\"\n\n\"But this, sir, since you are so exceedingly good\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"This,\" the man of science interrupted, as he resumed, \"this is quite another thing; between these two shagreens, sir, there is a difference just as wide as between sea and land, or fish and flesh. The fish's skin is harder, however, than the skin of the land animal. This,\" he said, as he indicated the talisman, \"is, as you doubtless know, one of the most curious of zoological products.\"\n\n\"But to proceed\u2014\u2014\" said Raphael.\n\n\"This,\" replied the man of science, as he flung himself down into his armchair, \"is an ass' skin, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said the young man.\n\n\"A very rare variety of ass found in Persia,\" the naturalist continued, \"the onager of the ancients, equus asinus, the koulan of the Tartars; Pallas went out there to observe it, and has made it known to science, for as a matter of fact the animal for a long time was believed to be mythical. It is mentioned, as you know, in Holy Scripture; Moses forbade that it should be coupled with its own species, and the onager is yet more famous for the prostitutions of which it was the object, and which are often mentioned by the prophets of the Bible. Pallas, as you know doubtless, states in his Act. Petrop. tome II., that these bizarre excesses are still devoutly believed in among the Persians and the Nogais as a sovereign remedy for lumbago and sciatic gout. We poor Parisians scarcely believe that. The Museum has no example of the onager.\n\n\"What a magnificent animal!\" he continued. \"It is full of mystery; its eyes are provided with a sort of burnished covering, to which the Orientals attribute the powers of fascination; it has a glossier and finer coat than our handsomest horses possess, striped with more or less tawny bands, very much like the zebra's hide. There is something pliant and silky about its hair, which is sleek to the touch. Its powers of sight vie in precision and accuracy with those of man; it is rather larger than our largest domestic donkeys, and is possessed of extraordinary courage. If it is surprised by any chance, it defends itself against the most dangerous wild beasts with remarkable success; the rapidity of its movements can only be compared with the flight of birds; an onager, sir, would run the best Arab or Persian horses to death. According to the father of the conscientious Doctor Niebuhr, whose recent loss we are deploring, as you doubtless know, the ordinary average pace of one of these wonderful creatures would be seven thousand geometric feet per hour. Our own degenerate race of donkeys can give no idea of the ass in his pride and independence. He is active and spirited in his demeanor; he is cunning and sagacious; there is grace about the outlines of his head; every movement is full of attractive charm. In the East he is the king of beasts. Turkish and Persian superstition even credits him with a mysterious origin; and when stories of the prowess attributed to him are told in Thibet or in Tartary, the speakers mingle Solomon's name with that of this noble animal. A tame onager, in short, is worth an enormous amount; it is well-nigh impossible to catch them among the mountains, where they leap like roebucks, and seem as if they could fly like birds. Our myth of the winged horse, our Pegasus, had its origin doubtless in these countries, where the shepherds could see the onager springing from one rock to another. In Persia they breed asses for the saddle, a cross between a tamed onager and a she-ass, and they paint them red, following immemorial tradition. Perhaps it was this custom that gave rise to our own proverb, 'Surely as a red donkey.' At some period when natural history was much neglected in France, I think a traveler must have brought over one of these strange beasts that endures servitude with such impatience. Hence the adage. The skin that you have laid before me is the skin of an onager. Opinions differ as to the origin of the name. Some claim that Chagri is a Turkish word; others insist that Chagri must be the name of the place where this animal product underwent the chemical process of preparation so clearly described by Pallas, to which the peculiar graining that we admire is due; Martellens has written to me saying that Chaagri is a river\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir, for the information that you have given me; it would furnish an admirable footnote for some Dom Calmet or other, if such erudite hermits yet exist; but I have had the honor of pointing out to you that this scrap was in the first instance quite as large as that map,\" said Raphael, indicating an open atlas to Lavrille; \"but it has shrunk visibly in three months' time\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said the man of science. \"I understand. The remains of any substance primarily organic are naturally subject to a process of decay. It is quite easy to understand, and its progress depends upon atmospherical conditions. Even metals contract and expand appreciably, for engineers have remarked somewhat considerable interstices between great blocks of stone originally clamped together with iron bars. The field of science is boundless, but human life is very short, so that we do not claim to be acquainted with all the phenomena of nature.\"\n\n\"Pardon the question that I am about to ask you, sir,\" Raphael began, half embarrassed, \"but are you quite sure that this piece of skin is subject to the ordinary laws of zoology, and that it can be stretched?\"\n\n\"Certainly\u2014\u2014oh, bother!\u2014\u2014\" muttered M. Lavrille, trying to stretch the talisman. \"But if you, sir, will go to see Planchette,\" he added, \"the celebrated professor of mechanics, he will certainly discover some method of acting upon this skin, of softening and expanding it.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir, you are the preserver of my life,\" and Raphael took leave of the learned naturalist and hurried off to Planchette, leaving the worthy Lavrille in his study, all among the bottles and dried plants that filled it up.\n\nQuite unconsciously Raphael brought away with him from this visit, all of science that man can grasp, a terminology to wit. Lavrille, the worthy man, was very much like Sancho Panza giving to Don Quixote the history of the goats; he was entertaining himself by making out a list of animals and ticking them off. Even now that his life was nearing its end, he was scarcely acquainted with a mere fraction of the countless numbers of the great tribes that God has scattered, for some unknown end, throughout the ocean of worlds.\n\nRaphael was well pleased. \"I shall keep my ass well in hand,\" cried he. Sterne had said before his day, \"Let us take care of our ass, if we wish to live to old age.\" But it is such a fantastic brute!\n\nPlanchette was a tall, thin man, a poet of a surety, lost in one continual thought, and always employed in gazing into the bottomless abyss of Motion. Commonplace minds accuse these lofty intellects of madness; they form a misinterpreted race apart that lives in a wonderful carelessness of luxuries or other people's notions. They will spend whole days at a stretch, smoking a cigar that has gone out, and enter a drawing-room with the buttons on their garments not in every case formally wedded to the button-holes. Some day or other, after a long time spent in measuring space, or in accumulating Xs under Aa-Gg, they succeed in analyzing some natural law, and resolve it into its elemental principles, and all on a sudden the crowd gapes at a new machine; or it is a handcart perhaps that overwhelms us with astonishment by the apt simplicity of its construction. The modest man of science smiles at his admirers, and remarks, \"What is that invention of mine? Nothing whatever. Man cannot create a force; he can but direct it; and science consists in learning from nature.\"\n\nThe mechanician was standing bolt upright, planted on both feet, like some victim dropped straight from the gibbet, when Raphael broke in upon him. He was intently watching an agate ball that rolled over a sun-dial, and awaited its final settlement. The worthy man had received neither pension nor decoration; he had not known how to make the right use of his ability for calculation. He was happy in his life spent on the watch for a discovery; he had no thought either of reputation, of the outer world, nor even of himself, and led the life of science for the sake of science.\n\n\"It is inexplicable,\" he exclaimed. \"Ah, your servant, sir,\" he went on, becoming aware of Raphael's existence. \"How is your mother? You must go and see my wife.\"\n\n\"And I also could have lived thus,\" thought Raphael, as he recalled the learned man from his meditations by asking of him how to produce any effect on the talisman, which he placed before him.\n\n\"Although my credulity must amuse you, sir,\" so the Marquis ended, \"I will conceal nothing from you. That skin seems to me to be endowed with an insuperable power of resistance.\"\n\n\"People of fashion, sir, always treat science rather superciliously,\" said Planchette. \"They all talk to us pretty much as the incroyable did when he brought some ladies to see Lalande just after an eclipse, and remarked, 'Be so good as to begin it over again!' What effect do you want to produce? The object of the science of mechanics is either the application or the neutralization of the laws of motion. As for motion pure and simple, I tell you humbly, that we cannot possibly define it. That disposed of, unvarying phenomena have been observed which accompany the actions of solids and fluids. If we set up the conditions by which these phenomena are brought to pass, we can transport bodies or communicate locomotive power to them at a predetermined rate of speed. We can project them, divide them up in a few or an infinite number of pieces, accordingly as we break them or grind them to powder; we can twist bodies or make them rotate, modify, compress, expand, or extend them. The whole science, sir, rests upon a single fact.\n\n\"You see this ball,\" he went on; \"here it lies upon this slab. Now, it is over there. What name shall we give to what has taken place, so natural from a physical point of view, so amazing from a moral? Movement, locomotion, changing of place? What prodigious vanity lurks underneath the words. Does a name solve the difficulty? Yet it is the whole of our science for all that. Our machines either make direct use of this agency, this fact, or they convert it. This trifling phenomenon, applied to large masses, would send Paris flying. We can increase speed by an expenditure of force, and augment the force by an increase of speed. But what are speed and force? Our science is as powerless to tell us that as to create motion. Any movement whatever is an immense power, and man does not create power of any kind. Everything is movement, thought itself is a movement, upon movement nature is based. Death is a movement whose limitations are little known. If God is eternal, be sure that He moves perpetually; perhaps God is movement. That is why movement, like God is inexplicable, unfathomable, unlimited, incomprehensible, intangible. Who has ever touched, comprehended, or measured movement? We feel its effects without seeing it; we can even deny them as we can deny the existence of a God. Where is it? Where is it not? Whence comes it? What is its source? What is its end? It surrounds us, it intrudes upon us, and yet escapes us. It is evident as a fact, obscure as an abstraction; it is at once effect and cause. It requires space, even as we, and what is space? Movement alone recalls it to us; without movement, space is but an empty meaningless word. Like space, like creation, like the infinite, movement is an insoluble problem which confounds human reason; man will never conceive it, whatever else he may be permitted to conceive.\n\n\"Between each point in space occupied in succession by that ball,\" continued the man of science, \"there is an abyss confronting human reason, an abyss into which Pascal fell. In order to produce any effect upon an unknown substance, we ought first of all to study that substance; to know whether, in accordance with its nature, it will be broken by the force of a blow, or whether it will withstand it; if it breaks in pieces, and you have no wish to split it up, we shall not achieve the end proposed. If you want to compress it, a uniform impulse must be communicated to all the particles of the substance, so as to diminish the interval that separates them in an equal degree. If you wish to expand it, we should try to bring a uniform eccentric force to bear on every molecule; for unless we conform accurately to this law, we shall have breaches in continuity. The modes of motion, sir, are infinite, and no limit exists to combinations of movement. Upon what effect have you determined?\"\n\n\"I want any kind of pressure that is strong enough to expand the skin indefinitely,\" began Raphael, quite of out patience.\n\n\"Substance is finite,\" the mathematician put in, \"and therefore will not admit of indefinite expansion, but pressure will necessarily increase the extent of surface at the expense of the thickness, which will be diminished until the point is reached when the material gives out\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Bring about that result, sir,\" Raphael cried, \"and you will have earned millions.\"\n\n\"Then I should rob you of your money,\" replied the other, phlegmatic as a Dutchman. \"I am going to show you, in a word or two, that a machine can be made that is fit to crush Providence itself in pieces like a fly. It would reduce a man to the conditions of a piece of waste paper; a man\u2014boots and spurs, hat and cravat, trinkets and gold, and all\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"What a fearful machine!\"\n\n\"Instead of flinging their brats into the water, the Chinese ought to make them useful in this way,\" the man of science went on, without reflecting on the regard man has for his progeny.\n\nQuite absorbed by his idea, Planchette took an empty flower-pot, with a hole in the bottom, and put it on the surface of the dial, then he went to look for a little clay in a corner of the garden. Raphael stood spellbound, like a child to whom his nurse is telling some wonderful story. Planchette put the clay down upon the slab, drew a pruning-knife from his pocket, cut two branches from an elder tree, and began to clean them of pith by blowing through them, as if Raphael had not been present.\n\n\"There are the rudiments of the apparatus,\" he said. Then he connected one of the wooden pipes with the bottom of the flower-pot by way of a clay joint, in such a way that the mouth of the elder stem was just under the hole of the flower-pot; you might have compared it to a big tobacco-pipe. He spread a bed of clay over the surface of the slab, in a shovel-shaped mass, set down the flower-pot at the wider end of it, and laid the pipe of the elder stem along the portion which represented the handle of the shovel. Next he put a lump of clay at the end of the elder stem and therein planted the other pipe, in an upright position, forming a second elbow which connected it with the first horizontal pipe in such a manner that the air, or any given fluid in circulation, could flow through this improvised piece of mechanism from the mouth of the vertical tube, along the intermediate passages, and so into the large empty flower-pot.\n\n\"This apparatus, sir,\" he said to Raphael, with all the gravity of an academician pronouncing his initiatory discourse, \"is one of the great Pascal's grandest claims upon our admiration.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\nThe man of science smiled. He went up to a fruit-tree and took down a little phial in which the druggist had sent him some liquid for catching ants; he broke off the bottom and made a funnel of the top, carefully fitting it to the mouth of the vertical hollowed stem that he had set in the clay, and at the opposite end to the great reservoir, represented by the flower-pot. Next, by means of a watering-pot, he poured in sufficient water to rise to the same level in the large vessel and in the tiny circular funnel at the end of the elder stem.\n\nRaphael was thinking of his piece of skin.\n\n\"Water is considered to-day, sir, to be an incompressible body,\" said the mechanician; \"never lose sight of that fundamental principle; still it can be compressed, though only so very slightly that we should regard its faculty for contracting as a zero. You see the amount of surface presented by the water at the brim of the flower-pot?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Very good; now suppose that that surface is a thousand times larger than the orifice of the elder stem through which I poured the liquid. Here, I am taking the funnel away\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Granted.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if by any method whatever I increase the volume of that quantity of water by pouring in yet more through the mouth of the little tube; the water thus compelled to flow downwards would rise in the reservoir, represented by the flower-pot, until it reached the same level at either end.\"\n\n\"That is quite clear,\" cried Raphael.\n\n\"But there is this difference,\" the other went on. \"Suppose that the thin column of water poured into the little vertical tube there exerts a force equal, say, to a pound weight, for instance, its action will be punctually communicated to the great body of the liquid, and will be transmitted to every part of the surface represented by the water in the flower-pot so that at the surface there will be a thousand columns of water, every one pressing upwards as if they were impelled by a force equal to that which compels the liquid to descend in the vertical tube; and of necessity they reproduce here,\" said Planchette, indicating to Raphael the top of the flower-pot, \"the force introduced over there, a thousand-fold,\" and the man of science pointed out to the marquis the upright wooden pipe set in the clay.\n\n\"That is quite simple,\" said Raphael.\n\nPlanchette smiled again.\n\n\"In other words,\" he went on, with the mathematician's natural stubborn propensity for logic, \"in order to resist the force of the incoming water, it would be necessary to exert, upon every part of the large surface, a force equal to that brought into action in the vertical column, but with this difference\u2014if the column of liquid is a foot in height, the thousand little columns of the wide surface will only have a very slight elevating power.\n\n\"Now,\" said Planchette, as he gave a fillip to his bits of stick, \"let us replace this funny little apparatus by steel tubes of suitable strength and dimensions; and if you cover the liquid surface of the reservoir with a strong sliding plate of metal, and if to this metal plate you oppose another, solid enough and strong enough to resist any test; if, furthermore, you give me the power of continually adding water to the volume of liquid contents by means of the little vertical tube, the object fixed between the two solid metal plates must of necessity yield to the tremendous crushing force which indefinitely compresses it. The method of continually pouring in water through a little tube, like the manner of communicating force through the volume of the liquid to a small metal plate, is an absurdly primitive mechanical device. A brace of pistons and a few valves would do it all. Do you perceive, my dear sir,\" he said taking Valentin by the arm, \"there is scarcely a substance in existence that would not be compelled to dilate when fixed in between these two indefinitely resisting surfaces?\"\n\n\"What! the author of the Lettres provinciales invented it?\" Raphael exclaimed.\n\n\"He and no other, sir. The science of mechanics knows no simpler nor more beautiful contrivance. The opposite principle, the capacity of expansion possessed by water, has brought the steam-engine into being. But water will only expand up to a certain point, while its incompressibility, being a force in a manner negative, is, of necessity, infinite.\"\n\n\"If this skin is expanded,\" said Raphael, \"I promise you to erect a colossal statue to Blaise Pascal; to found a prize of a hundred thousand francs to be offered every ten years for the solution of the grandest problem of mechanical science effected during the interval; to find dowries for all your cousins and second cousins, and finally to build an asylum on purpose for impoverished or insane mathematicians.\"\n\n\"That would be exceedingly useful,\" Planchette replied. \"We will go to Spieghalter to-morrow, sir,\" he continued, with the serenity of a man living on a plane wholly intellectual. \"That distinguished mechanic has just completed, after my own designs, an improved mechanical arrangement by which a child could get a thousand trusses of hay inside his cap.\"\n\n\"Then good-bye till to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Till to-morrow, sir.\"\n\n\"Talk of mechanics!\" cried Raphael; \"isn't it the greatest of the sciences? The other fellow with his onagers, classifications, ducks, and species, and his phials full of bottled monstrosities, is at best only fit for a billiard-marker in a saloon.\"\n\nThe next morning Raphael went off in great spirits to find Planchette, and together they set out for the Rue de la Sante\u2014auspicious appellation! Arrived at Spieghalter's, the young man found himself in a vast foundry; his eyes lighted upon a multitude of glowing and roaring furnaces. There was a storm of sparks, a deluge of nails, an ocean of pistons, vices, levers, valves, girders, files, and nuts; a sea of melted metal, baulks of timber and bar-steel. Iron filings filled your throat. There was iron in the atmosphere; the men were covered with it; everything reeked of iron. The iron seemed to be a living organism; it became a fluid, moved, and seemed to shape itself intelligently after every fashion, to obey the worker's every caprice. Through the uproar made by the bellows, the crescendo of the falling hammers, and the shrill sounds of the lathes that drew groans from the steel, Raphael passed into a large, clean, and airy place where he was able to inspect at his leisure the great press that Planchette had told him about. He admired the cast-iron beams, as one might call them, and the twin bars of steel coupled together with indestructible bolts.\n\n\"If you were to give seven rapid turns to that crank,\" said Spieghalter, pointing out a beam of polished steel, \"you would make a steel bar spurt out in thousands of jets, that would get into your legs like needles.\"\n\n\"The deuce!\" exclaimed Raphael.\n\nPlanchette himself slipped the piece of skin between the metal plates of the all-powerful press; and, brimful of the certainty of a scientific conviction, he worked the crank energetically.\n\n\"Lie flat, all of you; we are dead men!\" thundered Spieghalter, as he himself fell prone on the floor.\n\nA hideous shrieking sound rang through the workshops. The water in the machine had broken the chamber, and now spouted out in a jet of incalculable force; luckily it went in the direction of an old furnace, which was overthrown, enveloped and carried away by a waterspout.\n\n\"Ha!\" remarked Planchette serenely, \"the piece of skin is as safe and sound as my eye. There was a flaw in your reservoir somewhere, or a crevice in the large tube\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"No, no; I know my reservoir. The devil is in your contrivance, sir; you can take it away,\" and the German pounced upon a smith's hammer, flung the skin down on an anvil, and, with all the strength that rage gives, dealt the talisman the most formidable blow that had ever resounded through his workshops.\n\n\"There is not so much as a mark on it!\" said Planchette, stroking the perverse bit of skin.\n\nThe workmen hurried in. The foreman took the skin and buried it in the glowing coal of a forge, while, in a semi-circle round the fire, they all awaited the action of a huge pair of bellows. Raphael, Spieghalter, and Professor Planchette stood in the midst of the grimy expectant crowd. Raphael, looking round on faces dusted over with iron filings, white eyes, greasy blackened clothing, and hairy chests, could have fancied himself transported into the wild nocturnal world of German ballad poetry. After the skin had been in the fire for ten minutes, the foreman pulled it out with a pair of pincers.\n\n\"Hand it over to me,\" said Raphael.\n\nThe foreman held it out by way of a joke. The Marquis readily handled it; it was cool and flexible between his fingers. An exclamation of alarm went up; the workmen fled in terror. Valentin was left alone with Planchette in the empty workshop.\n\n\"There is certainly something infernal in the thing!\" cried Raphael, in desperation. \"Is no human power able to give me one more day of existence?\"\n\n\"I made a mistake, sir,\" said the mathematician, with a penitent expression; \"we ought to have subjected that peculiar skin to the action of a rolling machine. Where could my eyes have been when I suggested compression!\"\n\n\"It was I that asked for it,\" Raphael answered.\n\nThe mathematician heaved a sigh of relief, like a culprit acquitted by a dozen jurors. Still, the strange problem afforded by the skin interested him; he meditated a moment, and then remarked:\n\n\"This unknown material ought to be treated chemically by re-agents. Let us call on Japhet\u2014perhaps the chemist may have better luck than the mechanic.\"\n\nValentin urged his horse into a rapid trot, hoping to find the chemist, the celebrated Japhet, in his laboratory.\n\n\"Well, old friend,\" Planchette began, seeing Japhet in his armchair, examining a precipitate; \"how goes chemistry?\"\n\n\"Gone to sleep. Nothing new at all. The Academie, however, has recognized the existence of salicine, but salicine, asparagine, vauqueline, and digitaline are not really discoveries\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Since you cannot invent substances,\" said Raphael, \"you are obliged to fall back on inventing names.\"\n\n\"Most emphatically true, young man.\"\n\n\"Here,\" said Planchette, addressing the chemist, \"try to analyze this composition; if you can extract any element whatever from it, I christen it diaboline beforehand, for we have just smashed a hydraulic press in trying to compress it.\"\n\n\"Let's see! let's have a look at it!\" cried the delighted chemist; \"it may, perhaps, be a fresh element.\"\n\n\"It is simply a piece of the skin of an ass, sir,\" said Raphael.\n\n\"Sir!\" said the illustrious chemist sternly.\n\n\"I am not joking,\" the Marquis answered, laying the piece of skin before him.\n\nBaron Japhet applied the nervous fibres of his tongue to the skin; he had skill in thus detecting salts, acids, alkalis, and gases. After several experiments, he remarked:\n\n\"No taste whatever! Come, we will give it a little fluoric acid to drink.\"\n\nSubjected to the influence of this ready solvent of animal tissue, the skin underwent no change whatsoever.\n\n\"It is not shagreen at all!\" the chemist cried. \"We will treat this unknown mystery as a mineral, and try its mettle by dropping it in a crucible where I have at this moment some red potash.\"\n\nJaphet went out, and returned almost immediately.\n\n\"Allow me to cut away a bit of this strange substance, sir,\" he said to Raphael; \"it is so extraordinary\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"A bit!\" exclaimed Raphael; \"not so much as a hair's-breadth. You may try, though,\" he added, half banteringly, half sadly.\n\nThe chemist broke a razor in his desire to cut the skin; he tried to break it by a powerful electric shock; next he submitted it to the influence of a galvanic battery; but all the thunderbolts his science wotted of fell harmless on the dreadful talisman.\n\nIt was seven o'clock in the evening. Planchette, Japhet, and Raphael, unaware of the flight of time, were awaiting the outcome of a final experiment. The Magic Skin emerged triumphant from a formidable encounter in which it had been engaged with a considerable quantity of chloride of nitrogen.\n\n\"It is all over with me,\" Raphael wailed. \"It is the finger of God! I shall die!\u2014\u2014\" and he left the two amazed scientific men.\n\n\"We must be very careful not to talk about this affair at the Academie; our colleagues there would laugh at us,\" Planchette remarked to the chemist, after a long pause, in which they looked at each other without daring to communicate their thoughts. The learned pair looked like two Christians who had issued from their tombs to find no God in the heavens. Science had been powerless; acids, so much clear water; red potash had been discredited; the galvanic battery and electric shock had been a couple of playthings.\n\n\"A hydraulic press broken like a biscuit!\" commented Planchette.\n\n\"I believe in the devil,\" said the Baron Japhet, after a moment's silence.\n\n\"And I in God,\" replied Planchette.\n\nEach spoke in character. The universe for a mechanician is a machine that requires an operator; for chemistry\u2014that fiendish employment of decomposing all things\u2014the world is a gas endowed with the power of movement.\n\n\"We cannot deny the fact,\" the chemist replied.\n\n\"Pshaw! those gentlemen the doctrinaires have invented a nebulous aphorism for our consolation\u2014Stupid as a fact.\"\n\n\"Your aphorism,\" said the chemist, \"seems to me as a fact very stupid.\"\n\nThey began to laugh, and went off to dine like folk for whom a miracle is nothing more than a phenomenon.\n\nValentin reached his own house shivering with rage and consumed with anger. He had no more faith in anything. Conflicting thoughts shifted and surged to and fro in his brain, as is the case with every man brought face to face with an inconceivable fact. He had readily believed in some hidden flaw in Spieghalter's apparatus; he had not been surprised by the incompetence and failure of science and of fire; but the flexibility of the skin as he handled it, taken with its stubbornness when all means of destruction that man possesses had been brought to bear upon it in vain\u2014these things terrified him. The incontrovertible fact made him dizzy.\n\n\"I am mad,\" he muttered. \"I have had no food since the morning, and yet I am neither hungry nor thirsty, and there is a fire in my breast that burns me.\"\n\nHe put back the skin in the frame where it had been enclosed but lately, drew a line in red ink about the actual configuration of the talisman, and seated himself in his armchair.\n\n\"Eight o'clock already!\" he exclaimed. \"To-day has gone like a dream.\"\n\nHe leaned his elbow on the arm of the chair, propped his head with his left hand, and so remained, lost in secret dark reflections and consuming thoughts that men condemned to die bear away with them.\n\n\"O Pauline!\" he cried. \"Poor child! there are gulfs that love can never traverse, despite the strength of his wings.\"\n\nJust then he very distinctly heard a smothered sigh, and knew by one of the most tender privileges of passionate love that it was Pauline's breathing.\n\n\"That is my death warrant,\" he said to himself. \"If she were there, I should wish to die in her arms.\"\n\nA burst of gleeful and hearty laughter made him turn his face towards the bed; he saw Pauline's face through the transparent curtains, smiling like a child for gladness over a successful piece of mischief. Her pretty hair fell over her shoulders in countless curls; she looked like a Bengal rose upon a pile of white roses.\n\n\"I cajoled Jonathan,\" said she. \"Doesn't the bed belong to me, to me who am your wife? Don't scold me, darling; I only wanted to surprise you, to sleep beside you. Forgive me for my freak.\"\n\nShe sprang out of bed like a kitten, showed herself gleaming in her lawn raiment, and sat down on Raphael's knee.\n\n\"Love, what gulf were you talking about?\" she said, with an anxious expression apparent upon her face.\n\n\"Death.\"\n\n\"You hurt me,\" she answered. \"There are some thoughts upon which we, poor women that we are, cannot dwell; they are death to us. Is it strength of love in us, or lack of courage? I cannot tell. Death does not frighten me,\" she began again, laughingly. \"To die with you, both together, to-morrow morning, in one last embrace, would be joy. It seems to me that even then I should have lived more than a hundred years. What does the number of days matter if we have spent a whole lifetime of peace and love in one night, in one hour?\"\n\n\"You are right; Heaven is speaking through that pretty mouth of yours. Grant that I may kiss you, and let us die,\" said Raphael.\n\n\"Then let us die,\" she said, laughing.\n\nTowards nine o'clock in the morning the daylight streamed through the chinks of the window shutters. Obscured somewhat by the muslin curtains, it yet sufficed to show clearly the rich colors of the carpet, the silks and furniture of the room, where the two lovers were lying asleep. The gilding sparkled here and there. A ray of sunshine fell and faded upon the soft down quilt that the freaks of live had thrown to the ground. The outlines of Pauline's dress, hanging from a cheval glass, appeared like a shadowy ghost. Her dainty shoes had been left at a distance from the bed. A nightingale came to perch upon the sill; its trills repeated over again, and the sounds of its wings suddenly shaken out for flight, awoke Raphael.\n\n\"For me to die,\" he said, following out a thought begun in his dream, \"my organization, the mechanism of flesh and bone, that is quickened by the will in me, and makes of me an individual MAN, must display some perceptible disease. Doctors ought to understand the symptoms of any attack on vitality, and could tell me whether I am sick or sound.\"\n\nHe gazed at his sleeping wife. She had stretched her head out to him, expressing in this way even while she slept the anxious tenderness of love. Pauline seemed to look at him as she lay with her face turned towards him in an attitude as full of grace as a young child's, with her pretty, half-opened mouth held out towards him, as she drew her light, even breath. Her little pearly teeth seemed to heighten the redness of the fresh lips with the smile hovering over them. The red glow in her complexion was brighter, and its whiteness was, so to speak, whiter still just then than in the most impassioned moments of the waking day. In her unconstrained grace, as she lay, so full of believing trust, the adorable attractions of childhood were added to the enchantments of love.\n\nEven the most unaffected women still obey certain social conventions, which restrain the free expansion of the soul within them during their waking hours; but slumber seems to give them back the spontaneity of life which makes infancy lovely. Pauline blushed for nothing; she was like one of those beloved and heavenly beings, in whom reason has not yet put motives into their actions and mystery into their glances. Her profile stood out in sharp relief against the fine cambric of the pillows; there was a certain sprightliness about her loose hair in confusion, mingled with the deep lace ruffles; but she was sleeping in happiness, her long lashes were tightly pressed against her cheeks, as if to secure her eyes from too strong a light, or to aid an effort of her soul to recollect and to hold fast a bliss that had been perfect but fleeting. Her tiny pink and white ear, framed by a lock of her hair and outlined by a wrapping of Mechlin lace, would have made an artist, a painter, an old man, wildly in love, and would perhaps have restored a madman to his senses.\n\nIs it not an ineffable bliss to behold the woman that you love, sleeping, smiling in a peaceful dream beneath your protection, loving you even in dreams, even at the point where the individual seems to cease to exist, offering to you yet the mute lips that speak to you in slumber of the latest kiss? Is it not indescribable happiness to see a trusting woman, half-clad, but wrapped round in her love as by a cloak\u2014modesty in the midst of dishevelment\u2014to see admiringly her scattered clothing, the silken stocking hastily put off to please you last evening, the unclasped girdle that implies a boundless faith in you. A whole romance lies there in that girdle; the woman that it used to protect exists no longer; she is yours, she has become you; henceforward any betrayal of her is a blow dealt at yourself.\n\nIn this softened mood Raphael's eyes wandered over the room, now filled with memories and love, and where the very daylight seemed to take delightful hues. Then he turned his gaze at last upon the outlines of the woman's form, upon youth and purity, and love that even now had no thought that was not for him alone, above all things, and longed to live for ever. As his eyes fell upon Pauline, her own opened at once as if a ray of sunlight had lighted on them.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" she said, smiling. \"How handsome you are, bad man!\"\n\nThe grace of love and youth, of silence and dawn, shone in their faces, making a divine picture, with the fleeting spell over it all that belongs only to the earliest days of passion, just as simplicity and artlessness are the peculiar possession of childhood. Alas! love's springtide joys, like our own youthful laughter, must even take flight, and live for us no longer save in memory; either for our despair, or to shed some soothing fragrance over us, according to the bent of our inmost thoughts.\n\n\"What made me wake you?\" said Raphael. \"It was so great a pleasure to watch you sleeping that it brought tears to my eyes.\"\n\n\"And to mine, too,\" she answered. \"I cried in the night while I watched you sleeping, but not with happiness. Raphael, dear, pray listen to me. Your breathing is labored while you sleep, and something rattles in your chest that frightens me. You have a little dry cough when you are asleep, exactly like my father's, who is dying of phthisis. In those sounds from your lungs I recognized some of the peculiar symptoms of that complaint. Then you are feverish; I know you are; your hand was moist and burning\u2014\u2014Darling, you are young,\" she added with a shudder, \"and you could still get over it if unfortunately\u2014\u2014But, no,\" she cried cheerfully, \"there is no 'unfortunately,' the disease is contagious, so the doctors say.\"\n\nShe flung both arms about Raphael, drawing in his breath through one of those kisses in which the soul reaches its end.\n\n\"I do not wish to live to old age,\" she said. \"Let us both die young, and go to heaven while flowers fill our hands.\"\n\n\"We always make such designs as those when we are well and strong,\" Raphael replied, burying his hands in Pauline's hair. But even then a horrible fit of coughing came on, one of those deep ominous coughs that seem to come from the depths of the tomb, a cough that leaves the sufferer ghastly pale, trembling, and perspiring; with aching sides and quivering nerves, with a feeling of weariness pervading the very marrow of the spine, and unspeakable languor in every vein. Raphael slowly laid himself down, pale, exhausted, and overcome, like a man who has spent all the strength in him over one final effort. Pauline's eyes, grown large with terror, were fixed upon him; she lay quite motionless, pale, and silent.\n\n\"Let us commit no more follies, my angel,\" she said, trying not to let Raphael see the dreadful forebodings that disturbed her. She covered her face with her hands, for she saw Death before her\u2014the hideous skeleton. Raphael's face had grown as pale and livid as any skull unearthed from a churchyard to assist the studies of some scientific man. Pauline remembered the exclamation that had escaped from Valentin the previous evening, and to herself she said:\n\n\"Yes, there are gulfs that love can never cross, and therein love must bury itself.\"\n\nOn a March morning, some days after this wretched scene, Raphael found himself seated in an armchair, placed in the window in the full light of day. Four doctors stood round him, each in turn trying his pulse, feeling him over, and questioning him with apparent interest. The invalid sought to guess their thoughts, putting a construction on every movement they made, and on the slightest contractions of their brows. His last hope lay in this consultation. This court of appeal was about to pronounce its decision\u2014life or death.\n\nValentin had summoned the oracles of modern medicine, so that he might have the last word of science. Thanks to his wealth and title, there stood before him three embodied theories; human knowledge fluctuated round the three points. Three of the doctors brought among them the complete circle of medical philosophy; they represented the points of conflict round which the battle raged, between Spiritualism, Analysis, and goodness knows what in the way of mocking eclecticism.\n\nThe fourth doctor was Horace Bianchon, a man of science with a future before him, the most distinguished man of the new school in medicine, a discreet and unassuming representative of a studious generation that is preparing to receive the inheritance of fifty years of experience treasured up by the Ecole de Paris, a generation that perhaps will erect the monument for the building of which the centuries behind us have collected the different materials. As a personal friend of the Marquis and of Rastignac, he had been in attendance on the former for some days past, and was helping him to answer the inquiries of the three professors, occasionally insisting somewhat upon those symptoms which, in his opinion, pointed to pulmonary disease.\n\n\"You have been living at a great pace, leading a dissipated life, no doubt, and you have devoted yourself largely to intellectual work?\" queried one of the three celebrated authorities, addressing Raphael. He was a square-headed man, with a large frame and energetic organization, which seemed to mark him out as superior to his two rivals.\n\n\"I made up my mind to kill myself with debauchery, after spending three years over an extensive work, with which perhaps you may some day occupy yourselves,\" Raphael replied.\n\nThe great doctor shook his head, and so displayed his satisfaction. \"I was sure of it,\" he seemed to say to himself. He was the illustrious Brisset, the successor of Cabanis and Bichat, head of the Organic School, a doctor popular with believers in material and positive science, who see in man a complete individual, subject solely to the laws of his own particular organization; and who consider that his normal condition and abnormal states of disease can both be traced to obvious causes.\n\nAfter this reply, Brisset looked, without speaking, at a middle-sized person, whose darkly flushed countenance and glowing eyes seemed to belong to some antique satyr; and who, leaning his back against the corner of the embrasure, was studying Raphael, without saying a word. Doctor Cameristus, a man of creeds and enthusiasms, the head of the \"Vitalists,\" a romantic champion of the esoteric doctrines of Van Helmont, discerned a lofty informing principle in human life, a mysterious and inexplicable phenomenon which mocks at the scalpel, deceives the surgeon, eludes the drugs of the pharmacopoeia, the formulae of algebra, the demonstrations of anatomy, and derides all our efforts; a sort of invisible, intangible flame, which, obeying some divinely appointed law, will often linger on in a body in our opinion devoted to death, while it takes flight from an organization well fitted for prolonged existence.\n\nA bitter smile hovered upon the lips of the third doctor, Maugredie, a man of acknowledged ability, but a Pyrrhonist and a scoffer, with the scalpel for his one article of faith. He would consider, as a concession to Brisset, that a man who, as a matter of fact, was perfectly well was dead, and recognize with Cameristus that a man might be living on after his apparent demise. He found something sensible in every theory, and embraced none of them, claiming that the best of all systems of medicine was to have none at all, and to stick to facts. This Panurge of the Clinical Schools, the king of observers, the great investigator, a great sceptic, the man of desperate expedients, was scrutinizing the Magic Skin.\n\n\"I should very much like to be a witness of the coincidence of its retrenchment with your wish,\" he said to the Marquis.\n\n\"Where is the use?\" cried Brisset.\n\n\"Where is the use?\" echoed Cameristus.\n\n\"Ah, you are both of the same mind,\" replied Maugredie.\n\n\"The contraction is perfectly simple,\" Brisset went on.\n\n\"It is supernatural,\" remarked Cameristus.\n\n\"In short,\" Maugredie made answer, with affected solemnity, and handing the piece of skin to Raphael as he spoke, \"the shriveling faculty of the skin is a fact inexplicable, and yet quite natural, which, ever since the world began, has been the despair of medicine and of pretty women.\"\n\nAll Valentin's observation could discover no trace of a feeling for his troubles in any of the three doctors. The three received every answer in silence, scanned him unconcernedly, and interrogated him unsympathetically. Politeness did not conceal their indifference; whether deliberation or certainty was the cause, their words at any rate came so seldom and so languidly, that at times Raphael thought that their attention was wandering. From time to time Brisset, the sole speaker, remarked, \"Good! just so!\" as Bianchon pointed out the existence of each desperate symptom. Cameristus seemed to be deep in meditation; Maugredie looked like a comic author, studying two queer characters with a view to reproducing them faithfully upon the stage. There was deep, unconcealed distress, and grave compassion in Horace Bianchon's face. He had been a doctor for too short a time to be untouched by suffering and unmoved by a deathbed; he had not learned to keep back the sympathetic tears that obscure a man's clear vision and prevent him from seizing like the general of an army, upon the auspicious moment for victory, in utter disregard of the groans of dying men.\n\nAfter spending about half an hour over taking in some sort the measure of the patient and the complaint, much as a tailor measures a young man for a coat when he orders his wedding outfit, the authorities uttered several commonplaces, and even talked of politics. Then they decided to go into Raphael's study to exchange their ideas and frame their verdict.\n\n\"May I not be present during the discussion, gentlemen?\" Valentin had asked them, but Brisset and Maugredie protested against this, and, in spite of their patient's entreaties, declined altogether to deliberate in his presence.\n\nRaphael gave way before their custom, thinking that he could slip into a passage adjoining, whence he could easily overhear the medical conference in which the three professors were about to engage.\n\n\"Permit me, gentlemen,\" said Brisset, as they entered, \"to give you my own opinion at once. I neither wish to force it upon you nor to have it discussed. In the first place, it is unbiased, concise, and based on an exact similarity that exists between one of my own patients and the subject that we have been called in to examine; and, moreover, I am expected at my hospital. The importance of the case that demands my presence there will excuse me for speaking the first word. The subject with which we are concerned has been exhausted in an equal degree by intellectual labors\u2014what did he set about, Horace?\" he asked of the young doctor.\n\n\"A 'Theory of the Will,'\"\n\n\"The devil! but that's a big subject. He is exhausted, I say, by too much brain-work, by irregular courses, and by the repeated use of too powerful stimulants. Violent exertion of body and mind has demoralized the whole system. It is easy, gentlemen, to recognize in the symptoms of the face and body generally intense irritation of the stomach, an affection of the great sympathetic nerve, acute sensibility of the epigastric region, and contraction of the right and left hypochondriac. You have noticed, too, the large size and prominence of the liver. M. Bianchon has, besides, constantly watched the patient, and he tells us that digestion is troublesome and difficult. Strictly speaking, there is no stomach left, and so the man has disappeared. The brain is atrophied because the man digests no longer. The progressive deterioration wrought in the epigastric region, the seat of vitality, has vitiated the whole system. Thence, by continuous fevered vibrations, the disorder has reached the brain by means of the nervous plexus, hence the excessive irritation in that organ. There is monomania. The patient is burdened with a fixed idea. That piece of skin really contracts, to his way of thinking; very likely it always has been as we have seen it; but whether it contracts or no, that thing is for him just like the fly that some Grand Vizier or other had on his nose. If you put leeches at once on the epigastrium, and reduce the irritation in that part, which is the very seat of man's life, and if you diet the patient, the monomania will leave him. I will say no more to Dr. Bianchon; he should be able to grasp the whole treatment as well as the details. There may be, perhaps, some complication of the disease\u2014the bronchial tubes, possibly, may be also inflamed; but I believe that treatment for the intestinal organs is very much more important and necessary, and more urgently required than for the lungs. Persistent study of abstract matters, and certain violent passions, have induced serious disorders in that vital mechanism. However, we are in time to set these conditions right. Nothing is too seriously affected. You will easily get your friend round again,\" he remarked to Bianchon.\n\n\"Our learned colleague is taking the effect for the cause,\" Cameristus replied. \"Yes, the changes that he has observed so keenly certainly exist in the patient; but it is not the stomach that, by degrees, has set up nervous action in the system, and so affected the brain, like a hole in a window pane spreading cracks round about it. It took a blow of some kind to make a hole in the window; who gave the blow? Do we know that? Have we investigated the patient's case sufficiently? Are we acquainted with all the events of his life?\n\n\"The vital principle, gentlemen,\" he continued, \"the Archeus of Van Helmont, is affected in his case\u2014the very essence and centre of life is attacked. The divine spark, the transitory intelligence which holds the organism together, which is the source of the will, the inspiration of life, has ceased to regulate the daily phenomena of the mechanism and the functions of every organ; thence arise all the complications which my learned colleague has so thoroughly appreciated. The epigastric region does not affect the brain but the brain affects the epigastric region. No,\" he went on, vigorously slapping his chest, \"no, I am not a stomach in the form of a man. No, everything does not lie there. I do not feel that I have the courage to say that if the epigastric region is in good order, everything else is in a like condition\u2014\u2014\n\n\"We cannot trace,\" he went on more mildly, \"to one physical cause the serious disturbances that supervene in this or that subject which has been dangerously attacked, nor submit them to a uniform treatment. No one man is like another. We have each peculiar organs, differently affected, diversely nourished, adapted to perform different functions, and to induce a condition necessary to the accomplishment of an order of things which is unknown to us. The sublime will has so wrought that a little portion of the great All is set within us to sustain the phenomena of living; in every man it formulates itself distinctly, making each, to all appearance, a separate individual, yet in one point co-existent with the infinite cause. So we ought to make a separate study of each subject, discover all about it, find out in what its life consists, and wherein its power lies. From the softness of a wet sponge to the hardness of pumice-stone there are infinite fine degrees of difference. Man is just like that. Between the sponge-like organizations of the lymphatic and the vigorous iron muscles of such men as are destined for a long life, what a margin for errors for the single inflexible system of a lowering treatment to commit; a system that reduces the capacities of the human frame, which you always conclude have been over-excited. Let us look for the origin of the disease in the mental and not in the physical viscera. A doctor is an inspired being, endowed by God with a special gift\u2014the power to read the secrets of vitality; just as the prophet has received the eyes that foresee the future, the poet his faculty of evoking nature, and the musician the power of arranging sounds in an harmonious order that is possibly a copy of an ideal harmony on high.\"\n\n\"There is his everlasting system of medicine, arbitrary, monarchical, and pious,\" muttered Brisset.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Maugredie broke in hastily, to distract attention from Brisset's comment, \"don't let us lose sight of the patient.\"\n\n\"What is the good of science?\" Raphael moaned. \"Here is my recovery halting between a string of beads and a rosary of leeches, between Dupuytren's bistoury and Prince Hohenlohe's prayer. There is Maugredie suspending his judgment on the line that divides facts from words, mind from matter. Man's 'it is,' and 'it is not,' is always on my track; it is the Carymary Carymara of Rabelais for evermore: my disorder is spiritual, Carymary, or material, Carymara. Shall I live? They have no idea. Planchette was more straightforward with me, at any rate, when he said, 'I do not know.'\"\n\nJust then Valentin heard Maugredie's voice.\n\n\"The patient suffers from monomania; very good, I am quite of that opinion,\" he said, \"but he has two hundred thousand a year; monomaniacs of that kind are very uncommon. As for knowing whether his epigastric region has affected his brain, or his brain his epigastric region, we shall find that out, perhaps, whenever he dies. But to resume. There is no disputing the fact that he is ill; some sort of treatment he must have. Let us leave theories alone, and put leeches on him, to counteract the nervous and intestinal irritation, as to the existence of which we all agree; and let us send him to drink the waters, in that way we shall act on both systems at once. If there really is tubercular disease, we can hardly expect to save his life; so that\u2014\u2014\"\n\nRaphael abruptly left the passage, and went back to his armchair. The four doctors very soon came out of the study; Horace was the spokesman.\n\n\"These gentlemen,\" he told him, \"have unanimously agreed that leeches must be applied to the stomach at once, and that both physical and moral treatment are imperatively needed. In the first place, a carefully prescribed rule of diet, so as to soothe the internal irritation\"\u2014here Brisset signified his approval; \"and in the second, a hygienic regimen, to set your general condition right. We all, therefore, recommend you to go to take the waters in Aix in Savoy; or, if you like it better, at Mont Dore in Auvergne; the air and the situation are both pleasanter in Savoy than in the Cantal, but you will consult your own taste.\"\n\nHere it was Cameristus who nodded assent.\n\n\"These gentlemen,\" Bianchon continued, \"having recognized a slight affection of the respiratory organs, are agreed as to the utility of the previous course of treatment that I have prescribed. They think that there will be no difficulty about restoring you to health, and that everything depends upon a wise and alternate employment of these various means. And\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"And that is the cause of the milk in the cocoanut,\" said Raphael, with a smile, as he led Horace into his study to pay the fees for this useless consultation.\n\n\"Their conclusions are logical,\" the young doctor replied. \"Cameristus feels, Brisset examines, Maugredie doubts. Has not man a soul, a body, and an intelligence? One of these three elemental constituents always influences us more or less strongly; there will always be the personal element in human science. Believe me, Raphael, we effect no cures; we only assist them. Another system\u2014the use of mild remedies while Nature exerts her powers\u2014lies between the extremes of theory of Brisset and Cameristus, but one ought to have known the patient for some ten years or so to obtain a good result on these lines. Negation lies at the back of all medicine, as in every other science. So endeavor to live wholesomely; try a trip to Savoy; the best course is, and always will be, to trust to Nature.\"\n\nIt was a month later, on a fine summer-like evening, that several people, who were taking the waters at Aix, returned from the promenade and met together in the salons of the Club. Raphael remained alone by a window for a long time. His back was turned upon the gathering, and he himself was deep in those involuntary musings in which thoughts arise in succession and fade away, shaping themselves indistinctly, passing over us like thin, almost colorless clouds. Melancholy is sweet to us then, and delight is shadowy, for the soul is half asleep. Valentin gave himself up to this life of sensations; he was steeping himself in the warm, soft twilight, enjoying the pure air with the scent of the hills in it, happy in that he felt no pain, and had tranquilized his threatening Magic Skin at last. It grew cooler as the red glow of the sunset faded on the mountain peaks; he shut the window and left his place.\n\n\"Will you be so kind as not to close the windows, sir?\" said an old lady; \"we are being stifled\u2014\u2014\"\n\nThe peculiarly sharp and jarring tones in which the phrase was uttered grated on Raphael's ears; it fell on them like an indiscreet remark let slip by some man in whose friendship we would fain believe, a word which reveals unsuspected depths of selfishness and destroys some pleasing sentimental illusion of ours. The Marquis glanced, with the cool inscrutable expression of a diplomatist, at the old lady, called a servant, and, when he came, curtly bade him:\n\n\"Open that window.\"\n\nGreat surprise was clearly expressed on all faces at the words. The whole roomful began to whisper to each other, and turned their eyes upon the invalid, as though he had given some serious offence. Raphael, who had never quite managed to rid himself of the bashfulness of his early youth, felt a momentary confusion; then he shook off his torpor, exerted his faculties, and asked himself the meaning of this strange scene.\n\nA sudden and rapid impulse quickened his brain; the past weeks appeared before him in a clear and definite vision; the reasons for the feelings he inspired in others stood out for him in relief, like the veins of some corpse which a naturalist, by some cunningly contrived injection, has colored so as to show their least ramifications.\n\nHe discerned himself in this fleeting picture; he followed out his own life in it, thought by thought, day after day. He saw himself, not without astonishment, an absent gloomy figure in the midst of these lively folk, always musing over his own fate, always absorbed by his own sufferings, seemingly impatient of the most harmless chat. He saw how he had shunned the ephemeral intimacies that travelers are so ready to establish\u2014no doubt because they feel sure of never meeting each other again\u2014and how he had taken little heed of those about him. He saw himself like the rocks without, unmoved by the caresses or the stormy surgings of the waves.\n\nThen, by a gift of insight seldom accorded, he read the thoughts of all those about him. The light of a candle revealed the sardonic profile and yellow cranium of an old man; he remembered now that he had won from him, and had never proposed that the other should have his revenge; a little further on he saw a pretty woman, whose lively advances he had met with frigid coolness; there was not a face there that did not reproach him with some wrong done, inexplicably to all appearance, but the real offence in every case lay in some mortification, some invisible hurt dealt to self-love. He had unintentionally jarred on all the small susceptibilities of the circle round about him.\n\nHis guests on various occasions, and those to whom he had lent his horses, had taken offence at his luxurious ways; their ungraciousness had been a surprise to him; he had spared them further humiliations of that kind, and they had considered that he looked down upon them, and had accused him of haughtiness ever since. He could read their inmost thoughts as he fathomed their natures in this way. Society with its polish and varnish grew loathsome to him. He was envied and hated for his wealth and superior ability; his reserve baffled the inquisitive; his humility seemed like haughtiness to these petty superficial natures. He guessed the secret unpardonable crime which he had committed against them; he had overstepped the limits of the jurisdiction of their mediocrity. He had resisted their inquisitorial tyranny; he could dispense with their society; and all of them, therefore, had instinctively combined to make him feel their power, and to take revenge upon this incipient royalty by submitting him to a kind of ostracism, and so teaching him that they in their turn could do without him.\n\nPity came over him, first of all, at this aspect of mankind, but very soon he shuddered at the thought of the power that came thus, at will, and flung aside for him the veil of flesh under which the moral nature is hidden away. He closed his eyes, so as to see no more. A black curtain was drawn all at once over this unlucky phantom show of truth; but still he found himself in the terrible loneliness that surrounds every power and dominion. Just then a violent fit of coughing seized him. Far from receiving one single word\u2014indifferent, and meaningless, it is true, but still containing, among well-bred people brought together by chance, at least some pretence of civil commiseration\u2014he now heard hostile ejaculations and muttered complaints. Society there assembled disdained any pantomime on his account, perhaps because he had gauged its real nature too well.\n\n\"His complaint is contagious.\"\n\n\"The president of the Club ought to forbid him to enter the salon.\"\n\n\"It is contrary to all rules and regulations to cough in that way!\"\n\n\"When a man is as ill as that, he ought not to come to take the waters\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"He will drive me away from the place.\"\n\nRaphael rose and walked about the rooms to screen himself from their unanimous execrations. He thought to find a shelter, and went up to a young pretty lady who sat doing nothing, minded to address some pretty speeches to her; but as he came towards her, she turned her back upon him, and pretended to be watching the dancers. Raphael feared lest he might have made use of the talisman already that evening; and feeling that he had neither the wish nor the courage to break into the conversation, he left the salon and took refuge in the billiard-room. No one there greeted him, nobody spoke to him, no one sent so much as a friendly glance in his direction. His turn of mind, naturally meditative, had discovered instinctively the general grounds and reasons for the aversion he inspired. This little world was obeying, unconsciously perhaps, the sovereign law which rules over polite society; its inexorable nature was becoming apparent in its entirety to Raphael's eyes. A glance into the past showed it to him, as a type completely realized in Foedora.\n\nHe would no more meet with sympathy here for his bodily ills than he had received it at her hands for the distress in his heart. The fashionable world expels every suffering creature from its midst, just as the body of a man in robust health rejects any germ of disease. The world holds suffering and misfortune in abhorrence; it dreads them like the plague; it never hesitates between vice and trouble, for vice is a luxury. Ill-fortune may possess a majesty of its own, but society can belittle it and make it ridiculous by an epigram. Society draws caricatures, and in this way flings in the teeth of fallen kings the affronts which it fancies it has received from them; society, like the Roman youth at the circus, never shows mercy to the fallen gladiator; mockery and money are its vital necessities. \"Death to the weak!\" That is the oath taken by this kind of Equestrian order, instituted in their midst by all the nations of the world; everywhere it makes for the elevation of the rich, and its motto is deeply graven in hearts that wealth has turned to stone, or that have been reared in aristocratic prejudices.\n\nAssemble a collection of school-boys together. That will give you a society in miniature, a miniature which represents life more truly, because it is so frank and artless; and in it you will always find poor isolated beings, relegated to some place in the general estimations between pity and contempt, on account of their weakness and suffering. To these the Evangel promises heaven hereafter. Go lower yet in the scale of organized creation. If some bird among its fellows in the courtyard sickens, the others fall upon it with their beaks, pluck out its feathers, and kill it. The whole world, in accordance with its character of egotism, brings all its severity to bear upon wretchedness that has the hardihood to spoil its festivities, and to trouble its joys.\n\nAny sufferer in mind or body, any helpless or poor man, is a pariah. He had better remain in his solitude; if he crosses the boundary-line, he will find winter everywhere; he will find freezing cold in other men's looks, manners, words, and hearts; and lucky indeed is he if he does not receive an insult where he expected that sympathy would be expended upon him. Let the dying keep to their bed of neglect, and age sit lonely by its fireside. Portionless maids, freeze and burn in your solitary attics. If the world tolerates misery of any kind, it is to turn it to account for its own purposes, to make some use of it, saddle and bridle it, put a bit in its mouth, ride it about, and get some fun out of it.\n\nCrotchety spinsters, ladies' companions, put a cheerful face upon it, endure the humors of your so-called benefactress, carry her lapdogs for her; you have an English poodle for your rival, and you must seek to understand the moods of your patroness, and amuse her, and\u2014keep silence about yourselves. As for you, unblushing parasite, uncrowned king of unliveried servants, leave your real character at home, let your digestion keep pace with your host's laugh when he laughs, mingle your tears with his, and find his epigrams amusing; if you want to relieve your mind about him, wait till he is ruined. That is the way the world shows its respect for the unfortunate; it persecutes them, or slays them in the dust.\n\nSuch thoughts as these welled up in Raphael's heart with the suddenness of poetic inspiration. He looked around him, and felt the influence of the forbidding gloom that society breathes out in order to rid itself of the unfortunate; it nipped his soul more effectually than the east wind grips the body in December. He locked his arms over his chest, set his back against the wall, and fell into a deep melancholy. He mused upon the meagre happiness that this depressing way of living can give. What did it amount to? Amusement with no pleasure in it, gaiety without gladness, joyless festivity, fevered dreams empty of all delight, firewood or ashes on the hearth without a spark of flame in them. When he raised his head, he found himself alone, all the billiard players had gone.\n\n\"I have only to let them know my power to make them worship my coughing fits,\" he said to himself, and wrapped himself against the world in the cloak of his contempt.\n\nNext day the resident doctor came to call upon him, and took an anxious interest in his health. Raphael felt a thrill of joy at the friendly words addressed to him. The doctor's face, to his thinking, wore an expression that was kind and pleasant; the pale curls of his wig seemed redolent of philanthropy; the square cut of his coat, the loose folds of his trousers, his big Quaker-like shoes, everything about him down to the powder shaken from his queue and dusted in a circle upon his slightly stooping shoulders, revealed an apostolic nature, and spoke of Christian charity and of the self-sacrifice of a man, who, out of sheer devotion to his patients, had compelled himself to learn to play whist and tric-trac so well that he never lost money to any of them.\n\n\"My Lord Marquis,\" said he, after a long talk with Raphael, \"I can dispel your uneasiness beyond all doubt. I know your constitution well enough by this time to assure you that the doctors in Paris, whose great abilities I know, are mistaken as to the nature of your complaint. You can live as long as Methuselah, my Lord Marquis, accidents only excepted. Your lungs are as sound as a blacksmith's bellows, your stomach would put an ostrich to the blush; but if you persist in living at high altitude, you are running the risk of a prompt interment in consecrated soil. A few words, my Lord Marquis, will make my meaning clear to you.\n\n\"Chemistry,\" he began, \"has shown us that man's breathing is a real process of combustion, and the intensity of its action varies according to the abundance or scarcity of the phlogistic element stored up by the organism of each individual. In your case, the phlogistic, or inflammatory element is abundant; if you will permit me to put it so, you generate superfluous oxygen, possessing as you do the inflammatory temperament of a man destined to experience strong emotions. While you breath the keen, pure air that stimulates life in men of lymphatic constitution, you are accelerating an expenditure of vitality already too rapid. One of the conditions for existence for you is the heavier atmosphere of the plains and valleys. Yes, the vital air for a man consumed by his genius lies in the fertile pasture-lands of Germany, at Toplitz or Baden-Baden. If England is not obnoxious to you, its misty climate would reduce your fever; but the situation of our baths, a thousand feet above the level of the Mediterranean, is dangerous for you. That is my opinion at least,\" he said, with a deprecatory gesture, \"and I give it in opposition to our interests, for, if you act upon it, we shall unfortunately lose you.\"\n\nBut for these closing words of his, the affable doctor's seeming good-nature would have completely won Raphael over; but he was too profoundly observant not to understand the meaning of the tone, the look and gesture that accompanied that mild sarcasm, not to see that the little man had been sent on this errand, no doubt, by a flock of his rejoicing patients. The florid-looking idlers, tedious old women, nomad English people, and fine ladies who had given their husbands the slip, and were escorted hither by their lovers\u2014one and all were in a plot to drive away a wretched, feeble creature to die, who seemed unable to hold out against a daily renewed persecution! Raphael accepted the challenge, he foresaw some amusement to be derived from their manoeuvres.\n\n\"As you would be grieved at losing me,\" said he to the doctor, \"I will endeavor to avail myself of your good advice without leaving the place. I will set about having a house built to-morrow, and the atmosphere within it shall be regulated by your instructions.\"\n\nThe doctor understood the sarcastic smile that lurked about Raphael's mouth, and took his leave without finding another word to say.\n\nThe Lake of Bourget lies seven hundred feet above the Mediterranean, in a great hollow among the jagged peaks of the hills; it sparkles there, the bluest drop of water in the world. From the summit of the Cat's Tooth the lake below looks like a stray turquoise. This lovely sheet of water is about twenty-seven miles round, and in some places is nearly five hundred feet deep.\n\nUnder the cloudless sky, in your boat in the midst of the great expanse of water, with only the sound of the oars in your ears, only the vague outline of the hills on the horizon before you; you admire the glittering snows of the French Maurienne; you pass, now by masses of granite clad in the velvet of green turf or in low-growing shrubs, now by pleasant sloping meadows; there is always a wilderness on the one hand and fertile lands on the other, and both harmonies and dissonances compose a scene for you where everything is at once small and vast, and you feel yourself to be a poor onlooker at a great banquet. The configuration of the mountains brings about misleading optical conditions and illusions of perspective; a pine-tree a hundred feet in height looks to be a mere weed; wide valleys look as narrow as meadow paths. The lake is the only one where the confidences of heart and heart can be exchanged. There one can live; there one can meditate. Nowhere on earth will you find a closer understanding between the water, the sky, the mountains, and the fields. There is a balm there for all the agitations of life. The place keeps the secrets of sorrow to itself, the sorrow that grows less beneath its soothing influence; and to love, it gives a grave and meditative cast, deepening passion and purifying it. A kiss there becomes something great. But beyond all other things it is the lake for memories; it aids them by lending to them the hues of its own waves; it is a mirror in which everything is reflected. Only here, with this lovely landscape all around him, could Raphael endure the burden laid upon him; here he could remain as a languid dreamer, without a wish of his own.\n\nHe went out upon the lake after the doctor's visit, and was landed at a lonely point on the pleasant slope where the village of Saint-Innocent is situated. The view from this promontory, as one may call it, comprises the heights of Bugey with the Rhone flowing at their foot, and the end of the lake; but Raphael liked to look at the opposite shore from thence, at the melancholy looking Abbey of Haute-Combe, the burying-place of the Sardinian kings, who lie prostrate there before the hills, like pilgrims come at last to their journey's end. The silence of the landscape was broken by the even rhythm of the strokes of the oar; it seemed to find a voice for the place, in monotonous cadences like the chanting of monks. The Marquis was surprised to find visitors to this usually lonely part of the lake; and as he mused, he watched the people seated in the boat, and recognized in the stern the elderly lady who had spoken so harshly to him the evening before.\n\nNo one took any notice of Raphael as the boat passed, except the elderly lady's companion, a poor old maid of noble family, who bowed to him, and whom it seemed to him that he saw for the first time. A few seconds later he had already forgotten the visitors, who had rapidly disappeared behind the promontory, when he heard the fluttering of a dress and the sound of light footsteps not far from him. He turned about and saw the companion; and, guessing from her embarrassed manner that she wished to speak with him, he walked towards her.\n\nShe was somewhere about thirty-six years of age, thin and tall, reserved and prim, and, like all old maids, seemed puzzled to know which way to look, an expression no longer in keeping with her measured, springless, and hesitating steps. She was both young and old at the same time, and, by a certain dignity in her carriage, showed the high value which she set upon her charms and perfections. In addition, her movements were all demure and discreet, like those of women who are accustomed to take great care of themselves, no doubt because they desire not to be cheated of love, their destined end.\n\n\"Your life is in danger, sir; do not come to the Club again!\" she said, stepping back a pace or two from Raphael, as if her reputation had already been compromised.\n\n\"But, mademoiselle,\" said Raphael, smiling, \"please explain yourself more clearly, since you have condescended so far\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she answered, \"unless I had had a very strong motive, I should never have run the risk of offending the countess, for if she ever came to know that I had warned you\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"And who would tell her, mademoiselle?\" cried Raphael.\n\n\"True,\" the old maid answered. She looked at him, quaking like an owl out in the sunlight. \"But think of yourself,\" she went on; \"several young men, who want to drive you away from the baths, have agreed to pick a quarrel with you, and to force you into a duel.\"\n\nThe elderly lady's voice sounded in the distance.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" began the Marquis, \"my gratitude\u2014\u2014\" But his protectress had fled already; she had heard the voice of her mistress squeaking afresh among the rocks.\n\n\"Poor girl! unhappiness always understands and helps the unhappy,\" Raphael thought, and sat himself down at the foot of a tree.\n\nThe key of every science is, beyond cavil, the mark of interrogation; we owe most of our greatest discoveries to a Why? and all the wisdom in the world, perhaps, consists in asking Wherefore? in every connection. But, on the other hand, this acquired prescience is the ruin of our illusions.\n\nSo Valentin, having taken the old maid's kindly action for the text of his wandering thoughts, without the deliberate promptings of philosophy, must find it full of gall and wormwood.\n\n\"It is not at all extraordinary that a gentlewoman's gentlewoman should take a fancy to me,\" said he to himself. \"I am twenty-seven years old, and I have a title and an income of two hundred thousand a year. But that her mistress, who hates water like a rabid cat\u2014for it would be hard to give the palm to either in that matter\u2014that her mistress should have brought her here in a boat! Is not that very strange and wonderful? Those two women came into Savoy to sleep like marmots; they ask if day has dawned at noon; and to think that they could get up this morning before eight o'clock, to take their chances in running after me!\"\n\nVery soon the old maid and her elderly innocence became, in his eyes, a fresh manifestation of that artificial, malicious little world. It was a paltry device, a clumsy artifice, a piece of priest's or woman's craft. Was the duel a myth, or did they merely want to frighten him? But these petty creatures, impudent and teasing as flies, had succeeded in wounding his vanity, in rousing his pride, and exciting his curiosity. Unwilling to become their dupe, or to be taken for a coward, and even diverted perhaps by the little drama, he went to the Club that very evening.\n\nHe stood leaning against the marble chimney-piece, and stayed there quietly in the middle of the principal saloon, doing his best to give no one any advantage over him; but he scrutinized the faces about him, and gave a certain vague offence to those assembled, by his inspection. Like a dog aware of his strength, he awaited the contest on his own ground, without necessary barking. Towards the end of the evening he strolled into the cardroom, walking between the door and another that opened into the billiard-room, throwing a glance from time to time over a group of young men that had gathered there. He heard his name mentioned after a turn or two. Although they lowered their voices, Raphael easily guessed that he had become the topic of their debate, and he ended by catching a phrase or two spoken aloud.\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes, I.\"\n\n\"I dare you to do it!\"\n\n\"Let us make a bet on it!\"\n\n\"Oh, he will do it.\"\n\nJust as Valentin, curious to learn the matter of the wager, came up to pay closer attention to what they were saying, a tall, strong, good-looking young fellow, who, however, possessed the impertinent stare peculiar to people who have material force at their back, came out of the billiard-room.\n\n\"I am deputed, sir,\" he said coolly addressing the Marquis, \"to make you aware of something which you do not seem to know; your face and person generally are a source of annoyance to every one here, and to me in particular. You have too much politeness not to sacrifice yourself to the public good, and I beg that you will not show yourself in the Club again.\"\n\n\"This sort of joke has been perpetrated before, sir, in garrison towns at the time of the Empire; but nowadays it is exceedingly bad form,\" said Raphael drily.\n\n\"I am not joking,\" the young man answered; \"and I repeat it: your health will be considerably the worse for a stay here; the heat and light, the air of the saloon, and the company are all bad for your complaint.\"\n\n\"Where did you study medicine?\" Raphael inquired.\n\n\"I took my bachelor's degree on Lepage's shooting-ground in Paris, and was made a doctor at Cerizier's, the king of foils.\"\n\n\"There is one last degree left for you to take,\" said Valentin; \"study the ordinary rules of politeness, and you will be a perfect gentlemen.\"\n\nThe young men all came out of the billiard-room just then, some disposed to laugh, some silent. The attention of other players was drawn to the matter; they left their cards to watch a quarrel that rejoiced their instincts. Raphael, alone among this hostile crowd, did his best to keep cool, and not to put himself in any way in the wrong; but his adversary having ventured a sarcasm containing an insult couched in unusually keen language, he replied gravely:\n\n\"We cannot box men's ears, sir, in these days, but I am at a loss for any word by which to stigmatize such cowardly behavior as yours.\"\n\n\"That's enough, that's enough. You can come to an explanation to-morrow,\" several young men exclaimed, interposing between the two champions.\n\nRaphael left the room in the character of aggressor, after he had accepted a proposal to meet near the Chateau de Bordeau, in a little sloping meadow, not very far from the newly made road, by which the man who came off victorious could reach Lyons. Raphael must now either take to his bed or leave the baths. The visitors had gained their point. At eight o'clock next morning his antagonist, followed by two seconds and a surgeon, arrived first on the ground.\n\n\"We shall do very nicely here; glorious weather for a duel!\" he cried gaily, looking at the blue vault of sky above, at the waters of the lake, and the rocks, without a single melancholy presentiment or doubt of the issue. \"If I wing him,\" he went on, \"I shall send him to bed for a month; eh, doctor?\"\n\n\"At the very least,\" the surgeon replied; \"but let that willow twig alone, or you will weary your wrist, and then you will not fire steadily. You might kill your man instead of wounding him.\"\n\nThe noise of a carriage was heard approaching.\n\n\"Here he is,\" said the seconds, who soon descried a caleche coming along the road; it was drawn by four horses, and there were two postilions.\n\n\"What a queer proceeding!\" said Valentin's antagonist; \"here he comes post-haste to be shot.\"\n\nThe slightest incident about a duel, as about a stake at cards, makes an impression on the minds of those deeply concerned in the results of the affair; so the young man awaited the arrival of the carriage with a kind of uneasiness. It stopped in the road; old Jonathan laboriously descended from it, in the first place, to assist Raphael to alight; he supported him with his feeble arms, and showed him all the minute attentions that a lover lavishes upon his mistress. Both became lost to sight in the footpath that lay between the highroad and the field where the duel was to take place; they were walking slowly, and did not appear again for some time after. The four onlookers at this strange spectacle felt deeply moved by the sight of Valentin as he leaned on his servant's arm; he was wasted and pale; he limped as if he had the gout, went with his head bowed down, and said not a word. You might have taken them for a couple of old men, one broken with years, the other worn out with thought; the elder bore his age visibly written in his white hair, the younger was of no age.\n\n\"I have not slept all night, sir;\" so Raphael greeted his antagonist.\n\nThe icy tone and terrible glance that went with the words made the real aggressor shudder; he know that he was in the wrong, and felt in secret ashamed of his behavior. There was something strange in Raphael's bearing, tone, and gesture; the Marquis stopped, and every one else was likewise silent. The uneasy and constrained feeling grew to a height.\n\n\"There is yet time,\" he went on, \"to offer me some slight apology; and offer it you must, or you will die sir! You rely even now on your dexterity, and do not shrink from an encounter in which you believe all the advantage to be upon your side. Very good, sir; I am generous, I am letting you know my superiority beforehand. I possess a terrible power. I have only to wish to do so, and I can neutralize your skill, dim your eyesight, make your hand and pulse unsteady, and even kill you outright. I have no wish to be compelled to exercise my power; the use of it costs me too dear. You would not be the only one to die. So if you refuse to apologize to me, not matter what your experience in murder, your ball will go into the waterfall there, and mine will speed straight to your heart though I do not aim it at you.\"\n\nConfused voices interrupted Raphael at this point. All the time that he was speaking, the Marquis had kept his intolerably keen gaze fixed upon his antagonist; now he drew himself up and showed an impassive face, like that of a dangerous madman.\n\n\"Make him hold his tongue,\" the young man had said to one of his seconds; \"that voice of his is tearing the heart out of me.\"\n\n\"Say no more, sir; it is quite useless,\" cried the seconds and the surgeon, addressing Raphael.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I am fulfilling a duty. Has this young gentleman any final arrangements to make?\"\n\n\"That is enough; that will do.\"\n\nThe Marquis remained standing steadily, never for a moment losing sight of his antagonist; and the latter seemed, like a bird before a snake, to be overwhelmed by a well-nigh magical power. He was compelled to endure that homicidal gaze; he met and shunned it incessantly.\n\n\"I am thirsty; give me some water\u2014\u2014\" he said again to the second.\n\n\"Are you nervous?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"There is a fascination about that man's glowing eyes.\"\n\n\"Will you apologize?\"\n\n\"It is too late now.\"\n\nThe two antagonists were placed at fifteen paces' distance from each other. Each of them had a brace of pistols at hand, and, according to the programme prescribed for them, each was to fire twice when and how he pleased, but after the signal had been given by the seconds.\n\n\"What are you doing, Charles?\" exclaimed the young man who acted as second to Raphael's antagonist; \"you are putting in the ball before the powder!\"\n\n\"I am a dead man,\" he muttered, by way of answer; \"you have put me facing the sun\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"The sun lies behind you,\" said Valentin sternly and solemnly, while he coolly loaded his pistol without heeding the fact that the signal had been given, or that his antagonist was carefully taking aim.\n\nThere was something so appalling in this supernatural unconcern, that it affected even the two postilions, brought thither by a cruel curiosity. Raphael was either trying his power or playing with it, for he talked to Jonathan, and looked towards him as he received his adversary's fire. Charles' bullet broke a branch of willow, and ricocheted over the surface of the water; Raphael fired at random, and shot his antagonist through the heart. He did not heed the young man as he dropped; he hurriedly sought the Magic Skin to see what another man's life had cost him. The talisman was no larger than a small oak-leaf.\n\n\"What are you gaping at, you postilions over there? Let us be off,\" said the Marquis.\n\nThat same evening he crossed the French border, immediately set out for Auvergne, and reached the springs of Mont Dore. As he traveled, there surged up in his heart, all at once, one of those thoughts that come to us as a ray of sunlight pierces through the thick mists in some dark valley\u2014a sad enlightenment, a pitiless sagacity that lights up the accomplished fact for us, that lays our errors bare, and leaves us without excuse in our own eyes. It suddenly struck him that the possession of power, no matter how enormous, did not bring with it the knowledge how to use it. The sceptre is a plaything for a child, an axe for a Richelieu, and for a Napoleon a lever by which to move the world. Power leaves us just as it finds us; only great natures grow greater by its means. Raphael had had everything in his power, and he had done nothing.\n\nAt the springs of Mont Dore he came again in contact with a little world of people, who invariably shunned him with the eager haste that animals display when they scent afar off one of their own species lying dead, and flee away. The dislike was mutual. His late adventure had given him a deep distaste for society; his first care, consequently, was to find a lodging at some distance from the neighborhood of the springs. Instinctively he felt within him the need of close contact with nature, of natural emotions, and of the vegetative life into which we sink so gladly among the fields.\n\nThe day after he arrived he climbed the Pic de Sancy, not without difficulty, and visited the higher valleys, the skyey nooks, undiscovered lakes, and peasants' huts about Mont Dore, a country whose stern and wild features are now beginning to tempt the brushes of our artists, for sometimes wonderfully fresh and charming views are to be found there, affording a strong contrast to the frowning brows of those lonely hills.\n\nBarely a league from the village Raphael discovered a nook where nature seemed to have taken a pleasure in hiding away all her treasures like some glad and mischievous child. At the first sight of this unspoiled and picturesque retreat, he determined to take up his abode in it. There, life must needs be peaceful, natural, and fruitful, like the life of a plant.\n\nImagine for yourself an inverted cone of granite hollowed out on a large scale, a sort of basin with its sides divided up by queer winding paths. On one side lay level stretches with no growth upon them, a bluish uniform surface, over which the rays of the sun fell as upon a mirror; on the other lay cliffs split open by fissures and frowning ravines; great blocks of lava hung suspended from them, while the action of rain slowly prepared their impending fall; a few stunted trees tormented by the wind, often crowned their summits; and here and there in some sheltered angle of their ramparts a clump of chestnut-trees grew tall as cedars, or some cavern in the yellowish rocks showed the dark entrance into its depths, set about by flowers and brambles, decked by a little strip of green turf.\n\nAt the bottom of this cup, which perhaps had been the crater of an old-world volcano, lay a pool of water as pure and bright as a diamond. Granite boulders lay around the deep basin, and willows, mountain-ash trees, yellow-flag lilies, and numberless aromatic plants bloomed about it, in a realm of meadow as fresh as an English bowling-green. The fine soft grass was watered by the streams that trickled through the fissures in the cliffs; the soil was continually enriched by the deposits of loam which storms washed down from the heights above. The pool might be some three acres in extent; its shape was irregular, and the edges were scalloped like the hem of a dress; the meadow might be an acre or two acres in extent. The cliffs and the water approached and receded from each other; here and there, there was scarcely width enough for the cows to pass between them.\n\nAfter a certain height the plant life ceased. Aloft in air the granite took upon itself the most fantastic shapes, and assumed those misty tints that give to high mountains a dim resemblance to clouds in the sky. The bare, bleak cliffs, with the fearful rents in their sides, pictures of wild and barren desolation, contrasted strongly with the pretty view of the valley; and so strange were the shapes they assumed, that one of the cliffs had been called \"The Capuchin,\" because it was so like a monk. Sometimes these sharp-pointed peaks, these mighty masses of rock, and airy caverns were lighted up one by one, according to the direction of the sun or the caprices of the atmosphere; they caught gleams of gold, dyed themselves in purple; took a tint of glowing rose-color, or turned dull and gray. Upon the heights a drama of color was always to be seen, a play of ever-shifting iridescent hues like those on a pigeon's breast.\n\nOftentimes at sunrise or at sunset a ray of bright sunlight would penetrate between two sheer surfaces of lava, that might have been split apart by a hatchet, to the very depths of that pleasant little garden, where it would play in the waters of the pool, like a beam of golden light which gleams through the chinks of a shutter into a room in Spain, that has been carefully darkened for a siesta. When the sun rose above the old crater that some antediluvian revolution had filled with water, its rocky sides took warmer tones, the extinct volcano glowed again, and its sudden heat quickened the sprouting seeds and vegetation, gave color to the flowers, and ripened the fruits of this forgotten corner of the earth.\n\nAs Raphael reached it, he noticed several cows grazing in the pasture-land; and when he had taken a few steps towards the water, he saw a little house built of granite and roofed with shingle in the spot where the meadowland was at its widest. The roof of this little cottage harmonized with everything about it; for it had long been overgrown with ivy, moss, and flowers of no recent date. A thin smoke, that did not scare the birds away, went up from the dilapidated chimney. There was a great bench at the door between two huge honey-suckle bushes, that were pink with blossom and full of scent. The walls could scarcely be seen for branches of vine and sprays of rose and jessamine that interlaced and grew entirely as chance and their own will bade them; for the inmates of the cottage seemed to pay no attention to the growth which adorned their house, and to take no care of it, leaving to it the fresh capricious charm of nature.\n\nSome clothes spread out on the gooseberry bushes were drying in the sun. A cat was sitting on a machine for stripping hemp; beneath it lay a newly scoured brass caldron, among a quantity of potato-parings. On the other side of the house Raphael saw a sort of barricade of dead thorn-bushes, meant no doubt to keep the poultry from scratching up the vegetables and pot-herbs. It seemed like the end of the earth. The dwelling was like some bird's-nest ingeniously set in a cranny of the rocks, a clever and at the same time a careless bit of workmanship. A simple and kindly nature lay round about it; its rusticity was genuine, but there was a charm like that of poetry in it; for it grew and throve at a thousand miles' distance from our elaborate and conventional poetry. It was like none of our conceptions; it was a spontaneous growth, a masterpiece due to chance.\n\nAs Raphael reached the place, the sunlight fell across it from right to left, bringing out all the colors of its plants and trees; the yellowish or gray bases of the crags, the different shades of the green leaves, the masses of flowers, pink, blue, or white, the climbing plants with their bell-like blossoms, and the shot velvet of the mosses, the purple-tinted blooms of the heather,\u2014everything was either brought into relief or made fairer yet by the enchantment of the light or by the contrasting shadows; and this was the case most of all with the sheet of water, wherein the house, the trees, the granite peaks, and the sky were all faithfully reflected. Everything had a radiance of its own in this delightful picture, from the sparkling mica-stone to the bleached tuft of grass hidden away in the soft shadows; the spotted cow with its glossy hide, the delicate water-plants that hung down over the pool like fringes in a nook where blue or emerald colored insects were buzzing about, the roots of trees like a sand-besprinkled shock of hair above grotesque faces in the flinty rock surface,\u2014all these things made a harmony for the eye.\n\nThe odor of the tepid water; the scent of the flowers, and the breath of the caverns which filled the lonely place gave Raphael a sensation that was almost enjoyment. Silence reigned in majesty over these woods, which possibly are unknown to the tax-collector; but the barking of a couple of dogs broke the stillness all at once; the cows turned their heads towards the entrance of the valley, showing their moist noses to Raphael, stared stupidly at him, and then fell to browsing again. A goat and her kid, that seemed to hang on the side of the crags in some magical fashion, capered and leapt to a slab of granite near to Raphael, and stayed there a moment, as if to seek to know who he was. The yapping of the dogs brought out a plump child, who stood agape, and next came a white-haired old man of middle height. Both of these two beings were in keeping with the surroundings, the air, the flowers, and the dwelling. Health appeared to overflow in this fertile region; old age and childhood thrived there. There seemed to be, about all these types of existence, the freedom and carelessness of the life of primitive times, a happiness of use and wont that gave the lie to our philosophical platitudes, and wrought a cure of all its swelling passions in the heart.\n\nThe old man belonged to the type of model dear to the masculine brush of Schnetz. The countless wrinkles upon his brown face looked as if they would be hard to the touch; the straight nose, the prominent cheek-bones, streaked with red veins like a vine-leaf in autumn, the angular features, all were characteristics of strength, even where strength existed no longer. The hard hands, now that they toiled no longer, had preserved their scanty white hair, his bearing was that of an absolutely free man; it suggested the thought that, had he been an Italian, he would have perhaps turned brigand, for the love of the liberty so dear to him. The child was a regular mountaineer, with the black eyes that can face the sun without flinching, a deeply tanned complexion, and rough brown hair. His movements were like a bird's\u2014swift, decided, and unconstrained; his clothing was ragged; the white, fair skin showed through the rents in his garments. There they both stood in silence, side by side, both obeying the same impulse; in both faces were clear tokens of an absolutely identical and idle life. The old man had adopted the child's amusements, and the child had fallen in with the old man's humor; there was a sort of tacit agreement between two kinds of feebleness, between failing powers well-nigh spent and powers just about to unfold themselves.\n\nVery soon a woman who seemed to be about thirty years old appeared on the threshold of the door, spinning as she came. She was an Auvergnate, a high-colored, comfortable-looking, straightforward sort of person, with white teeth; her cap and dress, the face, full figure, and general appearance, were of the Auvergne peasant stamp. So was her dialect; she was a thorough embodiment of her district; its hardworking ways, its thrift, ignorance, and heartiness all met in her.\n\nShe greeted Raphael, and they began to talk. The dogs quieted down; the old man went and sat on a bench in the sun; the child followed his mother about wherever she went, listening without saying a word, and staring at the stranger.\n\n\"You are not afraid to live here, good woman?\"\n\n\"What should we be afraid of, sir? When we bolt the door, who ever could get inside? Oh, no, we aren't afraid at all. And besides,\" she said, as she brought the Marquis into the principal room in the house, \"what should thieves come to take from us here?\"\n\nShe designated the room as she spoke; the smoke-blackened walls, with some brilliant pictures in blue, red, and green, an \"End of Credit,\" a Crucifixion, and the \"Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard\" for their sole ornament; the furniture here and there, the old wooden four-post bedstead, the table with crooked legs, a few stools, the chest that held the bread, the flitch that hung from the ceiling, a jar of salt, a stove, and on the mantleshelf a few discolored yellow plaster figures. As he went out again Raphael noticed a man half-way up the crags, leaning on a hoe, and watching the house with interest.\n\n\"That's my man, sir,\" said the Auvergnate, unconsciously smiling in peasant fashion; \"he is at work up there.\"\n\n\"And that old man is your father?\"\n\n\"Asking your pardon, sir, he is my man's grandfather. Such as you see him, he is a hundred and two, and yet quite lately he walked over to Clermont with our little chap! Oh, he has been a strong man in his time; but he does nothing now but sleep and eat and drink. He amuses himself with the little fellow. Sometimes the child trails him up the hillsides, and he will just go up there along with him.\"\n\nValentin made up his mind immediately. He would live between this child and old man, breathe the same air; eat their bread, drink the same water, sleep with them, make the blood in his veins like theirs. It was a dying man's fancy. For him the prime model, after which the customary existence of the individual should be shaped, the real formula for the life of a human being, the only true and possible life, the life-ideal, was to become one of the oysters adhering to this rock, to save his shell a day or two longer by paralyzing the power of death. One profoundly selfish thought took possession of him, and the whole universe was swallowed up and lost in it. For him the universe existed no longer; the whole world had come to be within himself. For the sick, the world begins at their pillow and ends at the foot of the bed; and this countryside was Raphael's sick-bed.\n\nWho has not, at some time or other in his life, watched the comings and goings of an ant, slipped straws into a yellow slug's one breathing-hole, studied the vagaries of a slender dragon-fly, pondered admiringly over the countless veins in an oak-leaf, that bring the colors of a rose window in some Gothic cathedral into contrast with the reddish background? Who has not looked long in delight at the effects of sun and rain on a roof of brown tiles, at the dewdrops, or at the variously shaped petals of the flower-cups? Who has not sunk into these idle, absorbing meditations on things without, that have no conscious end, yet lead to some definite thought at last. Who, in short, has not led a lazy life, the life of childhood, the life of the savage without his labor? This life without a care or a wish Raphael led for some days' space. He felt a distinct improvement in his condition, a wonderful sense of ease, that quieted his apprehensions and soothed his sufferings.\n\nHe would climb the crags, and then find a seat high up on some peak whence he could see a vast expanse of distant country at a glance, and he would spend whole days in this way, like a plant in the sun, or a hare in its form. And at last, growing familiar with the appearances of the plant-life about him, and of the changes in the sky, he minutely noted the progress of everything working around him in the water, on the earth, or in the air. He tried to share the secret impulses of nature, sought by passive obedience to become a part of it, and to lie within the conservative and despotic jurisdiction that regulates instinctive existence. He no longer wished to steer his own course.\n\nJust as criminals in olden times were safe from the pursuit of justice, if they took refuge under the shadow of the altar, so Raphael made an effort to slip into the sanctuary of life. He succeeded in becoming an integral part of the great and mighty fruit-producing organization; he had adapted himself to the inclemency of the air, and had dwelt in every cave among the rocks. He had learned the ways and habits of growth of every plant, had studied the laws of the watercourses and their beds, and had come to know the animals; he was at last so perfectly at one with this teeming earth, that he had in some sort discerned its mysteries and caught the spirit of it.\n\nThe infinitely varied forms of every natural kingdom were, to his thinking, only developments of one and the same substance, different combinations brought about by the same impulse, endless emanations from a measureless Being which was acting, thinking, moving, and growing, and in harmony with which he longed to grow, to move, to think, and act. He had fancifully blended his life with the life of the crags; he had deliberately planted himself there. During the earliest days of his sojourn in these pleasant surroundings, Valentin tasted all the pleasures of childhood again, thanks to the strange hallucination of apparent convalescence, which is not unlike the pauses of delirium that nature mercifully provides for those in pain. He went about making trifling discoveries, setting to work on endless things, and finishing none of them; the evening's plans were quite forgotten in the morning; he had no cares, he was happy; he thought himself saved.\n\nOne morning he had lain in bed till noon, deep in the dreams between sleep and waking, which give to realities a fantastic appearance, and make the wildest fancies seem solid facts; while he was still uncertain that he was not dreaming yet, he suddenly heard his hostess giving a report of his health to Jonathan, for the first time. Jonathan came to inquire after him daily, and the Auvergnate, thinking no doubt that Valentin was still asleep, had not lowered the tones of a voice developed in mountain air.\n\n\"No better and no worse,\" she said. \"He coughed all last night again fit to kill himself. Poor gentleman, he coughs and spits till it is piteous. My husband and I often wonder to each other where he gets the strength from to cough like that. It goes to your heart. What a cursed complaint it is! He has no strength at all. I am always afraid I shall find him dead in his bed some morning. He is every bit as pale as a waxen Christ. Dame! I watch him while he dresses; his poor body is as thin as a nail. And he does not feel well now; but no matter. It's all the same; he wears himself out with running about as if he had health and to spare. All the same, he is very brave, for he never complains at all. But really he would be better under the earth than on it, for he is enduring the agonies of Christ. I don't wish that myself, sir; it is quite in our interests; but even if he didn't pay us what he does, I should be just as fond of him; it is not our own interest that is our motive.\n\n\"Ah, mon Dieu!\" she continued, \"Parisians are the people for these dogs' diseases. Where did he catch it, now? Poor young man! And he is so sure that he is going to get well! That fever just gnaws him, you know; it eats him away; it will be the death of him. He has no notion whatever of that; he does not know it, sir; he sees nothing\u2014\u2014You mustn't cry about him, M. Jonathan; you must remember that he will be happy, and will not suffer any more. You ought to make a neuvaine for him; I have seen wonderful cures come of the nine days' prayer, and I would gladly pay for a wax taper to save such a gentle creature, so good he is, a paschal lamb\u2014\u2014\"\n\nAs Raphael's voice had grown too weak to allow him to make himself heard, he was compelled to listen to this horrible loquacity. His irritation, however, drove him out of bed at length, and he appeared upon the threshold.\n\n\"Old scoundrel!\" he shouted to Jonathan; \"do you mean to put me to death?\"\n\nThe peasant woman took him for a ghost, and fled.\n\n\"I forbid you to have any anxiety whatever about my health,\" Raphael went on.\n\n\"Yes, my Lord Marquis,\" said the old servant, wiping away his tears.\n\n\"And for the future you had very much better not come here without my orders.\"\n\nJonathan meant to be obedient, but in the look full of pity and devotion that he gave the Marquis before he went, Raphael read his own death-warrant. Utterly disheartened, brought all at once to a sense of his real position, Valentin sat down on the threshold, locked his arms across his chest, and bowed his head. Jonathan turned to his master in alarm, with \"My Lord\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Go away, go away,\" cried the invalid.\n\nIn the hours of the next morning, Raphael climbed the crags, and sat down in a mossy cleft in the rocks, whence he could see the narrow path along which the water for the dwelling was carried. At the base of the hill he saw Jonathan in conversation with the Auvergnate. Some malicious power interpreted for him all the woman's forebodings, and filled the breeze and the silence with her ominous words. Thrilled with horror, he took refuge among the highest summits of the mountains, and stayed there till the evening; but yet he could not drive away the gloomy presentiments awakened within him in such an unfortunate manner by a cruel solicitude on his account.\n\nThe Auvergne peasant herself suddenly appeared before him like a shadow in the dusk; a perverse freak of the poet within him found a vague resemblance between her black and white striped petticoat and the bony frame of a spectre.\n\n\"The damp is falling now, sir,\" said she. \"If you stop out there, you will go off just like rotten fruit. You must come in. It isn't healthy to breathe the damp, and you have taken nothing since the morning, besides.\"\n\n\"Tonnerre de Dieu! old witch,\" he cried; \"let me live after my own fashion, I tell you, or I shall be off altogether. It is quite bad enough to dig my grave every morning; you might let it alone in the evenings at least\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Your grave, sir! I dig your grave!\u2014and where may your grave be? I want to see you as old as father there, and not in your grave by any manner of means. The grave! that comes soon enough for us all; in the grave\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"That is enough,\" said Raphael.\n\n\"Take my arm, sir.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe feeling of pity in others is very difficult for a man to bear, and it is hardest of all when the pity is deserved. Hatred is a tonic\u2014it quickens life and stimulates revenge; but pity is death to us\u2014it makes our weakness weaker still. It is as if distress simpered ingratiatingly at us; contempt lurks in the tenderness, or tenderness in an affront. In the centenarian Raphael saw triumphant pity, a wondering pity in the child's eyes, an officious pity in the woman, and in her husband a pity that had an interested motive; but no matter how the sentiment declared itself, death was always its import.\n\nA poet makes a poem of everything; it is tragical or joyful, as things happen to strike his imagination; his lofty soul rejects all half-tones; he always prefers vivid and decided colors. In Raphael's soul this compassion produced a terrible poem of mourning and melancholy. When he had wished to live in close contact with nature, he had of course forgotten how freely natural emotions are expressed. He would think himself quite alone under a tree, whilst he struggled with an obstinate coughing fit, a terrible combat from which he never issued victorious without utter exhaustion afterwards; and then he would meet the clear, bright eyes of the little boy, who occupied the post of sentinel, like a savage in a bent of grass; the eyes scrutinized him with a childish wonder, in which there was as much amusement as pleasure, and an indescribable mixture of indifference and interest. The awful Brother, you must die, of the Trappists seemed constantly legible in the eyes of the peasants with whom Raphael was living; he scarcely knew which he dreaded most, their unfettered talk or their silence; their presence became torture.\n\nOne morning he saw two men in black prowling about in his neighborhood, who furtively studied him and took observations. They made as though they had come there for a stroll, and asked him a few indifferent questions, to which he returned short answers. He recognized them both. One was the cure and the other the doctor at the springs; Jonathan had no doubt sent them, or the people in the house had called them in, or the scent of an approaching death had drawn them thither. He beheld his own funeral, heard the chanting of the priests, and counted the tall wax candles; and all that lovely fertile nature around him, in whose lap he had thought to find life once more, he saw no longer, save through a veil of crape. Everything that but lately had spoken of length of days to him, now prophesied a speedy end. He set out the next day for Paris, not before he had been inundated with cordial wishes, which the people of the house uttered in melancholy and wistful tones for his benefit.\n\nHe traveled through the night, and awoke as they passed through one of the pleasant valleys of the Bourbonnais. View after view swam before his gaze, and passed rapidly away like the vague pictures of a dream. Cruel nature spread herself out before his eyes with tantalizing grace. Sometimes the Allier, a liquid shining ribbon, meandered through the distant fertile landscape; then followed the steeples of hamlets, hiding modestly in the depths of a ravine with its yellow cliffs; sometimes, after the monotony of vineyards, the watermills of a little valley would be suddenly seen; and everywhere there were pleasant chateaux, hillside villages, roads with their fringes of queenly poplars; and the Loire itself, at last, with its wide sheets of water sparkling like diamonds amid its golden sands. Attractions everywhere, without end! This nature, all astir with a life and gladness like that of childhood, scarcely able to contain the impulses and sap of June, possessed a fatal attraction for the darkened gaze of the invalid. He drew the blinds of his carriage windows, and betook himself again to slumber.\n\nTowards evening, after they had passed Cesne, he was awakened by lively music, and found himself confronted with a village fair. The horses were changed near the marketplace. Whilst the postilions were engaged in making the transfer, he saw the people dancing merrily, pretty and attractive girls with flowers about them, excited youths, and finally the jolly wine-flushed countenances of old peasants. Children prattled, old women laughed and chatted; everything spoke in one voice, and there was a holiday gaiety about everything, down to their clothing and the tables that were set out. A cheerful expression pervaded the square and the church, the roofs and windows; even the very doorways of the village seemed likewise to be in holiday trim.\n\nRaphael could not repress an angry exclamation, nor yet a wish to silence the fiddles, annihilate the stir and bustle, stop the clamor, and disperse the ill-timed festival; like a dying man, he felt unable to endure the slightest sound, and he entered his carriage much annoyed. When he looked out upon the square from the window, he saw that all the happiness was scared away; the peasant women were in flight, and the benches were deserted. Only a blind musician, on the scaffolding of the orchestra, went on playing a shrill tune on his clarionet. That piping of his, without dancers to it, and the solitary old man himself, in the shadow of the lime-tree, with his curmudgeon's face, scanty hair, and ragged clothing, was like a fantastic picture of Raphael's wish. The heavy rain was pouring in torrents; it was one of those thunderstorms that June brings about so rapidly, to cease as suddenly. The thing was so natural, that, when Raphael had looked out and seen some pale clouds driven over by a gust of wind, he did not think of looking at the piece of skin. He lay back again in the corner of his carriage, which was very soon rolling upon its way.\n\nThe next day found him back in his home again, in his own room, beside his own fireside. He had had a large fire lighted; he felt cold. Jonathan brought him some letters; they were all from Pauline. He opened the first one without any eagerness, and unfolded it as if it had been the gray-paper form of application for taxes made by the revenue collector. He read the first sentence:\n\n\"Gone! This really is a flight, my Raphael. How is it? No one can tell me where you are. And who should know if not I?\"\n\nHe did not wish to learn any more. He calmly took up the letters and threw them in the fire, watching with dull and lifeless eyes the perfumed paper as it was twisted, shriveled, bent, and devoured by the capricious flames. Fragments that fell among the ashes allowed him to see the beginning of a sentence, or a half-burnt thought or word; he took a pleasure in deciphering them\u2014a sort of mechanical amusement.\n\n\"Sitting at your door\u2014expected\u2014Caprice\u2014I obey\u2014Rivals\u2014I, never!\u2014thy Pauline\u2014love\u2014no more of Pauline?\u2014If you had wished to leave me for ever, you would not have deserted me\u2014Love eternal\u2014To die\u2014\u2014\"\n\nThe words caused him a sort of remorse; he seized the tongs, and rescued a last fragment of the letter from the flames.\n\n\"I have murmured,\" so Pauline wrote, \"but I have never complained, my Raphael! If you have left me so far behind you, it was doubtless because you wished to hide some heavy grief from me. Perhaps you will kill me one of these days, but you are too good to torture me. So do not go away from me like this. There! I can bear the worst of torment, if only I am at your side. Any grief that you could cause me would not be grief. There is far more love in my heart for you than I have ever yet shown you. I can endure anything, except this weeping far away from you, this ignorance of your\u2014\u2014\"\n\nRaphael laid the scorched scrap on the mantelpiece, then all at once he flung it into the fire. The bit of paper was too clearly a symbol of his own love and luckless existence.\n\n\"Go and find M. Bianchon,\" he told Jonathan.\n\nHorace came and found Raphael in bed.\n\n\"Can you prescribe a draught for me\u2014some mild opiate which will always keep me in a somnolent condition, a draught that will not be injurious although taken constantly.\"\n\n\"Nothing is easier,\" the young doctor replied; \"but you will have to keep on your feet for a few hours daily, at any rate, so as to take your food.\"\n\n\"A few hours!\" Raphael broke in; \"no, no! I only wish to be out of bed for an hour at most.\"\n\n\"What is your object?\" inquired Bianchon.\n\n\"To sleep; for so one keeps alive, at any rate,\" the patient answered. \"Let no one come in, not even Mlle. Pauline de Wistchnau!\" he added to Jonathan, as the doctor was writing out his prescription.\n\n\"Well, M. Horace, is there any hope?\" the old servant asked, going as far as the flight of steps before the door, with the young doctor.\n\n\"He may live for some time yet, or he may die to-night. The chances of life and death are evenly balanced in his case. I can't understand it at all,\" said the doctor, with a doubtful gesture. \"His mind ought to be diverted.\"\n\n\"Diverted! Ah, sir, you don't know him! He killed a man the other day without a word!\u2014Nothing can divert him!\"\n\nFor some days Raphael lay plunged in the torpor of this artificial sleep. Thanks to the material power that opium exerts over the immaterial part of us, this man with the powerful and active imagination reduced himself to the level of those sluggish forms of animal life that lurk in the depths of forests, and take the form of vegetable refuse, never stirring from their place to catch their easy prey. He had darkened the very sun in heaven; the daylight never entered his room. About eight o'clock in the evening he would leave his bed, with no very clear consciousness of his own existence; he would satisfy the claims of hunger and return to bed immediately. One dull blighted hour after another only brought confused pictures and appearances before him, and lights and shadows against a background of darkness. He lay buried in deep silence; movement and intelligence were completely annihilated for him. He woke later than usual one evening, and found that his dinner was not ready. He rang for Jonathan.\n\n\"You can go,\" he said. \"I have made you rich; you shall be happy in your old age; but I will not let you muddle away my life any longer. Miserable wretch! I am hungry\u2014where is my dinner? How is it?\u2014Answer me!\"\n\nA satisfied smile stole over Jonathan's face. He took a candle that lit up the great dark rooms of the mansion with its flickering light; brought his master, who had again become an automaton, into a great gallery, and flung a door suddenly open. Raphael was all at once dazzled by a flood of light and amazed by an unheard-of scene.\n\nHis chandeliers had been filled with wax-lights; the rarest flowers from his conservatory were carefully arranged about the room; the table sparkled with silver, gold, crystal, and porcelain; a royal banquet was spread\u2014the odors of the tempting dishes tickled the nervous fibres of the palate. There sat his friends; he saw them among beautiful women in full evening dress, with bare necks and shoulders, with flowers in their hair; fair women of every type, with sparkling eyes, attractively and fancifully arrayed. One had adopted an Irish jacket, which displayed the alluring outlines of her form; one wore the \"basquina\" of Andalusia, with its wanton grace; here was a half-clad Dian the huntress, there the costume of Mlle. de la Valliere, amorous and coy; and all of them alike were given up to the intoxication of the moment.\n\nAs Raphael's death-pale face showed itself in the doorway, a sudden outcry broke out, as vehement as the blaze of this improvised banquet. The voices, perfumes, and lights, the exquisite beauty of the women, produced their effect upon his senses, and awakened his desires. Delightful music, from unseen players in the next room, drowned the excited tumult in a torrent of harmony\u2014the whole strange vision was complete.\n\nRaphael felt a caressing pressure on is own hand, a woman's white, youthful arms were stretched out to grasp him, and the hand was Aquilina's. He knew now that this scene was not a fantastic illusion like the fleeting pictures of his disordered dreams; he uttered a dreadful cry, slammed the door, and dealt his heartbroken old servant a blow in the face.\n\n\"Monster!\" he cried, \"so you have sworn to kill me!\" and trembling at the risks he had just now run, he summoned all his energies, reached his room, took a powerful sleeping draught, and went to bed.\n\n\"The devil!\" cried Jonathan, recovering himself. \"And M. Bianchon most certainly told me to divert his mind.\"\n\nIt was close upon midnight. By that time, owing to one of those physical caprices that are the marvel and the despair of science, Raphael, in his slumber, became radiant with beauty. A bright color glowed on his pale cheeks. There was an almost girlish grace about the forehead in which his genius was revealed. Life seemed to bloom on the quiet face that lay there at rest. His sleep was sound; a light, even breath was drawn in between red lips; he was smiling\u2014he had passed no doubt through the gate of dreams into a noble life. Was he a centenarian now? Did his grandchildren come to wish him length of days? Or, on a rustic bench set in the sun and under the trees, was he scanning, like the prophet on the mountain heights, a promised land, a far-off time of blessing.\n\n\"Here you are!\"\n\nThe words, uttered in silver tones, dispelled the shadowy faces of his dreams. He saw Pauline, in the lamplight, sitting upon the bed; Pauline grown fairer yet through sorrow and separation. Raphael remained bewildered by the sight of her face, white as the petals of some water flower, and the shadow of her long, dark hair about it seemed to make it whiter still. Her tears had left a gleaming trace upon her cheeks, and hung there yet, ready to fall at the least movement. She looked like an angel fallen from the skies, or a spirit that a breath might waft away, as she sat there all in white, with her head bowed, scarcely creasing the quilt beneath her weight.\n\n\"Ah, I have forgotten everything!\" she cried, as Raphael opened his eyes. \"I have no voice left except to tell you, 'I am yours.' There is nothing in my heart but love. Angel of my life, you have never been so beautiful before! Your eyes are blazing\u2014\u2014 But come, I can guess it all. You have been in search of health without me; you were afraid of me\u2014\u2014 well\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Go! go! leave me,\" Raphael muttered at last. \"Why do you not go? If you stay, I shall die. Do you want to see me die?\"\n\n\"Die?\" she echoed. \"Can you die without me? Die? But you are young; and I love you! Die?\" she asked, in a deep, hollow voice. She seized his hands with a frenzied movement. \"Cold!\" she wailed. \"Is it all an illusion?\"\n\nRaphael drew the little bit of skin from under his pillow; it was as tiny and as fragile as a periwinkle petal. He showed it to her.\n\n\"Pauline!\" he said, \"fair image of my fair life, let us say good-bye?\"\n\n\"Good-bye?\" she echoed, looking surprised.\n\n\"Yes. This is a talisman that grants me all my wishes, and that represents my span of life. See here, this is all that remains of it. If you look at me any longer, I shall die\u2014\u2014\"\n\nThe young girl thought that Valentin had grown lightheaded; she took the talisman and went to fetch the lamp. By its tremulous light which she shed over Raphael and the talisman, she scanned her lover's face and the last morsel of the magic skin. As Pauline stood there, in all the beauty of love and terror, Raphael was no longer able to control his thoughts; memories of tender scenes, and of passionate and fevered joys, overwhelmed the soul that had so long lain dormant within him, and kindled a fire not quite extinct.\n\n\"Pauline! Pauline! Come to me\u2014\u2014\"\n\nA dreadful cry came from the girl's throat, her eyes dilated with horror, her eyebrows were distorted and drawn apart by an unspeakable anguish; she read in Raphael's eyes the vehement desire in which she had once exulted, but as it grew she felt a light movement in her hand, and the skin contracted. She did not stop to think; she fled into the next room, and locked the door.\n\n\"Pauline! Pauline!\" cried the dying man, as he rushed after her; \"I love you, I adore you, I want you, Pauline! I wish to die in your arms!\"\n\nWith unnatural strength, the last effort of ebbing life, he broke down the door, and saw his mistress writhing upon a sofa. Pauline had vainly tried to pierce her heart, and now thought to find a rapid death by strangling herself with her shawl.\n\n\"If I die, he will live,\" she said, trying to tighten the knot that she had made.\n\nIn her struggle with death her hair hung loose, her shoulders were bare, her clothing was disordered, her eyes were bathed in tears, her face was flushed and drawn with the horror of despair; yet as her exceeding beauty met Raphael's intoxicated eyes, his delirium grew. He sprang towards her like a bird of prey, tore away the shawl, and tried to take her in his arms.\n\nThe dying man sought for words to express the wish that was consuming his strength; but no sounds would come except the choking death-rattle in his chest. Each breath he drew sounded hollower than the last, and seemed to come from his very entrails. At the last moment, no longer able to utter a sound, he set his teeth in Pauline's breast. Jonathan appeared, terrified by the cries he had heard, and tried to tear away the dead body from the grasp of the girl who was crouching with it in a corner.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she asked. \"He is mine, I have killed him. Did I not foresee how it would be?\"1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/7799113", "artist_names": "Cam Carter", "full_title": "Make, Love Not History: A Modern Declaration of our Global Cry for Peace by\u00a0Cam\u00a0Carter", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/dad9336ddaf54d2c5507837b428c2f29.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/dad9336ddaf54d2c5507837b428c2f29.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 7799113, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 9158329, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1647320362, "path": "/Cam-carter-make-love-not-history-a-modern-declaration-of-our-global-cry-for-peace-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Cam-carter-make-love-not-history-a-modern-declaration-of-our-global-cry-for-peace-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 4}, "release_date_for_display": "July 4, 2015", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jul. 4, 2015", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/dad9336ddaf54d2c5507837b428c2f29.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/dad9336ddaf54d2c5507837b428c2f29.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Make, Love Not History: A Modern Declaration of our Global Cry for Peace", "title_with_featured": "Make, Love Not History: A Modern Declaration of our Global Cry for Peace", "updated_by_human_at": 1647320362, "url": "https://genius.com/Cam-carter-make-love-not-history-a-modern-declaration-of-our-global-cry-for-peace-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1922881", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0cb1c09f89daa4e1ddcb2cc9d3a862c8.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 1922881, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/dad9336ddaf54d2c5507837b428c2f29.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": true, "name": "Cam Carter", "slug": "Cam-carter", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Cam-carter", "iq": 5248}, "artist": "Cam Carter", "lyrics": "Make, Love Not History: A Modern Declaration of our Global Cry for Peace LyricsMake Love, Not History:\nA modern Declaration of our global cry for peace\nAmor vincit omnia, docendo discimus\n\n\n\nBy: Cam Carter\nThe Pieces of Peace\nJuly 04, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter from the Author:\n\n\tThroughout my journey called life, I\u205fhave\u205fcome\u205fto deeply admire\u205fthe great writers\u205fand creative thinkers of this world.  Their differences have relayed a common truth:  that we are capable of our own desires, direction, and destruction.\n\t\n\tI hav\u0435 personally witnessed d\u0435speration strike, and it took everything just to be me.  Encouraging myself through struggles, finding who I was and who I wanted to be.  The truth is hard to imagine, but inside we are like animals, ravaging through excuses, diving towards despair, blinding ourselves as we watch madness breed madness, lingering alone in the midst of death, war, famine, and captivity.\n\n\tI will be the first to admit that I am not perfect.  I do not claim to be a chosen prophet of God, but I do have a gift that should be taken seriously.  Through my faith and the grace of God, I have been allowed knowledge, understanding, strength, and harmony.  I continue to learn, hoping to accumulate the wisdom to help mankind to open their minds to grasp a truth, subliminally buried beneath the flowers and the shadows of our dappled lies.\n\n\tDespite what I believe to be real or fantasy, we can all agree that we all have enemies.  In order to reach our growth potential as a human race, we must analyze our environment by coming together in peace so we can recognize the source of our good and evil.  Consider this my attempt to enlighten humanity by embracing our differences to make a difference.\n\n\tAs you read this rhapsody, know that it comes from a resurgent vision that stems from the warmest place in my heart.  With our ever-changing world I humbly pray that this message is heard and spread to as many people as possible.  Our different belief systems, language barriers, and lifestyles all share a certain passion that makes each of us unique and beautiful.  Together we can make love and peace the beginning of forever.\n\n\tI am confident that the human race will understand this revelation even though it may initially seem enigmatic and tactical.  I wanted to challenge society by painting a picture that shows that we must save one another from what we have become.  We have to salvage our future by being more clairvoyant with our hearts.  We must establish a vibrant truce, teaching as we learn before it\u2019s too late.  We have to rise above the blemishes of our vicarious sacrifices.\n\n\tLet us walk on our dirt and spring from our fall.  Let us not separate ourselves by the color of our skin or by religion, but rather love one another through our mistakes.  As population and information continues to increase, we statistically become more dangerous.  Internationally, our governments are already implementing precautions to prepare forces to retain order from potential chaos.  Let us not lose everything our ancestors fought for.  With the prophecies in place and the symptoms of the end of days nearby, we should hone our hearts and reiterate our beliefs.  We absolutely have to love our brothers and sisters and teach our future by example.\n\n\tA famous friend once told me something that I\u2019ll never forget. \u201cEverything is knowledge,\u201d he said.  \u201cYou just have to learn it.\u201d  I\u2019ve never seen peace, but I know it is possible.  Regardless of our scars and whatever \u201cHell\u2019\u201d we think we have been through, know there\u2019s more if we let it be.  I\u2019ve languished amongst raw evil and it inspires me to know that its opposite is near.  We have to be capable of hope, love, and respect if we are guilty of violence, hatred, and gangs.  We are a new breed of thinkers, so why do we continue to be brainwashed into being a mere spectator in a solicitously shrewd secret?  Writing this took a lot out of me.  It stemmed from a dream and was inspired by the concept of Dante Alighieri\u2019s \u201cDivine Comedy\u201d.  Use my words to find yourself.  When you find your love again, follow the road and never give up on it.  It took me losing everything to appreciate I had all along.\n\n\n-Cam Carter\n\u201cMake Love, Not History\u201d\nJuly 04, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\n\nTo my Beautiful Family\n\nMom and Dad, for your endless love and support.  Nothing in life could ever repay or thank you enough.  I owe you both the world, and I\u2019ll never give up on making you proud.\n\nJanice and Robbie, for the sacrifices you made, your charisma, patience, and endurance.  I know it wasn\u2019t all that easy.  You\u2019ve always done an outstanding job.  God will remember you.\n\nAlex and Lane, for the timeless memories of growing up, for being there when I should have been, and standing firm to who you are. I\u2019m very proud of who you\u2019ve become.  I\u2019m sorry I ever looked away.\nThe University of Mississippi, for educating me to believe in myself when others couldn\u2019t, teaching me how to utilize my passion for writing, and showing me that it\u2019s okay to be a rebel.  Hotty Toddy!\n\nI love each of you with my everything!\n\n\nPer angusta ad augusta, aut familia aut nihil\n\n\n\u201cThree things will last forever- faith, hope, and love-and the greatest of these is love\u201d\n(1 Corinthians 13:13 NLT)\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let the whole world into your story, but you can let the ones that matter the most.  And you should.\u201d\n(Stephen King, author)\n\n\n\n\u201cAll it takes is one good person to restore hope!\u201d\n(Pope Francis)\n\n\n\n\u201cThe ends justify the means.\u201d\n(Niccol\u00f3 Machiavelli, Philosopher)\n\n\n\n\n\tPART ONE: ARS LONGA, VITA BREVIS\n\nIf you received this then you have passed the test, and now it\u2019s time to separate our fate from all the rest.  Not by envy, but inspiration.  Not by detachment in distress, that is designed and forgotten and discarded in a desk.  Not by fantasy, but hope.  The truth and nothing less.  Distinguished by democracy, reprised by our stress.  Hydroplaned by poverty to stall the manifest, to carry all my brothers with more patience in each step.  With permutation without perish and not plummet to our debt, but rather rise like a phoenix from the ashes of our deaths.\n\n\tWith this exclusive message and whatever will that you shall choose, remember life is a choice so consider this choice on you.  Because no matter what our lessons or what alleged history has proved, we should never succumb to life\u2019s vicissitudes.  Trust me once and don\u2019t be weary, deliberate each move.  Listen to your love and be sincere at what you do.  Don\u2019t be left to languish, left alone without a clue.  Trapped inside a nightmare-not knowing what to do.  I feel it is my mission to save us from the news, but we can\u2019t hide in the darkness and expect to know the truth.\n\n\tWith my entire me, I have been told forever that I can\u2019t.  Too small, too stupid, like it was written in advance.  But instead of boxing out the world and feeding into their plan, I died inside.  Then I ran.  To the fields where we battle, idolized by our fans, inspired by their eyes, pretending not to give a damn.  The inner child trapped inside, still surviving in a man, holding the flowers of tomorrow with a simple smile in demand.  For knowledge not yet learned with all our blood soaked in the land.  Reprimanded by a lie, but who am I to make a stand?  This isn\u2019t narcissistic knowledge; this is our future in our hands.  Please listen, pay close attention.  We don\u2019t have much time to dance.\n\n\tMany dreams will diminish, even some will disappear.  Make for sure that you won\u2019t follow that sleepy smoke inside each mirror.  All our elegies will cry, and all our teachers will revere, and all our students will seek illusions and we\u2019ll recycle how we\u2019re here.  Seek whom the crime shall profit, let justice reappear, not severe to an innocent on an immanent frontier, but be honest to constituents, not blind them by their fear.  Don\u2019t dazzle with what sounds good, adhesive there and near.  Be more visual and evident, not as viscerally clear.  We are everything that\u2019s backwards because we\u2019re accidentally weird.\n\n\tUsing adverbs as adjectives while holding back a cure, stealing from our parents when we never were that sure, branding luxuries in lyrics, promoting Pyrrhic splurge, creating what is cool just to get on someone\u2019s nerves, using guns on people, demonstrating what we learn, watching what we see instead of showing more concern, shielding demagogues to poison us to buy off an urge, impulsive with their interests but deceptive with their words, depleting population, paving the way by thinning herds, the more and more we do, the more and more we seem absurd.\n\n\tAt the expense of darkness that gets revealed on center stage, laying down a royal flush, staring fiends in their face, playing dominoes with the devil, petrifying in a cage, dying to live again, somewhere not afraid.  Persisting youth to raise awareness amongst their psychogenic phase, teaching as we listen, losing count of all the days, getting closer to our maker, persevering in a plague, knowing that we must get through troubles to make it through the maze, hurting for others that don\u2019t care about today, repeating stupid actions when we can make a change, thinking peace is improper and ironic and a rave, ripping off the petals, tossing our roots into a flame, praying for a dollar that can be deemed another way, calumniating kids to believe in something fake, exonerating murderers to keep the cycle all the same.  We\u2019re on the breach of living dead always stuck within our pain, laughing at a joke when you\u2019re just a puppet in a play.  On the brink of martial law\u2026 it\u2019s a cold old game.\n\n\tI used to hate on history, but now I understand why we\u2019re beating on drums with our hands, singing to a plant for a century as the Renaissance man claims omnipotence in theory-still embraced by the damned.  We\u2019re quick to jump for attention but are deflected by default, sorting through the questions not hearing what we\u2019re taught.  As we listen in submission, but expeditious when we talk, wishing for a miracle as vicious as a hawk, gripping competition, pretending not to be involved, twisting every syllable, presiding every form of art.  Precision in addition with everything we bought, and it\u2019s a crying shame that we are what we are.\n\n\tIf you read the wrong book, you\u2019ll get treated like you\u2019re small.  Labeled as a citizen and tracked like a dog.  Maybe smooth as a criminal or whacked with the law.  Either way it doesn\u2019t matter, we lack unity, so we fall.  But if you play dumb you will still walk the halls.  Blend in Mr. Gentleman-you\u2019ll maybe get the ball.  Run for a moment but forget how to crawl.  Arm candy on your arm LOST in a phone call.\n\n\tWe talk about nothing all day long.  Take the puzzle called LIFE and try and piece it in a song.  Differentiate the meaning when everybody\u2019s wrong.  We indulge in our yesterdays when our yesterdays are GONE.  We\u2019re moving so fast we tend to only focus on pawns.  Sacrificing time, flip a quarter in a pond, fishing coalitions still quisling bonds, then live for the day to only die by the dawn.  Tantalizing truth, teasing youth in a con, sensing serendipity but sold out for a gun.  Curious to learn lies (cool cats) die for the fun, but scared to die for the Son, leaders: trap, trick, and run\u2026\n\n\tI know things are hard because I\u2019ve seen the road to.  I probably lost everything to try to help you.  Been overwhelmed by reality and still in pursuit\u2026 of happiness in harmony with love and truth.\n\n\tBut what\u2019s the point of changing views still doing what we do?  We lie by surprise, make our habits to a loop.  Deny it till the day of that final interview.  Nod your head, turn the page.  Bite your tongue, still confused.  But can we make love after all we been through?  Have we seen enough death?  Is it time to make moves?  We are people after all, didn\u2019t people make rules?  We prevaricated our friends, equivocating our crew\u2026 So, what is it going to take?  Can we really make do?  Can we humble our mistakes?  Is everything I say true?  We\u2019re embarking in the end, which side will you choose?  Are you red?  Are you blue?  Do we win?  Do we lose?\n\n\tMy purpose isn\u2019t only to hit you where it hurts.  Or reinvent Hell to find the diamonds in the dirt.  Open doors to the wise or provide more work.  Or stop a bullet in its tracks before it hits you in the shirt.  It\u2019s to save all the wandering from becoming what we were.  Bring peace through congruity by shining light on what occurs.  Take what\u2019s real from reality and feed it to the birds.  Because if we die now, we will always have words.\n\n\tI never said it would be easy.  You have to know it take guts.  To size up evil and never freeze up.  You have to help you before you ever help us\u2026 Pretty soon it\u2019ll all be dust, and it\u2019s crazy how we let ourselves lose touch.  Killing our own kind with the same guns that we love. Take your time and understand, what is and what was.  But don\u2019t listen to the world, listen to your love.  Stop violence by stopping what we must.  With everybody\u2019s hustle, we\u2019ll never need luck.  Here\u2019s my journey through Hell towards love.  Not covet but soar as a dove.  Broken wings still flying towards love.  Making justice just a little more just.  Making friends just a little more trust.  We\u2019ve been in the dark too long and enough is enough!\n\n\tSo read between the lines, it\u2019ll all add up.\n\nMay I pick a rose and leave it on her grave?\nMay I take this minute and question all our pain?\nMay I earn your friendship and request and equal aim?\nMay I die alive, not alone or in vain?\nMay I say goodbye to all that remains?\nMay I pray for yesterday and look the other way?\nMay I see tomorrow\u2019s enigma in a way,\nSo, I can make a difference with our differences today?\n\nMay I wonder why we\u2019re watching blindfolded by the news?\nWhy are we so amused every time we are abused?\nWhy are our perspectives so misled and misconstrued?\nWhy are we held captive and inclined to be reduced?\nWhy toss topsoil on everything we do?\nWhy not open doors for people who are rude?\nWhy deprive knowledge when it should be introduced?\nWhy ask questions when we\u2019re sitting on the truth?\n\n\tIf we are like vultures, violating all our fruit\u2026  Our ellipsis can\u2019t protect us from the poison in our food.  Listen, pay attention to the move!  In every riddle-in the middle- there\u2019s a clue\u2026  No deception, masquerading any proof\u2026. No second guessing, this is absolutely you!  Believe by yourself, I can\u2019t hide yourself from you\u2026  Believe in yourself.  They can\u2019t make you be a fool\u2026.\n\n\tWe can\u2019t be guided by love if we\u2019re corrected by fear.  The triple crown\u2019s alive, still residing in the clear.  In a nation within a nation, protecting Maximus each year, forcing lies to our surprise our prophecy is here.  In an ocean of emotions, overdosing in our tears.  So acoustic with excuses, simulating how we\u2019re here.  If we remain less intentional, we\u2019ll flashback to the rear, and become that sleepy smoke that we just mentioned in the mirror.  So, listen when you hear.  Please listen as a witness-pay attention to your peers.\n\n\tFirst of all, dividends aren\u2019t meant to be our friends.  Treasures hidden on an island are meant to hide them from revenge.  The serpent slips and slithers and blends in as noble men and will betray one for false beautiful to trick and kick them in the chin.  We can\u2019t sell out now, we can\u2019t sail without our wind.  We have been granted gifts to defend us from our sin, but we\u2019re too caught up in ourselves for us to see or comprehend.  Eyes too busy burning personals with the dexterity defense.  We learn by mistakes-play not to lose-instead of win.  The only times we stop to memorize are through our camera\u2019s lens.  When we see the bigger picture we gawk, glamorize, and grin.  Fake it just to make it nearly naked-innocent.  Photoshop a life, cloning demons, tricking them.  Summon up the courage through a spirit dead within.  Post it to a page, reveal a face as evidence.  Develop it, to value it, then store it in a bin.  A mere memory, a sole signature, lost inside again.  A conduit condemned to be condoned in the end, reaching far, through broken hearts, to only touch pretend.\n\n\tNow we tell visions with televisions, but never meet the writer\u2019s pen.  As stars are fed caviar; rewarded by limelight in their syringe.  Strung out on success in a pool of stress within, boxing up awards, forgetting who helped who begin.  Secrets kept in circles tight heir loomed by suffering.  Idols nearly worshipped, sacrificed by youths of prim.  Slumbered by the weight of all the knowledge to a sense.  It\u2019s everything we lose-sometimes we have to lose to win.\n\n\tFriends get betrayed to free a guilty man that\u2019s rich.\n\tParasites arrayed in a place that\u2019s full of ticks.\n\tSociety displayed on a page of ignorance.\n\tHypocrites on a stage in a world of politics.\n\tFalling in a pit.  Falling in abyss.\n\tFather Time, Mother Nature, all irrelevant.\n\tHiding in our lies, trapped inside our hate.\n\tHope and wait through adversity-we\u2019re due a better fate.\n\n\tEducation should be the basis for the children we must raise.  Because phonetics and this message could die with me in my grave.  I see our salvation in a lost recession age, and it is up to us.  We must learn to be the change.\n\n\tI have seen the golden head fall to Roman legs and feet.  The churches mixed with politics, controlling all the weak.  The ten tribes for marriage vows, together for defeat.  The proud whore of Babylon is seated on the beast.  The dark side of the moon will play for more than what it keeps.  As the taste of gunpowder dwells on everything we eat.  Still very uncivilized and savage, ravaging the beat, wiping blood from the sword of victory-promoting that very crime in the street.  Preparing for war, lying as if we plan for peace.  Selling dreams to our doubt in a black cloud of retreat.  Nearly destine to bleed in colors by the seven shades of greed, pontificating free when freedom\u2019s creed is always green.\n\n\tA modern revelation; a message sinking deep.  Inside a whale of variance beyond the thirty-third degree.  A story told but better shown, so through a quest \u201cwe shall see.\u201d  Three words of many kings without any kingdom at my feet.  Another brother heard the Trumpet, mulching miracles to be\u2026 never worthy of your worship-so please don\u2019t ever worship me\u2026 but help me take these words and plant them around the globe on every beach.  Every troubled heart.  Every distant mystery.  We are the world if we grow together like a tree.  On the shoulder of a giant comes our once good company.\n\n\tConsider this the declaration of our global cry for peace.  Sealed with a lock and a million-dollar key.  Held captive away from society, but yet I still believe-in society, we see only what we want to see.  Remember true poetic justice always comes with a fee, but if you decide to open it, you\u2019ll open up your dreams.  I\u2019ll try not to cry, die, question, jeopardize or deceive.  We are unique as people!  Let\u2019s try to be friends with enemies, defend those new friends from evil, plant more plants so we can breathe, share love and kill our violence-erase our tension in decree, lets cultivate our nobles and rebuke our devilry.  Find your faith\u2026 still hope and wait... and germinate this seed.\n\n\tYes, these words of witness steal my pride and flesh appeal.\n\tYes, this well-timed wisdom is really real and how I feel.\n\tThis is my pugnacious purpose since my adolescent build.\n\tThe power of my pen is my sword and my shield.\n\n\tA pioneer prosecuted through a perilous place concealed.  Through a glass blocked by concrete, and small walls that seem like steel.  A scope that must protect itself to be invested in a skill, persevering pain, not to gain, but to always be sincere.\n\t\n\tWhere the pesky and the petty befriend beggars, snakes, and eels.  Vamped by radios and mistletoes, misled by issues still.  Hate in hibernation, dictated dangers-with the will to kill.  While others pray in circles, redeemed by time and timeless tears.  While the city tends to die as modern slaves live to tell the tale.  The urges to be home, when the only home is through the mail.  The scars of where we are, only weighs down perception Libra\u2019s scale.  Consider this my light shining far outside my cell.\n\t\nWhat we have always wanted is a job somewhere else.  Vexing constellations leaning on Orion\u2019s belt.  Levitating pendulums, swinging shades of all avail, texting in a test-under desks of embered ail.  Guessing as we stress, perplexed by lessons never fair.\n\nWhen we lose our best friends, cheating when we\u2019re offered help.  Wasting all your blessings-constant thinking of yourself.  Patient with our wishes- Saint Lucia, reading brail.  The cruelest of cruel waters cumber some and for a spell.\n\nWhy is our love gone-somewhere, loving someone else?  Nestled next to demons while their souls are flying stealth.  Their happiness is forged to die inside a salted snail, denying words that will spare their hearts that were golden molded well.\n\nHow are we twice as smart, while empty brains line upon the shelf?  Teaching tales of teachers disguised by garnished lazy wealth.  Crystalized to their demise when Death has raised his blackest veil.  But I can save the people with my Halo into Hell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart two: Halo into hell\n\n\nThrough nine rings of fire guided slowly amongst the dead.  The one place where blood covers the road that twists ahead.  Zen can\u2019t balance sin when bodies claw the painful wind.  Towered through the blight as time knives surviving skin.  Parasites and famine paralyze the sludge in pods.  Sectioned off torture lurks in numbers forlornly odd.  Scorned in all regard, pedantic tanks of broken hearts.  Buried in Botticelli, seven rays of fatal art.\n\nAlone through the suffering, fighting unfair to stay alive, immolating time, imbruing tithes to take a tie.  Never losing faith because the truth will light their lies, preparing for escape behind closed curtains in their eyes.\n\nDante in red as Virgil guides his side, scrupling and hesitant, as peril seeks another bride.  Deception smirks.  The humble hurt.  The banshee wails its painful cry.  The yesterdays are all the same and everyone must die\u2026 but if we survive these troubled times and stop imprudent ties.  Overcome impossibles and put obstacles aside.  Not brag or boast, escape the ghosts, and do away with pride.  The mighty fall, the small grow tall-the optimist will rise!\n\nOppression under pressure, oxymoronic on a stage.\nOverruled by tragedy-terror in a day.\nThe backseat of destruction, holding bullets with your name.\nAs crooks beg for mercy but will never change their way.\nWhen a beautiful oblivion hides behind a cage.\nThe memories of misery are bound to leave a stain.\nThe epitome of epiphanies will never be the same.\nAnd the best book is you so don\u2019t forget the path you came.\n\nDon\u2019t close your eyes too fast and blink away each breath.\nDon\u2019t vanish in the wind before you have a chance to step.\nDon\u2019t get consumed in the moment.\nWhen you know you\u2019re right and nothing\u2019s left\u2026?\nDon\u2019t let anyone or anything make you crippled from your best.\n\nThe suffering burns a darkness on piano keys of hate.  The discipline involved in channeled passion in a safe.  Hidden by the negatives brought by the means of fate.  We can make it through mistakes, but it takes true courage to escape.\n\nMuscles growing tight, pulling love out of a cave.\nNervous of the heights and the depths of all we made.\nDesperate for attention while still running from the grave.\nBalanced by the Gemini, still longing to be brave.\n\nSaving every life that\u2019s still willing to be saved.\nWaking up the sleeping crowd of sheep lost in the maze.\nKnowing in my heart that soon we will find the way.\nFriendship with the world, will never get you raised.\n\nResist the power, forcing you to lead back to the flame.\nSharpen every instrument we must fight our way to pain.\nWe lost our guide, but I am here, and we are here the same.\nThis is Hell and to escape this jail we must love the hate away.\n\nControl the temper in it, don\u2019t listen to the blade.\nBe true despite the mockers and the bullies of the date.\nBest friends will testify and feed you to the snake.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nAll our love awaits the other side of Satan\u2019s gates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThere\u2019s no need for looking back.  We should all be looking up.  Be grateful for what you have.  Don\u2019t be slaving for some luck.  The tribulations will be tough, therefore He suffered just for us.  It may be heavy where we\u2019re at, but we can overcome a rut.  Heal from a cut and emerge from our lust.  The situation is critical-because critics always fuss.  Some rubble will be rough.  Be strong.  Be well.  Be love.\n\n\tNow that you can see this image smeared into your mind.  Take one last look at the Hell we left behind.  Sisyphus and Tantalus still shuffle through their bind, searching for something out of nothing of all our emptiness combined.  I understand your pain, it may seem a dream to find.  Help in a time-where help itself, would never try.  When people walk right by, too proud to look you in the eye.  Too cold to even cry as the lonesome days turn to night.  Remember God still loves us because there will always be the light.  But we have to put our love to action and live by what is right.  Don\u2019t be afraid to fight the devil, don\u2019t feed into what he likes.  Life is a jungle and the blessed will earn their stripes.\n\nSo, think before you blink, slow down and learn before you talk.\nWe\u2019re so quick to live and ramble and we wonder why we\u2019re lost.\n\nCorruption hardly questioned and our questions remain unsolved.  Days keep going by as all our crime is swept to law.  The papers scream, \u201cWe\u2019re innocent\u201d although our human rights are gone.  Railroaded by sobriety and written to another song.  The song that\u2019s never heard because our kings are still those pawns.  Disavowed by authority, brandishing their brawn.\n\nBleeding tears for everyone as our selfishness exceeds.  Stretching coast to coast like a viral night disease.  Influencing the masses despite all our evil deeds.  Seeing is believing, but haven\u2019t we seen enough to see?\nDone enough to achieve?\nDone enough to plant a seed?\nDone enough to finally see?\n\nHistory repeat.\nThe evidence concedes.\nWe have much more mouths to feed.\n\nFighting just to bleed?\nHigh of drugs and greed?\nQuestion marks of our defeat?\n\nAs we\u2019re sinking back to yesterday of what we used to be.\n\n\n\n\nPart Three: voices and choices\n\n\nNow with red hands our voices travel much faster than before.  Organized by weapons, kindled hatred by their force.  Pandora\u2019s box of paradox is toxic in its course.  With Malthusian inhabitants so thirsty for a war.  Using excuses to be ruthless to divide us as a fork.\n\nWhile contingencies and enemies torture through a torque, ripping gunners from their families-threatened by divorce, saving the stain of her lipstick from that last step off the porch, fighting to return again-without a home but with remorse, shaking up the gore, letting drugs seep through the door, stressing out and lonely, doing all the devil\u2019s chores, contemplating suicide after surviving through a war, knowing that everybody hurts, but you can\u2019t stand it anymore.\n\nOur arsenal is our love and the decisions we make will endure.  False love will kill armies if our conduct is ignored.  The products, another variable sold in a boarded store, weighing our irrelevance because everybody\u2019s poor.  Life is so much more than blood, guts, and gore\u2026 than lies, cries, and lore\u2026 than who is set up for the score\u2026\nSo, what are we fighting for?\nWhat are we hiding for?\nWhat are we dying for?\nAre we even living anymore?\nThe scientists of death are wise with their economic trend.  The media\u2019s assessment guesses through their camera\u2019s lens.  The psychology of life is sold like Bibles on a stand.  The governments of everywhere make everything a brand.  The money flips our roots on nearly everything we plant.  The nouns of the world make us busy as an ant.  The nabobs and necromancers liquidate the land, as malefic phases are fiercely flawed on purpose to manipulate a man.\n\nIf our music tends to die inside our whispers feeling small.\nThen can the answers be explained by the prudence down the hall?\n\nRearranged in a game timed by a frozen hourglass.\nChallenged by adversity to be drug back to the past.\n\nCan we synchronize our love and amplify our laugh?  Build bridges for tomorrow and never look back, but be humbled fact the fact, that we choose if we collapse.  The inevitable will happen so be true with what you have.  Be bold in every task because life is not an act.\n\nLife is a sentence.  Life is a pact.\nLife is a struggle.  Life is a blast.\nLife is a gift.  Life is a fact.\nLife is a blessing.\n\nSo, live life while it lasts.\n\nLife is a gateway, narrow in its path.\nLife is a flower, intertwined within our grasp.\nLife is a magic that\u2019s heavy and vast.\nLife is a support as a boom and a mast.\n\nLife is a circle, beautiful in all.\nLife is a metaphor, dying just to crawl.\nLife is a promise, the leaves of a tree.\nLife is forever and all that we need.\n\nLife is our trust and we must believe.\nLife is each other, together in peace.\nLife is submission, a pod for a pea.\nLife is our love and that is our key.\nMake life.  Make love.  Not history.\n\n\tDeath is widespread, wantonly warding the wind.\n\tWayward like wealth, winning more as we sin.\n\tProblems in problems, an outsource of disease.\n\tThe purge of a puppet, punching lines in a speech.\n\n\tDeath is a darkness, a threat in a fret.\n\tDeath is a nothing you\u2019d never expect.\n\tDeath is easy and silent as a silhouette.\n\tDeath is a pain you\u2019d never forget.\n\tDeath is a blank space that\u2019s left on a test.\n\tDeath is sleep that never gets rest.\n\tDeath is a sinkhole that\u2019s left on a chest.\n\tDeath is a message that dies on a quest.\n\n\tDeath is deceptive and a hard sacrifice.\n\tDeath is a cove, the ending of life.\n\nThrough all the years we\u2019ve seen colors fly.\nEnough blues and reds to paint all the sky.\n\nAlthough sometimes, time devours itself.\nA man from a mouse could still use some help.\n\nIn so many words with so much to say.\nFortune will forever favor the brave.\n\nBut if we\u2019re willing to die but aren\u2019t willing to live.\nWe\u2019re willing to steal, unwilling to give.\n\nThe feelings inside, I bring them to light.\nTo unite the world, I\u2019m willing to fight.\n\nFor peace.  For justice.  And anything right.\nWith all of my heart, and all of my might.\nKnowledge, Understanding, Strength, Harmony: Life.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSovereigns have come and conquered and still failed to find a queen.  Our children chase the wind to show their parents everything.  The earth has seen it all, from the peaks of mountains to the streams.  From stoic martyrs to faithless suicide, all in all and in between.\n\n\tWe are the people\u2026 people! Together our numbers will humble any king.  The laws of every average are a finished product of our team.  If we teach the world to smile again instead of hustle every scheme.  We can recycle, reduce, reuse-every unanswered dream, and save billions from the sky by saving our future\u2019s gasoline; caress the sands of time, tuck them in an angel\u2019s wing; make it safe enough where any little kid can swing, without wax or superman or supervision in between.\n\n\tLet us utilize what we learn to cultivate hope somehow by any means.  Without this increase of knowledge, decreasing all our strength.  Raise awareness as a prophet by shining emphasis on things, instead of plotting for a profit, let us teach the world to think!\n\n\tWe must rise towards tomorrow and make this day a memory.  We must always stick together and remain in harmony.  We must live for this occasion to make peace less make believe.  We must start a revolution and Make Love, Not History!\n\nWe must respect the little laws and abide by destiny, purifying hearts, letting hope retake the lead, cleansing what\u2019s ahead instead of what\u2019s behind our feet, putting action into words and keep our promises to keep.  Give the gift of knowledge even to our enemies, saving those around us from false teachers in decree, listening to their stories to recognize the melody, focusing through mistakes, ratifying love to be.  Despite our tendencies.  Make Love, Not History!\n\n\tNo one is perfect, sometimes we learn through our pain.  Sometimes the opportunities are opted in a flame.  Sometimes all abilities are forsaken through the fame.  Sometimes we must fall again to remind us where we came.  Sometimes we drown our ignorance, looking up in the rain.  Sometimes we build bridges just to burn them once again.  Sometimes that time is lost, and hate tends to build up in your skin.  Sometimes money means more than money, it really just depends.\n\t\n\tWe live with wolves around us, self-controlling rogues with rosaries.  A gangster in a suit with a sadistic monarchy.  A catalyst pursuit in the midst of fallacy.  A safari for the truth, desperate rolling through the deep.  A luminary sleuth driving towards a tragedy.  A DJ in a booth, vibing to an evil beat.  A phantom on the roof synching sequence in a scene.  An anthem in a noose, waiting for an intervene.\n\n\tDespite the known prophecies, what\u2019s done can\u2019t be erased.  Through all tribulations, this generation has seen every trend in place.  Even diabolic paragons envy love-that\u2019s not afraid.  Occults hide in temples, hiding truth inside a maze.  If we pay attention to the many whispers from the grave.  We can save our children from being selfish, ungrateful, and estranged\u2026 or as I, in a zoo, labeled legally insane.\n\n\tWhen our lies are truly feasible to the dormant that remain.  The judges of the world keep it silenced, to keep the game still the same.  As we throw away that pain, stained by blood that used to have a name.  We point our fingers to the clouds when it is US that we should blame.  It is US that we should tame.  It is US that we sustain.  Without complaint!  Without red paint!  Without doubt we shall reign.\n\nWithout compassion for the passionate and without the cards we\u2019re dealt.  We can\u2019t change the world, unless we learn to change ourselves.\n\t\n\tEmbracing the tomb of the unknown and Kennedy\u2019s eternal flame, watching hypocrites in lines all voting for a change, educating students stimulated by cocaine, asking questions for tomorrow, it\u2019ll never be the same.\n\n\tThe cascades of many stages and the abrasions of defeat.  Swim with many sharks with more potential than their teeth.  Then the mentor with the stencil already knows as they speak, but feels the emptiness inside, and all that emptiness was me.  But love still survives, sometimes it keeps away from sleep.  With the butterflies awake, I feel somebody else\u2019s need.  And if I let them fly instead of turning the other cheek.  I know that I can save a life and let discernment finally see.\n\n\tThe Princess died in a tunnel,\n\tLincoln shot in a play,\n\tJesus died on the cross,\n\tCaesars\u2019s court had him slain,\n\tEarnhardt finished what he loved,\n\tDisney\u2019s mind had us play,\n\tI\u2019ve felt the ghosts of Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway,\n\tThe ambition of Columbus with Robert Frost in my veins,\n\tThe courage of Geronimo with DaVinci in my paint,\n\tWith all the drops of Jupiter, and the road Beyond the Gates,\n\tQuestioned history like Hitler\u2026\nI hope we all learned from his hate\u2026\n\nShakespeared my way labyrinths in the city of the dead,\nGrew up in the land of Elvis, now that city\u2019s painted red,\nHave dreams of Dr. King still standing in my head,\nThe intuition of Mr. Farrakhan and all Mandela ever said,\nThe seed of Paul and Bonnie but I\u2019ll never be a saint,\nThey\u2019re my engine and my gas and they have always kept me safe,\nNow I\u2019m blazing guns of innocence,\nAll I lost is on this page\u2026\nI built off what was left behind, and get real for what awaits\u2026\nThe balance of faith and wisdom, the synopsis of my brain.\nMixed with Washington and Churchill and a little Lil Wayne.\nThe source of my beginnings,\nEvery season has its time.\nLet\u2019s spawn a new beginning,\nWe\u2019re too quiet for our mind.\nWhy watch when we can make it?\nLet\u2019s stop living in surprise.\nWe are the world.\nBut disconnected from our very lives.\n\nWe can be more than spectators,\nInstigating petty lies.\nTechnology connives with its conscience,\nThat means knowledge, without eyes.\nConservatives will prosper,\nBut not in a jungle in a bind.\nConstituents piecing puzzles,\nBut quit when problems do arise.\n\nWizards dazzle with their demons,\nDancing devils in disguise.\nDon\u2019t leave without our peace,\nWe can put the past behind.\nDon\u2019t discriminate the races,\nWe\u2019re much stronger all combined.\nJudicially we juggle,\nBut conjunctionally we\u2019re fine.\nEveryone has shadows,\nBut not everyone has time.\n\nLet\u2019s macerate our mask and remember all that die.\nIf we lacerate our fantasy, the hourglass will cry.\nIf we focus on tomorrows, we\u2019ll miss a day of sky.\nIf we what if-ifs forever, we\u2019ll always cherish every lie.\nBut if we stick together, we\u2019ll love more if we try.\nBut only if we try\u2026\nLet\u2019s be honest, who is the\u2026 who am I?\n\nLet us be achievers, not a dreamer all confused.\nLet us be a lender, not a taker and a scrooge.\nLet us be perceptive when we\u2019re doing what we do.\nLet us be fantastic, not so naturally removed.\n\nLet us be more patient with our happiness pursuit.\nLet us be more lucrative with our integrity renewed.\nLet us insure tranquility in the intentions that we choose.\nLet us be deliberate and together when we move.\n\nLet us be examples for a future well construed.\nLet us see through cracks of liberty when our fathers tend to lose.\nLet us ensure education because our books are bulletproof.\nLet us keep our faith in God in everything we do.\n\nLet us cultivate our gardens.\nLet us motivate our youth.\nLet us cultivate our branches.\nLet us motivate our fruit.\n\nLet us cherish every moment.\nLet us reform every due.\nLet us help every odyssey.\nLet us seek every clue.\n\nLet us make love better.\nLet us make something new.\nLet us make love forever.\nIt all starts with you.\n\nNow imagine all the people gathered by their so-called friends, dancing for \u201cjust\u201d dollars, getting tattoos on their hands.  Laid in a phase, spreading aids in a day.  Crazed in a daze, hurt for money so amazed.  Did it all for nothing, medicine for medicine.  So many pills, all the hills, start to spin.  Duplicity in cities of alterity and sin.  The dominoes of dynasties dynamic in the end.  Alliterating words just to see us comprehend.  Wars starting wars making population thin.  Artillery sold at a flick of a pen.  Thirsty for additions, crunching numbers, pressing send.  Connected globally for years in an economic sense.  Can we make a difference despite our differences again?  The oeuvres have closure, ossifying every win.  But we can\u2019t take our faith to the bank, and all things must end.\n\nPollution, gun violence, and domestic abuse.\nPoverty in urban blight creates a sense of urgency to shoot.\nImmigration, corruption, unemployment by the mass.\nDivorce, suicide, budget deficits, and math.\nTeen pregnancy, gambling, stock markets crash.\nPrices of education increase by every class.\nStudent loans, bankruptcy, desperate for a pass.\nSelling food stamps at church, stealing petty cash.\nMore money more problems, less money more death.\nLess money more bottles, more money more stress.\nPolice brutality, anger, and riots in the streets.\nBombs in a stadium, we are our enemies.\nAnother step towards a felon, just as hard to get a job.\nDrugs, excuses, politics-ticking hard.\nParasites a menace, humans trampled by a mob.\nFinally, driven by success, hands up then you\u2019re robbed.\n\nI know the love is still alive because I still feel the wind.\n\nLet us sacrifice our pride, and let it end. Amen!\n\n\tNow that I have your attention, let me make it-make (a little sense).  That darkness still lurks and I\u2019m not talking past tense.\n\n\tWe\u2019re so dependent on technology, we technologically went dumb.  Too ambitious for tomorrow, dead today by the tongue.  If we\u2019re modern coexisting from a mountain to a crumb.  We move around like robots, and we have made what we\u2019ve become.  Homes like boarding houses glued to memories not done.  Sticking forks into a nothing, nothing\u2019s tasteful in a slum.  Smart phones are talking while our kids talking guns.  If the internet would fail would we remember how to run?\n\n\n\tAs commerce and society freeze like a bad movie in a dome.\nEven the strong and prosperous are scared of the unknown.\nThat fear strikes their mercy, clicking buttons for a drone.\nMillions turn to killers; millions turn into bones.\n\n\nSurvival instincts climb the surface, jamming headphones in the zone.  Walking straight into a trap, while you think you\u2019re all alone.  Secret satellites taking pictures-people search through rubble for their home.  Pieces turn to peace for a moment then it\u2019s gone.\n\n\n\nCan we all become better?\nCan we put away our stones?\nCan we all come together?\nCan we all just get along?\nHiding with agendas using tokens yet to come.  Then poverty would probably take gangster number one.  Then those homeless in the alleys holding signs up to the sun.  While the man with the magnifier proves justice can be won.  Though intentions-are-everywhere and the Lemon Walls weigh a ton.  We have a choice.  We are the people.  We have to remember where we\u2019re from!  Through theories of conspiracies and/or a simple rhyme and pun.  These rhymes are for a reason and the reasons have begun.\n\nWhisper words of wisdom, but the words are like grenades.  Bursting in an instance, refugees to renegades.  Bullets flying at the post man with a single message on his page.\n\n\u201cStop lying in denial because it happens every day!\u201d\n\nWhen bodies line the ground and the survivors turn to slaves.  Tanks riding through our neighborhoods, pointing our guns at our face.  WAKE UP! IT\u2019S NOT A DREAM\u2026. It\u2019s a cold, old game.\n\nYou\u2019ll see true lies and fallen skies; only colors will remain.  We\u2019ll force scientist from all the world to study all our pain.  They\u2019ll still sacrifice a queen to gain access to our brain.  And it\u2019ll take libraries to finally see the strategy\u2019s-the same.  With the world in our pockets, tough love is shrinking small.  What was once the law, can\u2019t play along with the emptiness involved.  We can stall, make bricks to walls, but we\u2019ll still die, they\u2019ll take it all.  We\u2019re disempowered by employees that try to run before the crawl.\n\nWhat else is to be expected selling Death inside our malls?  Implementing trickery washed down with alcohol.  Impulsing spenders in a market shook by their greedy little flaws.  Tautologously tweaking thoughts, transfixed by final calls.\n\nWhat was once united isn\u2019t united anymore.\nWhat was once the door has been trampled to the floor.\nFreedom all for granted when freedom forgot the chore.\nNeutrality-formalities-never moral anymore.\n\nThat very news will amuse, eyes glued to the screens.\nWin intentional then lose, just to prove we\u2019re really mean.\nBesides that, confused and merely used like gasoline.\nWe are as toys, like the drugs are to the fiends.\n\n\tThe first to know, the first to go.\nThe last to move is out of sight.\n\tThe person saved will kiss the grave.\nAnd be one less to fight.\n\tWe can choose to follow rules.\nAnd utilize all our given tools.\n\tAnd make reality really real.\nInstead of creating what is cool.\nPart Three: A Piece of peace\n\n\tIf we build what we feel and manage peace, love, and time.  We can reiterate and liberate every simple mind.  Take this as a sign to remind us and rewind.  It doesn\u2019t take machines to realize mankind isn\u2019t kind.\n\n\tTrue love will be divine.\nMake love an enterprise.\n\t All hills are not that Beverly.\nBut love can edify.\n\n\tRollercoasters boasting Monte Cristo\u2019s rise through pretty lies, but love is a butterfly in Hell that never dies.  Again, let me be honest\u2026 who is the, who am I?\n\n\tI will make inner circles millions and use my share to provide fulfilment, inspiring just presidents to want to eat with me.  I will stop frivolous killings in the streets and subliminally make love to everyone that chooses to believe.  Before your selfish eyes, a maturing masterpiece, designed by a dream bigger than any Tennessee.  Still dreaming of my dreams, and even the diminutives climb through fragments of debris.  The once darker tendencies are history whether not, I still remember recipes.  Regardless of which weather-I\u2019ve seen more rain than ever-we can say we have changed for the better-but talk is still cheap.\n\n\tIt will all repeat.  It will all deplete.  It will all retreat.  I let justice speak through me.  So, I am destiny.  I am love and peace.  And I am only me.  Just a leaf, from a forgotten tree.  Lost beyond a memory.  Behind a master key, longing for the rest of me.  Am I free when I\u2019m free?  Am I seen when I\u2019m seen?  Am I keen when redeemed?  Am I living in a nightmare dressed in dreams?  The end will justify the means!\n\n\tAm I blessed to be the first son?  The first of Bonnie\u2019s birth.  When I started reading the proceedings had its perks.  When I felt destroyed by all the stupidity on earth.  Her buoyant charm, connected dots, to help me never hurt.  Her love taught me that kindness really works.  And all my many magics are really not a curse.  Every little opportunity presents itself in spurts, and at the end of everyday my gentry always lurks.  Family could be first after God then maybe church.  Love for your country.  But love is always work.  So, let my mom converge, the urge to shift attention to a mission in a surge.  To show my wounds were earned for a greater purpose to enlighten and discern.  Between ambition and courage to shine through a purge.  To help humanity with words for hope to bless them through a verse.  Because nothing is expected till it happens and occurs.  So, believe in unexpected because it\u2019ll pester till it\u2019s heard.\n\tAll I want is to move mountains and reach the top and never flop.  Make a star turn to dirt and from the dirt into a crop.  Through a seed of memories and journey to the rock.  When she left the world, I went away to Hollywood, and never stopped.  I cried tears of Christmas on a warm winter roof.  All alone in the music, in the blues, in a suit.  With all my dreams at my fingertips, and a mindset for the truth.  All my family in my heart with aspirations for the moon.\n\nBut how do we feed them love, when it\u2019s our love that always hates?\nHow do we help our fathers, when it\u2019s our fathers that keep us safe?  How do we be patient, when our patience, is taken by the day?\nI am allergic to wait because my soul is at stake.\n\n\tHearts break.  Random aches.  Shallow lakes.  Gates.\nWe change as we suffer, when our fates are running late.  Of the dead speak easy because soon they will awake.  When the world starts to shake, maybe then we will relate.\n\n\tI think so I exist, but I\u2019ve seen the benefits shift.  It is worse than a crime, it is a blunder to forget!  We have to come together and stop the killing and repent.  Stop history and make love before we stipulate a dent.\n\nAs time will be mine, what is mine I will keep.  To defeat the deceit for the love, let it be.  I invest the ink of this pen to find the lost pieces of peace.  Without evidence, I see.  So, I\u2019ll help you to believe\u2026\n\u2026by protecting the weak and having the courage to speak.\nTo make a stand and fill the gap of our excuses of Eve.\nBy ourselves we make nothing, but together we\u2019re free.\nBecause we\u2019re like comedy and tragedy with terror and fleas.\nWith that ole \u201cHalo into Hell\u201d, and the holy manna in me.\nI\u2019ll kill darkness with love, and let love let us see.\nI\u2019ll have faith and keep safe and earn hearts and not take.\nAppreciate the moment and embrace every day.\nKeep humility and the ability to say:\nLet us pray\u2026 Let us pray\u2026 We\u2019re not a prey\u2026\n\nOur love will last forever,\nWhat we know is incomplete,\nOur love never dies,\nIt carries hope and never sleeps,\nIt is lucent, potent, and perfect clarity,\nIt is emotion in motion,\nThe only recipe for peace.\n\nBut what is love if it hates?  False hope and mistakes?\nMake love, not history-we are the weight.\n\nLOVE is warm attachment-attracting every turn.\nLOVE is frequent magic, magnetic, stern, and firm.\n\nLOVE is sweet serenity while the symphonies await.\nLOVE is the beat inside of hearts, locked away in a cage.\n\nWhen LOVE will get you hurt, it is deception in disguise.\nBecause LOVE is perfect!  It wants the best for you and I.\n\nSo, remember this today for what I say it must be clear.\nWhen you leer and look around, please know it started here.\n\nMany languages have moved just as currency is exchanged.\nMany advantages are prude just as false idols are to blame.\n\nSimplicity is needed to keep from talking into empty space.\nThe only way we teach each other is to learn to relate\u2026\n\nThese rhymes are for their reasons therefore the reasons of why I rhyme.  Are to relate and decorate and paint a picture in your minds.  It sure sounds good on paper, but if we can find the melody.  We can make these words dance and Make Love, Not History!\n\nI know it seems indigestible and impossible in a sense, but if we help an enemy, we convert them to a friend.  And when we show them the unexpected and bring them back to where we began.  We cannot make up time, but we sure can change the sand.\n\nTake a lesson from the wise, the poor, and the scared\u2026 if you wake up and work-true love won\u2019t be impaired.  Take a lesson from the eager, the rich, and the aware\u2026 if you sleep away and die-poverty won\u2019t care.  It\u2019ll sneak up through a bottle or a blunt or a cigar, and stab with pure malice like the devil\u2019s in your heart.  Love will never trap you like a witty fox into a snare, but love will surround you when you know it\u2019s really there.  Love is patient, selfless, true, kind, generous, and fair.  Tonight, let\u2019s make tonight!  Let\u2019s love forever as the air!\n\nHowever, hate\u2026 is enmity, a jealousy\u2019s delight.  A hoodlum\u2019s heart, a stolen car, a fire burning ice.  Its devices create carnage while dictators rule the night.  It slithers as a rattle snake and strikes without a reason why.  Hate can see through people and it\u2019ll notice every time.  If money is there, it\u2019s well aware, and quick to set you up and drop the dime.  Hate is pure evil-death without excuse.  It\u2019ll raise its hand to kill a friend, and then come chasing after you.  Hate is plotting weasel words that keep lying to itself.  The witness died but would have lied, then raced to something else.  Hate is greedy dogs that steal and still resent.  Ogle here and bogey there, write you off and lose the pen.  It will bite the hand that fed them, longing for something still not seen.  Ravish with all atrocity, try to preach and intervene.  Vindictive vistas wreck the pictures, pillage then retreat.  Crash dignity and let it be, still fly with broken wings.\n\nNow what I love is real and what I hate is deep,\nSugar coated by society and lost inside of me,\nBut when cops are killing kids where our cameras can\u2019t see,\nI can\u2019t help but cry and bleed inside my heart for families,\n\nSo much war for wages,\nHistory should sign a lease,\nProtecting poppy fields,\nWhile soldiers die in the streets,\n\nFrom civil wars to wars on drugs to wars in the Middle East,\nMelancholies marred through deception-infested beyond belief,\nLike graduating students when those students cannot read,\nFollows, likes, and tweets when they never seen the lead,\n\nThose same greedy dogs claim they\u2019re \u201cjust trying to eat,\u201d\nIs no excuse to steal, kill, and destroy all our peace\u2026\n\nOh,\nHumanity?\nOh,\nHumility?\nI\u2019m not the one to preach\u2026but\nI have respect for my elders and say thank you and say please.\nWith the power of my pen strokes, my fingertips breathe.\nThey can take my mind and body,\nBut in my heart, I\u2019m always free\u2026\n\n\tI know it\u2019s hard to imagine, so just cherish every step.  Hold on to these words, save your tears for something else.  Have patience and prepare, accumulate love and make it wealth.  Fear God, love each other, don\u2019t be too proud to ask for help.\n\n\tA list of instructions blessed through a passage with my seal.  With a quibble tip, built through quality, and friendship through my quill.  Now as times are changing faster, stained by violence and all despair.  It is time that we kill jealousy and start to show we really care.\n\n\tIt was written first and once-once long ago.  But now it\u2019s time to act and reveal what-we used to know.  The places that we\u2019ve been and the places, soon we\u2019ll go.  The faces of our friends, that recognition, when they glow.\n\n\tI used to doubt and be without, be gullible, but shrewd.  And now I see a future, never seen but very true.  These drones will be a problem, open doors for fifty shades of blues.  In order for us to solve them, we must pay attention to the clues.  Stop the bombs and bullets, stop the smog that fills the air.  Them chem trails above us, twirl in circles not to scare.  There\u2019s a golden fringe around our freedom, as lies trickle down the heirs.   Elites discreet a challenge that will haunt us till when we\u2019re there.\n\nIf they sneak in purses and hide them under seats near the stage.  I\u2019ll shake their hands with pianos while we\u2019re burning up in flames.  I\u2019ll seem like I\u2019m raising Cain, saving Abel in denial.  Fight their fire with ghetto gospels; open eyes of every child.  Every man, woman, race, black, white, yellow, green/lead them through our gardens to prove that we are still a team.  Created perfect for a purpose, nearly social through a screen.  Forty-seven years late, yet I still have a dream!\n\nA patriot, impartial\u2026in a place where violence is deemed.  A place where the judges are the criminals and criminals are clean.  Disgraced and disgruntled known for a pyramid of gleam.  A home that has been lost, a house that used to have a king.\n\nCan we make every victim smile and give them hope and keep them safe?  Make criminals resort to giving, not be soft, but well behaved?  Make lovers love one soul and show them that it\u2019ll be okay.  We can shake the world together\u2026if we motivate.  I dedicate this moment to my opponents from here today.  If we can teach the world to love again, we can stop the world from hate.  Remember, we are the people and real eyes still realize real lies.  Be intuitive and intractable not intrigued or compromised.  Be reconciled and sound again, prepare without surprise.  Don\u2019t be desponded by the discipline, survive and be alive!\n\nWe may be outsourced and laid off or contained within a night.  But we won\u2019t give up or give in to these camps without a fight.  Our hearts are too bold, and our minds are sharp as knives.  Be brave, behold, be never out of sight.\n\nDo my similes and metaphors maybe ring a bell?\nThis is really real so we might as well, be well\u2026\nConsider this my lamp shining far outside my cell\u2026\nConsider this my second chance to make a difference somewhere else\u2026\n\nFrom selfish to selfless to innocent in jail.  I graduated college but hardly ever helped myself.  The people cheating off my paper the same to slander and save themselves.  What do I really know?\n\u2026only time will tell\u2026the tale.\n\nSo, as I set aside my halo and live through the mail,\nWith visions of a prophet never profiting through hell,\nDriving beamers with broken roads steered by horses full of kale,\nA black veil in the shadows, do we pick the one that\u2019s pale?\n\nDrinking drops of Jupiter in a court room full of whales,\nListening to lies, separated from our shell.\nTingles from the truth, hiding exculpatory proof\u2026\nDon\u2019t be tricked or bluffed be you\u2026\nIn everything you do\u2026\nThings happen for a reason,\nMaybe my purpose is for you\u2026\nIf I won\u2019t give up on me,\nI\u2019ll never give up on you,\n\nUnderstand that pain!\nKnow that everybody hurts!\nEverybody wants, needs, cries, lies, and steals-even church!\nWhen people lose it all and tend to have vengeance on their tongue\u2026\nKnow that someone else, somewhere else, is happy with a crumb.\n\nI plead my allegiance to my country and our God.\nOnce upon a time I was a pea inside a pod.\nAnd when I die, who am I, just another body dead?\nMy family is all scattered now that everything went red.\nBut I say that we must not give up that little whisper in our head.\nWe can build those bridges if we work instead of rest.\nWe can make things beautiful, even out of all this mess.\nI said it once, wrote it twice what I want is less and less.\nListen and trust me once because everything is fresh.\nI promise all the world that I\u2019ll become the best.\nI\u2019ll never sleep until we complete,\nSeek that perfect quest,\nBy increasing all humility and maybe humanize the rest.\n\nLove as I love, and see what I see\u2026\nFeel as I feel, and breathe as I breathe\u2026\nTake on this moment, hone it and be\u2026\nMake Love-Save Life-Not History!\n\nDon\u2019t be left behind, be more than your role.\nDon\u2019t get lost in a system, like you are a mole.\nDon\u2019t give up just yet, soon we will mold.\nBut not mold as a fungus, we\u2019ll mold into gold.\n\nSpread this manifesto from a boat to a coast.\nBy horse or a donkey, by camel or goat.\nThis is our future, my message of hope.\nA blessing, a lesson\u2026my purpose, our scope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart four: Make Love, Not history\n\t\n\tMister suit and tie America, the organ in my chest.  Where the land of the free meets the land of the stressed.  The olive branch, no arrows\u2026the eagle on our crest.  The syllogism symbolizes our freedom can be won!  Excited when united, let justice be done!  We can stop the killing and we can save the sun!  That power, that strength, but divided we end!  Let us lead by example and be The United States again!  We inspire every country when we bend the pretend!  With movies and music and the colors of our skin!  Everybody wants and Lord knows we want to win!  But can we just focus on US before we make another friend?  Can we be what we started, not be as we end?  The stars and stripes have meanings as the thirteen sons of sin, mixed with glory, passion, love, and revenge.  We are running around in circles therefore we are provoking the hate.  So, lets admit when we\u2019re wrong and admit our mistakes.\n\n\tFreedom!  For Order!  To form a more perfect Union, establishing that Justice but we got lost in Pursuing.  Ensure tranquility\u2026domestic and true, promoting general Welfare and the right thing to do.  Securing our blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, coping with tragedy with merit so merrily.  If we can make up the laws and change how we go.  We can cherish the minutes and never lose hope.  Then we can smile and take care of friends.  We have to be what we started at Mount Vernon again.  Without injustice or racists raising their hands.  If we can make love, we can make everyone stand.\n\nThrough the trees of Patagonia to Buenos Aires by dawn,\nBuild houses through Chile to Lima so on,\nHike through the Andes and wash off in a pond,\nVibe through the tropics and raft the Amazon,\nTo the places we missed as we soak up the thrill,\nKiss a lover in Argentina; eat all through Brazil,\nColumbia, Bolivia, Venezuela, we will\u2026\nAnd wake up in Guyana make a toast to the fun,\nAnd have hope in our hearts and forever be one.\nThen take on tomorrow and push through the pain,\nThrough the Strait of Gibraltar and hug the coast on to Spain,\nSip the wine all to Paris and show my respects to their loss,\nTake ferries through Venice and touch every heart,\nFrom Rome to Parma, no matter the cost,\nMake Love, Not History-from the church to the mosque.\nTop the hills on to Zurich to see peace where it\u2019s calm,\nYell to Yugoslavia, \u201cLet\u2019s destroy all the bombs.\u201d\nMontenegro, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia,\nBulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania\u2026\nMoldova, Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia,\nBelarus, Poland, Slovenia, Lithuania,\nFrom cities to countries to love and peace,\nFrom Iceland to Norway to Sweden to Greece\u2026\nAlbania, Austria, Czech Republic, I\u2019m gone\u2026\nAll through Germany, make love from Munich to Milan\u2026\nWhere everything is beauty and beauty is hope\u2026\nLet\u2019s come together without politics dividing our scope\u2026\nWalk barefooted to Finland despite the freezing or snow\u2026\nTears of ice down my cheeks on to Russia let\u2019s go\u2026\nTo everyone I miss, know that I am only one man\u2026\nTake the pieces of peace and put us together again!\n\nTastes of Tokyo to Sekisui through all Japan,\nKyoto to Osaka; Hiroshima-the land,\nBow heads with respect,\nFirm shakes of business alas\u2026\nUnderstand the yesterdays, but move on from the past\u2026\n\nSail the Pacific to Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia\u2026\nLearn to teach their love to Australia and New Zealand\u2026\nThe voyage back to Asia and touch her lips-heal scars\u2026\nVietnam, Korea, Laos, Thailand, Bangladesh,\nWalk the wall to China all in all-so impressed,\nNo amnesia will wash away all of the blood spilled on this dirt,\nThe last days of Israel they\u2019ll rebuild the temple and church,\nBreak barriers back to Babylon where inertia is inert\u2026\nRemind the world that\u2019s Iraq- let\u2019s stop all the hurt\u2026\nDeter down Damascus -scream for Syria to change!\nLet\u2019s help all of our children\u2026\nLet\u2019s rescue the days\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s plant seeds through Asia, make beauty from rain,\nLet\u2019s cultivate our future through empty gardens of pain,\nLearn as we love and teach as we walk.\nListen to God and hear what we\u2019re taught.\n\nDon\u2019t be blinded by large numbers or alarmed by their troops,\nPut flowers in barrels and stand as they shoot,\nAt the end of the day truculence will reduce,\nStoics still stand with their heart on the truth,\nPraise God on forever without putting holes through the roof,\nSubstantive words succor the proof,\nMake Love, Save Life!\nWhatever you choose\u2026\nReinvigorate today\u2026\nStarting with you\u2026\n\nThrough India, Thailand, China, Iran\u2026\nTurkey through all of Pakistan\u2026\nLebanon, Syria, all the way to Nepal\u2026\nSri Lanka, Kuwait, to amending the law\u2026\nKazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan\u2026\nTajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Yemen, Oman\u2026\nGeorgia, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan\u2026\nCyprus, Iraq-we stand\u2026\nTo Jordan to Egypt then on to Sudan\u2026\nEthiopia to Kenya to reaching new land\u2026\nSouth Africa, Rwanda, Congo, and Chad\u2026\nWe have to lose what we hate to love what we have\u2026\n\nNigeria, Mali, Uganda, Guinea, Gabon and Ghana,\nCameroon, Eritrea, Gambia, Mauritania,\nMalawi, Madagascar, Swaziland, Somalia\u2026\nSeychelles to Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone\u2026\nThe Morocco, then Wales-touch the UK and then home,\nWith all of our faith and all of our bones\u2026\nOn top of a rostrum know that you\u2019re not alone\u2026\n\nKiss me I\u2019m Irish, she knows that she\u2019s hot.\nNo ring on my finger, give all that I got.\nWith all of my heart.

So, make love and save life.\n\n\tI have suffered and been slandered, but I\u2019ll always overcome trouble.  Because I have seen the rewards and it\u2019s well worth the struggle.  Failure is not final, don\u2019t indulge in the puddle.  Success is everlasting, just listen and hustle.  Nothing is easy without a goal and a plan.  Stay true to your heart, and not to demands.  If anyone hurts, trust me, I understand.  If everyone loves, then everyone can.\n\n\tI despise the free lunch\nBecause nothing is free.\nRipened fruit nearly withered,\nToo far from its tree.\nIn every way there\u2019s a lock,\nHeld back by its key.\nWe\u2019re brought back to life,\nThrough a vine\u2026\nBy a letter from me.\n\n\nWe can challenge together without violence and hurt.\nBut can we think as we do it,\nAnd find ways to take action and work?\n\nIf I can rhyme a small book,\nWe can deliberate a cause.\nMaybe lock judges in dungeons,\nTo really show them the law.\n\nBecause I believe in our futures,\nLet\u2019s enjoin our hatred in balls.\nThrow them all in a casket,\nNailed shut-without pause.\n\nTeach our futures what\u2019s what\u2026\nWe can make it resolved\u2026\nNot teach our children enough\u2026\nBut all\u2026\n\nOne can see ten talents, while nine of them hate.\nTwo can see visions, dressed in-there\u2019s no time to waste.\nThree can do miracles and let me free from this cage.\nFour could start a movement until we\u2019re loving in space.\n\nAnd keep in mind it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s fate\u2026\nIf you feed a stray,\nThere\u2019s only one place to dwell.\nIf you rough a puppy up,\nThey\u2019ll take the fight somewhere else.\n\nBut if you take that courage and bring it home,\nAnd hone the bones of lust.\nTake hope and put love into a meal,\nTo test a little trust.\n\nLet them go their separate ways,\nAnd let love brush off the dust.\nThen comes home a new friend,\nTail wagging\u2026\nThat\u2019s us\u2026\n\n\tWe must fix our broken homes.  What we think we know, we really don\u2019t.  There are lies in the desert, while our heads are full of smoke.  What are really fallen angels, we see as UFOS.  What are false prophets, we see as men of hope.  Our youth is so damn smart, a book is viewed as a joke.  Listen, pay attention, we don\u2019t have much time to grow.\n\n\tComputers read our minds, but they can never read out hearts.  They tell visions with televisions.  Wear jewels and brag and boast.\nThis isn\u2019t what we are, but this is what we have become.  Pointing fingers to the stars, blaming everyone but one.\nStopping in a situation when you could help a ton.\nWhat happens when the bombs stop?\nWhat happens when we run?\n\nI\u2019ve felt what happens next, we won\u2019t having flying cars.  We will all receive a test, analyzing what we are.  Exacerbate.  Exaggerate.  Exonerate.  Confess.  Hide it all inside, forsaken by the rest.\n\nIs loyalty lost?  Buried deep within lost holes.  Connive and slide and improvise, using drugs to sell their soul.  Fame or fortune, this and that-whichever day it is.  When you lose everything, what would you tell your kids?  College students fight and snort and smoke and shoot everything but guns.  Doctors, lawyers, engineers break more laws than anyone.  Strippers dancing hastily, promoting sexy fun.  A minority that\u2019s innocent is suspect number one.\n\nWhen times get hard, things get hard\u2026life isn\u2019t fair, and that\u2019s no excuse.  Too much of anything, good or bad is still abuse.  What if you were that stray dog that has been damaged down your road?  What if you were my story and had vengeance in your bones?\nBroken homes and broken hearts are neglected by the fake.\nJails are full of talent with more than plenty time to waste.\nSometimes time isn\u2019t wasted, it is sharpened to be great.\nPlaces nearly racist, too audacious to be safe.\n\nWelcome to my world of tasteless occasions by the crate.\nNations that are faceless are apt to lose their faith.\nSneak attacked by passions, too ambitious to ever wait.\nFrustrated by irrelevant because there isn\u2019t anybody straight.\n\nBut love will never fade, take off days, or sail away.\nRegardless of the mystery or anything we say.\nWe will be okay, and they hate but can\u2019t take that away.\nThis is to everyone I love plus our forevers and a day.\n\n\tNo more treachery or treason-just acceptance and delight.\n\tNo more hating for no reason-just patience and insight.\n\tJust compassion, empathy, and love that never quits.\n\tJust tranquility, integrity, and hope that never dies.\n\n\tBecause love never quits and hope never dies.\n\tBecause love never quits and hope never dies.\n\nDon\u2019t let your music get trapped inside and die.\nDon\u2019t forget the movement, we can change if we try.\nBut only if we try\u2026\nBut only if we try\u2026\nTogether\u2026\nTonight\u2026\n\nFellow.\nRebels.\nFellow.\nFriends.\nFellow.\nFrienemies.\nFar Away.\n\nWe\u2019re still within our grasps, let\u2019s be optimists today.\nThe challenges sure can be tough, we\u2019ve witnessed plenty pain.\nRemember God has a plan, even as it rains.\n\nThe sun still shines above as it does every day.\nThe rivers race accordingly as the oceans drink away.\nThe seeds germinate just as generous as life turns another page.\nThe plants grow to trees from the seeds of yesterday.\n\nBut the fruit only bears what the vine bears as fruit.\nGathered up by twelve and it starts inside of you.\nA garden of ideas mixed with tendencies to do.\nObstacles by fantasies that\u2019s watching every move.\n\nThey had to take our freedom to make our eyes finally see.\nIf it\u2019s only for a moment\u2026 Make Love, Not History!\n\nOur natural temperament made once beauty now a scar.\nEven when our scars are beautiful this isn\u2019t what we are.\n\t\nTycoons are chasing profits like a puppy chases car.\nLawyers chase an ambulance like a sniper spots its mark.\nQuarterbacks seek glory while their receivers play their part.\nDoctors tend to argue the true function of our hearts.\n\nProsecutors convict large numbers and pretend they are a shark.\nArtists act nonchalant when their beauty is their art.\nDirectors pick through everything and are quick to pull your card.\nPimps will feed girls anything just to get them naked in the dark.\n\nWe are not supposed to be idols, we are to grace the world with our gifts.  The weakest link will break a chain, one man can sink a ship.  The rich get rich and confident premiered by power trips.  In retrospect, hope won\u2019t die and love never quits.\n\nSo, think about the people around the globe that never had.  We\u2019re so petty with our meddling, so quick to get upset and mad.  We handle it with predicates and play off emotions of the sad.  We can\u2019t ignore that open door or run from the past.\n\nIf you are with me reading this, phoenix tears are probably true.  But we can only heal the wounds by being together when we move.  This terra incognita shows that certain minds confuse, but other heart come open-with God we\u2019ll never lose!\n\nThose evil roots among us show why roses have their thorns.  The tears won\u2019t last forever, but every cloud still holds its storm.  Things will get better, but it\u2019ll take constant work.  Nothing good is easy, He made our temples from the dirt.\n\nIs my gift a gift or is my gift a curse?\nIs my freedom priceless?\nCondemnation sure does hurt\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this encased by glass inside museums.\nKnow that it was made possible all due to making friends.\n\nIf we let the devil creep and lie and change its skin.\nIf we let the devil hold our light-he\u2019ll blind to win.\n\nIf we keep our ifs and bottle them all in an errand\u2019s time.\nWe\u2019ll let our goals surpass our grasp and never walk the line.\nWe cannot change back time, so let us utilize our minds.\nEducate our differences and understand the signs.\n\nSeek and ye shall find\u2026\n\nKnowledge hidden through a ride\u2026\n\nRegardless of obscurities we\u2019ll always pick a side.\n\nI have witnessed eyes, peaking, switching, trying to hide.\n\nA wisp, an orb, a spirit, a notion-wizard wise.\n\nTrust me once, then trust me twice\u2026\nI can\u2019t say I never lied\u2026\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e1 vu and all the vision\u2026\n\nYou can\u2019t say I haven\u2019t tried\u2026\n\nI can\u2019t surrender or give in to hocus-pocus.\nSo, just focus on the light.\nI won\u2019t hinder, but I will render.\nJust focus on what\u2019s right.\n\nI have seen an opportunity slip beyond a grasp.\nI have seen futilities succeed within a mask.\nI have seen the incompetent hired for a task.\nI have seen intelligence die without a laugh.\n\nI have seen red carpets and lights at center stage.\nI have seen a dungeon underground; I missed her face.\nI have seen roses wither from being in the shade.\nI have seen enough to always be afraid.\n\nI have seen knowledge increase along with grief.\nI have seen sorrow, up all night and never sleep.\nI have seen the mighty bow down to the weak.\nI have seen love disappoint and history repeat.\n\nI have seen despair dispirit demons of decay.\nI have seen winds snap trees and lemons made to lemonade.\nI have seen destruction lurk and angels save the day.\nI have seen a miracle come from a leader in a grave.\n\nI have seen my lovers hurt, lie, and cheat.\nI have seen competitors misdirect, flash, and leave.\nI have seen death and strangers die in my arms.\nI have seen snakes deceived by their own natural charm.\n\nI have seen my brothers fade behind a cloud of sun.\nI have seen fathers cry at things their children done.\nI have seen mothers so proud to hug their oldest son.\nI have seen God\u2019s mercy when I was astray and couldn\u2019t run.\n\n\u2026but I have never seen a wife, a son, or a wedding day.\nI have never established myself enough to satisfy my name.\nI have never quit on myself or others.\nI have made my way through all the grey.\n\nThere are many things given and many we must take.\nLet us bow our heads in tandem\u2026 let us pray!\n\n\u201cMay God bless our souls with each another day.  Forgive us for our faults and help us learn from our pain.  Understand the significance of blessings when they come.  Lord teach us how to love again, before we all are done.  With our destinies aligned all careful to repent.  All the leaders of the world make us give-in-to-the-pretend.  Lord let us reach our potential and help us see who we are.  Lift the curtains from our eyes and kiss us on our scars.  Lead us to the promise land and show us how to be.  Protect us from our friends and set us free!  From every difference or barrier because everybody grieves, everybody wants, and everybody needs.  Give us strength in a time when no one knows the key.  In the name of your Son I believe!\u201d\n\nListen to the mission,\nIt is more than recognition.\nMore than desperate measures;\nMore than merely living\u2026\n\n\tAnyone with ears pay attention as you listen.\n\tTrust in your intuition, be forgiven.\n\tWe all have a vision, in addition, we can mention,\n\tThe way we make decisions,\n\tAnd the way we raise our children.\n\tLet us make petitions for peace, an intervention.\n\tLead by example,\n\tStop the killing!\n\n\tWe can ease the tension in other ways than being menaces.\n\tWe\u2019re allowing penalties and lacking penance.\n\tWe can be frustrated but think our way through every sentence.\n\tCan we stop our savage instincts before we\u2019re ended?\n\t\n\tWe\u2019re opening doors for things we all could have prevented.\n\tRhyming for a minute, but we have the means to finish.\n\tMilitants aren\u2019t meant to litigate by liquidating many.\n\tWe\u2019re facilitating murder\u2026stop forgetting!\n\n\n\tIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re white, yellow, red, brown, or black!\n\tStop letting our ignorance hold the children back!\n\t\n\tThe content of our hearts doesn\u2019t show.\n\tIf we divide by race in the road.\n\tAll lives can\u2019t matter if we cope.\n\tAnd neglect the black lives that we know.\n\n\tThe shortest distance between two points is a line\u2026\n\tSo, stop letting our hate stop our mind\u2026\n\tThere\u2019s no excuse to hide the truth behind\u2026\n\tBecause we are much stronger all combined\u2026\n\t\n\tWe were not to master the art of tricks and lies\u2026\n\tWe were meant to love again, and utilize our lives\u2026\n\tSo, stop letting money stop our mind\u2026\n\tThe shortest distance between two points is a line\u2026\n\n\tNot too lazily, but with purpose.,\n\tStarting at the hourglass.\n\n\tCan we stop the sands of surface?\n\tBefore our present meets the past?\n\n\n\tWe\u2019re humbled down the path of danger,\n\tWearing our innocence like masks.\n\n\tAs we try to cherish every minute,\n\tAnd make every second last\u2026\n\n\tWhen we see we\u2019re more alike,\n\tThen we\u2019d ever took the time to know.\n\n\tWe\u2019ll see we must shape ourselves,\n\tTo be prepared to grow.\n\n\tBecause if we don\u2019t stand for something,\n\tWe\u2019ll fall for anything.\n\n\tAnd if we fall for anything,\n\tWe\u2019ll never reach our dream.\n\n\tThose same voices and choices,\n\tStill travel faster than before.\n\n\tArsenals and kinetics,\n\tAnd depleted repertoires.\n\n\tCan make comedy a tragedy,\n\tOr despair forevermore.\n\n\tWhat\u2019s the point of using metaphors?\n\tWhen we are the war.\n\n\tIf we pour out our peace,\n\tAnd abuse what we\u2019re fighting for.\n\n\tThen freedom is jeopardized,\n\tAnd that\u2019ll spread to our core.\n\n\tBut when we use correctly,\n\tAnd expand our minds a little more.\n\n\tOur visions and love,\n\tAlways will endure.\n\n\tAgainst enormous armies,\n\tAnd this I will ensure.\n\n\tTime devours all,\n\tSo, we must be true to our rapport.\n\n\tWe must not remain neutral,\n\tBecause Hell is waiting for:\n\tThe ignorant to be ignored\u2026\n\tThe map of heaven to be tore\u2026\n\n\tThe leader\u2019s voices to be sore\u2026\n\tThe truth to be as lore\u2026\n\n\tQuote the Raven and the Eagle,\n\tAnd the Owl, nevermore!\n\n\tWe have to be as water and adjust\u2026\n\tTeach as we learn and adjust\u2026\n\n\tNever too poetic, but enough\u2026\n\tWorry less, with a little more love\u2026\n\n\tBeat ourselves at everything,\n\tWe used to do.\n\n\tFreeze time and inside,\n\tFind you.\n\n\tThen educate the world,\n\tAnd make moves.\n\n\tKnock on the Vatican,\n\tAnd find truth.\n\n\tIf you find this rhapsody or by fate it finds you.  Pass it to a friend and stop doing what we do.  The theologians will dissect it all and still find truth.  They\u2019ll hear their heartbeat and smile, and maybe help too.\n\n\tIt\u2019ll take strategy to march and let our patience carry on.  And it\u2019ll get frustrating when our friends are dead and gone.  As the rider of the white horse leads the vultures up above.  We must keep pushing further, and never quit on love.\n\n\tWe\u2019re destine to wage war to avenge and make peace.  Use the agendas to point fingers and retreat.  When there\u2019s a break in a bottle, are we the only one to see?  Yet you never doubted once.  You always believed.\n\nRemember me and remember David beat the best.  So, carry on further and point your nose to the west.  We\u2019re at the point of no return.  There will be a little more stress, a little more tear, and a little more test.  Be resilient and move intentional and be prepared for what awaits.  Because I love you true, and sometimes love does whatever it takes.\n\nAnd sometimes time reveals and erodes the days to dust.  Sometimes lines fade and the path remains with us.  Sometimes pain is temporary and sometimes it takes guts.  To keep sizing up evil, without having our love freeze up.  Sometimes life is mystical and sometimes we see Mars.  Sometimes we reach our dreams, and we have to pull up to the stars.  When we have it in our hands, we\u2019ll still have love in our hearts.  And we will catch our blessings because God knows where we are\u2026\n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot together on this map, but we\u2019ve never been together or rose from our past.  We\u2019re too distracted by irrelevance and the things outside our grasp, procrastinating morality and it\u2019s too late to hold fast.  But it is never too late to start new.  It is never too late to start helping others and let others help you.  It is never too late to expand understanding and make do.  Because once you have all of yourself, then you can help choose.\n\n\tSome testimonies have made it through Hell.  Tyrants will ask questions in wonder to see how we prevail.  Tyros will smile and set their rifles on shelves.  Neighbors might negate this, but it doesn\u2019t matter if it sells.\n\nSure, war turns profits and brings a balance to the world.  Sure, marijuana can be purchased as medication and be dispensed in a store.  Sure, casinos can dazzle and entice you into more\u2026. So, let business be business and let war be war.  If we plan for peace, we have to know what we fight for.  And plant seeds for our children so they always live for more.\n\nWe fall behind because we\u2019re lacking last chances.  People make mistakes but aren\u2019t given right answers.  All the critics toss a blurb as rappers rap verses.  Subliminally we\u2019re cursed by a false hope purpose.  Poisoned by lies and a short-term bribe.  Living in debt without knowledge or know why.  Forced to spend more just to understand, just to lose it all-from the house to the land.\n\nPeople!  It\u2019s time!  For US to take a stand!  Let us learn love and show that we can.  Let us be more and not give into demands.  Let us be as one and learn to hold hands.  Because as people we are different, and each deserves respect.  Each country has borders to serve and protect.  People share religions as some share pets.  So, let us keep love common, and not fret about regrets.  Sure, we have resources in imitable places.  Sure, we have bad apples and tasteless racists.  Sure, we have occasions where we\u2019re not so gracious.  Sure, a lone flower can grow through the pavement.\n\nAnything is possible if we can make gangs, but we don\u2019t need respect to come so strange.  If we can understand each other like we understand pain.  Then we can hold those accountable instead of point fingers and blame.  And make law fight the law, no matter whose name or fame.  Make examples and set examples for all that remain.  And forgive but let justice reign like rain.  As we kill cancel culture and change like change.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a revolution, we\u2019re meant for more than a mere pawn game.  Let our knights be knights and let our love take aim.  We can share, we can trade, and make peace.  We can use science separately, not to cause grief.  We can plant more trees for our grandkids to see.  If we can trust each other with eyes closed, then \u201cwe can breathe.\u201d  We can disarm weapons even with a fake smile.  We can just try to stop the killing for a while.  We can teach the police new skills instead of allowing them to do as they feel.   We can make reality just a little more real.  But it won\u2019t be easy, and it won\u2019t stop here.  I\u2019m behind closed doors, but what I see is sincere.\n\nThrough riots, fire, battle, gun shots, and bombs... Murder, rape, robbery, and the right to bear arms\u2026  War, death, grit, pillage, and an unmanned farm\u2026. Garnished wages, starvation, and a ransom for a bond\u2026. Up and down economies and worldwide feat\u2026  Natural disasters and a long losing streak\u2026. Rubber stamped indictments, from the bottom of a valley to a peak\u2026. Political lies, hiding truth as they speak\u2026  We can\u2019t turn the cheek when they prey on the weak\u2026  Secret societies, lost souls, and lost troubled peers\u2026  It\u2019s cold when the wind blows\u2026  Everybody\u2019s fear\u2026  Tattoos, gangbanging, sex/internet porn\u2026  Credit scams, bounced checks, locusts in a swarm\u2026  Sex trafficking savages, cannibals, and elites buying kids\u2026. Corruption is what we get, and everybody\u2019s pissed.\n\nI know we can believe and achieve.  I know we\u2019re capable of more than making people bleed and making people cry and being so mean, looking to the sky and trashing daydreams.  If hope is alive and knowledge is our queen.  Then freedom is our libido, and ambition is our king.  Understand our strength resides within the means.  So, listen to your heart and harmonize our wings.\n\nWe can be together, working hard with all our might.  We can wake the morning and reach the stars by tonight.  If Israel is invincible and Hebrew is still alive, then we don\u2019t have much time to change, so make these words survive.  God will give us justice, forever written on my walls.  Believe what you wish, but He will deal with the law.  He is munificent, omnipotent, magnificent, and everything we touch\u2026 but all the pieces of peace start with us.\n\nEven though we\u2019re used to violence and our movies portray poising literati, used to being used.  We are the people; therefore, we make the rules.  Don\u2019t cause panic or adversity, it\u2019s alright to be cool.  It\u2019s alright to enjoy the finer things and be the best you.  But be mindful of the next man living out of shoes, eating out of garbage cans, searching for his roof.  Or the minorities seeking knowledge to overcome the dunes.  Or the poor little lady still cagily living in a room, sleeping under windows as the walls go boom, shopping at a corner store-street sweeping with her broom.  Lost in her head, leaving trails of stale perfume.\n\nJust think before you blink fast, and stare at the screen.  These things that you see are more real than they seem.  Don\u2019t learn for yourself, learn as a team.  A goal without a plan is a dream\u2026 so bird by bird, one thing by thing.  Listen to your hearts.  Let them sing.\n\nCoexist as a human,\nNot as a machine,\n\nWe are superior,\nBecause we are supreme,\n\nWe are the future,\nWe are the offspring,\n\nAnd together we\u2019re better,\nBecause we\u2019re on the same team,\n\nA new breed of thinkers but we have the same hearts,\nSo, use them and never lose your spark!\n\n\nEveryone has their gifts,\nBut you are the art.\n\nSo, let your story make your reach,\nMake a mark\u2026\n\nSometimes all things seem unfair, but the song of a warrior can\u2019t be silenced once it\u2019s in the air.  The Change of Hearts will open up our instruments in pairs as we\u2019re called up every stair, and the beautiful world will start to see that we care.\n\nBeautiful words put together with a tear\u2026\nLet us humanize humanity and listen when we hear\u2026\n\nKnow that all things are possible\u2026\nBut we must face the mirror\u2026\n\nAnd change as we start a new year\u2026\n\nUsually less in necessary to win battles never won, but sometimes we invest in miracles to prove it can be done\u2026\n\n\u2026and in case whatever happens, and only one remembers me\u2026just in case you steal my water, know you\u2019re stealing from the sea\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nPer angusta ad augusta\nNon sum quails eram\nPoeta nascitur, non fit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNil desperandum,

They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him.

Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.)

Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape.

Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.\n\n(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!\n\nJOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads.

He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father! Little father!\n\nTHE BABES AND SUCKLINGS\n\nClap clap hands till Poldy comes home,\nCakes in his pocket for Leo alone.\n\n\n(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)\n\n\nBABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.)

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.)

Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood.

I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)\n\nTHE ARTANE ORPHANS\n\nYou big, you bog, you dirty dog!\nYou think the ladies love you!\n\n\nTHE PRISON GATE GIRLS\n\nIf you see kay\nTell him he may\nSee you in tea\nTell him from me.\n\n\nHORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.\n\n(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)\n\nMESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.\n\nBLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!\n\n(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)\n\nREUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.\n\n(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)\n\nTHE CITIZEN Thank heaven!\n\nBLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\n\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)\n\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.\n\n(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps.

Ahhkkk!\n\nELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\n\nZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\n\nFLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.\n\nSTEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.\n\n(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)\n\nTHE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom!

Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.)

The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo!

Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.)

Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches.

Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready.

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's.

R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware!

Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier.

Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers.

Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1562965", "artist_names": "The Searchers", "full_title": "Ain't That Just

PHILOSOPHER.p. 6 p. 7\n\nTHE GOLDEN TRACT\n\nCONCERNING THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE.\nThe Author's Preface to the Art-loving Reader.\n\nWORTHY reader, and true enquirer into the secrets of nature, marvel not that in the old age of this world, when it seems to have one foot already in the grave, I have determined to write this tract, although all libraries ale already full of books on this subject\u2014of which, however, the greater part are false, and wear merely the rouge and powder of philosophy. I have written it not for my own pleasure, but for your advantage, that, by pointing to the foundation of truth, I might lead you back from the pathless wilderness into the right way\u2014which is certainly for your own interest. As far as I am concerned, I have long known all that I seek to know in regard to this matter, and have no need of many books, seeing that during the last twenty-two years I have read and re-read all the works that fell into my hands\u2014including numerous manuscripts, as well as many printed volumes.\n\nIn this my tract you will find the subject set forth, and the true solution given, not only theoretically, but also from a practical and allegorical point of view, with a clearness and lucidity such as I believe to be almost unparalleled in any previous philosophical treatise. In quoting, I have always been careful to give the exact reference, so that you may look out the passage for yourself, and by diligently considering it, sharpen your understanding. I could more easily have composed this treatise, and made myself known to the Brethren of the Golden\n\np. 8\n\n[paragraph continues] Cross, if I had left out those references; but for your sake I decided otherwise. Do not wonder that I conceal my name, and refuse to appear to you face to face. I have come forward, not for the sake of any paltry glory, or of worldly praise, but to do you good. Moreover, my teachers, even the true philosophers, advised me not thus to risk my life for the sake of obtaining a high place in the world's esteem, to expose myself to greedy robbers or to give occasion for many crimes by the prostitution of this profound secret. No doubt the gentle reader has learned by the works of Sendivogius that whenever he sheaved himself openly to the powerful, he went in constant fear of his life. Experience teaches that many philosophers who gave no thought to their personal safety, have been killed and deprived of their tincture by greedy and powerful robbers; and it stands to reason that any one going about with a great treasure in his hand, must fall a prey to brigands. Sendivogius concealed his name by an anagram. Thus also a short time ago another philosopher and Brother of the Golden Cross, whose real name has long been familiar to me, concealed it beneath an anagram, and made himself known to his friends by an enigmatical designation. Why then should I place myself at the mercy of this impure world? Permit me rather, dear friend; to follow the example of the sages, and leave the rest to the thrice good and great God, who will make my true self known to you in good time, if it be for the glory of His name, and for your and my good. Do not be eager to enquire after my name. For even if you should get to know it, or become personally acquainted with me, you would have to rest satisfied with the contents of this tract. For I have solemnly promised two philosophers\u2014Bernard, Count of Trevisan, and Neigens\u2014that I will not betray to any one more than has been revealed in this book. Neither be anxious to ask whether I actually possess this precious treasure. Ask rather whether I have seen how the world was created; whether I am acquainted with the nature of the Egyptian darkness; what is the cause of the rainbow; what will be the appearance of the glorified bodies at the general resurrection; what is the most indelible colour. Of you that rightly understand this little book, I will enquire whether you have seen that great salt sea, without any corrosion, raise a sufficiency of the moisture of all nature to the summits of the highest mountains. Tell me\n\np. 9\n\nwhere there is sulphur out of sulphur, and mercury out of mercury\u2014or where sulphur springs from mercury, and again mercury from sulphur. When was there placed before your eyes the idea of most fervent love, the male and the female embracing each other so closely that they could no more be torn asunder, but through unsearchable love became one? If you understand what I am alluding to, and have performed the experiment with your own hands, and seen it with your own eyes, I welcome you as fellow partakers of the mystery, and have no dearer wish than to enjoy your familiar intercourse\u2014for which reason I have also sent forth into the world this little tract.\n\nIf any one complain of the difficulty of our Art, let him know that in itself it is perfectly simple, and can present no obstacle to those who love God, and are held worthy by Him of this knowledge. If any one blame me for setting forth the truths of this Art too plainly and clearly, so as to render it possible for any one to gain a knowledge thereof, I answer that I have indeed explained them with sufficient lucidity for those who are worthy and foreordained of God, but that the unworthy can derive no profit from them. To some foolish and shallow persons I have several times expounded this Art in the simplest manner, and even word for word, but they despised it only, and would not believe me that there is exhibited in our work a twofold resurrection of the dead. Our Art, its theory as well as its practice, is altogether a gift of God, Who gives it when and to whom He elects: it is not of him that wills, or of him that runs, but simply through the mercy of God. Though I had diligently studied this Art for 17 or 18 years, yet I had, after all, to wait for God's own time, and accept it as a free gift. No one need doubt the truth or certainty of this Art. It is as true and certain, and as surely ordained by God in nature, as it is that the sun shines at noontide, and the moon shews her soft splendour at night. But I must conclude this preface, and gird myself for writing the tract itself. But ye, beloved Brethren of the Golden Cross, who are about to learn how to enjoy and use this most precious gift of God in secret, do not remain unknown to me, and if ye know me not, be sure that the faithful will be approved and their faith become known through the Cross, while security and pleasure overshadow it. God be with us, Amen!\n\np. 10\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\np. 11\n\nTHE GOLDEN TRACT\n\nCONCERNING THE STONE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS.\nANCIENT as well as modern philosophers, most beloved reader, and devoted seeker after true wisdom, when through the grace of God they had reached the goal of their desires, have endeavoured to make their discovery known to their fellow inquirers in all parts of the world\u2014not only because they wished to inform them that the thrice great and good God had enlightened their minds, blessed the labours of their hands, and shewn to them the greatest and most profound secret of earthly wisdom (for which benefit all praise, honour, and glory are justly due to Him)\u2014but also that they might afford assistance to beginners in the Art, by which, with God's permission, they too might attain to the knowledge of this most holy mystery. Such men there have been in all countries. Amongst the Egyptians Hermes Trismegistus holds the highest place; then come Chald\u00e6ans, Greeks, Arabs, Italians, Gauls, Englishmen, Dutchmen, Spaniards, Germans, Poles, Hungarians, Hebrews, and many others. Though the aforementioned Sages wrote at different times, and in different languages, yet their works exhibit so marvellous an agreement, that any true philosopher may easily see that all their hearts had been gladdened by God in the discovery of this stone, and that they all had performed this work with their own hands. Now, as the truth of their views is perceived by their agreement, so the disagreement of certain others marks them as false philosophers. For, not knowing the foundation of this glorious Art, and making up fanciful theories out of their own heads, they exhibit their ignorance to all.\n\np. 12\n\nThe aforesaid agreement exists in regard to the Matter, its solution, its weight, and the regulation and increase of the fire.\n\nAs concerns the Matter, it is one, and contains within itself all that is needed. Out of it the artist prepares whatever he wants. Its \"Birth is in the sand,\" as the philosopher Anastratus says in \"The Crowd\": \"Nothing is more precious than the red sand of the sea; it is the distilled moisture of the Moon joined to the light of the Sun, and congealed.\" That only this one substance is required is attested by Agadmon in the same book. He says: \"Know that unless you take my body [sulphur] without the spirit [mercury] ye will not obtain what ye desire. Cease to think of many things. Nature is satisfied with one thing, and he who does not know it is lost.\"\n\nIn the same way Arnold, of Villa Nova, writes in his \"Flower of Flowers\"; \"Our stone is made out of one thing, and with one thing.\" To the same effect he says to the King of Naples: \"All that is in our stone is essential to it, nor does it need any foreign ingredient. Its nature is one, and it is one thing.\" And Rosinus says: \"Know that the object of your desire is one thing, out of which all things are made.\" Lilium: \"You have need only of one thing, which at any stage of our experiment can be changed into another nature.\" So Geber says in his \"Summary\": \"Our stone is one, one medicine, to which we add nothing, from which we take nothing away, only removing that which is superfluous.\" Again, Scites in \"The Crowd\" says: \"The essence of this Art is in like manner a certain one thing which is stronger and more exalted than all other things, and is called the most powerful acid, because it changes gold into a clear spirit, without which there is neither whiteness, nor blackness, nor redness. When the spirit is joined to the body it becomes one with it; and yet again becomes a spirit, and is saturated with the spiritual and unchangeable tincture, and thus again by combination receives a bodily tincture which cannot be annihilated. If you place the body without the acid over the fire, it will be burnt and destroyed.\" From these words of Scites the reader might conclude, that not one but two things, namely a body and an acid (as he calls it) are required, and that a liquid must be combined with a dry thing lest the dry thing should be consumed by the fire, in order that\n\np. 13\n\nby the moist thing it may be preserved from such combustion. To such a conclusion, if rightly accepted, I gladly subscribe. But from the above mentioned philosophical dicta (however obscurely worded they may be) it is clearer than day that the substance of our Blessed Stone is one (although different sages call it by different names), and that Nature has made it ready to the hand of the adept, having willed this one thing, and no other thing in all the world, to be the material of the Stone. This Matter lies before the eyes of all; everybody sees it, touches it, loves it, but knows it not. It is glorious and vile, precious and of small account, and is found everywhere. Theophrastus Paracelsus, in his book concerning \"The Tincture of Physical Things,\" calls it the Red Lion, which is named by many, but known by few. Hermes, in the first chapter of his Treatise, calls it \"Quick Silver coagulated in its innermost chambers.\" In the \"Rosary of the Philosophers\" it goes by the name of Salt. But, to be brief, our Matter has as many names as there are things in the world; that is why the foolish know it not. Foolish I call those who, without any previous knowledge of Nature and her properties, undertake to learn this Art, and come to it (as Arnold says) like the ass to the crib, not knowing for what they open their mouths. Hence it is well said by Geber, in the \"Sum of Perfection\": \"He who has no elementary knowledge of Nature is far from a proper appreciation of this Art.\" And Rosarius says: \"I advise no one to approach this Art unless he knows the principle and the regimen of Nature: if he be acquainted with these, little is wanting to him except one thing, nor need he put himself to a great expense, since the stone is one, the medicine is one, the vessel one, the rule one, the disposition one.\" Yet this one substance is so divided by the operation of Nature, and the skill of the Artist, that it is transmuted into our White Eagle, nor does the splendour of the sun illuminate more abundantly the spagyric matter with its beams; or, as Basilius Valentinus hath it, that, \"thence is born a spirit white as scow, and another spirit red as blood, which two spirits are contained in a third hidden thing.\" Hence King Aros well says: \"Our medicine is composed out of two things having one essence, namely, through the mercurial union of a solid and a liquid, a spiritual and a corporeal, a cold and a moist, a warm and a dry, and in\n\np. 14\n\nno other way can it be made.\" And Richard the Englishman says: \"The stone is one, the medicine one, which, however, according to the philosophers, is called Rebis (Two-thing), being composed of two things, namely, a body and spirit [red or white]. But over this many foolish persons have gone astray, explaining it in divers ways.\" Rebis is two things, and these two things are one thing, namely, water joined to a body, by which the body is dissolved into a spirit, that is, mineral water, out of which it was first made; and this body and spirit make up one mineral water, which is called Elixir, that is to say, ferment; for then water and spirit are one thing, of which is composed a tincture and medicine for purging all bodies. And thus, according to the philosophers, we have the nature of sulphur and mercury above ground, while underground they become gold and silver. Bernard, Count of Trevisan and the March, says: Our work is performed by means of one root, and two crude mercurial substances, drawn and extracted from a mineral, pure and clear, being conjoined by the heat of friendship, as this matter requires, and carefully cooked until the two things become one thing,\" &c. Basilius Valentinus (Lib. Nat. et Supernal., c. 4) says: \"I will make this known to thee in all truth [for the love of God], that the root of philosophic sulphur, which is a heavenly spirit, is united in the same material with the root of the spiritual and supernatural mercury, and the principle of spiritual salt\u2014out of which is made the Stone, and not out of several things. That universal thing, the greatest treasure of earthly wisdom, is one thing, and the principles of three things are found in one, which has power to change all metals into one. The three things are the true spirit of mercury, and the soul of sulphur, united to spiritual salt, and dwelling in one body; they are dragon and eagle, king and lion, spirit and body, etc.\"\n\nIn this way our prepared material is also called male and female, active and passive. So Zimon says, in \"The Crowd\": \"Know that the secret of the work consists in male and female, i.e., an active and a passive principle. In lead is found the male, in orpiment the female. The male rejoices when the female is brought to it, and the female receives from the male a tinging seed, and is coloured thereby.\" And Diomedes says: \"Join the\n\np. 15\n\nmale child of the 'red servant' to the fragrant spouse, and they will produce the object of our Art. But you must not introduce any foreign matter, neither dust, nor any other thing. The conception will then be perfect, and a true son will be born. Oh, how precious is the nature of the 'red servant,' without whom nothing can be effected!\" Others call it quicksilver, or mercury, and sulphur, or fire, as Roger Bacon says, in the third chapter of his \"Mirror\": \"Out of sulphur and mercury are all metals, and nothing adheres to them, neither is joined to them, or transmutes them, but what is of them. And thus we must accept mercury and sulphur as the matter of the stone.\" So also Menabadus says: \"He who joins quicksilver to the body of magnesia, and the woman to the man, extracts the secret essence by which bodies are coloured.\" Lullius in his \"Codicil\" says: \"The property of our mercury is to be coagulated by its sulphur\" And, in the Practice of his Testament: \"The silver is a flowing moisture, floating above and preserving the whole from combustion.\"\n\nOthers use the names, body, spirit, and soul. Thus Arnold, in his Flower of Flowers,\" says: \"The Sages have affirmed that our Stone is composed of body, soul, and spirit, and they have spoken truly. For the imperfect part they have compared to a body, because it is weak. The water they have called spirit, and truly, because it is spirit. The ferment they have termed soul, because it gives life to the imperfect body (which before was dead), and makes its form more beautiful.\"\nAgain, he says: \"A spirit is never joined to a body but by the interposition of a soul. For the soul is the medium between body and spirit, joining them together.\" Morienus says: \"The soul quickly enters its own body\u2014but if you tried to join it to a foreign body, you would labour in vain.\" And Lilium says: \"Body, soul, and spirit make up one thing, which has all in itself, and to which nothing is added.\"\n\nBut why should we mention and explain all the names by which our Matter is designated? We will be content with the foregoing, seeing that they are the most common and the most germane to our purpose. In the following pages, after endeavouring to find where our substance lies hid, and where it may be obtained, we will say some words about the mode of its dissolution,\n\np. 16\n\nthat being after all the principal object of our inquiry. And first, as concerns the search after our Matter, we should remember that in the beginning, when there was nothing but Himself, God, who is infinite in wisdom, created two classes of things, namely, those that are in heaven, and those that are under heaven. The heavenly things (about which we need not here speak at length) are the heavens themselves, and the dwellers in heaven The things that are under the heavens were created out of four elements, and are commonly divided into three classes. Those that live and feel hold the first place, and are called animals. The second class are the plants, that grow out of the earth, but do not feel. The third class, that of the minerals, has its origin underground. These three classes include all that (beneath the moon) has been created out of the elements. They can never become more or less, and God has bound each thing to its own genus and species, so that it cannot change from one genus to another. If any one tried to make a man or a tree out of a stone, or a monkey or lead out of a plant, or an animal or a plant out of lead, he would be prevented from doing so by the eternal order of the Great King. If such a thing were possible, all classes of natural objects could be changed into one. But, because such a change would put an end to the world, the Ruler of the Universe does not permit it. Nay, what is more, He not only restricted everything to its own kind, but gave each created thing its own seed, by which it might be propagated after its own manner\u2014always remaining in its own class, and not overstepping the bounds of some other species. If any one wished to change a man into a horse, an apple into a lettuce, a diamond or any other jewel into gold, he would make an enormous mistake. For such an attempt would be against the nature of sublunar things. And as it was in the beginning so it shall be in the end, when the Almighty, who in the beginning said \"Let it be,\" shall say \"Let it perish.\" But among those things which have a common substance, seed, and elementary compositior, it is not difficult to accomplish an amelioration and improvement, by the purification of their matter. So we may see a man of a clear and subtle mind attain to a higher degree of human excellence than others who are less gifted. This difference arises from the superior purity and subtlety of his spiritual substance, which again has its\n\np. 17\n\norigin in a rectified and well constituted body. Thus also we see one horse excel the strength and speed of another; and it is the same with all kinds of living beings. A like rule holds good to an even greater degree in regard to plants and trees\u2014with trees, by transplanting, grafting, and kindred methods well familiar to gardeners; while as to other vegetable natures, we are taught by daily experience how plants and flowers of the same kind differ from each other in glory, in beauty, in fragrance, and savour. Of this cloves and tulips afford a striking instance. Into how many different species have these flowers been developed; and even these. new developments are being made more beautiful from day to day, and it is universally admitted that never were there such fine and fragrant flowers before. What am I to say about metals which have a common substance, namely, quicksilver, digested and consolidated by the power of sulphur? Concerning this common substance, Richard the Englishman has the following words: \"Nature has elaborated all kinds of fusible things by a natural process out of mercury, and the substance of its sulphur, because it is the property of quicksilver to be consolidated by steam, as by the heat of white and red sulphur which does not burn.\"\n\nThe same view is expressed by Arnold (pt. 1., cp. ii.): \"Quicksilver is the elementary form of all things fusible; for all things fusible, when melted, are changed into it, and it mingles with them because it is of the same substance with them. Such bodies differ from quicksilver in their composition only so far as itself is or is not free from the foreign matter of impure sulphur.\" Similarly Rosinus (Ad Saratantam) says: \"The substance of all metals in the heart of the earth is solidified and imperfect quicksilver; for by the quickening heat of sulphur different metals (according to the different varieties of sulphur) are generated in the earth; their original substance is one and the same, and is modified only by a greater or smaller external influence.\" Hence we see daily how busily Nature is occupied in bringing them to mortification and perfection. Now the perfection of metals, and the final intention of Nature in regard to them, is gold. For all metals shew that Nature has done something for them towards ultimate perfection; no metal is so base as not to contain a single grain of gold or silver Nature would always change quicksilver that\n\np. 18\n\nhas within itself its own sulphur into gold, if she were not often hindered by some outward impediment, viz., impure, f\u0153tid, and combustible sulphur. In most cases gold is dug out pure, clear, free from dross, and unmixed with any other metals. But most frequently a large quantity of foreign sulphur mingles with the quicksilver, and thus prevents its perfect development; and, according to the variety of that sulphur, different kinds of metals are generated, as Aristotle says (4. Meteor.): \"If the quicksilver be of a good substance but the sulphur impure and combustible, it changes the quicksilver into brass. If the quicksilver be stony, impure, and earthy, and the sulphur not pure, it becomes iron. Tin seems to have good and pure quicksilver; but the sulphur is bad and not well mixed. Lead has gross, bad, and ill-smelling quicksilver, and is thus not properly coagulated.\"\n\nThat retarding, combustible, and f\u0153tid sulphur is not the true fire that fashions metals; but quicksilver has its own sulphur in itself, which is sufficient for the purpose of fashioning it, as Bernard, Count of Trevisan, says: \"Some believe that in the generation of metals, a sulphuric substance is introduced from without; but, on the contrary, it is clear that in the working of Nature sulphur is already enclosed in the mercury. Yet it has no power in it except through the moving heat, by which the said sulphur is changed, and with it two other qualities of the mercury. In this way, then, Nature generates by means of this sulphur the different kinds of metals in the veins of the earth, according to the diversity of degrees and alterations.\" For in metals, according to Arnold (pt. i., cp. iii.), \"there is a two-fold superfluity: one that is enclosed in the innermost nature of the quicksilver, and got there at the first mingling of the metal; the other does not belong to the essence of it, is external to it, and corruptible. To remove the former is a difficult task; the latter may be removed without any difficulty. The combustible sulphur is taken away by being subjected to the action of fire, or is destroyed by foreign bodies; but the other, which is in the quicksilver, is preserved by it from combustion.\" But again, that inward sulphur which fashions the quicksilver belonging to it, and matures it towards perfection, is either pure or impure, combustible or incombustible. Impure sulphur hinders the\n\np. 19\n\ndigestion of the quicksilver, which cannot be transformed into gold until that which does not belong to it has been entirely separated from it; but the pure, incombustible, fixed sulphur remains with it, and then at length it passes either into gold or silver, according as the sulphur is either white or red. This internal sulphur is nothing but mature mercury, and the most advanced part of the quicksilver, and for this reason the quicksilver receives it so kindly, as being of its own essence, while it rejects the other which is foreign to it. So Richard the Englishman says, in his ninth chapter: The more simple the sulphur is, the more readily does it combine with simple and pure mercury, and the more intimately they combine the more precious is the metal which is produced.\" But such sulphur, says Avicenna, \"is not found on earth, except in so far as it exists in metallic bodies through the action of the sun and moon. In the sun it exists in a perfect state, because there it is better digested and decocted.\" According to Richard, in his twelfth chapter, the red sulphur of the philosophers exists in the sun on account of its greater digestion, and the white sulphur in the moon on account of its inferior digestion.\"\n\nSince, then, the substance of the metals is one, and common to all, and since this substance is (either at once, or after laying aside in course of time the foreign and evil sulphur of the baser metals by a process of gradual digestion) changed by the virtue of its own indwelling sulphur into GOLD, which is the goal of all the metals, and the true intention of Nature\u2014we are obliged to admit, and freely confess that in the mineral kingdom, as well as in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, Nature seeks and demands a gradual attainment of perfection, and a gradual approximation to the highest standard of purity and excellence.\n\nI thought it would be best, O friendly searcher of Nature, to discuss the matter more in detail, in order that you might the more readily know and make use of the substance of our Stone! For if you attempted to produce our Stone out of an animal substance you would fail, because the two things belong to different natural orders. For the Stone is a mineral, but you would be trying to fashion it out of an animal substance. \"But nothing,\" says our Richard, in his first chapter, \"can be got out\n\np. 20\n\nof a thing which is not in it. Therefore every species, every genus, every natural order, is naturally developed within its own limits, bearing fruit after its own kind, and not within some other essentially different order: everything in which seed is sown must correspond to its own seed.\" And Basil. Valentinus says: \"Consider and know, my friend, that you must not select an animal soul for this your purpose. For flesh and blood were given by the Creator to animals, and are proper to animals, and from them animals are formed and brought forth.\" For this reason I wonder at those who wish to be regarded as great adepts, and yet look for the substance of the stone in female menstruums, the seminal fluid, eggs, hairs, urine, and similar things, and are not ashamed to fill so many volumes with their vain and worthless recipes, and to deceive the ignorant with such foolish, futile, and useless speculations. Roger, in his \"Mirror\" (cp. iii.), expresses his amazement at the folly of these men when he exclaims: \"How strange that any sane person should look for what he wants in the animal and vegetable worlds, which have nothing whatever to do with the object of his search, while the mineral world is quite as ready to his hand. It is incredible that any philosopher should establish his art on such a remote foundation, except indeed by way of allegory.\" \"For our Stone (says Basil.) is not made of combustible things. Verily that Stone and the matter thereof are safe from all such violence, therefore cease to seek it in the animal kingdom; for Nature herself could not find it there.\" Again, whoever hopes to find it in the vegetable world, as, for instance, in trees, herbs, flowers, is quite as much mistaken as he who would change an animal into a stone. Plants and trees, with all that they produce, may be consumed by fire, and leave nothing behind but the dust out of which they are made, and the salt which at the first creation of their species they received from Nature. Let no one be misled by the confident assertions of those who pretend that they can produce the Philosopher's Stone out of wheat, or out of wine. These persons fancy they understand the meaning of a certain passage in the writings of Raymond Lullius, but they exhibit the depth of their folly by the assumption of profound wisdom, and thus only deceive themselves and others. I do not deny that some excellent solvents, indispensable both\n\np. 21\n\nto the physician and to the chemist, are obtained from these sources; but I do most positively deny that the Philosopher's Stone can be prepared, or its seed elicited, from them, since the Creator has ordained that nothing should overstep the bounds of the natural order to which it was originally assigned. Hence every true disciple of wisdom may gather that the substance of the Stone is to be obtained neither in the animal nor in the vegetable world, seeing that both are combustible. We must therefore look for it among incombustible things, that is to say, in the mineral world, and thence only can we prepare it. Since, then, the Stone of the Wise is mineral, and there are different kinds of minerals, as stones (including clay and the different varieties of earth), salts, general minerals, and metals, we must further ask, in which of all these it is contained. We may at once eliminate stones, because they contain no fusible mercury, and cannot be incited, dissolved, or divided into their component parts on account of the large quantity of foreign sulphur and earthly substance which cleave to them.\n\nNor will the wise investigator of Nature's secrets expect to find the substance of the Blessed Stone in salts, alums, or similar minerals. [n them he meets with a sharp, corroding, destructive spirit, but mercury and sulphur, as understood by philosophers, he would vainly look for. General minerals, like magnesia, bismuth, antimony, etc., can never under any circumstances become metals; how, then, can the substance of this Stone, which is the essential perfection of all metals and minerals, be obtained from them? Moreover, they have nothing in common with metals, but do burn, corrode, and destroy them:\u2014how then can they be the means of their improvement?\n\nHear what Richard the Englishman has to say on this head (cp. x.): \"The lesser minerals cannot become metals\u2014First, because they were not generated out of the elementary substance of metals, which is quicksilver. But seeing that their generation differs from the generation of metals in form, and substance, and composition, they can never become metals, because things belonging to the same species have the same elementary sub- stance, and spring from the same seed. But the lesser minerals are not generated from mercury, as we learn from Aristotle and Avicenna. If they were to become metals, they would have to\n\np. 22\n\nchange into the elementary substance of metals. And, since such a transformation is beyond the power of chemistry, they can never become metals; that is to say, they can never be the substance of the Stone. Second, since the lesser minerals cannot ber come the elementary substance of metals, which is mercury, they can never reach the middle and the end of the same development, namely, metals and the tincture. But because the properties of the lesser minerals are foreign to those of the metals, although they may have some of the virtues of minerals, yet on the whole they are less excellent and are liable to be injured by fire. Therefore the nature of metals delights not in them, but repels them, while it receives that which is suited to it. For this reason they are foolish who bring in so many foreign speculations for the purpose of imposing upon their hearers; for the things they put forward are altogether unlike metals and can never receive nor impart their nature.\"\n\nThe student must not suffer himself to be misled by the language occasionally employed with regard to salts by the philosophers whom we have quoted, as, for instance, when it is said, in the mystic language of our Sages, \"He who works without salt will never raise dead bodies\"; or, again, when he reads in the book of Soliloquies,\" He who works without salt draws a bow without a string.\" For you must know that these sayings refer to a very different kind of salt from the common mineral. This you may see from the following passage of the \"Rosary of the Philosophers\": \"The salt of metals is the Philosopher's Stone; for our Stone is water congealed in gold and silver; it is hostile to fire and may be dissolved into the water of which it is composed after its kind.\" And that the \"congealed water\" of the Sages does not mean ordinary water may be gathered from the following words of Geber (lib. forn., cp. xix.): \"Seek to resolve the sun and the moon into their dry water, which the vulgar call mercury.\" The Sages have also described their earth under the name of salt\u2014e.g., in the \"Sounding of the Trumpet,\" where it is said: \"That which is left at the bottom of the distilling vessel is our salt\u2014that is to say, our earth.\" And in the \"Allegories of the Wise\" one bursts forth into these words: \"Mark well that those bodies which flow forth from our bodies are salts and alums.\" At times they call the medicine itself\n\np. 23\n\n[paragraph continues] \"Salt,\" as in the following passage of the \"Scale'': \"The virtue of the second water is to exalt earth into its own mineral salt, as though assimilating it by its own strength.\" And Arnold, in his work concerning the \"Preservation of Youth,\" (lib. iii.) says: \"This prepared salt has great virtue in preserving youth. The Sages have compared it to the natural heat of healthy youth. The Stone itself has sometimes been called by the wise the Animal Stone, sometimes the Mineral Secret, on account, of this similitude; sometimes the Everlasting Remedy, or the Water of Life. The whole preparation may be reduced to the purest drinking water, like other things that have the same properties.\" From the aforesaid it clearly appears that we are forbidden both by the teaching of the Sages and by the nature of the thing to suppose that the Stone can be made out of the lesser minerals.\n\nWe should next enquire more carefully whether the matter of our Stone may be obtained from the intermediate minerals\u2014like bismuth, antimony, magnesia, and so on. They are certainly often mentioned in this connection by the Sages. Thus Senior says, in a certain passage: \"If yellow orpiment has not the power of coagulating mercury our Magistery can never attain its goal.\" Thomas de Aquinas recommends us to take \"our antimony, or black earth,\" while Parmenides, in \"The Crowd,\" says: \"Take quicksilver and coagulate it in the body of magnesia, or corruptible sulphur.\" But in all such passages these terms are used metaphorically; it is not meant that the Great Stone can ever be made out of such substances. The orpiment and magnesia of the Sages are not the common minerals, but the substance which in other passages is called the Agent, the Lion, the King, Sulphur, and by many other names. They call it orpiment because it gives a deeper and more brilliant colouring to gold; magnesia because of the excellence and greatness of that which is gained from it; antimony, with Thomas Aquinas, on account of the brilliant blackness which it assumes after solution. As a matter of fact, when the Stone has assumed its ebony colour they are in the habit of comparing it to all black things.\n\nBut it may be said that some of these intermediate minerals are, as a matter of fact, composed of mercury and sulphur, and may become metals, e.g., magnesia unites with lead and tin, and antimony not only mingles with metals, but also produces a\n\np. 24\n\nlead not very different from natural lead. Moreover, it is asserted that many persons of high and low degree have actually seen gold made of these minerals. It is further said that as these minerals are composed of mercury and sulphur (and can by chemical means be reduced to them), and are therefore of a common origin with the metals, the substance of the Stone may also be elicited from them. But, in the first place, we must draw a distinction between the various minerals of this class, namely those which contain mercury, and those which hardly ever contain it. Those that are full of mercury are of greater account, since, by means of our Medicine, their mercury may be transformed into gold and silver; and, their nature being partly metallic, they may well be called half metals. But the rest, which have no mercury, are of no use for our purpose. But forasmuch as, on account of the gross and combustible sulphur which is in them, even the first are very far indeed from the metallic goal, so they cannot be taken for the substance of our Stone, which should be pure and perfect mercury combined with pure, subtle, and incombustible sulphur. That they are most impure and deeply infected with the grossness of their sulphur, may be easily seen by the test of a chemical experiment. One of them (zinetum) might, by reason of its weight and brilliance, be taken at first sight for pure mercury by the careless; but when brought to the test of fire it is consumed with a smoke, like that of sulphur. Bismuth, on the other hand, is not even fusible by fire\u2014such is its earthy grossness and impurity. Antimony, again, can be purged by a chemical process, and reduced to a very white and beautiful regulus. As we gaze upon it in this purified state, it seems difficult to believe that it may not be transformed into something glorious. Hence it is natural that some self-conceited people should have supposed that the Stone may be prepared from it. But however much antimony is purged of its blackness, it still retains its grossness, hardness, and sulphuric properties; it can never become malleable (like the metals), and therefore, in spite of its numerous affinities, cannot be regarded as a metal. Moreover, it has gross and impure mercury; and its sulphur is combustible. Ye, then, who would be great philosophers and do deceive many with your voluminous writings,\n\np. 25\n\nin which you put this mineral forward as the essence of the universal remedy\u2014I ask you again and again to reconsider your opinion, and to mark the saying of Arnold, that \"it is foolish to seek in a thing that which it does not contain.\" He also says, in his Commentary on \"The Crowd\": \"The philosopher's stone is a pure substance.\" Again, Lullius in his \"Last Testament,\" observes: \"Our tincture is nothing but pure fire.\" There is an expression to the same effect in his \"Vade Mecum\": \"It is a subtle spirit which tinges bodies, and cleanses them of their leprous infirmities.\" But this mineral (like all the rest, without a single exception) is so gross and impure that it can only be cleansed by the mediation of our tincture. Therefore, the substance of our Great Stone cannot be elicited from it, since (Richard, cp. 1.) nothing can be obtained from a body which does not exist therein. What shall we say of vitriol, which misleads many by its wonderful qualities, especially as some part of it changes into copper, and itself has the power of transforming icon into copper? As a matter of fact, it is the elementary substance of copper, and when this mineral vapour (or aeriform mercury) finds in the mineral veins of the earth a place where its bitter, acid, salt, and venereal sulphur lies hid, it immediately amalgamates with it into a metal. But since the quantity of the aforesaid sulphur greatly exceeds that of the mercury, when the pure is separated from the impure, and the combustible from the incombustible by the segregating office of Nature, the mercury itself is changed into a greenish inferior substance. When common sulphur is added to copper, and the whole brought in contact with fire (for art can do by intense heat in a few moments what it takes the gentle heat of Nature a long time to accomplish) it corrodes the copper, and changes it into vitriol, and, in proportion to the quantity of the sulphur, the vitriol assumes a richer or fainter colour; whence it comes that some vitriol contains more copper and some less. In iron, too, there is gross sulphur; hence it is corroded by vitriol which seeks its mercury (the mercury of iron being very like that of vitriol), and (the mercury being joined to the sulphur) the iron becomes pure copper.\n\nIt should be carefully noticed that the acid spirit of vitriol is generated from sulphur; for the smell of sulphur is perceived\n\np. 26\n\nin the spirit of vitriol, and the spirit of sulphur, like the spirit of vitriol, has power to change into vitriol. Since, then, this corrosive sulphur is hid in vitriol, and since it contains so small a quantity of impure mercury, we may be sure that it cannot be the object of our search. In this we agree with Alphidius, who says: \"Take heed, my son, and eschew dead bodies, and stones; in these things there is no true way of procedure, for their life preserves not, but destroys. Such are salts, orpiments, arsenic, magnesia, bismuth, tutty, and the like.\" And Arnold (Flos Flor.) says: \"The reason of these mistakes is that the four spirits, viz., orpiment, salt of ammonia, mercury, and sulphur, are not the seed of perfect or imperfect metals (except, of course, mercury and sulphur by themselves).\"\n\nBut from these last words of Arnold it might be inferred that common mercury and quicksilver are the substance of the stone, seeing that these are referred to the four spirits, and that sulphur is supposed to consolidate the mercury. But I answer, with Richard the Englishman, in his eleventh chapter, that it does not really do so. For every kind of common sulphur is repugnant to metals, as the Sage says: \"Indeed you must know that sulphur comes forth out of the fatness of the earth, and is thickened in the minera by gentle heat; when it becomes hard it is called sulphur.\"\n\nNow there are two kinds of sulphur, the living and the combustible. Quick sulphur is the active principle of metals, and, when purged from all foreign matter, is the Matter of our Stone. But the common combustible variety is not the Matter of metals or of our Stone; rather, it is injurous to them. Common, combustible sulphur\u2014so we are told by Avicenna and Richard the Englishman\u2014has nothing to do with our art. However carefully prepared, it still disintegrates and destroys metals, because it has no affinity with them. When enclosed in metals, it retards their fusion. This is clearly seen in the case of iron, which contains hard, gross, and impure sulphur. When this sulphur is burned it is nothing but a dead, earthy, powdery substance. How then can it impart life to other things? For it has two principles of decay\u2014its inflammability and its earthy impurity. The sulphur of the Sages, on the other hand, is living fire; it is quick, and quickens and matures lifeless\n\np. 27\n\nsubstances. Common sulphur, then, cannot be the substance of the Stone.\n\nBut what shall we infer concerning common mercury? The Sages tell us that the Matter of our Stone is a mercurial substance, and many of its qualities closely resemble those of vulgar mercury. For it is the elementary substance of all fusible minerals, as Arnold says (Ros., pt. I., cp. ii.): \"Since all fusible substances, when melted, are changed into it, and it mingles with them because of its common nature: they can differ from it only in so far as it contains impure foreign sulphur.\" And, again (cp. iv.): \"Living mercury is clearly most perfect, and proved in all its operations, since it saves from combustion and promotes fusion. It is the red tincture, the sum of perfection, and quick as lightning; nor is it severed from that with which it has mingled so long as it exists. The same is full of affinity, cleaving faithfully, and is the medium by which tinctures are united, for it mingles most intimately with them, penetrating naturally into their inmost part, for it is of the same nature. We imitate Nature exactly, who in her minera hath no other matter whereon she works except a pure mercurial form. It is the only thing that overcomes fire, and is nut overcome by it, but delights in its amicable warmth.\" Again, Bernard says: \"In this mercury is enclosed essential sulphur, which the fire cannot touch; and it accomplishes our object without any other substance than that of pure mercury.\" Seeing, then, that mercury has such excellent properties, it must surely be the substance of our Stone? True; but as there are two kinds of sulphur, so there are two kinds of mercury, the common mercury and the mercury of the Sages. Common mercury is gross and crude; nor does it stand the test of fire like our mercury, but is dissipated in the form of smoke, even by gentle heat. Hence the Sages have laid down this rule: \"Our mercury is not the mercury of the vulgar herd.\" So Lullius says (Clav. cp. I.): \"Common quicksilver, however carefully prepared, can never become the quicksilver of the Sages, for common quicksilver can only stand the test of fire by the aid of some other dry and more highly digested quicksilver.\" But most students of this art have spoken largely about the sublimation of common mercury, and have persisted in seeking the treasure of earthly\n\np. 28\n\nwisdom where it cannot be found, because Nature has not placed it there. And, truly, the working even of common mercury is so wonderful that it has misled some who supposed themselves to be adepts in this art. The following is a case in point. I knew a man who succeeded in giving to his amalgam an orange colour, but he could not get it any nearer to the colour of gold. At last this clever chemist determined to increase the heat of the furnace, thinking that this would have the desired effect of more intimately combining the various ingredients. But alas! the alembic burst, the gold was hurled into the fire, and almost changed from its nature by the still volatile mercury. Hence it appears that the mercury (which is its body) so strongly affected the gold in its minutest particles as to reduce it to a tincture, although several colours were obtained by the action of the heat on the melted mass. If that good man had taken to heart Arnold's words in the \"Flower of Flowers,\" he would never have made that experiment. For the said Arnold makes reference to those who adopt this method in the following terms: \"They knew that mercury is the elementary principle of the metals, and that they are produced through its digestion by the heat of sulphur; they therefore sublimed mercury by itself, then fixed and consolidated it, again melted it and did again coagulate it: but when they came to examine the alembic, they found no gold, etc.\" Therefore we cannot believe that common quicksilver is the substance of the Stone. At the same time I do not deny that it is indispensable both to the philosophical chymist and to the physician.\n\nWe have carefully sought the substance of our stone in the animal and vegetable world, among stones, lesser, intermediate, and greater minerals, but in vain. We must now see whether we can find it in the metals, and if so, whether in all or only in some. It is a well-known fact (to which Roger bears witness, Spec., cp. iii.), that all metals are generated out of sulphur and quicksilver, and that nothing will become one with them, or change them, but what originates in themselves; since a thing can be developed and improved only by that which belongs to its own nature (Richard, cp. i.).\n\nI need not say that the Great Artist has ordained that throughout the whole of Nature things should generate and\n\np. 29\n\nproduce only that which is like them, so that, for instance, a horse can never be the offspring of a man. \"As brute animals,\" says Basil Valentine, \"cannot multiply after their kind by way of generation except by virtue of their common nature; so you cannot expect to obtain the Blessed Stone, but out of its own seed, out of which it was made from the beginning. Now to find the seed you should diligently consider for what purpose you require the Store. You will at once see that it can be obtained only from the metallic root from which God has ordained that the metals themselves should be generated. Moreover, there is a great conformity between the generation of the metals and the Stone. For in both sulphur and quicksilver (containing that salt which is their quickening soul) are indispensably required; nor can any useful metal be generated until these three (making up the metallic substance) have been combined; for in the composition of metals there must be nothing which has not been obtained from a metallic source.\" \"No external thing,\" says Draco, \"which is not derived from these two [sulphur and mercury] has power to produce or transmute metals. On this account we must select a metallic substance for the production of the Stone.\" We must next briefly enquire whether it is to be found in imperfect metals. Many imagine that the substance of the white (tincture) may be elicited from tin or lead, and that of the red out of copper or iron, or both. This idea is doubtless owing to a misconception of the words of the Sages. For Geber (lib. forn. cp., ix.) says: \"The mass for fermentation we generally gain from the imperfect [base] bodies.\" Therefore we lay it down as a general rule that the white paste may be extracted from Jupiter and Saturn, the red from Venus, Saturn, and Mars. And Basil. Valentinus says (Lib. de phys. et hyperphys.), that the tincture is prepared out of a conjunction of Mars and Venus. Again (Triumph. Antimon.), he uses these words: \"After this tincture of the Sun and Moon comes the tincture of Venus and Mars, which two make up the tincture of the Sun, when they have been thoroughly perfected and condensed. After these come the tinctures of Jupiter and of Saturn (for the coagulation of mercury), and at last the tincture of mercury itself.\" But the searcher of Nature must know that there can be no contradiction of opinion between Geber or Basil, for it is impossible that the true\n\np. 30\n\nphilosophers should ever lie, and so these words should be parabolically understood. For no perfection can be obtained from imperfect metals, either by themselves or mixed, nor can that which is itself imperfect bring other things to perfection. For the purest substance of mercury is required for our purpose, as is testified in the \"Sounding of the Trumpet,\" and by Avicenna, Lullius, and almost all the Sages, who unanimously affirm that \"the purest substance of mercury is selected by us for our work.\" Now this highly refined substance of mercury is not found in the base metals, since they are rendered so gross by their impure and unessential sulphur, that, like leprous bodies, they can never be thoroughly purged and cleansed, in which process is the essence of our artifice. Nor do they well stand the test of fire, which is one of the properties required in our Matter. Let us hear what Geber has to tell us (Summa, cp. lxiii.) concerning the impurity of imperfect metals, and the properties of perfect mercury: \"Thus,\" he says, \"we happen upon two most wonderful secrets. The one is that there exists a twofold cause for the destruction of every [imperfect] metal by fire: namely, (1), the combustible sulphur enclosed in their interior substance is kindled by fierce heat, and (unimpeded by any excellence in their mercury) annihilates, and converts into smoke their entire substance; (2), the outward flame is fed by them, penetrates into their interior, and dissolves them into smoke, even though they be very solid; (3), their interior is laid bare by calcination. Now when all these conditions of destruction are found together, bodies must needs be destroyed; if they are not found together, they are destroyed somewhat more slowly. The second secret is the excellence which quicksilver imparts to bodies. For quicksilver (no other condition of decay being present) does not permit itself to be separated into its elements, but proves its perfection by preserving its substance intact in the fire. Blessed be God who created it, and gave it such a substance and such properties as are not found in all Nature besides. This is that which overcomes fire, and delights in its amicable heat.\" Here Geber clearly shews that the substance of our Stone cannot exist in imperfect metals; because things that are impure in themselves do not abide the fire which might purify them, while our mercury (on account of its purity) is not in the slightest degree\n\np. 31\n\ninjured by the fire. Thus we perceive that no one imperfect metal can contain the substance of our Stone. But neither is it to be found in a mixture of impure metals\u2014for by mixing they become less pure than they were before. Moreover we said above that the substance we required was one. This fact is clearly set forth by Halys (lib. secret., cp. vi.), when he says: \"The Stone is One; nothing else must be added to it: out of one substance the Sages obtain our remedy. Nothing else must mingle with the Stone itself, or with its substance.\" And Morienus says: \"This Magistery grows from one original root, which branches out into several parts, and from which springs one thing.\"\n\nBut if base metals cannot be the substance of the Stone, why do the Sages bid us employ them? I will tell you. When they speak of impure bodies, they do not mean copper, iron, lead, tin, &c., but its own body, or its earth\u2014as Arnold (Flos Flor.) says: \"Mercury is united to earth, i.e., to an imperfect substance [or body].\" \"For though this earth\" is so perfect and pure that in these respects it would seem to attain the utmost possibility of Nature, yet in regard to the Stone it is still imperfect and impure. In this point art leaves Nature behind, since it accomplishes what Nature could not perform. That this earth before its plenary purgation and regeneration is imperfect, may be seen from the fact that it cannot yet accomplish more in the matter of tinging than Nature has given to it, while after its regeneration it is most powerful. Its grossness is clearly perceived in an actual experiment: for first it is black and looks like lead or antimony; then it is of a whitish colour, and is called Jupiter (or tin, or magnesia), and this also before it has attained true whiteness, but when it has passed the white stage, it is called Mars and Venus; after that it becomes perfect and red. That Basil. Valentinus agrees with me, and did not really hold the opinion which he expressed in some of his writings, is clear from his tract concerning the Great Stone, where (speaking of the Matter of the Stone) he says that in the Sun all three perfections are found together, whence it derives its power of resisting the fire, and that the Moon, on account of its fixed mercury, does not easily yield to the fire, but endures the trial. \"That noble paramour Venus,\" he continues, \"is\n\np. 32\n\nfurnished with an abundance of colour, and the greater and richer part of her body is full of tincture. The colour is the same which dwells in the most precious of metals, and on account of its abundance has a reddish appearance. But its body is leprous, for which reason the tincture cannot remain fixed in it, but evaporates when the former is destroyed. For when the body decays the soul cannot remain, but is dissipated and driven off. Its habitation is destroyed and burnt with fire, and its place knows it no more. In a fixed body it would without difficulty remain. The fixed 'salt' gives to brave Mars a hard, strong, and heavy body; whence the strength of his soul is perceived: for this warrior is not easily overcome. For his body is hard and difficult to wound.\"\n\nBut let no one conclude from these words of Basilius that that fixed sulphur of Venus, when united to the spirit of perfect mercury, will become the tincture. We must again repeat that our substance is not collected from many sources; but, as Basilius says, it is one universal thing, and is found in, and obtained from one thing, being the spirit of mercury, the soul of sulphur, and a spiritual salt, united under one heaven and dwelling in one body. Therefore let us turn our backs upon the base metals, and turn our minds to the precious metals, taking to heart those words of Plato (qu. ii.): \"Why do you melt and dissolve other bodies with great labour, when in these [the precious metals] you have what you seek? If you wish to use the base metals, you must first change them into the substance of perfect bodies.\" Therefore, beloved inquirer into the secrets of Nature, leave on one side all things animal and vegetable, all salts, alums, vitriols, bismuths, magnesias, antimonies, and all base and impure metals, and seek thy Stone with Arnold de Vill. nov. (Pt. I., cp. vii.): \"in Mercury and the Sun for the Sun, and in Mercury and the Moon for the Moon; since the whole virtue of this art consists in them alone.\" \"For as the source of ignition is fire, so gold is the principle of gold making,\" says Ripley, in his \"First Gate.\" If, therefore, thou wouldest make gold and silver by the philosopher's art, take for this purpose neither eggs, nor blood, but gold and silver, which, being subjected to the action of fire naturally, prudently, and not manually, generate new substances after their own kind,\n\np. 33\n\nlike all things in Nature. Richard (cp. x.) tells us \"to sow gold and silver, that aided by our labour they may bring forth fruit, through the mediation of Nature: for these two have [and are] what you seek and nothing else in all the world.\" And why should I not fix on them since they contain pure and perfect mercury, with red and white sulphur. (Richard, cp. xvii.) So Avicenna teaches that, \"in all silver is white, as in all gold there is red, sulphur. No other sulphur like that which exists in these bodies is found on all the earth. Therefore we cunningly prepare these two bodies, that we may have sulphur and quicksilver of the same substance as that which generates gold and silver under the earth. For they are shining bodies, whose rays tinge other bodies with true whiteness and redness, according to the manner of their own preparation.\" \"For our Magistery,\" says, Arnold (Rosar., pt. I., cp. v.) \"aids perfect bodies, and works upon the imperfect without the admixture of anything else. Gold, then, being the most precious of all the metals, is the red tincture, tinging and transforming every body. Silver is the white tincture, tinging other bodies with its perfect whiteness.\" Let me tell the gentle reader that the metals, that is to say, gold and silver in their metallic form, are not the Matter of our Stone\u2014being in the middle between them and the base metals, as our Matter is in the middle between the former and our Great Stone. So Bernard says, (pt. ii.): \"Let them be silent who affirm that there is any tincture but our own, or any other sulphur than that which lies hid in magnesia; also those who would extract the quicksilver from any but the red slave, and who speak of some other water but our own which is incorruptible and combines with nothing except that which belongs to its own nature, and moistens [tinges] nothing except that which is one with its own nature. There is no acid but our own, no other regimen, no other colours. In the same way, there is no other true solution, sublimation, consolidation, putrefaction. I therefore advise you to have done with alums, vitriols, salts, black bodies, borax, aqua fortis, herbs, animals, beasts, and all that proceeds from them, hairs, blood, urine, human seed, flesh, eggs, and all minerals, and to keep to the metals. But though the quicksilver required for our Stone is found in metals only, and in these is the beginning of the work, they\n\np. 34\n\nare not therefore our Stone, so long as they retain their metallic form. For one and the same substance cannot have two forms. How can they be the Stone which holds an intermediate form between metals and mercury, unless their present form is first destroyed and removed?\" Therefore, also, Raymond Lully says in his \"Testament\" (cp. vi.): \"On this account a good artist takes metals for his media in the work of the magistery, and especially the Sun and Moon, because in them the substance of the Mercury and Sulphur is ripened, pure, and well-digested by Nature's own artifice. The artist would vainly endeavour to produce this exact proportion out of the natural elements, if he did not find it ready to his hand in these bodies.\" And in the \"Codicil\" he says: \"Without these two, viz., gold and silver, our art would have no existence since the sulphur they contain has been purified by nature with a thoroughness such as art would vainly strive to imitate. From these two bodies, with their prepared sulphur [or prepared arsenic] our Medicine may be elicited, but without them we can never obtain it.\" In the preface to his \"Key\" he says: \"I advise you, my friends, to operate on nothing but the Sun and Moon; but these you should resolve into their elementary substances, viz., our quicksilver and our sulphur.\" In like manner Arnoldus assures us that \"from these bodies there is extracted an exceedingly white and red sulphur; for in these there is a most pure substance of sulphur, cleansed to the highest degree by Nature's own artifice.\" Nicarus, in \"The Crowd,\" says: \"I bid you take gold, which you desire to multiply and renew, and to divide its water into two parts; for that metal falling into that water will be called the fermenting matter of gold.\" How can this Sage call his \"water\" gold? To assist the student in solving this enigma I must tell him that the gold of the Sages is not common gold, as also Senior tells us. In \"The Crowd\" it is said: \"As mercury is the element of all metals, so gold is their ultimate goal; hence in all metals, pure and impure, there are gold, silver, and mercury. But there is one true gold which is the essence of all.\" Thus you see that there is a gold of the Sages, which, though derived from common gold, is yet very different from it. The following words occur in the \"Rising Dawn\" (cp. xvi.) \"The philosopher's gold resembles common\n\np. 35\n\ngold neither in colour nor in substance. That which is extracted from it is the red and white tincture.\" \"The philosopher's gold may be bought at a low price\" (Aphidius). \"All that is bought at a high price is false. With little gold we buy much\" (Morienus). Moreover, our gold is living gold, and our silver is living silver, so that they can cause nothing but life and growth. Common gold and silver are dead, They can effect nothing until they are raised from the dead and quickened by the Sage. Then they live, and possess in a high degree the power of propagating and multiplying their race. Concerning the life of our metals that great philosopher, Sendivogius (who is still living), has the following words: \"Let me advise you not to receive the gold and silver of the vulgar herd, for they are dead. Take our living metals. Place them in our fire, and there will result a dry liquid. First, earth will be resolved into water [for thus the Mercury of the Sages is called]. That water will solve gold and silver, and consume them until only the tenth part with one part is left. This will be the humid radical of the metals.\"\n\nIt is to be noted that Sages sometimes call their water, as well as their earth, gold. Hereunto we have already heard the words of Nicarus, and after a like manner we are told in the \"Rosary of the Philosophers: \"Our gold and silver are not the gold and silver of the vulgar. We call gold the water which rises into the air when exposed to fire. Verily, this gold is not the gold of the vulgar. The vulgar would not believe of their gold that it could be volatilised on account of its solid nature.\"\n\nThe philosopher's \"earth,\" then, is sometimes designated their gold, as the same author testifies: \"Know that our ore, which is the gold of the philosophers, is their earth.\" This \"earth\" is also called ore, ferment, or tincture; just as the \"water\" is called white and flaky \"eart.h\" So we read in the \"Sounding of the Trumpet\": \"Wherefore Hermes says, 'Sow your gold in white, flaky earth which by calcination has been made glowing, subtle, and volatile.' That is to say: Sow gold, i.e., the soul and quickening virtue, into the white earth, which by preparation has been made white and pure and freed from all its grossness. Thus natural gold is not the fermenting matter, but the philosopher's gold is the quickening ferment itself.\" Again, in the Seventh Step of the \"Ladder of the Philosophers\": \"Their\n\np. 36\n\nearth is white in which their gold [which is the soul] is sown, and this body is the centre of knowledge, the concentration thereof, and the habitation of tinctures.\" Once more: \"Therefore Hercules says; 'Solve the body of magnesia which has become white and like the leaves of the bramble.' This is the body; the soul is the essence which is called the philosopher's gold.\" (For with water the spirit ascends into the upper air.) \"Mix,\" says Senior, \"gold with gold, that is water [mercury] and ashes.\" Again, Hermes says: \"Sow gold into the white flaky earth.\" From these expressions, however obscurely worded. it is clear that our gold is not common gold.\n\nBut why do the philosophers call their gold now \"water,\" and now \"earth\"? Do they not contradict themselves, or each other? No; our Sages, in expounding the truth, veil it under obscure and allegorical expressions, but nevertheless agree with each other so marvellously that they all seem to speak, as it were, with one mouth. They do nit confound one thing with another, nor do they wish to lead the earnest enquirer astray. They express themselves in mystic phrases to hide the truth from the unworthy and impious, lest they should seem to be casting pearls before swine, and giving the holy thing to be trodden underfoot by these who think only of indulging their lustful desires. But the noble student of our art has been told more than once, not only from what quarter our Stone may be obtained, but also that its substance must be one, which by the artist's skill may be resolved into two, viz., earth and fire, or mercury and sulphur.\n\nThe Sages, then, do well to call their gold earth or water; for they have a perfect right to term it whatever they like. So they have frequently called their Stone their gold, their super-perfect gold, their regenerate gold, and by many other names besides. If any one does not perceive their meaning at the first glance, he must blame his own ignorance, not their jealousy.\n\nThe reader now knows that the substance of our Stone is neither animal nor vegetable, and that it does not belong to the minerals or the base metals, but that it must be extracted from gold and silver, and that our gold and silver are not the vulgar, dead gold and silver, but the living gold and silver of the Sages. We must now say something about the mode of solution, as the\n\np. 37\n\ngreatest arcanum of all, and the root of the matter. A solution takes place when we transform a dry thing into a liquid, a hard thing into a soft, a hidden thing into one that is manifest, i.e., when a solid is changed into water; not, however, the vulgar water (as Parmenides and Agadmon in \"The Crowd\" teach us: \"When some persons hear of the liquefaction, they think a change takes place into the water of the clouds. But if they had read and understood our books, they would know that our water is permanent), but into the water of the Sages, i e., the elementary substance, as Arnold (Ros. I., cp. ix.) says: \"The object of the Sages is to dissolve the Stone into its mercury, or elementary matter\" And Avicenna says: \"Thou who wouldest attain our object must first endeavour to dissolve and sublime the two luminaries, which is the first stage of the experiment, that they may become quicksilver.\" Therefore Arnold (Ros. II., cp. ii.) describes the solution as a resolving of bodies, and a preparation of the first Matter or Nature. And Richard the Englishman (cp. xviii.) writes thus: \"First the Stone must be resolved into its elementary substance [seeing that it is an union of body and spirit], that the two may become one mercurial water.\" But even as this first solution is the most vital part of our process, so is it also the most difficult, as Eobold Vogelius testifies when he says: \"How hard this achievement is can be affirmed by those who have performed it.\" Bernard of Trevisan, in his book addressed to Thomas of Bononia, says: \"He who knows the secret of the solution is acquainted with the arcanum of the Art, which is, to mingle kinds, and effectually to extract elements from elements which lie hid in them.\" The solution must not be made with aqua fortis; for aqua fortis corrodes and destroys the body which should be only liquefied and improved. The solution does not take place into any water that wets the hands, but into a dry water, which is called both sulphur and mercury, as Zneumo says (Turba): \"Unless by resolving it into its elements you extract from the body its marrow, and make it an impalpable spirit, you labour in vain.\" And Richard the Englishman, following Avicenna, affirms (cp. xi.): \"The Sages have striven to discover how those sulphurs may be extracted from those more perfect bodies, and how their qualities may be so refined by Art, that that which was not manifest before (although\n\np. 38\n\nit always lay hid in them) may appear by the mediation of the said Art with Nature.\" And this they confess cannot be done unless the body be resolved into its First Matter, which is quicksilver, out of which it was made in the beginning, without admixture of any outward things; since foreign matter cannot improve the nature of our Stone. \"For no water,\" says Bernard, \"dissolves our bodies, but that which is of their kind, and may be inspissated by them.\" (Ep. to Thom. of Bonon.) And in the same Epistle he writes: \"The solution should be permanent, so that from both elements, viz., the male and female seed, a new species may result. Amen, I say unto you that no natural water can dissolve metals, except that which is always in them substantially and formally, and which the metals themselves, being dissolved, may again consolidate.\" Thus Morfoleus, in \"The Crowd\" says: \"Every body is dissolved with the spirit that is joined to it, and doubtless also becomes spiritual. And every spirit is modified and coloured by bodies, to which spirit is thus added a tinging colour which stands the test of fire.\"\n\nHence the student of our art must diligently enquire what that water is. \"For the knowledge of the menstruum,\" says Raymond (Comp. An., p. i.) \"is a thing without which nothing can be done in the magistery of this Art. Nothing preserves the metals while it dissolves them, but our menstruum,\" which, as he further states in his 'Codicil,' is \"the water by which the metals are solved, while all their essential properties are conserved.\" Though this is the Great Arcanum which our Sages have always kept secret, and have forbidden us to reveal, yet, as far as we may, we will put you on the right track by two quotations. The first is found in the abridged Rosary, and runs as follows: \"The first preparation and foundation of this Art, is the solution [i.e., reduction] of the body into water, i.e., into quicksilver, and this they call the solution, when they say: Let the gold be dissolved, which is hid in the body of magnesia, that it may be reduced to its First Matter, that thence it may become sulphur and quicksilver, and not be again liquefied into water. The object of our solution is to make it liquid, and resolve it into the substance of quicksilver that the saltness of its sulphur may be diminished, which divine sulphur is prepared by extraction from two sulphurs, when the spirit meets the body.\" The second quotation\n\np. 39\n\nis from the \"Pro\u0153mium of the Twelve Gates,\" by Ripley: \"I will straightway teach thee that thou mayest know that there are three mercuries, which are the keys of knowledge [which Raymond calls his menstrua], without which nothing is properly done. But two of them are superficial. The third is of the essence of the Sun and Moon, the properties of which I will describe to thee. For mercury, the essence of other metals, is the principal substance of our Stone. In Gold and Silver our menstrua are not visible to the eye, and are only perceived by their effect. This is the Stone of which we speak, if anyone understand our books aright. It is the soul and shining substance of the Sun and Moon, that subtile influence from which the earth derives its splendour. For what are gold and silver (says Avicenna) but pure red and white earth? Take away from it the aforesaid splendour, and it will be nothing but worthless earth. The whole compound we call our lead. The quality of splendour comes from the Sun and Moon. And, in brief, these are our solvents. Perfect bodies we naturally calcine with the first, without adding any impure body but one, commonly called by philosophers the green lion, and this is the medium for perfectly combining the tinctures of the Sun and Moon. With the second, which is a vegetable liquid, reviving what before was dead, the two principles [both material and formal] must be solved; else they would be of little value. With the third, which is a permanent, incombustible liquid, of unctuous quality, the tree of Hermes is burnt to ashes. This is our natural, most sure fire, our mercury, our sulphur, our pure tincture, our soul, our Stone raised with the wind, born in the earth. These things take to heart. This Stone, I dare to tell thee, is the powerful essence of the metal, and thou must be careful how thou dost obtain it. For this solvent is invisible, although with the secondary philosophic water it may, by the separation of elements, become visible in the form of pure water. Out of this solvent, and with it, thou mayst obtain the sulphur of Nature, if it be naturally turned into a pure spirit. Then thou mayst with it dissolve thy fundamental mass [i.e. gold and silver].\"\n\nIn these two quotations the whole mystery of the solution is revealed. If you will consider the properties and powers of Nature, and compare them with these words, and annihilate all\n\np. 40\n\nthe workings of Nature (i.e. reduce them, and unroll them like the thread of a skein), you will find in them all truth plainly and fundamentally. But if you cannot gather from them where are the bolted gates, and do not know the substance and the powers of Nature, you shall be conducted to them, not by contemptuous self-conceit, but by ardent prayer and indefatigable study.\n\nFor (by the revelation of the great and good God) I have attained this Art only by persevering application, vigils, and repeated reading of authentic books. I do not speak of the matter\u2014that was made known to me by the revelation of God alone; but I have by study discovered the secret of its solution, which is the same with ancient and modern Sages, and the true arcanum of the Art, in the absence of which neither past nor present Philosophers could have performed anything, whence it is a secret of Art and an arcanum of wisdom which no one but God must reveal, for which benefit I give undying thanks with heart and lips to the Creator of all things, world without end, Amen.\n\nThat you may have no cause to complain of me, gentle reader, I will, however, for the love of God, expound to you another mystery. You are to know that, although the solution is one, yet in it there may be distinguished a first, and a second, as they say in the schools. The first solution is that of which Arnold speaks in the above quotation, viz., the reduction of it to its First Matter; the second is that perfect solution of body and spirit at the same time, in which the solvent and the thing solved always abide together, and with this solution of the body there takes place simultaneously a consolidation of the spirit.\n\nHere you may clearly and plainly see with your eyes what you have long desired to see. If you understand it, it is mere child's play; therefore, I will forbear to speak any further about it. If you know the beginning, the end will duly follow by the help of God, from whom alone we may obtain all glory, the corruptible glory of this world, and that eternal glory in which with glorified bodies we shall see God face to face\u2014despising all mundane pleasure that we may behold with our own eyes that eternal, infinite, and unspeakable joy of heaven.\n\nWith these words I will conclude my little tract. Everything else that remains to be said I will set forth in the following\n\np. 41\n\nparable, where you will find the entire system and practice clearly expounded. If you duly follow it, you will doubtless attain to the true wisdom. May it be shewn to you, and to all good men, by God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, Blessed for evermore!\n\n_______________\n\nM.S.\n\nThe thing is one in number, and one essence, which Nature strives to transform, but with the help of Art, into two, and twice two: mercury and sulphur impart nourishment to themselves. Spirit, and soul, and body, and four elements: the fifth which they furnish is the Philosopher's Stone. Select your substance without guile, let it be double, and let its splendour be of pure mercury. Take sulphur free from every foreign substance, and consume it in a fiery furnace. But when you put it together again, let it still be of the same weight. Then I will believe that you are upon the road of the mystery. When you have dissolved, quickly sublime it. Pound what you obtain, and ceaselessly distil it. Then endeavour to condense it, and continue to expose it to heat. After this begin to \"tinge\" largely. You have the panacea of men, and the sum of the metals, and you shall be able to cure whomsoever and whatsoever you please.\n\n__________________________\n\nHere follows a Parable in which the Mystery of the whole Matter is Declared.\n\nOnce upon a time, when I was walking abroad in a wood, and considering the wretchedness of this life, and deploring that through the lamentable fall of our first parents we had been reduced to this pitiable state, I suddenly found myself upon a rough, untrodden, and impracticable path, which was beset with briars. Then I was afraid, and strove to retrace my steps. But it was not in my power to do so; for so violent a tempest blew upon me from behind that it was easier to take ten steps forward than to take one backward. So I had to hurry forward, and follow the rugged path up and down hill. After a while, I reached a beautiful\n\np. 42\n\nmeadow, surrounded with heavy-laden fruit trees, which the inhabitants of the place called the Meadow of Happiness. There I met a crowd of decrepit men with grey beards, one of whom, an elderly personage, had a long darkish beard, whom also I knew by name, but whose face I had never seen. These men were discussing various subjects, e.g., the goodness and wisdom of God, all natural objects, and especially the great mystery which lies hid in Nature, which\u2014they said\u2014God conceals from the whole world, and makes known only to a few who truly love Him. I listened to them for a long time (for I was pleased with their discourse) till I thought that some were talking rather wildly, not in regard to the substance and the method, but as concerns parables, similitudes, etc., which were the figments of Aristotle, Pliny, and others. When I heard these things, I could no longer contain myself, and, like Saul among the prophets, I began to give my opinion, and to refute those futile assertions by arguments drawn from experience and reason. Some of them agreed with me, and began to test my knowledge with many questions. But I was so well grounded that I stood the test to the admiration of all. They all marvelled at the soundness of my knowledge, and affirmed with one voice that I should be received into their fellowship. These words filled me with great joy. But they said I could not be their Brother until I knew their Lion, and his internal and external properties. They told me I must summon up my whole strength to subdue him. I confidently replied that I would leave no stone unturned to attain this object. For their kindness affected me so that I would not have left them for all the wealth of this world. Therefore they conducted me to the Lion, and were at great pains to declare to me his nature. But no one would tell me how I must treat him at first. Some of them did indeed mutter a few words on this point, but so confusedly and obscurely, that scarce one in a thousand would have understood their meaning. However, they said that when I had bound him without being harmed by his sharp claws and terrible teeth, I should know all the rest. This Lion was old, fierce, great, and terrible to behold with his flowing yellow mane. Then I repented of my temerity, and would gladly have retreated if I had not been held to my purpose by my vow, and\n\np. 43\n\nthe old men that surrounded me. So I carefully descended into the Lion's den, and strove to pacify him; but he glared upon me with red eyes, and affrighted me so that I could hardly stand upon my feet, and thought that my last hour had come. But calling to mind what one of the old men had said to me when I entered the den, namely, that many had undertaken to tame the Lion, but that only few had accomplished it, I summoned up courage, and tried several artifices, which I had learned by diligent training. Moreover, I had some knowledge of natural magic. I therefore relinquished my blandishments, and seized him so gently, skilfully, and subtly, that almost before he knew what I was about I had drawn all the blood from his body, and from his very heart and bowels. This blood was red indeed, but choleric. Then I proceeded to dissect him, and made a most marvellous discovery:\u2014his bones were as white as snow, and their quantity more considerable than that of the blood. When the old men who stood round the den, and had watched our struggle, saw this, they began to converse with great eagerness, as I could see from their gestures\u2014for, being in the den, I could not hear their words. But anon their dispute began to run high, and I could distinguish these words: \"He must bring him to life again if he wishes to be our brother.\" Therefore, without further delay, I stepped out of the den into a large open space, and then suddenly (I know not how) found myself upon a very high wall, which rose more than 100 yards into the air, but at the top was not more than a foot in width, and along the middle of it ran an iron battlement of great strength. Now as I passed along I thought I saw one walking before me on the right side of the battlement. When I had followed him a short distance I became aware of another person following me on the other side; but, whether it was a man or a woman I cannot undertake to say. This person hailed me, and said that there was more convenient footing on his side than on mine. This I was quite ready to believe; for the battlement, which was on the middle of the wall, made the path so narrow as to render progress extremely difficult at such a great height, indeed, I noticed that some of those who followed me actually fell. Therefore I got over the battlement on to the other side, and proceeded to the end of the wall, which presented a most\n\np. 44\n\ndifficult and dangerous descent. Then I was sorry that I had deserted my own side, as I could neither advance nor retreat. But, remembering that fortune befriends the bold, I attempted the descent, and by using my hands and feet, I got down safely. Now when I had advanced a little further, I put away all thought of danger, and forgot all about the wall and the battlement. Then lighting upon a certain place, I found white and red roses, but the latter were more abundant; so I gathered some of them and stuck them in my cap. In that place were some most beautiful women, and in the neighbouring garden a number of young men were to be seen. But a wall which surrounded the garden prevented the latter from joining the women. They were eager to do so, but were not allowed to go round the garden and find the gate. The sight moved me to pity, and therefore I hastily went back by the smooth path along which I had come, and soon reached some houses, among which I expected to find the gardener's cottage. But I found there many men, of whom each had his own cell (in very few there were two living together). They were all busily at work, each labouring by himself. Their work was of a kind long and familiarly known to me\u2014indeed, far too well known. So I said to myself: \"Behold, here are many persons at work upon vain and foolish experiments, which have a certain specious plausibility (according to each man's idiosyncrasy), but no, real foundation in Nature. Surely you, too, will obtain forgiveness.\" At least, I would not suffer myself to be detained with these barren futilities, but went on my way. When I reached the gate of the garden some looked askance at me, and I was afraid they would prevent me from carrying out my purpose. Others murmured, and said: \"Look, this fellow presumes to approach the gate of the garden, and we who have spent so many years in these horticultural labours, have never gained admittance! How we will jeer at him if he meets with a repulse.\" But I paid no attention to their talk (for I knew the interior of that garden better than they, although I had never been in it), and approached the gate, which was double-locked, and in which there appeared to be no keyhole, but soon I perceived a keyhole which would have escaped any common observer. So I inserted my master key (called by some \"the adulteress\"), which I had diligently fashioned for the purpose, pushed back\n\np. 45\n\nthe bolt, and entered. After passing this gate, I came upon other bolted gates, which, however, I opened without any difficulty. So I entered the garden, and found in the middle of it a small square garden, which was surrounded with a rose hedge covered with beautiful roses, and as a little rain was falling, and the rays of the sun shone upon it, I beheld a rainbow. But I was hastening past the small garden, to that place where I thought I could aid the young women, when, behold, there came forward the most beautiful of all the maidens, arrayed in silk and satin, with the most beautiful of the youths, dressed in a scarlet robe. They walked arm in arm to the rose garden, and carried many fragrant roses in their hands. I greeted them, and asked how she had got over. \"This my beloved bridegroom,\" she said, \"helped me, and now we are leaving this pleasant garden, and hastening to our chamber to satisfy our love.\" \"I am glad,\" I returned, \"that without any trouble on my part your desires have been fulfilled. But you see how much trouble I have taken on your behalf, having traversed so great a distance in so short a time.\" Then I came to a water-mill, built within of stones, where there were no flour bins or other miller's requisites; yet I saw wheels driven round by the water. I asked the decrepit miller the reason, and he told me the grinding took place somewhere out of view. At the same moment I saw a miller enter that place by a small bridge, and immediately followed him. When I had passed the bridge, which was on the right side of the wheels, I paused and beheld a wonderful sight. In a moment the wheels were above the bridge; I saw very black water, with white drops; the bridge was only about three inches wide; but by clinging to the rails I got safely back, without being wetted at all, and asked the old man how many wheels he had. He answered, \"Ten.\" I was troubled by the marvellous incident, and would gladly have known its meaning, but felt that it was labour lost to ask the old man any questions, and so departed. Before the mill was a raised platform on which some of the aforesaid old men were walking to and fro in the warm sunshine, discussing a letter which they had received from the Faculty of the University. I guessed the tenor of the letter, and, feeling sure that it concerned me, I addressed to them\n\np. 46\n\na question to that effect. \"It does concern you,\" they said, \"the wife whom you married a long time ago, you must keep for ever, or else we must tell our chief.\" \"You need not trouble yourselves about this matter,\" I said, \"for we were born together, and brought up together as children, and now that I have married her, I will never forsake her, but cherish her till her last breath; nay, even death itself shall not sever us.\" \"It is well,\" they said, \"your wife is satisfied, too; you must be joined together.\" \"I am content,\" I said. \"It is well,\" they repeated. \"For thus the Lion will be restored to life, and be more powerful and more active than he was before.\" Then I remembered my labours, and knew by certain signs that this matter concerned not myself, but a very good friend of mine. As these thoughts crossed my mind, I saw our bridegroom and his beloved bride\u2014both clothed in the aforesaid garments\u2014come forward, eager to be joined together. This sight gladdened me; for I had been afraid that the whole matter concerned me. Now when the bridegroom, in his bright scarlet robe, with his bride, whose silk dress gave out shining rays, reached the old men, they were straightway joined together. And I marvelled that the maiden, who was said to be the mother of her bridegroom, was of so youthful an appearance, that she might have seemed his daughter. But I know not what sin they had committed, except that brother and sister had been drawn to each other by such passionate love that they could no more be separated; and, being charged with incest, they were shut up for ever in a close prison, which, however, was as pellucid and transparent as glass, and arched like the heavenly vault, so that all that they did could be seen from without. Here they were to do penance for their sins with ever-flowing tears, and true sorrow. All their clothes and outward ornaments were taken away. None of their servants and friends were allowed to be with them, but after they had received sufficient meat and drink (the latter taken from the aforesaid water), the door was shut and locked, and the seal of the Faculty was affixed to it. I was entrusted with the charge of heating their chamber in the winter, so that they might be neither. too hot nor too cold, and I was further to see that they did not escape. If any accident of any kind happened, I was to be severely punished. I did not like this\n\np. 47\n\ncharge; and, as I remembered that the matter was most important, and that the College of Sages were not wont to say what they did not mean, I was filled with fear. But since I had to bear that which I could not alter, and since the chamber was situated in a strong tower, and surrounded with battlements and lofty walls, and, moreover, could be easily heated with a gentle and continuous fire, I called upon God for help, and began to heat the chamber. But what happened? As soon as they felt the grateful warmth, they fell to embracing each other so passionately that the husband's heart was melted with the excessive ardour of love, and he fell down broken in many pieces. When she who loved him no less than he loved her, saw this, she wept for him, and, as it were, covered him with overflowing tears, until he was quite flooded and concealed from view. But those complaints and tears did not last long, for being weary with exceeding sorrow, she at length destroyed herself. Alas! what fear and anguish fell upon me, when I saw those who had been so straitly committed to my charge, lying, as it were, melted and dead before me. I felt sure that I should be put to death for it; but the jeers, the derision, and the contempt which I would have to undergo seemed more grievous even than death. In this anxious state of mind I spent several days, until the thought occurred to me that, if Medea had restored a dead body to life, I might perhaps be able to do the same. But I could think of no better plan than to keep up the warmth of the chamber until the water should have evaporated, and the dead bodies of the lovers could again be seen. I doubted not that then I should most honourably escape from all danger. So I kept up the fire forty days, the water diminishing from day to day, and the dead bodies beginning to reappear. Now, however, they looked as black as coals. This effect would have been produced sooner if the chamber had not been so closely shut and sealed so that I could in no wise open it. For I noticed that the water rose to the roof of the chamber, and then came down again like rain; but it could find no exit from the chamber, until the dead bodies had putrefied and began to give out a grievous smell. In the meantime the rays of the sun, shining upon the moisture of the chamber, produced a most beautiful rainbow; and, after all my sorrow, the sight of its gay\n\np. 48\n\ncolours filled me with great delight; and I was particularly pleased to see my lovers lying before me. But as there is no joy without a drop of bitterness, so I was still disturbed by the thought that those who had been committed to my care were still lying lifeless. Nevertheless, I comforted myself with the reflection that the chamber (being so tightly closed) must still contain their souls and spirits. Therefore I continued diligently to perform my office of warming them, being assured that they would not return to their bodies while they could enjoy that moist atmosphere. This conjecture was justified by the event. For towards evening I noticed that many vapours rose from the earth through the heat of the sun, and were lifted up as water is attracted by the sun; afterwards when night fell, they watered the earth as fertilising dew, and washed our bodies, which became more beautiful and white the oftener this sprinkling took place. And the whiter they became, the more the quantity of moisture in the air diminished, until at last the atmosphere was too thin for the spirit and soul to remain therein any longer; so they were at length compelled to return to the clarified body of the Queen, which (to my great joy) was straightway restored to life. My joy was all the greater, because now she was arrayed in a beautiful and magnificent garment such as is rarely seen by mortal eye, and had a glorious crown, all made of diamonds, upon her head. Thus attired, she stood upon her feet and cried: \"Know this, ye mortals, and let it enter your hearts, that the most High God is one God, who has power to set up and pull down kings. He makes rich and poor as He, wills. He has killed, and raised again. I was great, and was brought low; but now, having been humbled, I have been made Queen of many more kingdoms. After death life has been restored to me. When I was poor, the treasures of the wise and mighty were committed to me. Therefore I, too, can make the poor rich, give grace to the humble, and restore the health of the sick. But I am not yet able to raise my beloved brother, the most mighty King, from the dead. Nevertheless, when he comes, he will show that my words are true.\" When she had thus spoken the sun lighted up the world with his glorious rays, and the heat waxed great (for the dog days were approaching). Long before this, garments of rich black silk, of grey or ash-coloured damask,\n\np. 49\n\nof rare white silk, embroidered with silver, precious pearls, and brilliant diamonds, had been got ready towards the marriage of our Queen; and now garments of many colours, of flesh colour, orange, and saffron, and of red and scarlet silk, richly embroidered with rubies and carbuncles, were being prepared for the adornment of our new King. But there was no one to be seen working at those garments; yet one after another was got ready, insomuch that I greatly marvelled, because I knew that none but the bride and the bridegroom had entered the chamber. My wonder increased when I observed that as each dress was finished, those that had been there before straightway vanished, though I could see no one put them away. Now when that most precious scarlet garment had been finished, the great and mighty King appeared in great splendour and indescribable magnificence, and when he saw that he was shut in, he besought me, in the most persuasive accents, to open the door, as it would be to my advantage to let him out of the chamber. Now, though I had been most strictly enjoined not to open the chamber, I was filled with awe by the majesty and persuasive speech of the King, and acceded to his request. When he left the chamber, he bore himself so kindly, so gently, and so humbly, that I could not help reflecting that these virtues are the most glorious ornaments of the great. As he had passed the dog days in great heat he was extremely thirsty, spent, and weary; wherefore he humbly requested me to bring him some water from the river where it raged and foamed under the wheels. I gladly acceded to his request, and, after slaking his thirst with a deep draught, he returned to the chamber, requesting me to shut the door carefully so that no one might disturb him or rouse him from his sleep. So he slept a few days, and then called me back to open the door again. He looked much more beautiful, ruddier, and more royal, and said that this water was very precious and full of virtue. When at his request I had fetched him some more, he took a deeper draught than before, insomuch that the size of the chamber seemed to become enlarged. After drinking of this water (which is lightly esteemed by the ignorant) as much as he desired, he became so beautiful and glorious that in all my life I do not remember to have seen a more glorious man, or more glorious deeds. For he took me\n\np. 50\n\ninto his kingdom and showed me all the treasures and riches of the whole world, till I was obliged to confess, that so far from exaggerating his power, the Queen had not told me the half of it. Of gold and precious carbuncles there was no end. There was also to be found renewal and restoration of youth, and of the natural faculties, and recovery of lost health, with a never failing panacea for all diseases. What pleased me most of all, was that the people of that kingdom knew, feared, and honoured their Creator, and asked and obtained of him wisdom, understanding, and, after this life, eternal glory and beatitude. May this latter be given to us also by God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, the Blessed Trinity, to Whom belong praise, glory, and honour, world without end, Amen.Embed"}, {"_type":
