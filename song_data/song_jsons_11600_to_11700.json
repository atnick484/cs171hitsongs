'til you clean off your plate\nSo eat it, don't you tell me you're full\n\n[Chorus]\nJust eat it (Eat it), eat it (Eat it)\nGet yourself an egg and beat it\nHave some more chicken, have some more pie\nIt doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried\nJust eat it (Eat it), just eat it (Eat it)\nJust eat it (Eat it), just eat it (Eat it, woo)\n[Verse 2]\nYour table manners are a cryin' shame\nYou're playin' with your food, this ain't some kind of game\nNow if you starve to death you'll just have yourself to blame\nSo eat it, just eat it (Brr)\nYou better listen, better do what you're told (Woo)\nYou haven't even touched your tuna casserole (Ooh)\nYou better chow down, or it's gonna get cold\nSo eat it, I don't care if you're full\n\n[Chorus]\nJust eat it (Eat it), eat it (Eat it)\nOpen up your mouth and feed it\nHave some more yogurt, have some more Spam\nIt doesn't matter if it's fresh or canned\nJust eat it (Eat it), eat it (Eat it)\nDon't you make me repeat it\nHave a banana,

it's getting cold, reheat it\nHave a big dinner, have a light snack\nIf you don't like it, you can't send it back\nJust eat it (Ooh-hoo, eat it), eat it (Eat it)\nGet yourself an egg and beat it (Oh,

sparklin' wine\nGo and have your fun\nLaugh and sing\nBut while we're apart\nDon't give your heart to anyone\n\n[Chorus]\nJust don't forget who's takin' you home\nAnd in whose arms you're gonna be\nSo darlin', save the last dance for me\n\n[Verse 3]\nBaby, don't you know I love you so?\nCan't you feel it when we touch?\nI will never ever let you go\nI love you  oh so much\n\nYou can dance\nGo and carry on 'til the night is gone\n'Til it's time to go\nIf she asks if you're all alone\nCan she take you home?\nYou got to tell her no\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd don't forget who's takin' you home\nAnd in whose arms you're gonna be\nSo darlin', save the last dance for me\n\n[Chorus]\nJust don't forget who's takin' you home\nAnd in whose arms you're gonna be\nSo darlin', save the last dance for me\nOoh darlin', save the last dance for me\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou can dance\nEvery dance with the one that gives you the eye\nLet him hold you tight\nYou can smile\nEvery smile for the one that holds

to know\nYou're indestructible, always believing\nYou are gold (gold)\nGlad that you're bound to return\nThere's something I could have learned\nYou're indestructible, always believing\n\n[Verse 2]\nAfter the rush has gone\nI hope you find a little more time\nRemember we were partners in crime\nIt's only two years ago\nThe man with the suit and the face\nYou knew that he was there on the case\nNow he's in love with you, he's in love with you\nAnd love is like a high prison wall\nAnd you could leave me standing so tall\n\n[Chorus]\nGold (gold)\nAlways believe in your soul\nYou've got

you\nBe with you night and day\nNothing changes on New Year's Day\nOn New Year's Day\n[Chorus]\nI will be with you again\nI will be with you again\n\n[Verse 2]\nUnder a blood red sky\nA crowd has gathered in black and white\nArms entwined, the chosen few\nThe newspaper says, says\nSay it's true, it's true...\nAnd we can break through\nThough torn in two\nWe can be one\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI, I will begin again\nI, I will begin again\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Bridge]\nOh\nMaybe the time is right\nOh, maybe tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nI will be with you again\nI will be with you again\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nAnd so we're told this is the golden age\nAnd gold is the reason for the wars we wage\nThough I want to be with you\nBe with you night and day\nNothing changes\nOn New Year's

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHe's a rebel and a runner\nHe's a signal turning green\nHe's a restless young romantic\nWants to run the big machine\nHe's got a problem with his poisons\nBut you know he'll find a cure\nHe's cleaning up his systems\nTo keep his nature pure\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLearning to match the beat of the Old World Man\nLearning to catch the heat of the Third World Man\n[Chorus 1]\nHe's got to make his own mistakes\nAnd learn to mend the mess he makes\nHe's old enough to know what's right\nBut young enough not to choose it\nHe's noble enough to win the world\nBut weak enough to lose it\nHe's a New World Man\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe's a radio receiver\nTuned to factories and farms\nHe's a writer and a ranger\nAnd a young boy bearing arms\nHe's got a problem with his power\nWith weapons on patrol\nHe's got to walk a fine line\nAnd keep his self-control\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTrying to save the day for the Old World Man\nTrying to pave the way for the Third World Man\n\n[Chorus 2]\nHe's not concerned with yesterday\nHe knows constant change is here today\nHe's noble enough to know what's right\nBut weak enough not to choose it\nHe's wise enough to win the world\nBut fool enough to lose it\nHe's a New World Man\nYou might also like[Outro]\nLearning to match the beat of the Old World Man\nHe's learning to catch the heat of the Third World Man\n\nHe's a New World Man\nHe's a New World

From somewhere within the wind\ncomes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters\nsinging \"My Favorite Things.\" A series of sepia images of\nanti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after\nanother on the screen.\n\nIn the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title\nFEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:\nTITLE: \"He who makes a beast of himself Gets rid of the pain\nOf being a man.\"\nDr. Johnson\n\nThe VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe were somewhere around Barstow on\nthe edge of the desert when the\ndrugs began to take hold.\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nA red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black\nscreen.\n\nEXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nTHE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred\nmiles an hour.  THE STONES' \"Sympathy For the Devil\" blares.\n\nAT THE WHEEL\n\nSTRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,\nBEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.\nBESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND\nWRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY\nUNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.\n\nThe music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths\nup a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember saying something like:\n\"I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe\nyou should drive...\"\n\nGONZO starts shaving.\n\n2.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSuddenly there was a terrible roar\nall around us and the sky was full\nof what looked like huge bats, all\nswooping and screeching and diving\naround the car...\n\nClose on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The\nreflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close\nto one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... and a voice was screaming: Holy\nJesus!  What are these goddamn\nanimals?\n\nCUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -\n\nDUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.\nGONZO casually looks over...\n\nGONZO\nWhat are you yelling about?\n\nDUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench\nmakes GONZO nick his face with his razor.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's your turn to drive.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNo point mentioning these bats.  I\nthought.  The poor bastard will see\nthem soon enough.\n\nDUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,\nfrantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A\nMOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles\nthrough the impressive stash.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had two bags of grass, seventy-\nfive pellets of mescaline, five\nsheets of high powered blotter\nacid, a salt shaker half full of\ncocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-\ncolored uppers, downers, screamers,\nlaughers... Also a quart of tequila,\na quart of rum, a case of beer, a\npint of raw ether and two dozen\namyls.\n\n3.\n\n\nDUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the\nSHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with\nanother six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives\nback into the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNot that we needed all that for the\ntrip, but once you get locked into\na serious drug collection, the\ntendency is to push it as far as\nyou can.\n\nTHE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,\nweakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A\nBAT?\n\nEXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nIN THE RED SHARK\n\nGONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a\nlousy driver.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only thing that really worried\nme was the ether.  There is nothing\nin the world more helpless and\nirresponsible and depraved than a\nman in the depths of an ether binge.\nAnd I knew we'd get into that\nrotten stuff pretty soon.\n\nThe radio news wars with \"SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL\" on a tape\nrecorder.\n\nRADIO NEWS\nAn overdose of heroin was listed as\nthe official cause of death for\npretty 19 year old Diane Hanby\nwhose body was found stuffed in a\nrefrigerator last week...\n\nGONZO changes the station - \"ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET\nJESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE\" vies with \"SYMPATHY\"... He\nsings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.\nThe RED SHARK fishtails.\n\nGONZO\n\"One toke over the line, sweet\nJesus.\"\n\n4.\n\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nOne toke.  You poor fool.  Wait\ntill you see those goddamn bats.\n\nUP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD\n\nA LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a\nthumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down\nthe road...\n\nGONZO\nLet's give that boy a lift.\n\nGONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side\nof the road.\n\nDUKE\nWe can't stop here - this is bat\ncountry!\n\nGONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The\nHITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHot damn!  I never rode in a\nconvertible before!\n\nThen the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the\nsight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-\nNORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.\n\nDUKE\nIs that right?  Well, I guess\nyou're about ready, eh?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER hesitates.\n\nGONZO\nWe're your friends.  We're not like\nthe others.\n\nDUKE\n(hissing sharply)\nNo more of that talk or I'll put\nthe leeches on you.\n\nDUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.\n\nEXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED\nSHARK screams down the road.\n\n5.\n\n\nGONZO sings along to the tape player.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out\nand taking his chances.\n\nDUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear\nview mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHow long could we maintain, I\nwondered.  How long before one of\nus starts raving and jabbering at\nthis boy?  What will he think then?\nThis same lonely desert was the\nlast known home of the Manson family.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling\ndown GONZO's neck.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWould he make that grim connection\nwhen my attorney starts screaming\nabout bats and huge manta rays\ncoming down on the car?\n\nDUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with\nthe words, sometimes not.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf so - well, we'll just have to\ncut his head off and bury him\nsomewhere.  Because it goes without\nsaying that we can't turn him loose.\nHe'd report us at once to some kind\nof outback Nazi law enforcement\nagency, and they'll run us down\nlike dogs...\n\nDUKE\n(out loud to himself)\nJesus!  Did I say that?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOr just think it?  Was I talking?\nDid they hear me?\n\nGONZO\n(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)\nIt's okay.  He's admiring the shape\nof your skull.\n\nDUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER\ngiggles nervously.\n\n6.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I better have a chat with\nthis boy I thought.  Perhaps if I\nexplain things, he'll rest easy...\n\nDUKE\n(roaring over the\nroad noise)\nTHERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD\nPROBABLY UNDERSTAND --\n\nThe HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.\n\nDUKE\n(yells)\nCAN YOU HEAR ME?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs\ninto the back seat.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  Because I want you to\nhave all the background.  This is a\nvery ominous assignment -- with\novertones of extreme personal\ndanger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!\nThis is important, goddamnit!  This\nis a true story!...\n(WHACKS the BACK OF\nTHE DRIVER'S SEAT\nwith his fist)\n\n\nThe CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.\n\nGONZO\n(screams)\nKeep your hands off my fucking neck!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS\nHIM BACK DOWN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur vibrations were getting nasty --\nbut why?  Was there no communication\nin this car?  Had we deteriorated\nto the level of dumb beasts?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.\n\n7.\n\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nI want you to understand that this\nman at the wheel is my attorney!\nHe's not just some dingbat I found\non the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I\nthink he's probably Samoan.  But it\ndoesn't matter, does it?  Are you\nprejudiced?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHell, no!\n\nDUKE\nI didn't think so.  Because in\nspite of his race, this man is\nextremely valuable to me.  Hell, I\nforgot all about this beer.  You\nwant one?\n(HITCHHIKER shakes\nhis head)\nHow about some ether?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nWhat?\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  Let's get right to the\nheart of this thing.  Twenty-four\nhours ago we were sitting in the\nPogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills\nHotel...\n\nINT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY\n\nA uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE\nthrough the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They\nare the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL\nBOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore\nSlings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED\nVERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... in the patio section, of\ncourse, drinking Singapore Slings\nwith mescal on the side, hiding\nfrom the brutish realities of this\nfoul year of Our Lord, 1971.\n\nThe DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and\nshades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank\ntop undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious\nconversation.\n\n8.\n\n\nDUKE\nI'm telling you, the Salazar story\nis getting too complicated.  The\nweasels have started closing in.\n\nThe DWARF sneers.\n\nDWARF\nPerhaps this is the call you've\nbeen waiting for all this time,\nsir...\n\nDUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...\n\nDUKE\nUh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...\n\nDUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A\nMOVIE SPY.\n\nDWARF\nThat was headquarters.  They want\nme to go to Las Vegas at once and\nmake contact with a Portuguese\nphotographer named Lacerda.  He'll\nhave the details.  All I have to do\nis check into my sound proof suite\nand he'll seek me out.\n\nGONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!\n\nGONZO\nGod hell!  I think I see the\npattern!  This one sounds like real\ntrouble!  You're going to need\nplenty of legal advice before this\nthing is over.  As your attorney I\nmust advise you that you'll need a\nvery fast car with no top and after\nthat, the cocaine.  And then the\ntape recorder, for special music,\nand some Acapulco shirts...\n(GONZO tucks his\nkhaki undershirt into\nhis white\nbellbottoms -- he\nmeans business!)\nThis blows my weekend, because\nnaturally I'll have to go with\nyou -- and we'll have to arm\nourselves.\n\n9.\n\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  If a thing's worth doing,\nit's worth doing right.\n\nDUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them\nwith the (very large) check in his hand.\n\nThey sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it\nswinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.\n\nDUKE\nI tell you, my man.  This is the\nAmerican Dream in action!  We'd be\nfools not to ride this strange\ntorpedo all the way to the end.\n\nGONZO\nIndeed.  We must do it.  What kind\nof story is this?\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO emerge.\n\nDUKE\nThe Mint 400!  The richest off-road\nrace for motorcycles and dune-\nbuggies in the history of organized\nsport!\n(handing parking\nticket to Valet)\n-- a fantastic spectacle in honor\nof some fatback grossero who owns\nthe luxurious Mint Hotel in the\nheart of downtown Vegas... at least\nthat's what the press release says.\n\nTheir car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They\njump in.\n\nDUKE\nWe're going to have to drum it up\non our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.\n\nAnd they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-\nbleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY\n\nThe PINTO races through shot.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nGetting hold of the drugs and\nshirts had been no problem...\n\n10.\n\n\nEXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nThe PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back\nwindow full of Hawaiian shirts.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n... but the car and tape recorder\nwere not easy things to round up at\n6:30 on a Friday afternoon in\nHollywood.\n\nINT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nTORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile\nas GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four\nSingapore Slings.\n\nGONZO\nO.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.\nWe'll be there in thirty minutes.\n(to DUKE -- hand over\nthe PHONE)\nI finally located a car with\nadequate horsepower and the proper\ncoloring.\n(into PHONE)\nWhat?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has\na major credit card!  Do you\nrealize who the fuck you're talking\nto?\n\nDUKE\nDon't take any guff from these\nswine.\n(GONZO slams the\nphone down)\nNow we need a sound store with the\nfinest equipment.  Nothing dinky.\nOne of those new Belgian Heliowatts\nwith a voice-activated shotgun\nmike, for picking up conversations\nin oncoming cars.\n\nGONZO\nWe won't make the nut unless we\nhave unlimited credit.\n\nDUKE\nWe will.  You Samoans are all the\nsame.  You have no faith in the\nessential decency of the white\nman's culture.\n\n11.\n\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK\n\nThe PINTO races down street.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe store was closed, but the\nsalesman said he would wait, if we\nhurried...\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK\n\nThey're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE\nBANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut we were delayed en route when a\nStingray in front of us killed a\npedestrain.\n\nDirectly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered\ncorpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.\n\nEXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had trouble, again, at the car\nrental agency.\n\nBehind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with\nsatisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out\na clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.\n\nAGENT\nSay... uh... you fellas are going\nto be careful with this car, aren't\nyou?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.\n\nDUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the\ngas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.\n\nAGENT\nWell, good god!  You just backed\nover that two foot concrete abutment\nand you didn't even slow down!\nForty-five in reverse!  And you\nbarely missed the pump!\n\nDUKE\nNo harm done.  I always test the\ntransmission that way.  The rear\nend.  For stress factors.\n\n12.\n\n\nGONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box\nof rum and ice into the RED SHARK.\n\nAGENT\nSay.  Are you fellows drinking?\n\nDUKE\nNot me.  We're responsible people.\n\nHe JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The\nAGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.\n\nGONZO\nThere's another worrier.  He's\nprobably all cranked up on speed.\n\nEXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nSTRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted\nfigures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe spent the rest of that night\nrounding up materials and packing\nthe car.  Then we ate some mescaline\nand went swimming.\n\nThe surf crashes in the distance...\n\nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT\n\nDUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself\nfloat up through the silvery bubbles...\n\nDUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING\nMOONLIT SURF.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur trip was different.  It was to\nbe a classic affirmation of\neverything right and true in the\nnational character; a gross,\nphysical salute to the fantastic\npossibilities of life in this\ncountry.  But only for those with\ntrue grit...\n\nEXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE's intense face.\n\nDUKE\n...and we're chock full of that!\n\n13.\n\n\nGONZO\nDamn right!\n\nDUKE\nMy attorney understands this\nconcept, despite his racial handicap.\nBut do you?!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHe said he understood, but I could\nsee in his eyes that he didn't.  He\nwas lying to me.\n\nGONZO\nMy heart!\n\nGONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and\nscreeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nWhere's the medicine?\n\nDUKE\nThe medicine?  Yes, it's right here.\n\nDUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry, this man has a bad\nheart... Angina Pectoris.  But we\nhave a cure for it.\n\nDUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO\nfalls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The\nHITCHHIKER looks petrified.\n\nGONZO\n(suddenly flailing\nhis naked arms at the sky)\nTurn up the fucking music!  My\nheart feels like an alligator!\nVolume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must\nhave bass!  What's wrong with us?\nAre you goddamn old ladies?\n\nDUKE\n(turns up music to\nfull volume)\nYou scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch\nyour language!  You're talking to a\nDoctor of Journalism!\n\n14.\n\n\nGONZO\n(laughing uncontrollably)\nWhat the fuck are we doing out here?\nSomebody call the police!  We need\nhelp!\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nPay no attention to this swine.  He\ncan't handle the medicine.\n(he begins laughing)\n\n\nGONZO\n(to the HITCHHIKER)\nThe truth is we're going to Vegas\nto croak a scag baron named Savage\nHenry.  I've known him for years\nbut he ripped us off -- and you\nknow what that means, right?\n\nGONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nSavage Henry has cashed his check!\nWe're going to rip his lungs out!\n\nDUKE\nAnd eat them!  That bastard won't\nget away with this!  What's going\non in this country when a scum\nsucker like that can get away with\nsandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?\n\nGONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,\nAND FLEES.\n\nHITCHHIKER\nThanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot.\nI like you guys.  Don't worry about\nme.\n\nDUKE\n(yells)\nWait a minute!  Come back and have\na beer!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.\n\n15.\n\n\nGONZO\nGood riddance.  That boy made me\nnervous.  Did you see his eyes?\n(laughing)\nJesus, this is good medicine.\n\nDUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.\n\nDUKE\n(suddenly clambering\ninto the front seat)\nMove over!!  We have to get out of\nCalifornia before that kid finds a\ncop!\n\nDUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...\n\nEXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nTHE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead\ndriving.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was absolutely imperative that\nwe get to the Mint Hotel before the\ndeadline for press registration.\nOtherwise, we might have to pay for\nour suite.\n\nGONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off\nand the powder swirls away on the wind.\n\nGONZO\nOh, Jesus!  Did you see what god\njust did to us?\n\nDUKE\nGod didn't do that!  You did it!\nYou're a fucking narcotics agent,\nthat was our cocaine, you pig!\n\nGONZO\n(waving his .357\nMagnum at Duke)\nYou better be careful.  Plenty of\nvultures out here.  They'll pick\nyour bones clean before morning.\n\nDUKE\nYou whore!\n\nGONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.\n\n16.\n\n\nGONZO\nHere -- chew this.  It's your half\nof the acid.\n\nDUKE takes his half -- chews it.\n\nDUKE\nHow long do I have?\n\nGONZO\nMaybe thirty more minutes.  As your\nattorney, I advise you to drive at\ntop speed.  It'll be a goddamn\nmiracle if we can get there before\nyou turn into a wild animal.  Are\nyou ready for that?  Checking into\na Vegas hotel under a phony name\nwith intent to commit capital fraud\nand a head full of acid.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThirty minutes.  It was going to be\nvery close.\n\nThe RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:\n\"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \\ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20\nYEARS; SALE - LIFE!!\"\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK\n\nThe RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner\nspanning the street announces the MINT 400.\n\nDUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a\nbuckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the\nTICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.\n\nDUKE\nI need this, right?\n\nATTENDANT\nI'll remember your face.\n\nDUKE stares -- losing it...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere is no way of explaining the\nterror I felt.\n\nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\nDUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP\nENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to\nqueue jump and failing.\n\n17.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI was pouring sweat.  My blood is\ntoo thick for Nevada.  I've never\nbeen able to properly explain\nmyself in this climate.\n\nA COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes\nfixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nBe quiet, be calm... name, rank,\nand press affiliation, nothing\nelse...\n\nDUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the\ntension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING\nAROUND -- absolutely no success.\n\nSomething catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his\neyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET\nWHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE\nINEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS...\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n...ignore this terrible drug,\npretend it's not happening...\n\nThe LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE\ncomes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK... AND\nEXPLODES!\n\nDUKE\nHI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL\nDUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S\nFOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL\nWISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT?\nI HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I\nREALIZE OF COURSE...\n\nAs DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH.\nHe tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER.\n\nDUKE\n... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE\nLIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE.\nYES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND\nYOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S\nTHE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT?\n\nDUKE sags -- grips the desk -- WHITE KNUCKLES.\n\n18.\n\n\nRESERVATIONS CLERK\n(hands him an envelope)\nYour suite's not ready yet.  But\nthere's somebody looking for you.\n\nHer face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING...\n\nDUKE\n(shouts)\nNO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING\nYET!\n\nThe FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS.\nDEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm\nintensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.\n\nGONZO\nI can handle this.  This man has a\nbad heart, but I have plenty of\nmedicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo.\nPrepare our suite at once.  We'll\nbe in the bar.\n\nGONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks\nback -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green\njowls and fangs.\n\nINT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY\n\nThe bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme.\nDUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the\nwall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone...\n\nGONZO\n(to the bartender)\nTwo Cuba Libres with beer and\nmescal on the side.\n(opens the envelope)\nWho's Lacerda, he's waiting for us\nin a room on the twelfth floor?\n\nDUKE\nLacerda?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI couldn't remember.  The name rang\na bell, but I couldn't concentrate.\nTerrible things were happening all\naround us...\n\nDUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY\nonto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low.\n\n19.\n\n\nDUKE\nOrder some golf shoes.  Otherwise,\nwe'll never get out of this place\nalive.  It's impossible to walk in\nthis muck -- no footing at all...\n\nDUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.\n\nDUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED\ninto a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND\nGNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI was right in the middle of a\nfucking reptile zoo.  And somebody\nwas giving booze to these goddamn\nthings!  It won't be long before\nthey tear us to shreds!\n\nGONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER.\n\nGONZO\nIf you think we're in trouble now\nwait until you see what's happening\nin the elevators.\n\nGONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying...\nas he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to\nkeep him in his line of vision.\n\nGONZO\nI just went upstairs to see this\nman Lacerda.  I told him I knew\nwhat he was up to...\n(GONZO rallies --\nturns fierce)\nHe says he's a photographer!  But\nwhen I mentioned Savage Henry he\nfreaked!  He knows we're onto him!\n\nDUKE\nBut what about our room?  And the\ngolf shoes?\n\nA GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at\nthem, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\n(grabbing GONZO\ntrying to hold him still)\nHoly shit!  Look at that bunch over\nthere!  They've spotted us!\n\n20.\n\n\nCut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing\nnext to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality.\nGONZO is sitting in his original position.\n\nGONZO\n(downs his drink --\ngets up)\nThat's the press table.  Where you\nhave to sign in for our credentials.\nShit, let's get it over with.  You\nhandle that, and I'll check on the\nroom.\n\nDUKE\nNo, no.  Don't leave me!\n\nBlack screen.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK\n\nA TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK,\nprotesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous\nBELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on\nthe floor next to DUKE.\n\nBELL BOY\nFour club sandwiches, four shrimp\ncocktails.\n\nDUKE\nThere's a big... machine in the\nsky... some kind of electric snake...\n\nDUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon\nsign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million\ncolored lights.\n\nBELL BOY\n... a quart of rum...\n\nDUKE\n... coming straight at us.\n\nGONZO\nShoot it.\n\nDUKE\nNot yet.  I want to study its habits.\n\nBELL BOY\n... and nine fresh grapefruit.\n\n21.\n\n\nGONZO\nVitamin C.  We'll need all we can\nget.\n\nGONZO sees the BELL BOY out the door -- turns and lays into\nDUKE.\n\nGONZO\nLook, you've got to stop this talk\nabout snakes and leeches and\nlizards and that stuff.  It's\nmaking me sick!\n\nDUKE stares -- hears the drone of B52 BOMBERS...\n\nOn TV: The LAOS INVASION -- A SERIES OF HORRIFYING\nDISASTERS -- EXPLOSIONS AND TWISTED WRECKAGE.\n\nNewsreel footage of MAI LAI MASSACRE and the LIEUTENANT\nCALLEY court-martial.\n\nDUKE\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nGONZO\nYou bastard!  They'll never let us\nback in that place.  I leave you\nalone for three minutes and you\nstart waving that goddamn marlin\nspike around -- yelling about\nreptiles!  You scared the shit out\nof those people!  They were ready\nto call the cops.  Hell, the only\nreason they gave us press passes\nwas to get you out of there...\n\nA knock at the door.  DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat.\n\nDUKE\nOh my God!  Who's that?!\n\nGONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to\nLACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM.  GONZO stares\nat a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep\nsuspicion.\n\nLACERDA\nDuke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer.\nGot your press passes?  Good, good.\nToo bad you missed the bikes\nchecking in.  My, what a sight!\n\nDUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS.\n\n22.\n\n\nLooking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the\nBOMBS EXPLODE like vicious flowers.\n\nDUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised,\nfilthy and blood spattered.  LACERDA approaches him --\ntalking a foreign language.\n\nLACERDA\nHusquavarnas.  Yamahas.  Kawaskis.\nMaicos.  Pursang.  Swedish Fireballs.\nCouple of Triumphs, here and there\na CZ.  All very fast.  What a race\nit's gonna be.\n\nDUKE screws up his eyes -- WILLS NORMALITY BACK.  LACERDA is\nnow just a keen photographer.L\n\nLACERDA\nWell, we start at dawn.  Get a good\nnight's sleep.  I know I will.\n\nAnd with a cheerful wave, he's gone.  DUKE is in shock.\n\nDUKE\n(weakly)\nThat's good...\n\nGONZO\nI think he's lying to us.  I could\nsee it in his eyes.\n\nDUKE\n(even weaker)\nThey'll probably have a big net for\nus when we show up.\n\nDUKE's attention returns to the devastation on the TV...\n\nGONZO\nTurn that shit off!\n\nGONZO kills the TV.\n\nBlack screen.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNever lose sight of the primary\nresponsibility.  Cover the story.\nBut what was the story?  Nobody had\nbothered to say.\n\n23.\n\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAWN\n\nAgainst A BIG ORANGE SUN, on a concrete slab, MEN FIRE\nSHOTGUNS into the dawn sky.

Get back in that\ntub!\n\nGONZO\nBack the tape up.  I need it again!\nLet it roll!  Just as high as the\nfucker can go!  And when it comes\nto that fantastic note where the\nrabbit bites its own head off, I\nwant you to THROW THAT FUCKING\nRADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!\n\nDUKE stares down at GONZO.\n\nDUKE\nNot me.  It would blast you through\nthe wall -- stone dead in ten\nseconds and they'd make me explain\nit!\n\nGONZO\nBULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.\n\nHIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.\n\nDUKE\nJesus.\n\nGONZO\nDo it!  I want to get HIGHER!\n\nDUKE considers this.  He's had enough.\n\n47.\n\n\nDUKE\nOkay.  You're right.  This is\nprobably the only solution.\n(holds the PLUGGED IN\nTAPE/RADIO over the tub)\nLet me make sure I have it all\nlined up.  You want me to throw\nthis thing into the tub when \"WHITE\nRABBIT\" peaks.  Is that it?\n\nGONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.\n\nGONZO\nFuck yes.  I was beginning to think\nI was going to have to go out and\nget one of the goddamn maids to do\nit.\n\nDUKE\nAre you ready?\n\nHe switches \"WHITE RABBIT\" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS\nAND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.\n\nMeanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a\ngood two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when \"WHITE\nRABBIT\" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.\n\nGONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A\nTIDAL WAVE.\n\nDUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF\nTHE BATHROOM.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE slumps onto the sofa.\n\nSILENCE.\n\nGONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE\nWAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at\nDUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.\n\nDUKE\nMACE!  YOU WANT THIS?\n\nGONZO stops -- hisses.\n\nGONZO\nYou bastard!  You'd do that,\nwouldn't you?\n\n48.\n\n\nDUKE\n(laughs)\nWhy worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing\nin the world like a Mace high.\nForty-five minutes on your knees\nwith the dry heaves...\n\nGONZO\nYou cheap honky sonofabitch...\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  Hell, just a minute ago,\nyou were asking me to kill you!\nAnd now you want to kill me!  What\nI should do, goddamnit, is call the\npolice!\n\nGONZO\nThe cops?\n\nDUKE\nThere's no choice.  I wouldn't dare\ngo to sleep with you wandering\naround with a head full of acid and\nwanting to slice me up with that\ngoddamn knife!\n\nGONZO\n(mumbles)\nWho said anything about slicing you\nup?  I just wanted to carve a\nlittle Z on your forehead.  Nothing\nserious.\n\nGONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.\n\nDUKE\n(menaces him with the MACE)\nGet back in that tub.  Eat some\nreds and try to calm down.  Smoke\nsome grass, shoot some smack --\nshit, do whatever you have to do,\nbut let me get some rest.\n\nGONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.\n\nGONZO\nHell, yes.  You really need some\nsleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn.\nWhat a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't\nlet me keep you up.\n\n49.\n\n\nGONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair\nup against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next\nto the clock.\n\nDUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He\ncollapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIgnore the nightmare in the bathroom.\nJust another ugly refugee from the\nLove Generation.\n\nThe WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his\nface.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL\nBEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney had never been able to\naccept the notion -- often espoused\nby former drug abusers -- that you\ncan get a lot higher without drugs\nthan with them.  And neither have\nI, for that matter.\n\nThe pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL\nLIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the\nforeground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior\nof A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.\n\nINT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT\n\nA slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the\naction is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI recall one night in the Matrix.\nThere I was -- a victim of the Drug\nExplosion.  A natural street freak,\njust eating whatever came by.\n\nA ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The\nsound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.\n\nROAD-PERSON\nAnybody want some L...S...D...?  I\ngot all the makin's right here.\nAll I need is a place to cook.\n\nThe camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.\n\nINT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nStill in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a\nHUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.\n\n50.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI decided to eat only half at first.\nGood thinking.  But I spilled the\nrest on the sleeve of my red\nPendleton shirt.\n\nDUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the\ndoor to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in\nslow-motion.\n\nMUSICIAN\nWhat's the trouble?\n\nDUKE\n(also in slow-motion)\nWell, all this white stuff on my\nsleeve is LSD.\n\nThe MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A\nlong pause.\n\nCut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-\ncut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.\nWe cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the\nmen's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...\nsucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The\nSTOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWith a bit of luck his life was\nruined -- forever thinking that\njust behind some narrow door in all\nhis favorite bars, men in red\nPendleton shirts are getting\nincredible kicks from things he'll\nnever know.\n\nINT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT\n\nThe STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking\nlost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a\nTV white noise snowstorm.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE sits staring at the TV.\n\n51.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStrange memories on this nervous\nnight in Las Vegas.\n(he gets up, pours\nhimself a drink)\nHas it been five years?  Six?  It\nseems like a lifetime -- the kind\nof peak that never comes again.\nSan Francisco in the middle sixties\nwas a very special time and place\nto be a part of.  But no\nexplanation, no mix of words or\nmusic or memories can touch that\nsense of knowing that you were\nthere and alive in that corner of\ntime and the world.  Whatever it\nmeant.\n\nDUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.\n\nEXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE\n\nWe are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nTHERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,\nAT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE\nSPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A\nFANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT\nWHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,\nTHAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I\nTHINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE\nOF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE\nFORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY\nMEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T\nNEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY\nprevail.  We had all the momentum;\nwe were riding the crest of a high\nand beautiful wave...\n\nDUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE\nNEVER SEEN BEFORE.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSo now, less than five years later,\nyou can go up on a steep hill in\nLas Vegas and look west, and with\nthe right kind of eyes you can\nalmost see the high water mark --\nthat place where the wave finally\nbroke and rolled back.\n\n52.\n\n\nThe memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.\nSuddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi\nshouting \"WOODSTOCK \u00dcBER ALLES!\"\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN\n\nA harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking\nlike shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe decision to flee came suddenly.\nOr maybe not.\n\nDUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of\nfruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.\n\nBELL BOY\nRoom service!\n\nThe BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already\nstacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I'd planned it all along --\nsubconsciously waiting for the\nright moment.  The bill was a\nfactor, I think.  Because I had no\nmoney to pay for it.\n\nDUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur room service tabs had been\nrunning somewhere between $29 and\n$36 per hour, for forty-eight\nconsecutive hours.  Incredible.\nHow could it happen?\n\nDUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED\nLUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --\nempty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut by the time I asked this\nquestion, there was no one around\nto answer.\n\nDUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.\n\n53.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney was gone.  He must have\nsensed trouble.\n\nQUICK CUT TO:\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY\n\nGONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of\nbrand-new fine cowhide luggage.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nPanic.\n\nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --\nleaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both\nways, then hurries away down the corridor.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt crept up my spine like first\nrising vibes of an acid frenzy.\nAll these horrible realities began\nto dawn on me.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY\n\nAn anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the\nelevator descends.  He searches his pockets...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHere I was, alone in Las Vegas,\nwith this goddamned incredibly\nexpensive car, completely twisted\non drugs, no cash, no story for the\nmagazine.  And on top of everything\nelse I had a gigantic goddamn hotel\nbill to deal with.\n\nDUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.\n\nThe door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN\nHANDCUFFS.\n\nDUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors\nclose.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI didn't even know who had won the\nrace.  Maybe nobody.\n\n54.\n\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\nDUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering\nMANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nHow would Horatio Alger have\nhandled this situation?\n\nEXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY\n\nMotoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN\nwith a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves\nat the CAR BOY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a\nrelatively respectable citizen -- a\nmultiple felon, perhaps, but\ncertainly not dangerous.\n\nThe CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The\nback seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint\n400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nLuckily, I had taken the soap and\ngrapefruit and other luggage out to\nthe car a few hours earlier.  Now\nit was only a matter of slipping\nthe noose...\n\nDUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMR. DUKE!\n\nDUKE freezes.\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMr. Duke!  We've been looking for\nyou!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe game was up!  They had me.\n\nDUKE\n(to himself)\nWell, why not?  Many fine books\nhave been written in prison.\n\n55.\n\n\nResigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK\narrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS\nHAND.\n\nCLERK\nSir?\n(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)\nThis telegram came for you.\nActually, it isn't for you.  It's\nfor somebody named Thompson, but it\nsays 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does\nthat make sense?\n\nDUKE\n(barely able to speak)\nYes... It makes sense.\n\nDUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.\n\nThe CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous\nstash inside.\n\nCLERK\nI checked the register for this man\nThompson.  We don't show him but I\nfigured he might be part of your\nteam.\n\nDUKE\nHe is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to\nhim.\n\nHe fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.\n\nSECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word\nor two.\n\nCLERK\nWhat confused us was Dr. Gonzo's\nsignature on the telegram from Los\nAngeles.  When we knew he was right\nhere in the hotel.\n\nDUKE\nYou did the right thing.  Never try\nto understand a press message.\nAbout half the time we use codes --\nespecially with Dr. Gonzo.\n\nCLERK\nTell me.  When will the doctor be\nawake?\n\n56.\n\n\nDUKE\n(tenses)\nAwake?  What do you mean?\n\nDUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.\n\nCLERK\n(uncomfortably)\nWell... the manager, Mr. Heem,\nwould like to meet him.  Nothing\nunusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet\nall our large accounts... put them\non a personal basis... just a chat\nand a handshake, you understand.\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  But if I were you, I'd\nleave the Doctor alone until after\nhe's eaten breakfast.  He's a very\ncrude man.\n\nDUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.\n\nCLERK\nBut he will be available?  Perhaps\nlater this morning?\n\nDUKE\nLook.  That telegram was all\nscrambled.  It was actually from\nThompson, not to him.  Western\nUnion must have gotten the names\nreversed.  I have to get going.  I\nhave to get out to the track.\n\nCLERK\nThere's no hurry!  The race is over!\n\nDUKE\n(taking off)\nNot for me.\n\nHe waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.\n\nCLERK\nLet's have lunch!\n\nDUKE\nRighto!\n\nEXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.\n\n57.\n\n\nA \"YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS\" sign flashes past.\n\nBob Dylan plays: \"Memphis Blues Again -- \"Aaww, Mama, can\nthis really by the end...?\"\n\nA sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nJesus, bad waves of paranoia,\nmadness, fear and loathing --\nintolerable vibrations in this\nplace.  Get out!  The weasels were\nclosing in.  I could smell the ugly\nbrutes.  Flee!\n\nDUKE drives fast.\n\nDUKE\nDo me one last favor Lord: just\ngive me five more high-speed hours\nbefore you bring the hammer down;\njust let me get rid of this goddamn\ncar and off of this horrible desert.\n\nA sign flashes \"YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.\"\n\nA patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nYou evil bastard!  This is your\nwork!  You'd better take care of\nme, Lord... because if you don't\nyou're going to have me on your\nhands.\n\nThe patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nFew people understand the psychology\nof dealing with a Highway Traffic\nCop.  Your normal speeder will\npanic and immediately pull over to\nthe side.  This is wrong.\n\nDUKE floors the gas pedal.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt arouses contempt in the cop heart.\n\nTHE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.\n\n58.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMake the bastard chase you.  He\nwill follow.  But he won't know\nwhat to make of your blinker signal\nthat says you're about to turn right.\n\nDUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThis is to let him know you're\nlooking for a proper place to pull\noff and talk.\n\nAN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.\n\nDUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt will take him a moment to\nrealize that he is about to make\n180 degree turn at speed... but you\nwill be ready for it, braced for\nthe G's and the fast heel toe work.\n\nThe patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.\n\nEXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY\n\nThe patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE\nstands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nJust what the FUCK did you think\nyou were doing?!\n\nDUKE smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nMay I see your license.\n\nDUKE\nOf course, officer.\n\nDUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer\ncan -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI knew I was fucked.\n\nThe COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for\nDUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.\n\n59.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nCould I have that, please?\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  It was getting warm anyway.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --\nglances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars\nof soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou realize...\n\nDUKE\nYeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I\nunderstand that.  I knew it was a\ncrime but I did it anyway.  Shit,\nwhy argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nThat's a strange attitude.\n\nHe looks at DUKE thoughtfully.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou know -- I get the feeling you\ncould use a nap.  There's a rest\narea up ahead.  Why don't you pull\nover and sleep a few hours?\n\nDUKE\nA nap won't help.  I've been awake\nfor too long -- three or four\nnights.  I can't even remember.  If\nI go to sleep now, I'm dead for\ntwenty hours.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nOkay.  Here's how it is.  What goes\ninto my book, as of noon, is that I\napprehended you... for driving too\nfast, and advised you to proceed no\nfurther than the next rest area...\nyour stated destination, right?\nWhere you plan to take a long nap.\nDo I make myself clear?\n\nDUKE\nHow far is Baker?  I was hoping to\nstop there for lunch.\n\n60.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nNot my jurisdiction.  The city\nlimits are two point two miles\nbeyond the rest area.  Can you make\nit that far?\n\nDUKE\nI'll try.  I've been wanting to go\nto Baker for a long time.  I've\nheard a lot about it.\n\nThe PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nExcellent seafood.  With a mind\nlike yours, you'll probably want to\ntry the land-crab.  Try the Majestic\nDiner.\n\nThe PATROLMAN slams the door shut.\n\nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY\n\nDUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt raped.  The Pig had done me\non all fronts, and now he was going\noff to chuckle about it -- on the\nwest side of town, waiting for me\nto make a run for L.A.\n\nDUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he\nsignals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn\nhe sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn\ntheir eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER\ndrops his thumb.\n\nDUKE\nGreat Jesus, it's him.\n\nDUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE\nWAY HE CAME.\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.\n\nDUKE\nThey've nailed me!  I'm trapped in\nsome stinking desert crossroads\ncalled Baker.  I don't have much\ntime.  The fuckers are closing in.\nThey'll hunt me down like a beast!\n\n61.\n\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.

BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE screams -- sweat pouring.\n\nDUKE\nYou bastard!  I need a lawyer\nimmediately!\n\nINT.

BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.\n\nGONZO'S VOICE\nYou brainless scumbag!  You're\nsupposed to be covering the National\nDistrict Attorney's conference!  I\nmade all the reservations... rented\na white Cadillac convertible... the\nwhole thing is arranged!  What the\nhell are you doing out there in the\nmiddle of the fucking desert?\n\n62.\n\n\nDUKE stares at the telegram.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's all a big joke.\nI'm actually sitting beside the\npool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking\nfrom a portable phone.  Some dwarf\nbrought it out from the casino.  I\nhave total credit!  Can you grasp\nthat?\n(shouts)\nDon't come anywhere near this place!\nForeigners aren't welcome here!\n\nDUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAY\n\nC/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWell.

I\nunderstood this now...\n(another blast from\nthe gun)\n... and with understanding came a\nsense of almost terminal relief.\n\nDUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the\nthuds of the explosions echo away.\n\nEXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.\n\n63.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI had to get rid of The Shark.

The rear\nwindows leapt up with a touch like\nfrogs in a dynamited pond.  The\ndashboard was full of esoteric\nlights and dials and meters that I\nwould never understand.\n\nEXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON\n\nA GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S\nCONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf the Pigs were gathering in\nVegas, I felt the Drug Culture\nshould be represented as well...\nand there was a certain bent appeal\nin the notion of running a savage\nburn on one Las Vegas hotel and\nthen just wheeling across town and\nchecking into another.\n\nThe WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately\nattended by impressed MINIONS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMe and a thousand ranking cops from\nall over America.

I hate to interrupt, but I\nwonder if maybe I could just sort\nof slide through and get out of\nyour way.  Name's Raoul Duke --\nRaoul Duke.  My attorney made the\nreservation.\n\nDUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE\ngoes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he\nwas some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The\nCLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.\n\nCLERK\nCertainly, Mr. Duke!\n\nDUKE\nMy bags are out there in that white\nCadillac convertible.  Can you have\nsomeone drive it around to the room?\n\nALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.\n\nDUKE\nOh, and could I get a quart of Wild\nTurkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and\na night's worth of ice delivered to\nmy room, please?\n\nCLERK\nDon't worry about a thing, sir.\nJust enjoy your stay.\n\nDUKE\nWell, thank you.\n\nDUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the\nelevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of\nbeer and toasts them.  The doors close.\n\n66.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.\n\nDUKE\nAh, home at last!\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON\n\nDUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.\n\nA 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.\n\nGONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a\ndrug-addled grin on his face.\n\nDUKE\nYou degenerate pig!\n\nGONZO\nIt can't be helped.  This is Lucy.\n(laughing distractedly)\nYou know--like \"Lucy In The Sky\nWith Diamonds.\"\n\nLUCY eyes DUKE venomously.\n\nGONZO\nLucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!\nRemember what happened at the\nairport!  No more of that, okay?\n\nLUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his\narm round her shoulder.\n\nGONZO\nLucy... this is my client.  This is\nMr. Duke, the famous journalist.\nHe's paying for this suite, Lucy.\nHe's on our side.\n\nDUKE flops onto the sofa.\n\nGONZO\nMr. Duke is my friend.  He loves\nartists.\n\nDUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of\nartwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in\ncharcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.\n\nGONZO\nLucy paints portraits of Barbra\nStreisand.\n\n67.\n\n\nLUCY\nI drew these from TV.\n\nGONZO\nFantastic.  She came all the way\ndown here from Montana just to give\nthese portraits to Barbra.  We're\ngoing over to the Americana Hotel\ntonight to meet her backstage...\n\nDUKE's voice rises above GONZO.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI desperately needed peace, rest,\nsanctuary.  I hadn't counted on\nthis.  Finding my attorney on acid\nand locked into some kind of\npreternatural courtship.\n\nDUKE\nWell, I guess they brought the car\nround by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF\nOUT OF THE TRUNK.\n\nDUKE fixes GONZO hard.\n\nGONZO\nAbsolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.\n(to LUCY)\nNow, we'll be right back.  Don't\nanswer the phone if it rings.\n\nLUCY\n(makes one-fingered\nJesus freak sign)\nGod bless.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE collars GONZO -- serious.\n\nDUKE\nWELL?  What are your plans?\n\nGONZO\nPlans?\n\nDUKE\nLucy.\n\n68.\n\n\nGONZO\n(struggling to focus)\nShit.  I met her on the plane and I\nhad all that acid.\n(he shrugs)\nYou know, those little blue barrels.\nI gave her a cap before I realized...\nshe's a religious freak... Jesus,\nshe's never even had a drink.\n\nDUKE\nWell... It'll probably work out.\nWe can keep her loaded and peddle\nher ass at the drug convention.\n\nGONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.\n\nGONZO\nListen, she's running away from\nhome for something like the fifth\ntime in six months.  It's terrible.\n\nDUKE\nShe's perfect for this gig.  These\ncops will go fifty bucks a head to\nbeat her into submission and then\ngang fuck her.  We can set her up\nin one of these back street motels,\nhang pictures of Jesus all over the\nroom, then turn these pigs loose on\nher... Hell she's strong; she'll\nhold her own.\n\nGONZO's face twitches badly.\n\nGONZO\nJesus Christ.  I knew you were sick\nbut I never expected to hear you\nactually say that kind of stuff.\n\nDUKE\nIt's straight economics.  This girl\nis a god-send.  Shit, she can make\nus a grand a day.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  Stop talking like that.\n\nDUKE\nI figure she can do about four at a\ntime.  Christ, if we keep her full\nof acid that's more like two grand\na day.  Maybe three.\n\n69.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou filthy bastard.  I should cave\nyour fucking head in.\n\nDUKE\nIn a few hours, she'll probably be\nsane enough to work herself into a\ntowering Jesus-based rage at the\nhazy recollection of being seduced\nby some kind of cruel Samoan who\nfed her liquor and LSD, dragged her\nto a Vegas hotel room and savagely\npenetrated every orifice in her\nbody with his throbbing,\nuncircumcised member.\n\nGONZO starts crying.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I\nwanted to help her!\n\nDUKE\nYou'll go straight to the gas\nchamber.  And even if you manage to\nbeat that, they'll send you back to\nNevada for Rape and Consensual\nSodomy.  She's got to go.\n\nPause.\n\nGONZO\nShit, it doesn't pay to try to help\nsomebody these days.\n\nA silence.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only alternative was to take\nher out to the desert and feed her\nremains to the lizards.  But, it\nseemed a bit heavy for the thing we\nwere trying to protect: My attorney.\n\nGONZO\nWe have to cut her loose.  She's\ngot two hundred dollars.  And we\ncan always call the cops up there\nin Montana, where she lives, and\nturn her in.\n\nDUKE\nWhat?... What kind of goddamn\nmonster are you?\n\n70.\n\n\nGONZO\nIt just occurred to me, that she\nhas no witnesses.  Anything that\nshe says about us is completely\nworthless.\n\nDUKE\nUs?\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET\n\nDUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.\n\nDUKE\nHotel Americana?  I need a\nreservation.  For my niece.  Listen,\nI need her treated very gently.\nShe's an artist, and might seem a\ntrifle highstrung...\n\nIn the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the\ndoor.\n\nGONZO\nOkay, Lucy, it's time to go meet\nBarbra...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt like a Nazi, but it had to\nbe done.\n\nEXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK\n\nThe WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps\nLUCY and her paintings from the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nLucy was a potentially fatal\nmillstone on both our necks.  There\nwas absolutely no choice but to cut\nher adrift and hope her memory was\nfucked.\n\nGONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --\nwaves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting\nto come down...\n\nGONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands\ntogether as if washing his hands of the situation.\n\nGONZO\nWell that's that.  Take off slowly.\nDon't attract attention.\n\n71.\n\n\nThey pull out into traffic.\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK\n\nGONZO\nI gave the cabbie an extra ten\nbucks to make sure she gets there\nsafe.  Also, I told him I'd be\nthere myself in an hour, and if she\nwasn't, I'd come back out here and\nrip his lungs out.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  You can't be subtle\nin this town.\n\nGONZO\nAs your attorney, I advise you to\ntell me where you put the goddamn\nmescaline.\n\nDUKE\nMaybe we should take it easy tonight.\n\nGONZO\nRight.  Let's find a good seafood\nrestaurant and eat some red salmon.\nI feel a powerful lust for red\nsalmon...\n\nThe electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The\nsun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson\ntune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING\n\nGONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.\n\nIn the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.\n\nDUKE\nCome on, we're going to be late.\n\nGONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth\nwith a towel.\n\nGONZO\nThis goddamn mescaline.  Why the\nfuck can't they make it a little\nless pure?  Maybe mix it up with\nRolaids or something.\n\n72.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n(crackling and\nbooming over the\nlousy sound system)\nOn behalf of the prosecuting\nattorneys of this county, I welcome\nyou to the Third National DA's\nConference on Narcotics and\nDangerous Drugs.\n\nThe EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman\ntype -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:\nNATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. \"If You Don't Know, Come To\nLearn... If You Know, Come To Teach.\"\n\nA BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS\nAND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod\ndress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be\nWITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around\n20 REDNECKS.\n\nA dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles\ndistort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.\n\nAt the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI\nwingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name\ntag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.\n\nGONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,\nCRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.\n\nGONZO\n(lowers his voice)\nI saw these bastards in Easy Rider,\nbut I didn't believe they were real.\nNot like this.  Not hundreds of them!\n\nDUKE\nThey're actually nice people when\nyou get to know them.\n\nGONZO\nMan, I know these people in my\ngoddamn blood!\n\nDUKE\nDon't mention that word around here.\nYou'll get them excited.\n\nGONZO\nThis is a fucking nightmare.\n\n73.\n\n\nDUKE\nRight.  Sure as hell some dope-\ndealing bomb freak is going to\nrecognize you and put the word out\nthat you're partying with a thousand\ncops.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nSSSSHHH!\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST -- a \"drug expert\" -- takes the stage.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nWe must come to terms with the Drug\nCulture in the country... country...\ncountry...\n\nThe sound systems echoes.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nThe reefer butt is called a \"roach,\"\nbecause it resembles a cockroach...\ncockroach... cockroach...\n\nGONZO\n(whispers)\nWhat the fuck are these people\ntalking about?  You'd have to be\ncrazy on acid to think a joint\nlooked like a goddamn cockroach!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was clear that we had stumbled\ninto a prehistoric gathering.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nNow, there are four states of being\nin the cannabis, or marijuana,\nsociety: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and\nSquare.  The square is seldom if\never cool.  He is not \"with it,\"\nthat is, he doesn't know \"what's\nhappening.\" But if he manages to\nfigure it out, he moves up a notch\nto \"hip.\"\n\nDUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nAnd if he can bring himself to\napprove of what is happening, he\nbecomes \"groovy.\" After that, with\nmuch luck and perseverance, he can\nrise to the rank of \"cool.\" A cool\nguy... cool guy... cool guy...\n\n74.\n\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDr. Bloomquist, do you think the\nanthropologist, Margaret Mead's\nstrange behavior of late might\npossibly be explained by a private\nmarijuana addiction?\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nI really don't know, but at her\nage, if she did smoke grass, she'd\nhave one hell of a trip!\n\nRoars of laughter.\n\nGONZO\nI know a hell of a lot better ways\nto waste my time than listening to\nthis bullshit.\n\nHe stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and\nplunges down the aisle to the door.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDown in front!\n\nGONZO\nFuck you!  I have to get out!  I\ndon't belong here!\n\nCOP IN BACK\nGood riddance!\n\nHe stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to\nthe stage.\n\nThe lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER\nMADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nKNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE\nMAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be\nable to see his eyes because of\nTea-Shades, but his knuckles will\nbe white from inner tension...\n\nDUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF\nwho necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\n... and his pants will be crusted\nwith semen from constantly jacking\noff when he can't find a rape\nvictim...\n\n75.\n\n\nDUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,\nhe gets up, hand over mouth.\n\nDUKE\nPardon me, I feel sick.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nHe will stagger and babble when\nquestioned.  He will not respect\nyour badge.  The Dope Fiend fears\nnothing.  He will attack, for no\nreason, with every weapon at his\ncommand -- including yours...\n\nDUKE heads for the exit.\n\nDUKE\nSorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling\nsick...\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nBEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a\nsuspected marijuana addict should\nuse all necessary force immediately.\nOne stitch in time [on him] will\nusually save nine on you.\n\nDUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.\n\nINT. CASINO BAR - DAY\n\nDUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING\nCOP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT\nATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.\n\nDA\nI'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't\nhave much trouble from drugs where\nI come from...\n\nGONZO\nYou will.  One of these nights\nyou'll wake up and find a junkie\ntearing your bedroom apart.\n\nDA\nNaw!\n\nGONZO\nThey'll climb right into your\nbedroom and sit on your chest with\nbig Bowie knives.  They might even\nsit on your wife's chest.  Put the\nblade right down on her throat.\n\n76.\n\n\nDA\nNot down in my parts.\n\nDUKE joins them.\n\nDUKE\n(to WAITRESS)\nRum and ice, please.\n\nDA\n(looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)\nYou're another one of these\nCalifornia boys.  Your friend\nhere's been tellin' us about dope\nfiends.\n\nDUKE\nThey're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.\nAnd sure as hell not in the South.\nThey like warm weather... You'd\nnever believe it.  In L.A. it's out\nof control.  First it was drugs,\nnow it's witchcraft.\n\nDA\nWitchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!\n\nThe BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the\nconversation.\n\nGONZO\nRead the newspapers.\n\nDUKE\nMan, you don't know trouble until\nyou have to face down a bunch of\nthese addicts gone crazy for human\nsacrifice!\n\nDA\nNaw!  That's science fiction stuff!\n\nDUKE\nNot where we operate.\n\nGONZO\nHell, in Malibu alone, these\ngoddamn Satan worshippers kill six\nor eight people every day.  All\nthey want is the blood.  They'll\ntake people right off the street if\nthey have to.\n\n77.\n\n\nDUKE\nJust the other day we had a case\nwhere they grabbed a girl right out\nof a McDonald's hamburger stand.\nShe was a waitress, about sixteen\nyears old... with a lot of people\nwatching, too!\n\nThe BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more\nfuriously.\n\nDA\nWhat happened?  What did they do to\nher?\n\nGONZO\nDo?  Jesus Christ, man.  They\nchopped her goddamn head off right\nthere in the parking lot!  Then\nthey cut all kinds of holes in her\nhead and sucked out the blood!\n\nDA\n(DA ad-libs a\nsummation of the crime)\nAnd nobody did anything?\n\nDUKE\nWhat could they do?  The guy that\ntook the head was about six-seven,\nand maybe three-hundred pounds.  He\nwas packing two Lugers, and the\nothers had M-16s.\n\nGONZO\nThey just ran back out into Death\nValley -- you know, where Manson\nturned up...\n\nDUKE\nLike big lizards.\n\nGONZO\n... and every one of them stacked\nnaked...\n\nDA\nNaked!?\n\nDUKE\nNaked.\n\n78.\n\n\nGONZO\nYeh, naked!... except for the\nweapons.\n\nDUKE\nThey were all veterans.\n\nDA\nVeterans?!!!?\n\nAgog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes\nthe glass -- faster and faster...\n\nGONZO\nYeh.  The big guy used to be a\nmajor in the Marines.\n\nDA\nA major!\n\nGONZO\nWe know where he lives, but we\ncan't get near the house.\n\nDA\nNaw!  Not a major.\n\nGONZO\nHe wanted the pineal gland.\n\nDA\nReally?\n\nGONZO\nThat's how he got so big.  When he\nquit the Marines he was just a\nlittle guy.\n\nDUKE\nUsually, it's whole families.\nDuring the night.  Most of them\ndon't even wake up until they feel\ntheir heads going -- and then, of\ncourse, it's too late.\n\nThe glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nHappens every day.\n\nDUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.\n\n79.\n\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nThree more rums.  Plenty of ice.\nMaybe a handful of lime chunks.\n\nWAITRESS\nAre you guys with the police\nconvention upstairs?\n\nDA\nWe sure are, Miss.\n\nWAITRESS\nI thought so.  I never heard that\nkind of talk around here before.\nJesus Christ!  How do you guys\nstand that kind of work?\n\nGONZO\n(grinning)\nWe like it.  It's groovy.\n\nThe WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's wrong with you?  Hell,\nsomebody has to do it.\n\nGONZO\nHurry up with those drinks.  We're\nthirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine\na Bloody Mary.\n\nDA\n(whacks his fist on\nthe bar)\nHell, I really hate to hear this.\nBecause everything that happens in\nCalifornia seems to get down our\nway, sooner or later.  Mostly\nAtlanta.  But that was back when\nthe goddamn bastards were peaceful.\nAll we had to do was to keep 'em\nunder surveillance.  They didn't\nroam around much... But now Jesus,\nit seems nobody's safe.\n\nGONZO\n(with a conspiratorial\nnod)\nYou're going to need to take the\nbull by the horns -- go to the mat\nwith this scum.\n\n80.\n\n\nDA\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nGONZO\nYou know what I mean.  We've done\nit before and we can damn well do\nit again!\n\nDUKE\nCut their goddamn heads off.  Every\none of them.  That's what we're\ndoing in California.\n\nDA\n(stupefied)\nWHAT?\n\nGONZO\nSure.  It's all on the Q.T., but\neverybody who matters is with us\nall the way down the line.\n\nDUKE\nWe keep it quiet.  It's not the\nkind of thing you'd want to talk\nabout upstairs.  Not with the press\naround.\n\nDA\n(recovering slightly)\nHell, no.  We'd never hear the\ngoddamn end of it.\n\nDUKE\nDobermans don't talk.\n\nDA\nWhat?\n\nGONZO\nSometimes it's easier to just rip\nout the backstraps.\n\nDUKE\nThey'll fight like hell if you try\nto take the head without the dogs.\n\nDA\nGod almighty!\n(muttering in a daze)\nI don't think I should tell my wife\nabout this.  She'd never understand.\nYou know how women are.\n\n81.\n\n\nDUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.\n\nDUKE\nJust be thankful your heart is\nyoung and strong.\n\nDUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the\nswirling ice in drink.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.\n\nGONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the\nbathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.\n\nThe phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,\npicks up the phone.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's the message?  My light is\nblinking.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nAh, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one\nmessage: \"Call Lucy at the Americana\nHotel, room 1600.\"\n\nDUKE\nHoly shit!\n\nDUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the\nbathroom -- looking like death.\n\nDUKE\nLucy called.\n\nGONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.\n\nGONZO\nWhat?\n\nThe telephone rings.  DUKE answers.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY\n\nA worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.\n\nCLERK\nMr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm\nsorry we were cut off a moment\nago...

What do you want?\n\nIn the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his\nstash from the lining.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nThe woman who left that message for\nyou sounded very disturbed.  I\nthink she was crying...\n\nDUKE\nCrying?  Why was she crying?\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nWell, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.\nBut since I know you're here with\nthe Police Convention...\n\nDUKE\nLook, you want to be gentle with\nthat woman if she ever calls again.\nWe're watching her very carefully...\nthis woman has been into laudanum.\nIt's a controlled experiment, but I\nsuspect we'll need your cooperation\nbefore this thing is over.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\n(hesitantly)\nWell, certainly... We're always\nhappy to cooperate with the police...\n\n83.\n\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry.  You're protected.\nJust treat this poor woman like\nyou'd treat any other human being\nin trouble.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nWhat?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what\nyou mean... Yes... so, you'll be\nresponsible then?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  And now I have to get\nback to the news.  Send up some ice.\n\nHe hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.\n\nGONZO\nGood work.  They'll treat us like\ngoddamn lepers after that.\n\nDUKE\n(slowly, carefully)\nLucy is looking for you.\n\nGONZO\n(laughing)\nNo, she's looking for you.\n\nDUKE\nMe?\n\nGONZO\nShe really flipped over you.  The\nonly way I could get rid of her was\nby saying you were taking me out to\nthe desert for a showdown -- that\nyou wanted me out of the way so you\ncould have her all to yourself.\n(laughing again)\nI guess she figures you won.  That\nphone message wasn't for me, was it?\n\nA look of stunned realization from DUKE...\n\nINT.

Let me handle this.\n(dials the PHONE,\nsnaps angrily at DUKE)\nYou'd make a piss-poor lawyer.\n...Room 1600, please.\n(to DUKE)\nAs your attorney, I advise you not\nto worry.\n(nods towards bathroom)\nTake a hit out of that little brown\nbottle in my shaving kit.\n\nDUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a\nlabel: \"DRINK ME.\"\n\nDUKE\nWhat is this?\n\n85.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou won't need much.  Just a little\ntiny taste, that stuff makes pure\nmescaline seem like ginger-beer.\nAdrenochrome.\n\nDUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.\n\nDUKE\nAdrenochrome...\n\nGONZO\n(into PHONE)\nHi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got\nyour message...what?  Hell, no, I\ntaught the bastard a lesson he'll\nnever forget... what?  No, not\ndead, but he won't be bothering\nanybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left\nhim out there, I stomped him, then\npulled all his teeth out...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember thinking, \"Jesus, what a\nterrible thing to lay on somebody\nwith a head full of acid.\"\n\nDUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies\nit -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...\n\nGONZO\n(to PHONE)\nBut here's the problem.  That\nbastard cashed a bad check\ndownstairs and gave you as a\nreference.  They'll be looking for\nboth of you.  Yeah, I know, but you\ncan't judge a book by its cover,\nLucy.  Some people are just\nbasically rotten... Anyway, the\nlast thing you want to do is call\nthis hotel again; they'll trace the\ncall and put you straight behind\nbars... no, I'm moving to the\nTropicana right away.  I have to\ngo, they've got the phone tapped.\nYeah, I know, it was horrible, but\nit's all over now... OH MY GOD!\nTHEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!\n(throws the PHONE\ndown; shouts)\nNo!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent!\nIt was Duke!  I swear to God!\n(MORE)\n\n86.\n\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\n(stomps the PHONE; moans)\nNo, I don't know where she is.\nYou'll never catch Lucy!  She's\ngone!  I swear, I don't know where\nshe is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!\n(slams the PHONE down)\n\n\nGONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.\n\nGONZO\nWell.  That's that.  She's probably\nstuffing herself down the\nincinerator about now.  That's the\nlast we should be hearing from Lucy.\n(fumbling with the\nhash pipe)\nWhere's the opium?\n\nDUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY\nSTRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember slumping on the bed, his\nperformance had given me a bad jolt.\nFor a moment I thought his mind had\nsnapped -- that he actually believed\nhe was being attacked by invisible\nenemies.  But the room was quiet\nagain.\n\nDUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.\n\nDUKE\nWhere'd you get this?\n\nGONZO\nNever mind, it's absolutely pure.\n\nDUKE\nJesus... what kind of monster\nclient have you picked up this time?\nThere's only one source for this\nstuff -- the adrenaline gland from\na living human body!\n\nGONZO turns to smile at DUKE.\n\n87.\n\n\nGONZO\nI know, but the guy didn't have any\ncash to pay me.  He's one of these\nSatanism freaks.  He offered me\nhuman blood -- said it would take\nme higher than I've ever been in my\nlife.\n(laughs -- struts\nround DUKE -- eyes\nbright with expectation)\nI thought he was kidding, so I told\nhim I'd just as soon have an ounce\nor so of pure adrenochrome -- or\nmaybe just a fresh adrenaline gland\nto chew on.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI could already feel the stuff\nworking on me -- the first wave\nfelt like a combination of mescaline\nand methedrine -- maybe I should\ntake a swim, I thought...\n\nDUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...\n\nGONZO\nYeah, they nailed this guy for\nchild molesting.  He swore he\ndidn't do it. \"Why should I fuck\nwith children?\" he says. \"They're\ntoo small.\" Christ, werewolf is\nentitled to legal counsel.  I\ndidn't dare turn the creep down.\nHe might have picked up a letter\nopener and gone after my pineal\ngland!\n\nGONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS\nGOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  We should get some of\nthat.  Just eat a big handful and\nsee what happens.\n\nGONZO\nSome of what?\n\nDUKE\n(spitting words)\nExtract of pineal!\n\n88.\n\n\nGONZO\n(STARING AT DUKE WITH\nA STRANGE SMILE)\nSure.  That's a good idea.  One\nwhiff of that shit would turn you\ninto something out of a goddamn\nmedical encyclopedia.\n\nGONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.\n\nGONZO\nMan, your head would swell up like\na watermelon, you'd probably gain\nabout a hundred pounds in two\nhours...\n\nA CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.\n\nDUKE\nRight!\n\nGONZO\n... grow claws... bleeding warts.\n\nGONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.\n\nDUKE\nYes!\n\nGONZO\n... then you'd notice about six\nhuge hairy tits swelling up on your\nback...\n\nA TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A\nFLAME RED DEMON!\n\nDUKE\nFantastic!\n\nDUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY\nat the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.  His\nheels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED,\nEYEBALLS SWELLING.\n\nGONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.\n\nGONZO\nyou'd go blind... your body would\nturn to wax... they'd have to put\nyou in a wheelbarrow and...\n\nGONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals\nGONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.\n\n89.\n\n\nGONZO\nMan I'll try about anything; but\nI'd never touch a pineal gland.\n\nDUKE\nFINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What\nhappened?!  What about the glands?\n\nGONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...\ntowards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...\n\nGONZO\nJesus, that stuff got right on top\nof you, didn't it.\n\nVEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead.  He is purplish-red.\nOVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!\n\nDUKE\nMaybe you could just... shove me\ninto the pool, or something...\n\nGONZO shakes his head disgustedly.\n\nGONZO\nIf I put you in the pool right now,\nyou'd sink like a goddamn stone.\nYou took too much.  Jesus, look at\nyour face, you're about to explode.\n\nGONZO sits back down... watching the TV.\n\nGONZO\nDon't try and fight it, or you'll\nget brain bubbles.  Strokes,\naneurysms.  You'll just wither up\nand die.\n\nDUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO\nPARALYSIS.\n\nAND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF\nRICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.\n\nNIXON\nSacrifice... sacrifice...\nsacrifice...\n\nDUKE PASSES OUT.\n\nBLACK SCREEN\n\n90.\n\n\nINT.

He lies,\nawkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been\nthere days -- months.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhen I came to the general back\nalley ambiance of the suite was so\nrotten, so incredibly foul.  How\nlong had I been lying there?  Hours?\nDays?  Months?  All these signs of\nviolence.  What had happened?\n\nDUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE\nSIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving\nwhisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights\nreplace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,\npornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered\non a shattered mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was evidence in this room of\nexcessive consumption of almost\nevery type of drug known to\ncivilized man since 1544 AD.\n\nDUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --\nHOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut what kind of addict would need\nall these coconut husks and crushed\nhoneydew rinds?  Would the presence\nof junkies account for all these\nuneaten french fries?  These\npuddles of glazed ketchup on the\nbureau?  Maybe so, but then why all\nthis booze?  And these crude\npornographic photos smeared with\nmustard that had dried to a hard\nyellow crust...\n\nDUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT\nRAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.\n\n91.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThese were not the hoof prints of\nyour normal god-fearing junkie.  It\nwas too savage, too aggressive.\n\nQUICK FLASHBACK:\n\nGONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:\n\nBACK IN THE ROOM:\n\nDUKE stares at the smashed mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nGrim memories and bad flashbacks.\n\nIn the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN\nVOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.\n\nDUKE unzips and pisses.

I was\nsure of it...\n\nDUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.\n\nThe SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.\n\nDUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out\nof the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE\nSMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...\nsleeping on the sofa.\n\nThe ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.\n\nA hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO\ngrappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is\nmuffling her screams with an ice bag.\n\nMAID\nPlease... please... I'm only the\nmaid.  I didn't mean nothin!...\n\nDUKE\n(jumps up from the\nbed, flashing his\npress badge)\nYOU'RE UNDER ARREST!\n\n92.\n\n\nGONZO\n(to DUKE)\nShe must have used a pass key.  I\nwas polishing my shoes in the\ncloset when I noticed her sneaking\nin-so I took her.\n\nDUKE shakes his head.\n\nDUKE\n(barks at the MAID)\nWhat made you do it?  Who paid you\noff?\n\nMAID\nNobody.  I'm the maid!\n\nGONZO\nYou're lying!  You were after the\nevidence.  Who put you up to\nthis -- the manager?\n\nMAID\nI don't know what you're talking\nabout!\n\nGONZO\nBullshit!  You're just as much a\npart of it as they are!\n\nMAID\nPart of what?\n\nDUKE\nThe dope ring.  You must know\nwhat's going on in this hotel.  Why\ndo you think we're here?\n\nMAID\n(blubbering)\nI know you're cops, but I thought\nyou were just here for that\nconvention.  I swear!  All I wanted\nto do was clean up the room.  I\ndon't know anything about dope!\n\nGONZO laughs.\n\nGONZO\nCome on, baby don't try to tell us\nyou never heard of the Grange Gorman.\n\n93.\n\n\nMAID\nNo!  No!  I swear to Jesus I never\nheard of that stuff!\n\nDUKE\nMaybe she's telling the truth.\nMaybe she's not part of it.\n\nMAID\nNo!  I swear I'm not!\n\nGONZO\n(long pause)\nIn that case, maybe she can help.\n\nMAID\nYes!  I'll help you all you need!\nI hate dope!\n\nDUKE\nSo do we, lady.\n\nGONZO\n(helping her up)\nI think we should put her on the\npayroll.  See what she comes up with.\n\nDUKE\nDo you think you can handle it?\n\nMAID\nWhat?\n\nGONZO\nOne phone call every day.  Just\ntell us what you've seen.  Don't\nworry if it doesn't add up, that's\nour problem.\n\nGONZO hustles the MAID to the door.\n\nMAID\nYou'd pay me for that?\n\nDUKE\nYou're damn right.  But the first\ntime you say anything about this,\nto anybody -- you'll go straight to\nprison for the rest of your life.\nWhat's your name?\n\nMAID\nAlice.  Just ring Linen Service and\nask for Alice.\n\n94.\n\n\nGONZO\nAlright, Alice... you'll be\ncontacted by Inspector Rock.\nArthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a\npolitician.\n\nDUKE\nInspector Rock will pay you.  In\ncash.  A thousand dollars on the\nninth of every month.\n\nMAID\nOh Lord!  I'd do just about anything\nfor that!\n\nGONZO\nYou and a lot of other people.\n\nDUKE\nThe password is: \"One Hand Washes\nThe Other.\" The minute you hear\nthat, you say \"I fear nothing.\"\n\nMAID\nI fear nothing.\n\nShe repeats the password several times while they listen to\nmake sure she has it right.\n\nGONZO\nOh, and don't bother to make up the\nroom.  That way we won't have to\nrisk another of these little\nincidents, will we?\n\nMAID\nWhatever you say, gentlemen.  I\ncan't tell you how sorry I am about\nwhat happened...\n\nGONZO\nDon't worry, it's all over now.\nThank God for the decent people.\n\nShe smiles, repeating to herself \"One Hand Washes The Other\"\nas GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.\n\nCUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.\n\nA grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.\n\nGONZO ON TAPE\n...

They\nsend DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.\n\nThe trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather\nat the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with\njunk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.\n\nDUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.

A sly look at the gathering\nCROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!\n\nA GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.\n\nDUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!

WHEELS CHURNING,\nHE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight\nup, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER\nA FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the\nRUNWAY.\n\nGONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He\nthrows a worried look at DUKE.\n\nDUKE\nI'll drop you right next to the\nplane.\n\nThey SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET\nENGINE SCREAM.\n\nGONZO\nNo!  I can't get out!  They'll\ncrucify me.  I'll have to take the\nblame!\n\n106.\n\n\nDUKE\n(irritatedly)\nRidiculous!  Just say you were\nhitchhiking to the airport and I\npicked you up.  You never saw me\nbefore.  Shit, this town is full of\nwhite Cadillac convertibles.  I\nplan to go through there so fast\nthat nobody will even glimpse the\ngoddamn license plate.  You ready?\n\nGONZO\nWhy not?  But for Christ's sake,\njust do it fast!\n\nEXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY\n\nDUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO\nJUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.\n\nDUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.\n\nDUKE\nHey!\n\nGONZO stops -- turns.\n\nDUKE\nDon't take any guff from those\nswine.  Remember, if you have any\ntrouble you can always send a\ntelegram to the Right People.\n\nGONZO\nYeah... Explaining my Position.\nSome asshole wrote a poem about\nthat once...\n\nGONZO pauses.\n\nGONZO\nProbably good advice, if you have\nshit for brains.\n\nGONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT\nTO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND\nLEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere he goes -- one of God's own\nprototypes -- a high powered mutant\nof some kind never even considered\nfor mass production.  Too weird to\nlive and too rare to die.\n\n107.\n\n\nDUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH\nTHE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT\n\nOn the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find\nDUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his\ntypewriter.\n\nDUKE\nWe are all wired into a survival\ntrip now.  No more of the speed\nthat fueled that 60's.  That was\nthe fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.\nHe crashed around America selling\n\"consciousness expansion\" without\never giving a thought to the grim\nmeat-hook realities that were lying\nin wait for all the people who took\nhim seriously...\n\nDUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly\nrises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT\nIMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.\n\nDUKE\nAll those pathetically eager acid\nfreaks who thought they could buy\nPeace and Understanding for three\nbucks a hit.  But their loss and\nfailure is ours too.  What Leary\ntook down with him was the central\nillusion of a whole life-style that\nhe helped create...\n\nRISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30\nFEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE\nCAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...\n\nDUKE\n... a generation of permanent\ncripples, failed seekers, who never\nunderstood the essential old-mystic\nfallacy of the Acid Culture: the\ndesperate assumption that somebody...\nor at least some force -- is\ntending the light at the end of the\ntunnel.\n\nHIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX\nSURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON\nSIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT\nLIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.\n\n108.\n\n\nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY\n\nA BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE\nDRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out\nof the back seat as he takes a bump.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was only one road back to L.A.\nUS Interstate 15, just a flat-out\nhigh speed burn through Baker and\nBarstow and Berdoo, then on to the\nHollywood Freeway straight into\nfrantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,\njust another freak in the Freak\nKingdom.\n\nDUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING\nfacing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon\nsign that flashes beer.\n\nDUKE\nAhhh.  Wonderful.\n\nDUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.\n\nINT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY\n\nDUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all\nabout the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON\nWHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE\nRAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD\nMAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden\nbar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.\n\nPROPRIETOR\nWhat'll you have?\n\nDUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.\n\nDUKE\n(doubtfully)\nBallantine Ale...?\n\nTHE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND\nRELAXES.\n\nDUKE\nHard to find it served like this\nanymore.\n\nAs he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE\nAMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY\nPIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack\nreads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.\n\n109.\n\n\nPROPRIETOR\nWhere ya comin' from, young man?\n\nDUKE\nLas Vegas.\n\nPROPRIETOR\nA great town, that Vegas.  I bet\nyou had good luck there.  You're\nthe type.\n\nDUKE\nI know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.\n\nPROPRIETOR\n(trustingly)\nThat's a fine combination.  You\ncan't lose.\n\nA LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS\nREALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...\nKISSES THE PROPRIETOR.\n\nDUKE\n(caught off guard... muttering)\nOh, my God!...\n\nPROPRIETOR\n(not understanding)\nThis is my granddaughter...\n\nDUKE\n(recovering)\nDon't worry...\n(leans forward in confidence)\n... and I'm actually the District\nAttorney from Ignoto County.\n(winks)\nJust another good American like\nyourself.\n\nA MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.\n\nWordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the\nback of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.\n\nWHO FEELS ASHAMED.\n\nDUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.\n\nEXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY\n\nA CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.\nGets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...\n\n110.\n\n\nA state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.\n\nSomberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags\nstep off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...\n\nDUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the\ntrembling dash... DUKE catches it...\n\nONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...\n\nDUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --\nTEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.\n\nDUKE\nHOLY SHIT!!!\n\nDUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT\nTHE MARINES.\n\nDUKE\nGOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!\n\nDUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS\nIN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE\nCONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nThe TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.\n\nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY\n\nDUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!\n\nDUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy heart was filled with joy.  I\nfelt like a monster reincarnation\nof Horatio Alger... a man on the\nmove... and just sick enough to be\ntotally confident.\n\nThe WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nENDEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1684471", "artist_names": "Rainbow", "full_title": "Stone Cold

walked into a different world\nThe past forever gone\nI could have gone to Canada\nOr I could have stayed in school\nBut I was brought up differently\nI couldn't break the rules\nThirteen months and fifteen days\nThe last ones were the worst\nOne minute I'd kneel down and pray\nAnd the next I'd stand and curse\nNo place to run to\nWhere I did not feel that war\nWhen I got home I stayed alone\nAnd checked behind each door\n[Chorus]\nBecause I'm still in Saigon\nStill in Saigon\nI am still in Saigon\nIn my mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe ground at home was covered in snow\nAnd I was covered in sweat\nMy younger brother calls me a killer\nAnd my daddy calls me a vet\nEverybody says I'm someone else\nAnd I'm sick and there's no cure\nDamned if I know who I am\nThere was only one place I was sure\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause I'm still in Saigon\nStill in Saigon\nI am still in Saigon\nIn my mind\n\n[Verse 3]\nEvery summer when it rains\nI smell the jungle, I hear the planes\nI can't tell no one, I feel ashamed\nAfraid some day I'll go insane\nThat's been ten long years ago\nAnd time has gone on by\nNow and then I catch myself\nEyes searching through the sky\nAll the sounds of long ago\nWill be forever in my head\nMingled with the wounded cries\nAnd the silence of the dead\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBecause I'm still in Saigon\nStill in Saigon\nI am still in Saigon\nIn my

inside\nThey fill your ears as you run to a place to hide\nYou're never sure if the illusion is real\nYou pinch yourself but the memories are all you feel\n\nCan you break away\nFrom your alibis?\nCan you make a play?\nOh, will you meet me in the dark?\nIn the dark\nIn the dark\nIn the dark\nIn the dark\nIn the dark\n\nDon'tcha need me, hey, hey\nDon'tcha need me, oh yeah\nDon'tcha leave me, hey, hey\nDon'tcha need me, oh yeah\n\nYou take no interest, no opinion's too dear\nYou make the rounds, oh, you try to be so sincere\nYou guard your hopes and you pocket your dreams\nYou'd trade it all to avoid an unpleasant scene\n\nCan you face the fire\nWhen you see me there?\nCan you feel the fire?\nWill you love me in the dark?\nIn the dark\nIn the dark\nIn the dark\nIn the dark\nIn the dark\nIn

Fire Lyrics[Verse 1: Jody Watley, Howard Hewett]\nYou came into my life\nWhen I was lost and all alone\nWith no one to call my own\nYou made me feel alive again\nI've been in love before\nAnd you're more than just a friend\nI never thought that I would love again\nBut my heart is burnin' for you\n\n[Chorus: Shalamar, Howard Hewett, Jody Watley]\nYour love (Ooh) is full of fire\nBurnin', only you I desire\nYour love is full of fire\nCan't stop this raging fire\nHot\n[Verse 2: Jody Watley, Howard Hewett]\nFilled with so much love\nAnd lots of understanding\nHope this passion is everlasting\nWithout you there could be no me\nOoh, the warmth of your embrace\nIt really set my soul aflame\nGirl, we're past the point of playing games\nWe struck the spark that will burn forever\n\n[Chorus: Shalamar, Howard Hewett, Jody Watley]\nYour love (Ooh) is full of fire\nBurnin', only you I desire\nYour love is full of fire\nCan't stop this raging fire\n\n[Bridge: Shalamar,

make me forget past mistakes\nIf I had known that you'd be coming my way\nYou would have spared me so much heartache\nGirl, I'm glad you realize\nThat from now until the end of time\nI'm gonna claim you to be mine\nWe got a love that lasts forever\nYou and I together, baby\n\n[Chorus: Shalamar, Howard Hewett, Jody Watley]\nYour love (Ooh) is full of fire\nBurnin' (Burnin'), only you I

from the country\nAnd the hitters from the shop\nEverybody wants to do the horizontal bop\n[Verse 2]\nSomeone bring the records\nSomeone get the brew\nSomeone get a house\nBuddy we'll know what to do\nSomeone tell the ladies\nSomeone make a deal\nIf we can't find a house\nThen someone better find a field\nGrass is good as carpet\nAny place is fine\nIt's time to get to rockin'\nBabe it's time to make it shine\nTell 'em we'll be dancin'\nDancin' till we drop\nIt's time to get down and do the horizontal bop\n\n[Saxophone Solo: Alto Reed]\nOh yeah\n\n[Guitar Solo: Drew Abbott]\n\n[Verse

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nChiquitita, tell me what's wrong\nYou're enchained by your own sorrow\nIn your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow\nHow I hate to see you like this\nThere is no way you can deny it\nI can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet\n\n[Verse 2]\nChiquitita, tell me the truth\nI'm a shoulder you can cry on\nYour best friend, I'm the one you must rely on\nYou were always sure of yourself\nNow, I see you've broken a feather\n(How it hurts to see you cry)\n(And how it hurts to see you sad)\nI hope we can patch it up together\n[Chorus]\nChiquitita, you and I know\nHow the heartaches come and they go\nAnd the scars they're leaving\nYou'll be dancing once again\nAnd the pain will end\nYou will have no time for grieving\nChiquitita, you and I cry\nBut the sun is still in the sky\nAnd shining above you\n(Even though you cry)\n(The sun is shining in the sky)\nLet me hear you sing once more\n(So let me hear you sing some more)\nLike you did before\n(The way you used to do before)\nSing a new song, Chiquitita\nTry once more, like you did before\nSing a new song, Chiquitita\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo the walls came tumbling down\nAnd your love's a blown-out candle\nAll is gone, and it seems too hard to handle\nChiquitita, tell me the truth\nThere is no way you can deny it\nI see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nChiquitita, you and I know\nHow

pain will end\n(And all the pain you take will end)\nYou will have no time for grieving\nChiquitita, you and I cry\nBut the sun is still in the sky\nAnd shining above you\n(Even though you cry)\n(The sun is shining in the sky)\nLet me hear you sing once more\n(So let me hear you sing some more)\nLike you did before\n(The way you used to do before)\nSing a new song, Chiquitita\nTry once more, like

hippie\nTo the hip, hip-hop and you don't stop the rockin'\nTo the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie\nTo the rhythm of the boogie, the beat\n\n[Verse 1: Wonder Mike]\nNow, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat\nAnd me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet\nYou see, I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello\nA to the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow\nBut first, I gotta bang-bang the boogie to the boogie\nSay up jump the boogie to the bang-bang boogie\nLet's rock, you don't stop\nRock the rhythm that'll make your body rock\nWell so far you've heard my voice, a but I brought two friends along\nAnd next on the mic is my man Hank, come on, Hank, sing that song\n[Verse 2: Big Bank Hank]\nCheck it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y\nYou see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why\nYou see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee\nYou see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously\nI got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the wack\nI got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac\nSo after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall\nI got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball\nHear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money a than a sucker could ever spend\nBut I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again\n\n[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\nEverybody go, \"Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today?\" (Say what?)\n'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ\nEverybody go, \"Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\"\nYou see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend\n\n[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\nA Master Gee, a my mellow?\nIt's on you so what you gonna do?\n\n[Verse 3: Master Gee]\nWell it's on and on and on, on and on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nI said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E\nI said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee\nWell, my name is known all over the world\nBy all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls\nI'm going down in history\nAs the baddest rapper there ever could be\nNow I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows\nThe beat starts getting into your toes\nYou start popping your fingers and stomping your feet\nAnd moving your body while you're sitting in your seat\nAnd then damn, you start doing the freak\nI said damn, a right outta your seat\nThen you throw your hands high in the air\nYou're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere\nYou're rocking to the beat without a care\nWith the sure-shot MCs for the affair\nNow, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang\nBut I rap to the beat just the same\nI got a little face and a pair of brown eyes\nAll I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize\nSinging on and on and on, on and on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nA singing on and on and on, on and on\nLike a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie\nPop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop\nA come alive, y'all gimme what you got\nI guess by now you can take a hunch\nAnd find that I am the baby of the bunch\nBut that's okay, I still keep in stride\n'Cause all I'm here to do is just a wiggle your behind\nSinging on and on and on, on and on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nA singing on and on and on, on and on\nRock-rock, y'all, a get on the floor\nYou might also like[Chorus: Master Gee]\nI'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna freak you there\nI'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere\n\n[Post-Chorus: Master Gee]\n'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind\nI'll put the t-t-tickets in your behind\nI said a 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, a get on the floor\nA come alive, y'all, a gimme what ya got\n'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock\nI said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?\n\n[Chorus: Wonder Mike]\nSaid a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie\nThe hip, hip-a-hop and you don't stop rockin'\nTo the bang-bang, the boogie, say up jump the boogie\nTo the rhythm of the boogie, the beat\n\n[Verse 4: Wonder Mike]\nA-skiddlee bebop, we rock a scooby doo\nAnd guess what, America, we love you\nA 'cause ya rock and a roll with a so much soul\nYou could rock 'til you're hundred and one years old\nI don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast\nBut we're like hot butter on a breakfast toast\nWe rock it up, a baby bubba\nBaby bubba to the boogie, the bang-bang, the boogie\nTo the beat, beat, it's so unique\nCome on, everybody, and dance to the beat\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus: Wonder Mike]\nA hip-hop, the hippie, the hippie\nTo the hip, hip-hop and you don't stop\nA rock it out, baby bubba, to the boogie, the bang-bang\nThe boogie to the boogie, the beat\n\n[Verse 5: Wonder Mike]\nI say I can't wait 'til the end of the week\nWhen I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat\nAn attempt to raise your body heat\nA just blow your mind so a that you can't speak\nA do a thing, but a rock and shuffle your feet\nAnd let it change up to a dance called the freak\nAnd when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat\nRest a little while so ya don't get weak\nI know a man named Hank\nHe has more rhymes than a serious bank\nSo come on, Hank, a sing that song\nA to the rhythm of the boogie, the bang-bang, the bong\n\n[Verse 6: Big Bank Hank]\nWell, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies pimp\nThe women fight for my delight\nBut I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs\nThat shock the house for the young ladies\nAnd when you come inside, into the front\nYou do the freak, spank, and do the bump\nAnd when the sucker MCs try to prove a point\nWe're treacherous trio, a with a serious joint\nA from sun to sun and from day to day\nI sit down and write a brand new rhyme\nBecause they say that miracles never cease\nI've created a devastating masterpiece\nI'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist\nEverybody, I say it goes like this\nWell, I was coming home late one dark afternoon\nReporter stopped me for a interview\nShe said she's heard stories and she's heard fables\nThat I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables\nThis young reporter, I did adore\nSo I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before\nShe said, \"Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you\nThe Casanova legend must have been true\"\nI said, \"By the way, baby, what's your name?\"\nSaid \"I go by the name Lois Lane\"\nAnd you could be my boyfriend, you surely can\nJust let me quit my boyfriend called Superman\nI said, \"He's a fairy, I do suppose\nFlying through the air in pantyhose\nHe may be very sexy or even cute\nBut he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit\"\nI said, \"You need a man who's got finesse\nAnd his whole name across his chest\nHe may be able to fly all through the night\nBut can he rock a party 'til the early light?\nHe can't satisfy you with his little worm\nBut I can bust you out with my super sperm\"\nI go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it\nAn' I'm here and I'm there, I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere\nA just throw your hands up in the air\nAnd party hardy like you just don't care\nLet's do it, a don't stop, y'all, a tick a tock, y'all, you don't stop\n\n[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\nIt go, \"Hotel, motel, a what you gonna do today?\" (Say what?)\n'Cause I'm gon' get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ\nEverybody go, \"Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\"\nYou see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend\n\n[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\nI say skip, dive, what can I say?\nI can't fit 'em all inside my OJ\nSo I just take half and bust them out\nI give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house\n\n[Verse 7: Master Gee]\nIt was twelve o'clock a one Friday night\nI was rocking to the beat and feeling alright\nEverybody was dancing on the floor\nDoing all the things they never did before\nAnd then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean\nShe came into the bar, she came into the scene\nAs she traveled deeper inside the room\nAll the fellas checked out her white Sassons\nShe came up to the table, looked into my eyes\nThen she turned around and shook her behind\nSo I said to myself, its time for me to release\nMy vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece\nAnd now people in the house, this is just for you\nA little rap to make you boogaloo\nNow, the group ya hear is called Phase 2\nAnd let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew\nOnce a week we're on the street\nJust a cutting the jams and making it freak\nFor you to party, got to have the moves\nSo we'll get right down and give you a groove\nFor you to dance you got to be hype\nSo we'll get right down and make ya rock\nNow the system's on and the girls are there\nYou definitely have a rocking affair\nBut let me tell ya something, there's still one fact\nThat to have a party, got to have a rap\nSo when the party's over you're making it home\nAnd trying to sleep before the break of dawn\nAnd while ya sleeping, you start to dream\nAnd thinking how ya danced on the disco scene\nA name appears in your mind\nYeah, a name you know that was right on time\nIt was Phase 2 a just a doing the do\nRocking ya down 'cause ya know we could\nTo the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak\nA come alive, girls, a get on your feet\nTo the rhythm of the beat, to the beat, the beat\nTo the double beat-beat that it makes ya freak\nTo the rhythm of the beat that says you go on\nOn and on until the break of dawn\nNow I got a man coming on right now\nHe's guaranteed to throw down\nHe goes by the name of Wonder Mike\nA come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like\n\n[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]\nI say, a can of beer that's sweeter than honey\nLike a millionaire that has no money\nLike a rainy day that is not wet\nLike a gambling fiend that does not bet\nLike Dracula without his fangs\nLike the boogie to the boogie without the boogie-bang\nLike collard greens that don't taste good\nLike a tree that's not made out of wood\nLike going up and not coming down\nIs just like the beat without the sound, no sound\nTo the beat, beat, ya do the freak\nEverybody just rock and dance to the beat\nHave you ever went over a friend's house to eat\nAnd the food just ain't no good?\nI mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\nA so you try to play it off like you think you can\nBy saying that you're full\nAnd then your friend says, \"Mama, he's just being polite\nHe ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull\"\nA so your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie\nAnd you say that you already ate\nAnd your friend says, \"Man, there's plenty of food\"\nSo you pile some more on your plate\nBut while the stinky food's steaming, your mind starts to dreaming\nOf the moment that it's time to leave\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting\nInto something that looks like cheese\nOh, so you say that's it, I got to leave this place\nI don't care what these people think\nI'm just sitting here making myself nauseous\nWith this ugly food that stinks\nOh, so you bust out the door while it's still closed\nStill sick from the food you ate\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\nFrom a bottle of Kaopectate\nAnd then you call your friend a two weeks later\nTo see how he has been\nAnd he says \"I understand about the food\nBaby bubba, but we're still friends\"\n\n[Chorus: Wonder Mike]\nA with a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie\nThe hip, hip-hop and you don't stop the rockin'\nTo the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie\nTo the rhythm of the boogie, the beat\n\n[Post-Chorus: Wonder Mike]\nI said, \"A Hank, a can ya rock?\nCan ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?\nA can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?\"\nI said, \"A come on, make, m-make the people move\"\n\n[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]\nI go toot the horns and then ring the bell\nBecause I am the man with the clientele\nAnd if ya ask me why I rock so well\nI'm Big Bank, I got clientele\nAnd from the time I was only six years old\nI never forgot what I was told\nIt was the best advice that I ever had\nIt came from my wise dear old dad\nHe said, \"Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you\nAnd don't say a word until I'm through\nNow there's a time to laugh, a time to cry\nA time to live and a time to die\nA time to break and a time to chill\nTo act civilized or act real ill\nBut whatever ya do in your lifetime\nYa never let a MC steal your rhyme\"\nSo from '66 to this very day\nI'll always remember what he had to say\nSo when the sucker MCs try to chump my style\nI let them know that I'm versatile\nI got style, finesse and a little black book\nThat's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look\nBut the thing that separates you from me\nAnd that is called originality\nBecause my rhymes are on from what you've heard\nI didn't even bite, not a god**** word\nAnd I say a little more later on tonight\nSo the sucker MCs can bite all night\nA tick a tock, y'all, a beat-beat y'all\nA lets rock, y'all, ya don't stop\n\n[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\nIt go, \"Hotel, motel, a whatcha gonna do today?\" (Say what?)\n'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, and drive off in a def OJ\nEverybody go, \"Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\"\nYou see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friends\n\n[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\nA like that, y'all, a to the beat, y'all\nA beat-beat, y'all, ya don't stop\nA Master Gee, am I mellow?\nIt's on you, so whatcha gonna do?\n\n[Verse 10: Master Gee]\nWell, like Johnny Carson on the late show\nA like Frankie Crocker in stereo\nA like the Bar-Kays singing \"Holy Ghost\"\nThe sounds I throw down, a they're played the most\nJust a like my man, a Captain Sky\nWhose name he earned with his super sperm\nWe rock and we don't stop\nA get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got\nA to the beat that it makes you freak\nAnd come alive girl, a get on your feet\nA like a Perry Mason without a case\nLike Farrah Fawcett without her face\nLike the Bar-Kays on the mic\nLike getting right down for you tonight\nLike moving your body so ya don't know how\nRight to the rhythm and throw down\nLike coming alive to the Master Gee\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\nI said the age of one, my life begun\nAt the age of two, I was doing the do\nAt the age of three, it was you and me\nRocking to the sounds of the Master Gee\nAt the age of four, I was on the floor\nGiving all the freaks what they bargained for\nAt the age of five, I didn't take no jive\n'Cause with the Master Gee, it's all the way live\nAt the age of six, I was a picking up sticks\nRapping to the beat, my stick was fixed\nAt the age of seven, I was rocking in heaven\nDon't ya know I went off?\nI gotta run on down to the beat, you see\nGetting right on down, making all the girls\nJust take of their clothes to the beat, the beat\nTo the double beat-beat that makes you freak\nAt the age of eight I was a really great\n'Cause every night, you see, I had a date\nAt the age of nine I was a right on time\n'Cause every night I had a party rhyme\nWe're going on and on, and on, on and on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nA saying on and on, and on, on and on\nLike a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn\nA going on and on, and don't ya dare stop\nA rock-rock, y'all, a gimme what ya got\n'Cause I'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic\nI am the definite freak's delight\nI'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic\nI am the definite freak's delight\nThey call me the Master Gee, you see\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\n\n[Outro: Master Gee]\nI'm gonna move ya here, I'm gonna move ya there\nI'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere\n'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shocks your mind\nI'll put the t-t-tickets in your behind\nSaid, just rock it to the east and move it to the west\nMove it toward the lady you love-love the best\nMaster Gee, get it on\nTaggin' all the girls, goin' down\n(Gimme time, I'ma shock your mind)\n(A come and jig-jig-jigglin' your behind)104Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/105217", "artist_names": "Bob Dylan",
