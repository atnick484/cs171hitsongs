Speak up, Butch, please\n\nWell he goes on and goes up to the elevator, gets drunk\n\nBut I mean what does he do? He comes through this through this door? Why don't you just tell me?\n\nHe comes through this door goin' around and takes the elevator\n\nWhat is this the kitchen or-\n\nNo this is the freight elevator\n\nDo you have lots of people coming through like that?\n\nWell there's one\n\nDo you have a lot of celebrities coming through?\n\nWell no holiday, uh, conventions and things in the back just coming up this way\n\nWhat do you think about Elvis Presley coming through here?\n\nOh it's wonderful\n\nDo you know anything about him?\nYou might also likeYeah. Do I know anything about him?\n\nYeah\n\nI was raised in his home town\n\nAre you gonna be saying something to him or be talking to him?\n\nWell that's just gonna depend\n\nAre you looking forward to seeing him?\n\nSure\n\nWhy don't you show us where he's coming in?\n\nHe's coming through this door here, there's two doors in this entrance, he's coming through this door here and this is and it opens back like this and we have this one the other door goes back like this...\n\nYou gotta have the blood of Jesus Christ the love from...to man he died on that cross so that we might have a right to the tree of life I come to tell you this my beloved...Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/835217", "artist_names": "Ike & Tina Turner", "full_title":

One\ntetly watch\n\nFrankie Green woke bathed in cold sweat. The bedroom was dark and she felt so disorientated that for a moment she almost didn\u2019t know where she was.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her phone lay on her bedside table and she fumbled for it, pressing the button so that the screen lit up. With light, she managed to find her glasses and look at the time.\nTwo fifteen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh hell, she thought. She had a hectic day ahead, she hadn\u2019t been able to get to sleep for ages and now she was awake again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beside her, Seth was a long mound under the duvet, sleeping soundly, which was infinitely annoying. He didn\u2019t have to get up in the morning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which wasn\u2019t his fault, she reminded herself, as she did so often these days as a sort of guilty afterthought. He hadn\u2019t joyfully decided to retire and let her continue working, he\u2019d been made redundant three months ago and hated it. Yet, it felt like his fault that he could sleep late while she \u2013 now the major earner \u2013 had to haul herself out of bed come rain or shine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pushing back the duvet, she went into the horrible, poky bathroom she swore she would never get used to, shivering as the cool night air hit her soaked cotton pyjamas.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the bathroom\u2019s cold light, a tired, white-faced woman stared back at her from the mirror: dark hair plastered to her skull, face sheeny with damp, nightclothes sticking like a second skin.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She looked as if she\u2019d been running through a rainforest for days. She looked \u2013 Frankie realized the correct word with misery \u2013 old.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Somehow, while she\u2019d been busy trying to raise two children, run the Human Resources department of Dutton Insurance and be a wife to Seth Green, age had crept up on her. She\u2019d been so busy working, doing school runs and making vast meals to freeze, checking homework diaries and worrying about exam results, mopping up teenage tears and making rare date nights with her husband, that the blur of her thirties had morphed into her forties and suddenly, here she was, forty-nine. Calcium, collagen, oestrogen \u2013 everything was leaching out of her. Soon all that would remain would be a dried-out husk and if she stood still long enough, she\u2019d be stuffed in a museum as an example of tinder-dry womankind. Even her marriage felt dried out and empty. That was the worst thing and she couldn\u2019t bear to think about it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is this all normal? she silently asked the mirror-image Frankie. If it was, nobody talked about it. Not her sister, not her friends. If only her mother was a bit normal, she might have asked her, but there was nothing normal about Madeleine. Her mother, pushing eighty and still fond of causing havoc, managed to be old in years without being old in any other way. Madeleine to most people, but plain old Mad to her two daughters, had never bothered with creams or unguents. In her forties, she\u2019d lain in the back garden toasting herself under layers of coconut sun oil, happiest when she was nut brown. When hot pants were the \u2018in\u2019 clothes for teenagers, Madeleine had worn them herself, not caring that other mothers wore normal summer skirts and cardigans. If she passed a building site and somebody whistled, Madeleine would blow the builders a delighted kiss, while her teenage daughters, Frankie and Gabriella, would exchange horrified glances.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why couldn\u2019t Mother be more like other mothers?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Frankie grew up, she began to appreciate her mother\u2019s unconventional spirit but even so, she wondered at the secret of her parents\u2019 long marriage. Eventually, Frankie decided that it worked because Dad was a placid person who managed by saying \u2018that\u2019s fine, dear,\u2019 to whatever Madeleine wanted to do.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They still lived in a cottage in the fishing village of Kinsale, and when Madeleine went through her phase of \u2018forgetting\u2019 her costume when she went for her morning dip, Dad greeted people\u2019s outraged comments by saying \u2018Isn\u2019t she a great woman for the swimming, all the same.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Madeleine\u2019s marriage guidance advice, if she offered it, would be to get married to a calm man in the first place, and then ignore him happily thereafter. Dad never seemed to get sad or tired. He was just Dad, content with his paper and the crossword, able to keep his spirits up no matter what happened, happy to let his wife be exactly who she wanted to be.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beauty-wise, the sun had taken a cruel revenge on Frankie\u2019s mother and now her face was more wrinkled than a very old crab apple. But in true Madeleine fashion, she didn\u2019t mind in the slightest. She continued to wear bright-red lipstick and dye her grey hair a glossy dark brown and had no problem facing herself in the mirror.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frankie\u2019s mother was one of the happy people who liked what they saw when they spied their own reflection.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Sunday lunches in Frankie and Seth\u2019s house, Madeleine would happily discuss the way her hair was still silky and obedient, and say: \u2018Frankie, I was thinking of getting a more angular bob in the hairdressers. Lionel says I\u2019ve got the bones for it.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lionel was Madeleine\u2019s hairdresser and, as far as Frankie was concerned, he clearly liked living on the edge, sending his older clientele out with styles their daughters wouldn\u2019t dream of risking.\nBut maybe Lionel and his clients were right, Frankie thought gloomily. They didn\u2019t worry about wrinkles \u2013 what was the point?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frankie had been careful with the sun. She used serums and suncream. She read articles in magazines about the latest products, she never ventured out with anything less than a factor 25 moisturizer. And look at her now. She might write to all those serum and suncream people and tell them they should be fined for filling people\u2019s heads with insane dreams. In the cold light of the basement bathroom, with bluish shadows under her dark eyes and a spiderweb of lines around them, she could have passed for eighty herself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maybe it was time she started visiting Lionel \u2013 the sort of deranged, angular haircut that Lady Gaga would balk at might be the very thing. At least it would take people\u2019s eyes away from her face.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning from the mirror, she stripped off the damp pyjamas and balled them up into the laundry basket. She dried off her hair and body, then, still using her phone for light because she didn\u2019t want to wake Seth, found fresh nightclothes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the bed, she had lavender oil and she rubbed a bit on her wrists and temples. Nobody looked good when they woke in the middle of the night, she told herself, but at least she could smell good.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was tired, that was all. But instead of going back to sleep, her mind began to race the way it so often did. The previous day at Dutton Insurance unfurled like a film reel, and she thought of all the things she ought to have done. Next, the following day\u2019s meetings and potential problems began to roll out. The company employed nearly a thousand people, so as human resources director there was always something for Frankie to worry about.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tomorrow \u2013 or rather today \u2013 she had to conduct five interviews for the position of deputy marketing director. Then there was a particularly tricky case of sexual harassment involving a woman in the motor insurance department and her boss. The claims department was in uproar over holiday policy, and the intervention of one of Frankie\u2019s HR team had only succeeded in making matters worse, so that needed sorting out. And on top of that, one of the department heads wanted to take her to lunch to \u2018pick her brains\u2019 about something.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Lunch!\u2019 she\u2019d vented to Seth the previous evening as they sat at the kitchen table after dinner. Seth had cooked a very nice Thai curry and Frankie had eaten so much she\u2019d had to open the button on her jeans. \u2018I don\u2019t have time for lunch! I\u2019m supposed to run a team that isn\u2019t actually big enough for the size of the company, recruit fabulous staff at high speed when required, and,/i> be free for lunch whenever some other executive wants to chat!\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018You used to enjoy having lunches with the other executives,\u2019 Seth said innocently.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018That was when I had time for lunch. These days I barely have time to snatch a sandwich at my desk,\u2019 she hissed. Did he understand anything?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s no need to snap,\u2019 he said, with a hint of a snap in his own voice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And of course, Frankie felt sorry for taking it out on him. But at the same time, she was angry. It seemed that she spent her life tiptoeing around male egos, both in the office and at home. Trying to allay other people\u2019s worries when she was overwhelmed with her own. Sometimes Frankie felt it like an actual weight on her shoulders: worries about staff redundancies, about how pale and withdrawn Seth was, about how they were ever going to find the money to sort out the house.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The house. That was their biggest worry of all.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A dream Edwardian red-brick house with a large garden, Sorrento House has many unusual features the piece in the newspaper had purred. It had leapt out at them from the property supplement because Seth and Frankie had been talking about moving for years. They\u2019d started married life in a narrow end-of-terrace house from the turn of the nineteenth century. When Emer and Alexei came along, they remodelled the place so that the front retained the period features, while the back was modern with a glass extension that Seth had designed, giving them a light-filled kitchen-cum-family room.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Much as they had loved that house, it was small. For years Frankie and Seth had talked about buying a big old house they could do up.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018When Emer and Alexei are older,\u2019 Frankie would say, during the mad junior school years when long division sums, homework and careful nurturing of delicate young souls took up every hour she wasn\u2019t in the office.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018When they\u2019re settled, not an exam year,\u2019 Seth would say when Emer and Alexei were teenagers, caught up in another phase of life where careful nurturing was required.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then the previous July twenty-two-year-old Emer had finished college and decided to spend a year travelling the world. Inspired by his sister\u2019s example, Alexei, just eighteen, had set off on a gap year with three school friends.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking back, Frankie could see that the whole moving house thing had come about as a coping mechanism for empty-nest syndrome.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She hadn\u2019t wanted to stop being busy for long enough to think about her children leaving.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018What if we moved house while you were away?\u2019 she\u2019d asked them. It had been June, and the four of them were sitting around the table in the light-filled kitchen, making the most of the last few weeks before her beloved children departed on their travels.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Go for it!\u2019 said Emer.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Emer was the wild child of the family. She might have inherited her paternal grandmother\u2019s strawberry blonde hair and bright blue eyes, but her eagerness for fun and adventure owed more to Grandmother Madeleine, Frankie thought ruefully. Still, four years at college, finishing with a masters in business studies, appeared to have calmed her down. At least, Frankie hoped it had.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s your turn to do things now, Mum,\u2019 said Alexei gently. Her darling, thoughtful boy; she felt like leaping up from the table to give him a hug. Four years younger than his sister, he was gentler and quieter. There had been no baby after Emer and finally Frankie and Seth had turned to adoption. Since the small Russian boy with the blond hair, fine bones and a lonely look in his misty grey eyes had come into her life, Frankie had never ceased wanting to protect him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The idea of Alexei travelling the world made her heart physically hurt. She\u2019d thought taking care of small children had been hard, but nothing could be harder than watching those same children grow up and leave the nest.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s just a wild thought,\u2019 said Seth, ever sensible. \u2018We\u2019d probably be insane to move. The economy\u2019s so bad.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018The property market\u2019s not great,\u2019 Frankie agreed. \u2018We should have done it years ago; we missed the boat.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, alone in their family home with what seemed like the actual family part gone, they read about Sorrento House and went to see it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What had made them fall for the place? Frankie remembered that first visit. It had been September \u2013 always the start of the year for Frankie, with its associations of back-to-school. The leaves on the trees were almost golden in the autumn light, and the beech tree with its bronzed leaves drooping outside the old stone pillars had given the house at the end of Maple Avenue a sort of faded glamour.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It brought to mind the endless leaves she\u2019d gathered with the children for school projects, days spent trying to do leaf rubbings into copybooks, and the fun of decorating the house for Halloween, as Alexei and Emer eagerly discussed what costumes they\u2019d wear that year.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If only they were here to see this, she thought sadly. But then she brightened up at the prospect of what a welcome home it would make, to arrive at this lovely house.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was no doubt that the house was unusual. The porch and front door stood at a right angle to the fa\u00e7ade, almost hidden behind great swathes of rhododendron that overran a garden at least three times the size of their old one.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The property agent was a man with a finely tuned sense of when not to speak, so he kept his thoughts to himself about the amount of work that needed doing. He\u2019d learned the hard way not to say anything along the lines of \u2018it needs updating\u2019 because such words could prove fatal where potential buyers were concerned. Some people loved a challenge and were dying to get their hands on an industrial sander. Others thought you needed a hard hat and a guide to navigate the hardware shop.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So Seth and Frankie wandered around Sorrento House by themselves, seeing only the possibilities. The name itself called to them. Sorrento was where they\u2019d gone on honeymoon.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The house, two storeys above a dark basement flat, had not been a single residence for years. The upstairs bedsits were miserably decorated in wallpapers at least thirty years old. On the ground floor, two of the bigger rooms, which Seth and Frankie could imagine transformed into gracious living rooms overlooking the garden, were divided in half with cheap plasterboard.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018You\u2019d think a person would be ashamed to put anyone in these rackety spaces,\u2019 Frankie said in disgust, not even wanting to touch the filthy curtains half hanging on the windows.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seth put an arm round her waist and steered her to face the long-neglected garden at the back.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Look,\u2019 he said. \u2018Then close your eyes and imagine how it will all appear when we\u2019re finished with it. A gorgeous kitchen, a bit like at home, but extended out into that long garden. Don\u2019t you love those copper beeches and the apple trees? And see that maple in the far left corner? It\u2019s changing colour \u2013 in a week or so it\u2019ll be a glorious crimson.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frankie sighed. \u2018If I close my eyes, I\u2019ll realize we\u2019re mad to even consider buying the place. We\u2019ll have to get it checked for damp, then rip off all that wallpaper, tear up those hideous nylon carpets, paint every inch inside and out, and \u2026 oh heck, the windows\u2014\u2019 She looked down in alarm. \u2018Do you reckon this frame is rotten? Are the windows on borrowed time?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ve been checking with my penknife while you were upstairs just now,\u2019 he said. \u2018The windows are actually fine. So\u2019s the roof, as far as I can tell. Otherwise, we really would be mad to buy it. It would still be a lot of work interior-wise, and of course the extension would take time, but I can see how it will all come together. We just need to sit down and work out the numbers. Think, it will be our dream home, love. Sorrento House. That sounds a bit grand. We could change the name. Sorrento Villa is nicer, more homely, don\u2019t you think?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The words \u2018dream home\u2019 combined with the vision of glorious Italian coast magically mingled in Frankie\u2019s mind. She\u2019d been brought up in Kinsale, a jewel of a town perched beside the sea, and her sister, Gabrielle, had chosen to live in the seaside town of Cobh, about half an hour from Cork.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another plus was the location: Redstone. It was a part of the city that had gone from fashionable in the nineteenth century, to down at heel in the twentieth, but was now growing in popularity again thanks to the regeneration of the area.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seth had a development map which showed that their house faced others that backed on to the allotments behind rows of one-time council houses, the St Brigid\u2019s estate. \u2018Part of the waste ground beside the allotments is being turned into parkland,\u2019 he explained, \u2018which adds value to the neighbourhood.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After seeing the house, they went for a coffee at the crossroads, which was the centre of Redstone. The place sealed the deal for both of them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s perfect,\u2019 said Frankie wistfully, admiring the sycamores growing at the roadside.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Very nineteen thirties,\u2019 mused Seth as they walked along hand-in-hand, deciding which place to go into. \u2018Look at those fa\u00e7ades.\u2019 He pointed to one block decorated with period signage.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They admired the clothes boutique, the delicatessen with windows full of cheeses and all manner of exotic meats, they walked past a pretty pink-and-brown beauty salon, and finally settled in a coffee shop where they ate the best raspberry-and-almond muffins they\u2019d ever tasted.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018We can do it,\u2019 Seth said, enthusiastically outlining his plans.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was sure, from experience, that planning permission wouldn\u2019t be a problem. He would design the new parts of the house, a builder he\u2019d worked with would agree a reasonable price for the work, and Seth could manage the build himself. With two decent salaries coming in, they should be able to find the money.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Can you cope with living in the basement while we do up the rest?\u2019 Seth asked her the day before the sale closed. They were walking through the property again, imagining grand neo-classical fireplaces from the salvage yard instead of the bricked-up fireplaces and the hazardous two-bar electric fires that the previous owner had installed everywhere.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I can cope with anything,\u2019 Frankie had said excitedly, eyeing up the kitchen and imagining how marvellous it would look when the extension was built and the whole room had been turned into an open-plan kitchen/breakfast room. She\u2019d got an idea for a conservatory, too. She could just see a couple of huge planters filled with exotic ferns beside the imaginary doors. And the garden. Gardening had never really been her thing, but here there was so much possibility. Or there would be, once the jungle of weeds and wild brambles had been torn away.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I can cope with anything. Famous last words for sure.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A month after they\u2019d moved into the basement flat of the newly named Sorrento Villa, Seth was made redundant by the big architectural practice where he\u2019d worked for fifteen years. The company was in dire financial straits, the senior partner explained: they had no option but to downsize.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shocked, Frankie recalled that same senior partner \u2013 Seth\u2019s friend since college \u2013 at the previous year\u2019s Christmas dinner, where much had been made of the company\u2019s resilience in the shaky economic climate. A glass of red wine in his hand, the man had toasted each member of staff. Frankie had clapped loudest of all when he\u2019d said \u2018Seth Green, the man we all aspire to be,\u2019 then raising his glass, \u2018quietly professional, dedicated and loyal.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loyalty hadn\u2019t gone both ways it seemed. Seth wasn\u2019t a full partner, but on a high wage, so his name was at the top of the redundancy list.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If she was shocked, then Seth had been devastated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ve failed you,\u2019 was all he could say. Despite his years of hard work for the company he\u2019d only been given the statutory legal pay-off. There was no vat of cash to help fund the work on Sorrento Villa. They had savings but it would be madness to plough them into such a project. \u2018How will we manage financially?\u2019 Seth asked in despair. \u2018With the new house \u2026\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018We\u2019ll manage,\u2019 said Frankie, magically switching on the same positive tone that had worked so well during the children\u2019s teenage years. \u2018We\u2019ll manage somehow.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But inside, her stomach was churning with fear. How could they survive on only one salary? If only they\u2019d stayed in their modest old house instead of thinking they were the sort of people who should own a detached Victorian red-brick villa on a half-acre site in Redstone. Christmas had been just over a month off, both children were staying away \u2013 Emer in Australia, Alexei in Japan \u2013 and she and Seth had to face a dark and depressing festive season on their own. Three months later, they were still far from managing.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Coping with anything had turned out to mean a husband who sloped around in sweatpants and could barely summon up the energy to walk to the crossroads for a daily newspaper. He\u2019d lost his zest for life when he\u2019d lost his job. All the great plans for the house now lay untouched under a mound of bills at one end of the kitchen table.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Redundancy had settled over their house like a heavy grey storm cloud.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frankie, who had been responsible for setting up counselling sessions for Dutton employees following a series of redundancies at the company, now saw the problem from the other side of the table. Her husband was in despair.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Work doesn\u2019t define women in the way it defines men, she remembered telling her team in the HR department at the time. Men find it hard to cope with being out of work.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Platitudes delivered straight from the most basic HR psychology books.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those words were certainly mocking her now as she lay beside this shadow of the man who had been her husband, waiting for sleep to claim her. Sleep didn\u2019t come.\n\nIt was the Sleep Theorem, she told herself. The number of hours you lost sleepless in bed was always in reverse proportion to the amount of work you had to do the following day. Eventually, she drifted into an uneasy doze filled with nightmares involving Emer and Alexei in danger, when she couldn\u2019t run fast enough to save them. And darling Seth, once her mainstay in life, was watching all and seemed paralysed into indecision.\n\n\nAt six the alarm went off. She woke exhausted and decided that, at that precise moment, the word for the day was shattered. While Seth carried on sleeping, she showered, dressed and had some muesli for breakfast before heading into work.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she pulled into the underground car park of Dutton Insurance at seven twenty-five on that clear but cold February morning, Frankie felt a low drag of anxiety in the depths of her belly. Steeling herself for the day ahead, she grabbed her briefcase, got out of the car and strode towards the lifts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doors closed behind her with a satisfying swish. The inevitable muzak drifted into her head. She hated that music. The lifts from the car park were workmanlike and industrial. Important visitors to Dutton Insurance parked in a designated section of the car park and made their entrance through much more glamorous lifts. She pushed the button for the lobby, the lift shuddered and brought her up. She used to make it her business to run up the stairs at least once every day but these days she was too tired.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Morning, Mrs Green,\u2019 said the fresh-faced security guard as she slid her recognition card into the slot on the barrier.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Morning, Lucas,\u2019 said Frankie cheerily, suppressing the thought that he looked even younger than Alexei, standing there in his uniform as if ready to defend Dutton Insurance from invaders. The policemen were looking younger too. Was she finally at that age at which all the old clich\u00e9s start becoming true? She headed across the Italian marble floor to the gleaming brass-fronted lifts that were the public face of the business.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These lifts were mirrored on the inside and Frankie could see herself from every angle.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a girl, she had grown up confident in herself, confident in her tall, athletic body and never embarrassed about budding breasts or menstruation. In fact her only worry had been that her mother might run around brandishing a packet of tampons and screaming You\u2019re a woman now! at the top of her voice when Frankie had finally had her first period.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frankie had never dieted like the girls in her class at school, hadn\u2019t denied herself food, had loved her body for the things it could do, the sports it could play. She was captain of the netball team and a fabulous long distance runner with those long, lean legs. In her teenage bedroom, she\u2019d had a small haul of medals and trophies from track and field events.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For most of her life, her body had done whatever she asked of it and it never occurred to her to worry about curves here and there, or fine lines around her eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until now.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she stood on her own in the lift, harsh lights accentuating every flaw, it struck her that the woman in the charcoal skirt-suit, the subtle pearl earrings, and the long, dark hair tied up neatly into a knot, looked old.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frankie closed her eyes and waited for the lift to arrive at her floor, then marched out without another glance at herself. In her office, she switched on her computer and keyed in her password.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The instant messaging icon flashed that a message was waiting. It was from Anita, Frankie\u2019s closest friend within the company, a mother of two who was second in command in the legal department. She clicked on it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You in yet? Have gossip \u2013 not nice gossip.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where are you? typed Frankie.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About to go to canteen. Need coffee. War when I left the house. Julie knows it\u2019s my early day but she still hadn\u2019t turned up when I was leaving, Clarice was on the kitchen floor screaming, Peaches was throwing baby porridge around and Ivan was glaring at me, as if it was my fault. I only got out by the skin of my teeth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You should fire her if she\u2019s late again. I told you about giving her written warnings.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be simpler to fire Ivan. Husbands are easier to come by than good nannies. See you in five?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frankie grinned and set off for the canteen, walking at speed through the vast open-plan beige kingdom that was Dutton Insurance. She certainly didn\u2019t believe that a husband was easier to come by than a nanny. Besides, Ivan was actually a sweetie. Francesca knew it was useless to point out yet again that Julie was invariably late, barely listened to half of what Anita said and was paid as much as the head of the UN Peacekeeping Force. Last time she had said this, Anita\u2019s voice had veered into near hysteria as she protested that Julie was the one person in the world capable of managing her two children: \u2018She\u2019s been with us since Clarice was a baby and she\u2019s the only person Peaches will settle with. Even Ivan\u2019s mother can\u2019t make Peaches go to sleep \u2013 and she had eight kids.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Blimey, eight kids,\u2019 said Frankie. She\u2019d have loved more children herself, but not that many.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anita was in the empty canteen pushing a tiny dark-red pellet into the trendy Nespresso machine that the Chief Financial Officer had installed on all the floors of the company two years before, when they\u2019d achieved record profits, despite the state of the economy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In ten minutes, the canteen \u2013 which served the executive floor \u2013 would be buzzing with people in early for the monthly status meeting, attended by representatives from all the divisions. It was a largely for-show meeting because all the real business was done behind locked doors, but the CEO was keen on making everybody feel a part of the team.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Have you heard anything?\u2019 Anita said, as she waited for Frankie to get her coffee.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Heard what?\u2019 Frankie said slowly, again feeling that low drag in the pit of her stomach.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was obvious from Anita\u2019s face that, whatever she\u2019d heard, it wasn\u2019t good news.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Heard that we\u2019re in trouble, that there\u2019s a takeover on the cards.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Oh.\u2019 Frankie reached for the nearest chair and sat into it. \u2018Where did you hear it?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Oh, the usual labyrinthine methods whereby gossip gets around. Someone in the executive dining room was overheard by one of the chefs who told his girlfriend on the third floor. I heard about it last night, haven\u2019t been able to sleep. I mean, if we\u2019re taken over by another company, loads of us are going to lose our jobs. What\u2019ll I do? The mortgage is huge and we can only just manage it with both our salaries.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She looked so distraught that Frankie, who had spent her working life mentoring colleagues, ignored her own shock and pain to comfort Anita.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Now listen here,\u2019 she said, \u2018it\u2019s just a rumour. Companies thrive on that sort of stuff. Besides, whatever happens you can get through it. We can get through it. We\u2019re made of stronger stuff. We\u2019ve gone through childbirth! You had a ten-pound baby, Anita. There\u2019s nothing you cannot cope with.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The comment had the desired effect. Anita gave a snort of laughter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Yeah, I guess,\u2019 she said, shaking her head ruefully.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Baby Peaches had been a positive Goliath, taking after her tall, broad father rather than her petite five-foot-two mother.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I know there\u2019s no medal for childbirth, but there should be,\u2019 Frankie went on. \u2018A ten-pound baby \u2013 you should get gold for that. No, platinum.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They talked a while longer and then Frankie looked at her watch.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Time to move,\u2019 she said, finishing her coffee. \u2018Once more unto the breach and all that.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She hurried back to her office, rumours of a takeover now adding to the turmoil in her mind. Stay focused, she told herself. Panicking never got anyone anywhere.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the office still empty she decided to grab the chance for a speedy morning email to Emer and Alexei.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beautiful Emer, currently in Sydney but thinking of moving to the US for a few months, was waitressing by day and putting years of piano lessons to good use by playing in the restaurant of a boutique hotel by night.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s incredible here, Mum, you\u2019ve got to come out before I leave, she\u2019d emailed only last week. I love it. The sun, the people, you\u2019d love it. too.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Frankie, who had read many CVs in her time, had to come up with one word to sum up her daughter, that word would be light: the shining light that flowed out of her like the sun. Emer was vivid and sparkling and prone to mischief. Frankie had been the same as a child.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018How come you always know, Mum?\u2019 Emer would demand crossly when Frankie would take one look at her child\u2019s eyes shining naughtily in her tiny little face. \u2018You always know what I\u2019m doing \u2013 have you got X-ray vision?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Yes,\u2019 Frankie would say gravely, suppressing the urge to laugh. \u2018All mothers have it. As soon as the baby is born, kapow! \u2013 we are given the gift. I can see through ceilings. So I know you have been upstairs doing something verrry naughty.\u2019 She\u2019d drag out the syllables in pretend menace.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Emer was a kind person too, but in Sydney she was far removed from the pain in Sorrento Villa and it was out of the question to let on that there was a problem. That would only have her rushing home to help Frankie cope.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So when Emer telephoned and asked: \u2018Dad sounds down on the phone, is he all right?\u2019 Frankie made herself smile into the receiver and slipped into her cheery, buoyant tone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018No, love, he\u2019s just relaxing, taking time off from being a wage slave.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Has he started work on the house yet?\u2019 Emer said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the background, Frankie could hear happy voices and could almost sense the sunniness of Emer\u2019s new world. Wishing some of that sunniness would beam out of the phone and light up the gloom in her world, she upped the cheeriness a notch:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Not yet. We\u2019re still discussing things. You know your dad, he wants it to be perfect. Now, tell me all about you, darling. What\u2019s the weather like? It\u2019s chilly here, I can tell you \u2026\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a struggle to come up with snippets of cheerful news from home, so her emails followed the same tactic of swiftly shifting the focus from life in Redstone to the latest goings on in Sydney and Japan. It was a little trickier in Alexei\u2019s case, because he was hugely intuitive and much more liable to pick up on things. While Emer took after Frankie, drawing on a tough nugget of strength buried deep inside of her, managing to stay positive no matter what, Alexei was a worrier.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She pictured him now, with his wide Slavic cheekbones, grey eyes and the shock of blond hair, so different from everyone in the family. He might not have been born from her body, but he was very much the child of her heart. It had been a wrench, letting him go off on a gap year before college. The thought of her daughter travelling alone actually troubled her far less than the thought of her son venturing out into the world with three other boys for company. Emer had street smarts in abundance while Alexei was softer, much more vulnerable than his feisty sister, who\u2019d signed up for a self-defence course months before she left.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Got to be able to look after myself, Mum,\u2019 she\u2019d said, showing off some of her techniques.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alexei took after Seth: he was gentle, thoughtful and prone to staring into the distance when working out a problem, his mind drifting off to some higher plane just the way Seth\u2019s did.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seth. All her thoughts came back to Seth. If a person was supposed to get better at things over time, why didn\u2019t that dictum hold true when it came to marriage?\nPerhaps, she thought, closing her personal email and opening up her business mailbox where fifty new messages had arrived overnight, a visit from Seth\u2019s long-lost half-sister might succeed in lifting his spirits.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019d been so thrilled when he got the email from Melbourne. Thrilled, with a tiny and utterly-to-be-expected element of shock.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I have a sister,\u2019 he\u2019d said in wonderment as Frankie leaned over his shoulder to read the email. As she carried on reading he\u2019d sat staring at the email as if it was a thing of fantasy that might vanish at any moment. \u2018I\u2019d always wanted someone else when I was growing up, a brother or a sister. And I had one all along \u2026\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frankie hugged him, aware even then that she could support Seth over this, yet the words that would help him with the grinding pain of his redundancy escaped her. Her career as a human resources executive was built on a mastery of effective interpersonal skills, arbitration, mediation, appraisals, setting goals and accomplishing them \u2026 but when it came to Seth, instinct told her that there was nothing she could do for him. If he was going to crawl out of this misery, he would have to do it by himself. Without her help. And Frankie, who wanted to solve everyone\u2019s problems, hated herself for that.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/909631", "artist_names": "Engelbert

you just feel the moonshine?\nAnd ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?\nYes, I'm going to Carolina in my mind\n\n[Verse 1]\nKaren, she's a silver sun\nYou best walk her way and watch it shine\nWatch her watch the morning come\nA silver tear appearing now I'm crying, ain't I?\nI'm going to Carolina in my mind\n[Verse 2]\nThere ain't no doubt in no one's mind\nThat love's the finest thing around\nWhisper something soft and kind\nAnd hey, baby, the sky's on fire, I'm dying, ain't I?\nI'm going to Carolina in my mind\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my mind, I'm gone to Carolina\nCan't you see the sunshine?\nNow can't you just feel the moonshine?\nAnd ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?\nYes, I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind\n\n[Verse 3]\nDark and silent late last night\nI think I might have heard the highway call\nGeese in flight and dogs that bite\nThe signs that might be omens say I'm going, going\nGone to Carolina in my mind\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow where holy host of others standing around me\nStill I'm on the dark side of the moon\nAnd it looks like it goes on like this forever\nYou must forgive me\nIf its up and gone to Carolina in my mind\nSee James

Duke University Community, thank you for inviting me to come back to my alma mater for this important occasion. I am grateful for the honorary degree, and moved by the opportunity to address the graduating seniors.\n\nTo the Class of 2013: Let me start by saying congratulations ...\n\n... and by reminding you to thank your mothers and wish them a happy Mothers' Day ...\n\n... and by admitting that I'm still bitter about the Louisville game.\nI was a student here in 1986 when Coach K took the team to the finals for the first time. We lost to Louisville then, too, so you and I share that particular agony.\nHowever, you had the good fortune to be here on campus when Duke won its fourth national championship.\nI never got to see us cut down the nets, but I did see us beat UNC, in Chapel Hill, when Michael Jordan was the star of the team.\n\nThe fact that Michael Jordan recently turned 50 years old tells you how long it's been since I was a student.\n\nNo matter how much time passes, though, I always feel connected to Duke. I love visiting my favorite landmarks, especially the Duke Gardens, where I used to go when I was stressed out before exams and needed to clear my head. I went yesterday, because I wanted to make sure I was centered before giving this speech.\n\nThere's also my feeling of deep connection to the community my classmates created during our four years, and to the lifelong friends I made here -- in short, to the people. I doubt there is a word that captures the combination of experiences and places and people that we summarize under the label \"Duke.\" The best one I can think of is \"connected.\" And this is a word I'd like to talk about for a few minutes on your Commencement Day.\n\nIn August, 1982, I left my home in Dallas, Texas, to come here to Durham. To mark this rite of passage, my parents gave me a terrific present: the cutting-edge Olympus B12 portable typewriter, with a carrying case included. One of its best features was how light it was: Amazingly, the whole bundle weighed just 12 pounds!\n\nIt was during my time at Duke that the personal computer displaced the typewriter as the technology of choice on campus. Those of us in the computer science department actually resented the change. There were so few computers available, and all of a sudden the humanities majors were hogging our machines to write their papers.\n\nWe had to do our programming in the middle of the night, usually in the creepy basement of the old biological science building. We'd set up contests -- who programmed the fastest or made the fewest mistakes -- kind of like a prehistoric hack-a-thon. The punishment for the losers was a trip to the biology lab at the end of the hall, where they had to touch the scariest mutant frog specimens.\n\nCONNECTION, AN INTRODUCTION\n\nThe personal computer -- and later, after I'd graduated and taken a job at Microsoft, the Internet -- started a communications revolution. My kids are a few years younger than you, but raising them has proved to me that the way you communicate is the single biggest difference between you now and me a generation ago.\n\nOne popular way of describing this aspect of your lives is to say that you're \"connected.\" Some pundits have even started to refer to you as Generation C. One recent report overdid the c-thing by saying you are \"connected, communicating, content-centric, community-oriented, always clicking.\" It went on to say that, for these reasons alone, you will \"transform the world as we know it.\"\n\nOf course, all the hype about how connected you are has contributed to a counter-narrative -- that, in fact, your generation is increasingly disconnected from the things that matter. The arguments go something like this: Instead of spending time with friends, you spend it alone, collecting friend requests. Rather than savoring your food, you take pictures of it and post them on Facebook.\n\nI want to encourage you to reject the cynics who say technology is flattening your experience of the world. Please don't let anyone make you believe you are somehow shallow because you like to update your status on a regular basis.\n\nThe people who say technology has disconnected you from others are wrong. So are the people who say technology automatically connects you to others. Technology is just a tool. It's a powerful tool, but it's just a tool. Deep human connection is very different. It's not a tool. It's not a means to an end. It is the end -- the purpose and the result of a meaningful life -- and it will inspire the most amazing acts of love, generosity, and humanity.\nIn his famous speech \"Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution,\" Martin Luther King Jr. said, \"Through our scientific and technological genius, we have made of this world a neighborhood and yet we have not had the ethical commitment to make of it a brotherhood.\"\n\nWith 50 years of hindsight, I think it's fair to say Dr. King was premature in calling the world a neighborhood. Back then, Americans lumped whole continents into something they referred to as the Third World, as if the people on the other side of the planet were an undifferentiated mass whose defining feature was that they were not like us.\n\nBut as a result of the ongoing communications revolution, your world really can be a neighborhood. So the ethical commitment Dr. King spoke of is yours to live up to.\n\nWhat does it mean to make of this world a brotherhood and a sisterhood? That probably sounds like a lot to ask of you as individuals, or even as a graduating class. I'm pretty sure none of you will respond to the annoying question \"What are you going to do after graduation?\" by saying \"I plan to have the ethical commitment to make of this world a brotherhood.\"\n\nBut you can change the way you think about other people. You can choose to see their humanity first -- the one big thing that makes them the same as you, instead of the many things that make them different from you.\n\nIt is not just a matter of caring about people. I assume you already do that. It's much harder to see all people, including people whose experiences are very different from yours, as three-dimensional human beings who want and need the same things you do. But if you can really believe that all 7 billion people on the planet are equal to you in spirit, then you will take action to make the world more equal for everyone.\n\nPAUL FARMER, TESTAMENT TO CONNECTION\n\nPaul Farmer, the Duke graduate I admire most, is a testament to the deep human connection I'm talking about. As many of you know, Paul, who's here today, is a doctor and global health innovator. For years, he travelled back and forth from Boston, where he is a professor of medicine, to Haiti, where he ran a health clinic giving the highest quality care to the poorest people in the world. Now, he lives mostly in Rwanda, where he's working on changing the country's entire health care system.\n\nI first met Paul in 2003, when I went to see him in Haiti. It took us forever to walk the 100 yards from our vehicle to the clinic because he introduced me to every single person we met along the way. I am not exaggerating. Every single person.\n\nAs we moved along, he introduced each person to me by first and last name, wished their families well, and asked for an update about their lives. He hugged people when he greeted them and looked them in the eyes throughout each conversation. If you believe love plays a role in healing, there was healing happening at every step of that journey.\n\nWhen we finally reached the waiting area outside the clinic, I saw a lovely garden with a canopy of flowering vines. Paul told me he built it himself, for two reasons. First, he said, it gets hot, and he wants to his patients to be cool in the shade while they wait. Second, he wants them to see what he sees, the beauty of the world, before they have to go into the clinic for treatment.\n\nThe next day, I visited a different clinic in Haiti. The clinic was there for the same reason as Paul's -- to provide poor people with the medical care they desperately need but cannot afford. The doctors worked there for all the right reasons. But I noticed that the patients were waiting outside in the scorching sun. Inside, it felt like the doctors considered themselves health providers, and the patients were recipients. There was no sense, as there was in Paul's clinic, of an equal partnership with the community.\n\nExperiencing those two clinics one right after the other showed me that Paul made a moral choice to do the hard work of deep connection. He took the time to do the little things: provide shade, remember surnames, and make eye contact. These small acts were born of a big idea -- the boundless dignity of all people.\nTECHNOLOGY AND CONNECTION\n\nOf course, not everybody is Paul Farmer. Not everybody is going to dedicate their whole life to connecting with the poorest people in the world. But just because you don't qualify for sainthood doesn't mean you can't form deep human connections -- or that your connections can't make a difference in the world.\n\nThat's where technology comes in. If you make the moral choice to connect deeply to others, then your computer, your phone, and your tablet make it so much easier to do.\n\nToday, there are 700 million cell phone subscribers in Africa. I travelled to Kenya recently and spent a day in Kibera, which many people consider the largest slum in Africa. One image that sticks with me is all the cell phones piled up in a small kiosk where locals paid to recharge their batteries. Most people in Kibera don't have electricity -- even the cell phone charging businesses steal it from the city's power grid -- but everywhere I looked young people were on their phones. And guess what they were doing? Exactly what you do ... they were texting.\n\nYou and they can share your stories directly with each other, with literally billions of people, because you're all using the same technology.\n\nOn the Internet, you can also immerse yourselves in one another's lives -- read what the other is reading, listen to what the other is listening to, and watch what the other is watching. You can learn their language, and they can learn yours. You can find out how to cook one another's recipes. And then you can photograph the final product and post it on Facebook!\n\nNobody expects you to wake up tomorrow and randomly Skype someone in Nairobi. And sometimes it's wise to ignore emails from strangers in Nigeria offering to split a large fortune with you!\n\nBut over the course of your lives, I promise you will have many opportunities to use technology to make your world bigger: to meet more different kinds of people, and to keep in touch with more of the people you meet.\n\nThese connections are important by themselves, but the truth is, I don't want you to connect for connection's sake alone. I want you to connect because I believe it will inspire you to do something, to make a difference in the world. Humanity in the abstract will never inspire you in the same way as human beings you meet. Poverty is not going to motivate you. But people will motivate you.\n\nYOUR FIRST CONNECTION\n\nWhen my husband Bill and I started our foundation, we didn't know much about global health at all. I read the academic literature and talked to experts in the field. But most of what I learned was expressed in morbidity and mortality rates, not in flesh and blood. So in 2001, I took my first foundation learning trip, to India and Thailand, to meet with people and find out what their lives were really like behind the veil of statistics.\n\nOne of my first visits was to a tiny, impoverished village in the foothills of the Himalaya Mountains. I spent most of my day talking to women about the issues we were working on at the foundation: women and children's health, infectious diseases, and sanitation.\n\nLate in the afternoon, one of the women who'd been showing me around invited me into her home. We went inside and she produced two lawn chairs that were hanging from a nail in her kitchen. They were the aluminum folding kind with the itchy fabric seat you've sat on a million times, quite possibly when you were tenting in Krzyzewskiville. When I was growing up in Dallas, we had the same chairs. On Sunday nights in the summer, my parents and my siblings and I used to set them up on our back patio and gaze up into the sky together as a family.\n\nIt turned out my host wanted to show me her stunning view of the Himalayas, and as we sat and contemplated the planet's highest peaks, we talked about our children and the future. Our aspirations were basically the same. We wanted our children to fulfill their potential. We wanted the love and respect of family and friends. We wanted meaningful work. The biggest difference between us was not what we dreamt about, but how hard it was for her to make her dreams come true.\n\nSome people assume that Bill and I are too rich to make a connection with someone who's poor, even if our intentions are good. But adjectives like rich and poor don't define who any of us truly are as human beings. And they don't make any one individual less human than the next. The universe is like computer code in that way. Binary. There is life, and there is everything else. Zeroes and ones. I'm a one. You're a one. My friend in the Himalayas is a one.\n\nMartin Luther King was not a computer programmer, so he called this concept a brotherhood. His hope was that college students could bring a brotherhood into being. Dr. King thought the world had shrunk as much as it was going to shrink -- in his words, we'd \"dwarfed distance and placed time in chains.\" So the fact that people still didn't treat each other like brothers and sisters was, to him, an ethical failure.\n\nI take a slightly different view. I believe we are finally creating the scientific and technological tools to turn the world into a neighborhood. And that gives you an amazing ethical opportunity no one has ever had before.\n\nYou can light up a network of 7 billion people with long-lasting and highly motivating human connections.\n\nYou have spent four years at one of the world's finest universities acquiring the knowledge and skills to succeed at everything you do.\n\nSo what will you do?\n\nI hope you will use to the tool of technology to do what you already had it in your heart to do ... To connect ... To make of this world a brotherhood ... and a sisterhood ...\n\nI can't wait to see what it looks like when you do.\n\nCongratulations again.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

The first sounds from the street had told me, according to whether they came to my ears dulled and distorted by the moisture of the atmosphere or quivering like arrows in the resonant and empty area of a spacious, crisply frozen, pure morning; as soon as I heard the rumble of the first tramcar, I could tell whether it was sodden with rain or setting forth into the blue. And perhaps these sounds had themselves been forestalled by some swifter and more pervasive emanation which, stealing into my slumber, diffused in it a melancholy that seemed to presage snow, or gave utterance (through the lips of a little person who occasionally reappeared there) to so many hymns to the glory of the sun that, having first of all begun to smile in my sleep, having prepared my eyes, behind their shut lids, to be dazzled, I awoke finally amid deafening strains of music. It was, moreover, principally from my bedroom that I took in the life of the outer world during this period. I know that Bloch reported that, when he called to see me in the evenings, he could hear the sound of conversation; as my mother was at Combray and he never found anybody in my room, he concluded that I was talking to myself. When, much later, he learned that Albertine had been staying with me at the time, and realised that I had concealed her presence from all my friends, he declared that he saw at last the reason why, during that episode in my life, I had always refused to go out of doors. He was wrong. His mistake was, however, quite pardonable, for the truth, even if it is inevitable, is not always conceivable as a whole. People who learn some accurate detail of another person\u2019s life at once deduce consequences which are not accurate, and see in the newly discovered fact an explanation of things that have no connexion with it whatsoever\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I reflect now that my mistress had come, on our return from Balbec, to live in Paris under the same roof as myself, that she had abandoned the idea of going on a cruise, that she was installed in a bedroom within twenty paces of my own, at the end of the corridor, in my father\u2019s tapestried study, and that late every night, before leaving me, she used to slide her tongue between my lips like a portion of daily bread, a nourishing food that had the almost sacred character of all flesh upon which the sufferings that we have endured on its account have come in time to confer a sort of spiritual grace, what I at once call to mind in comparison is not the night that Captain de Borodino allowed me to spend in barracks, a favour which cured what was after all only a passing distemper, but the night on which my father sent Mamma to sleep in the little bed by the side of my own. So it is that life, if it is once again to deliver us from an anguish that has seemed inevitable, does so in conditions that are different, so diametrically opposed at times that it is almost an open sacrilege to assert the identity of the grace bestowed upon us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Albertine had heard from Fran\u00e7oise that, in the darkness of my still curtained room, I was not asleep, she had no scruple about making a noise as she took her bath, in her own dressing-room. Then, frequently, instead of waiting until later in the day, I would repair to a bathroom adjoining hers, which had a certain charm of its own. Time was, when a stage manager would spend hundreds of thousands of francs to begem with real emeralds the throne upon which a great actress would play the part of an empress. The Russian ballet has taught us that simple arrangements of light will create, if trained upon the right spot, jewels as gorgeous and more varied. This decoration, itself immaterial, is not so graceful, however, as that which, at eight o\u2019clock in the morning, the sun substitutes for what we were accustomed to see when we did not arise before noon. The windows of our respective bathrooms, so that their occupants might not be visible from without, were not of clear glass but clouded with an artificial and old \u2014 fashioned kind of frost. All of a sudden, the sun would colour this drapery of glass, gild it, and discovering in myself an earlier young man whom habit had long concealed, would intoxicate me with memories, as though I were out in the open country gazing at a hedge of golden leaves in which even a bird was not lacking. For I could hear Albertine ceaselessly humming:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For melancholy Is but folly\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he who heeds it is a fool\nI loved her so well that I could spare a joyous smile for her bad taste in music. This song had, as it happened, during the past summer, delighted Mme. Bontemps, who presently heard people say that it was silly, with the result that, instead of asking Albertine to sing it, when she had a party, she would substitute:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A song of farewell rises from troubled springs\n\nWhich in its turn became \u2018an old jingle of Massenet\u2019s, the child is always dinning into our ears.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A cloud passed, blotting out the sun; I saw extinguished and replaced by a grey monochrome the modest, screening foliage of the glass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The partition that divided our two dressing-rooms (Albertine\u2019s, identical with my own, was a bathroom which Mamma, who had another at the other end of the flat, had never used for fear of disturbing my rest) was so slender that we could talk to each other as we washed in double privacy, carrying on a conversation that was interrupted only by the sound of the water, in that intimacy which, in hotels, is so. often permitted by the smallness and proximity of the rooms, but which, in private houses in Paris, is so rare\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On other mornings, I would remain in bed, drowsing for as long as I chose, for orders had been given that no one was to enter my room until I had rung the bell, an act which, owing to the awkward position in which the electric bulb had been hung above my bed, took such a time that often, tired of feeling for it and glad to be left alone, I would lie back for some moments and almost fall asleep again. It was not that I was wholly indifferent to Albertine\u2019s presence in the house. Her separation from her girl friends had the effect of sparing my heart any fresh anguish. She kept it in a state of repose, in a semi-immobility which would help it to recover. But after all, this calm which my mistress was procuring for me was a release from suffering rather than a positive joy. Not that it did not permit me to taste many joys, from which too keen a grief had debarred me, but these joys, so far from my owing them to Albertine, in whom for that matter I could no longer see any beauty and who was beginning to bore me, with whom I was now clearly conscious that I was not in love, I tasted on the contrary when Albertine was not with me. And so, to begin the morning, I did not send for her at once, especially if it was a fine day. For some moments, knowing that he would make me happier than Albertine, I remained closeted with the little person inside me, hymning the rising sun, of whom I have already spoken. Of those elements which compose our personality, it is not the most obvious that are most essential. In myself, when ill health has succeeded in uprooting them one after another, there will still remain two or three, endowed with a hardier constitution than the rest, notably a certain philosopher who is happy only when he has discovered in two works of art, in two sensations, a common element. But the last of all, I have sometimes asked myself whether it would not be this little mannikin, very similar to another whom the optician at Combray used to set up in his shop window to forecast the weather, and who, doffing his hood when the sun shone, would put it on again if it was going to rain. This little mannikin, I know his egoism; I may be suffering from a choking fit which the mere threat of rain would calm; he pays no heed, and, at the first drops so impatiently awaited, losing his gaiety, sullenly pulls down his hood. Conversely, I dare say that in my last agony, when all my other \u2018selves\u2019 are dead, if a ray of sunshine steals into the room, while I am drawing my last breath, the little fellow of the barometer will feel a great relief, and will throw back his hood to sing: \u201cAh! Fine weather at last!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I rang for Fran\u00e7oise. I opened the Figaro. I scanned its columns and made sure that it did not contain an article, or so-called article, which I had sent to the editor, and which was no more than a slightly revised version of the page that had recently come to light, written long ago in Dr. Percepied\u2019s carriage, as I gazed at the spires of Martinville. Then I read Mamma\u2019s letter. She felt it to be odd, in fact shocking, that a girl should be staying in the house alone with me. On the first day, at the moment of leaving Balbec, when she saw how wretched I was, and was distressed by the prospect of leaving me by myself, my mother had perhaps been glad when she heard that Albertine was travelling with us, and saw that, side by side with our own boxes (those boxes among which I had passed a night in tears in the Balbec hotel), there had been hoisted into the \u2018Twister\u2019 Albertine\u2019s boxes also, narrow and black, which had seemed to me to have the appearance of coffins, and as to which I knew not whether they were bringing to my house life or death. But I had never even asked myself the question, being all overjoyed, in the radiant morning, after the fear of having to remain at Balbec, that I was taking Albertine with me. But to this proposal, if at the start my mother had not been hostile (speaking kindly to my friend like a mother whose son has been seriously wounded and who is grateful to the young mistress who is nursing him with loving care), she had acquired hostility now that it had been too completely realised, and the girl was prolonging her sojourn in our house, and moreover in the absence of my parents. I cannot, however, say that my mother ever made this hostility apparent. As in the past, when she had ceased to dare to reproach me with my nervous instability, my laziness, now she felt a hesitation \u2014 which I perhaps did not altogether perceive at the moment or refused to perceive \u2014 to run the risk, by offering any criticism of the girl to whom I had told her that I intended to make an offer of marriage, of bringing a shadow into my life, making me in time to come less devoted to my wife, of sowing perhaps for a season when she herself would no longer be there, the seeds of remorse at having grieved her by marrying Albertine. Mamma preferred to seem to be approving a choice which she felt herself powerless to make me reconsider. But people who came in contact with her at this time have since told me that in addition to her grief at having lost her mother she had an air of constant preoccupation. This mental strife, this inward debate, had the effect of overheating my mother\u2019s brow, and she was always opening the windows to let in the fresh air. But she did not succeed in coming to any decision, for fear of influencing me in the wrong direction and so spoiling what she believed to be my happiness. She could not even bring herself to forbid me to keep Albertine for the time being in our house. She did not wish to appear more strict than Mme. Bontemps, who was the person principally concerned, and who saw no harm in the arrangement, which greatly surprised my mother. All the same, she regretted that she had been obliged to leave us together, by departing at that very time for Combray where she might have to remain (and did in fact remain) for months on end, during which my great-aunt required her incessant attention by day and night. Everything was made easy for her down there, thanks to the kindness, the devotion of Legrandin who, gladly undertaking any trouble that was required, kept putting off his return to Paris from week to week, not that he knew my aunt at all well, but simply, first of all, because she had been his mother\u2019s friend, and also because he knew that the invalid, condemned to die, valued his attentions and could not get on without him. Snobbishness is a serious malady of the spirit, but one that is localised and does not taint it as a whole. I, on the other hand, unlike Mamma, was extremely glad of her absence at Combray, but for which I should have been afraid (being unable to warn Albertine not to mention it) of her learning of the girl\u2019s friendship with Mlle. Vinteuil. This would have been to my mother an insurmountable obstacle, not merely to a marriage as to which she had, for that matter, begged me to say nothing definite as yet to Albertine, and the thought of which was becoming more and more intolerable to myself, but even to the latter\u2019s being allowed to stay for any length of time in the house. Apart from so grave a reason, which in this case did not apply, Mamma, under the dual influence of my grandmother\u2019s liberating and edifying example, according to whom, in her admiration of George Sand, virtue consisted in nobility of heart, and of my own corruption, was now indulgent towards women whose conduct she would have condemned in the past, or even now, had they been any of her own middle-class friends in Paris or at Combray, but whose lofty natures I extolled to her and to whom she pardoned much because of their affection for myself. But when all is said, and apart from any question of propriety, I doubt whether Albertine could have put up with Mamma who had acquired from Combray, from my aunt L\u00e9onie, from all her kindred, habits of punctuality and order of which my mistress had not the remotest conception\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She would never think of shutting a door and, on the other hand, would no more hesitate to enter a room if the door stood open than would a dog or a cat. Her somewhat disturbing charm was, in fact, that of taking the place in the household not so much of a girl as of a domestic animal which comes into a room, goes out, is to be found wherever one does not expect to find it and (in her case) would \u2014 bringing me a profound sense of repose \u2014 come and lie down on my bed by my side, make a place for herself from which she never stirred, without being in my way as a person would have been. She ended, however, by conforming to my hours of sleep, and not only never attempted to enter my room but would take care not to make a sound until I had rung my bell. It was Fran\u00e7oise who impressed these rules of conduct upon her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was one of those Combray servants, conscious of their master\u2019s place in the world, and that the least that they can do is to see that he is treated with all the respect to which they consider him entitled. When a stranger on leaving after a visit gave Fran\u00e7oise a gratuity to be shared with the kitchenmaid, he had barely slipped his coin into her hand before Fran\u00e7oise, with an equal display of speed, discretion and energy, had passed the word to the kitchenmaid who came forward to thank him, not in a whisper, but openly and aloud, as Fran\u00e7oise had told her that she must do. The parish priest of Combray was no genius, but he also knew what was due him. Under his instruction, the daughter of some Protestant cousins of Mme. Sazerat had been received into the Church, and her family had been most grateful to him: it was a question of her marriage to a young nobleman of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise. The young man\u2019s relatives wrote to inquire about her in a somewhat arrogant letter, in which they expressed their dislike of her Protestant origin. The Combray priest replied in such a tone that the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise nobleman, crushed and prostrate, wrote a very different letter in which he begged as the most precious favour the award of the girl\u2019s hand in marriage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise deserved no special credit for making Albertine respect my slumbers. She was imbued with tradition. From her studied silence, or the peremptory response that she made to a proposal to enter my room, or to send in some message to me, which Albertine had expressed in all innocence, the latter realised with astonishment that she was now living in an alien world, where strange customs prevailed, governed by rules of conduct which one must never dream of infringing. She had already had a foreboding of this at Balbec, but, in Paris, made no attempt to resist, and would wait patiently every morning for the sound of my bell before venturing to make any noise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The training that Fran\u00e7oise gave her was of value also to our old servant herself, for it gradually stilled the lamentations which, ever since our return from Balbec, she had not ceased to utter. For, just as we were boarding the tram, she remembered that she had forgotten to say good-bye to the housekeeper of the Hotel, a whiskered dame who looked after the bedroom floors, barely knew Fran\u00e7oise by sight, but had been comparatively civil to her. Fran\u00e7oise positively insisted upon getting out of the tram, going back to the Hotel, saying good-bye properly to the housekeeper, and not leaving for Paris until the following day. Common sense, coupled with my sudden horror of Balbec, restrained me from granting her this concession, but my refusal had infected her with a feverish distemper which the change of air had not sufficed to cure and which lingered on in Paris. For, according to Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s code, as it is illustrated in the carvings of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, to wish for the death of an enemy, even to inflict it is not forbidden, but it is a horrible sin not to do what is expected of you, not to return a civility, to refrain, like a regular churl, from saying good-bye to the housekeeper before leaving a hotel. Throughout the journey, the continually recurring memory of her not having taken leave of this woman had dyed Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s cheeks with a scarlet flush that was quite alarming. And if she refused to taste bite or sup until we reached Paris, it was perhaps because this memory heaped a \u2018regular load\u2019 upon her stomach (every class of society has a pathology of its own) even more than with the intention of punishing us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among the reasons which led Mamma to write me a daily letter, and a letter which never failed to include some quotation from Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, there was the memory of my grandmother. Mamma would write to me: \u201cMme. Sazerat gave us one of those little luncheons of which she possesses the secret and which, as your poor grandmother would have said, quoting Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, deprive us of solitude without affording us company.\u201d In one of my own earlier letters I was so inept as to write to Mamma: \u201cBy those quotations, your mother would recognise you at once.\u201d Which brought me, three days later, the reproof: \u201cMy poor boy, if it was only to speak to me of my mother, your reference to Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 was most inappropriate. She would have answered you as she answered Mme. de Grignan: \u2018So she was nothing to you? I had supposed that you were related.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this time, I could hear my mistress leaving or returning to her room. I rang the bell, for it was time now for Andr\u00e9e to arrive with the chauffeur, Morel\u2019s friend, lent me by the Verdurins, to take Albertine out. I had spoken to the last-named of the remote possibility of our marriage; but I had never made her any formal promise; she herself, from discretion, when I said to her: \u201cI can\u2019t tell, but it might perhaps be possible,\u201d had shaken her head with a melancholy sigh, as much as to say: \u201cOh, no, never,\u201d in other words: \u201cI am too poor.\u201d And so, while I continued to say: \u201cIt is quite indefinite,\u201d when speaking of future projects, at the moment I was doing everything in my power to amuse her, to make life pleasant to her, with perhaps the unconscious design of thereby making her wish to marry me. She herself laughed at my lavish generosity. \u201cAndr\u00e9e\u2019s mother would be in a fine state if she saw me turn into a rich lady like herself, what she calls a lady who has her own \u2018horses, carriages, pictures.\u2019 What? Did I never tell you that she says that. Oh, she\u2019s a character! What surprises me is that she seems to think pictures just as important as horses and carriages.\u201d We shall see in due course that, notwithstanding the foolish ways of speaking that she had not outgrown, Albertine had developed to an astonishing extent, which left me unmoved, the intellectual superiority of a woman friend having always interested me so little that if I have ever complimented any of my friends upon her own, it was purely out of politeness. Alone, the curious genius of C\u00e9leste might perhaps appeal to me. In spite of myself, I would continue to smile for some moments, when, for instance, having discovered that Fran\u00e7oise was not in my room, she accosted me with: \u201cHeavenly deity reclining on a bed!\u201d \u201cBut why, C\u00e9leste,\u201d I would say, \u201cwhy deity?\u201d \u201cOh, if you suppose that you have anything in common with the mortals who make their pilgrimage on our vile earth, you are greatly mistaken!\u201d \u201cBut why \u2018reclining\u2019 on a bed, can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m lying in bed?\u201d \u201cYou never lie. Who ever saw anybody lie like that? You have just alighted there. With your white pyjamas, and the way you twist your neck, you look for all the world like a dove.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine, even in the discussion of the most trivial matters, expressed herself very differently from the little girl that she had been only a few years earlier at Balbec. She went so far as to declare, with regard to a political incident of which she disapproved: \u201cI consider that ominous.\u201d And I am not sure that it was not about this time that she learned to say, when she meant that she felt a book to be written in a bad style: \u201cIt is interesting, but really, it might have been written by a pig.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rule that she must not enter my room until I had rung amused her greatly. As she had adopted our family habit of quotation, and in following it drew upon the plays in which she had acted at her convent and for which I had expressed admiration, she always compared me to Assu\u00e9rus:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And death is the reward of whoso dares\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To venture in his presence unawares\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None is exempt; nor is there any whom\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or rank or sex can save from such a doom;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even I myself\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like all the rest, I by this law am bound;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, to address him, I must first be found\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By him, or he must call me to his side\n\nPhysically, too, she had altered. Her blue, almond-shaped eyes, grown longer, had not kept their form; they were indeed of the same colour, but seemed to have passed into a liquid state. So much so that, when she shut them it was as though a pair of curtains had been drawn to shut out a view of the sea. It was no doubt this one of her features that I remembered most vividly each night after we had parted. For, on the contrary, every morning the ripple of her hair continued to give me the same surprise, as though it were some novelty that I had never seen before. And yet, above the smiling eyes of a girl, what could be more beautiful than that clustering coronet of black violets? The smile offers greater friendship; but the little gleaming tips of blossoming hair, more akin to the flesh, of which they seem to be a transposition into tiny waves, are more provocative of desire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as she entered my room, she sprang upon my bed and sometimes would expatiate upon my type of intellect, would vow in a transport of sincerity that she would sooner die than leave me: this was on mornings when I had shaved before sending for her. She was one of those women who can never distinguish the cause of their sensations. The pleasure that they derive from a smooth cheek they explain to themselves by the moral qualities of the man who seems to offer them a possibility of future happiness, which is capable, however, of diminishing and becoming less necessary the longer he refrains from shaving\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I inquired where she was thinking of going\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI believe Andr\u00e9e wants to take me to the Buttes-Chaumont; I have never been there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course it was impossible for me to discern among so many other words whether beneath these a falsehood lay concealed. Besides, I could trust Andr\u00e9e to tell me of all the places that she visited with Albertine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Balbec, when I felt that I was utterly tired of Albertine, I had made up my mind to say, untruthfully, to Andr\u00e9e: \u201cMy little Andr\u00e9e, if only I had met you again sooner! It is you that I would have loved. But now my heart is pledged in another quarter. All the same, we can see a great deal of each other, for my love for another is causing me great anxiety, and you will help me to find consolation.\u201d And lo, these identical lying words had become true within the space of three weeks. Perhaps, Andr\u00e9e had believed in Paris that it was indeed a lie and that I was in love with her, as she would doubtless have believed at Balbec. For the truth is so variable for each of us, that other people have difficulty in recognising themselves in it. And as I knew that she would tell me everything that she and Albertine had done, I had asked her, and she had agreed to come and call for Albertine almost every day. In this way I might without anxiety remain at home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also, Andr\u00e9e\u2019s privileged position as one of the girls of the little band gave me confidence that she would obtain everything that I might require from Albertine. Truly, I could have said to her now in all sincerity that she would be capable of setting my mind at rest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, my choice of Andr\u00e9e (who happened to be staying in Paris, having given up her plan of returning to Balbec) as guide and companion to my mistress was prompted by what Albertine had told me of the affection that her friend had felt for me at Balbec, at a time when, on the contrary, I had supposed that I was boring her; indeed, if I had known this at the time, it is perhaps with Andr\u00e9e that I would have fallen in love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat, you never knew,\u201d said Albertine, \u201cbut we were always joking about it. Do you mean to say you never noticed how she used to copy all your ways of talking and arguing? When she had just been with you, it was too obvious. She had no need to tell us whether she had seen you. As soon as she joined us, we could tell at once. We used to look at one another, and laugh. She was like a coalheaver who tries to pretend that he isn\u2019t one. He is black all over. A miller has no need to say that he is a miller, you can see the flour all over his clothes; and the mark of the sacks he has carried on his shoulder. Andr\u00e9e was just the same, she would knit her eyebrows the way you do, and stretch out her long neck, and I don\u2019t know what all. When I take up a book that has been in your room, even if I\u2019m reading it out of doors, I can tell at once that it belongs to you because it still reeks of your beastly fumigations. It\u2019s only a trifle, still it\u2019s rather a nice trifle, don\u2019t you know. Whenever anybody spoke nicely about you, seemed to think a lot of you, Andr\u00e9e was in ecstasies.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding all this, in case there might have been some secret plan made behind my back, I advised her to give up the Buttes-Chaumont for that day and to go instead to Saint-Cloud or somewhere else\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was certainly not, as I was well aware, because I was the least bit in love with Albertine. Love is nothing more perhaps than the stimulation of those eddies which, in the wake of an emotion, stir the soul. Certain such eddies had indeed stirred my soul through and through when Albertine spoke to me at Balbec about Mlle. Vinteuil, but these were now stilled. I was no longer in love with Albertine, for I no longer felt anything of the suffering, now healed, which I had felt in the tram at Balbec, upon learning how Albertine had spent her girlhood, with visits perhaps to Montjouvain. All this, I had too long taken for granted, was healed. But, now and again, certain expressions used by Albertine made me suppose \u2014 why, I cannot say \u2014 that she must in the course of her life, short as it had been, have received declarations of affection, and have received them with pleasure, that is to say with sensuality. Thus, she would say, in any connexion: \u201cIs that true? Is it really true?\u201d Certainly, if she had said, like an Odette: \u201cIs it really true, that thumping lie?\u201d I should not have been disturbed, for the absurdity of the formula would have explained itself as a stupid inanity of feminine wit. But her questioning air: \u201cIs that true?\u201d gave on the one hand the strange impression of a creature incapable of judging things by herself, who appeals to you for your testimony, as though she were not endowed with the same faculties as yourself (if you said to her: \u201cWhy, we\u2019ve been out for a whole hour,\u201d or \u201cIt is raining,\u201d she would ask: \u201cIs that true?\u201d). Unfortunately, on the other hand, this want of facility in judging external phenomena for herself could not be the real origin of her \u201cIs that true? Is it really true?\u201d It seemed rather that these words had been, from the dawn of her precocious adolescence, replies to: \u201cYou know, I never saw anybody as pretty as you.\u201d \u201cYou know I am madly in love with you, I am most terribly excited.\u201d\u2014 affirmations that were answered, with a coquettishly consenting modesty, by these repetitions of: \u201cIs that true? Is it really true?\u201d which no longer served Albertine, when in my company, save to reply by a question to some such affirmation as: \u201cYou have been asleep for more than an hour.\u201d \u201cIs that true?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without feeling that I was the least bit in the world in love with Albertine, without including in the list of my pleasures the moments that we spent together, I was still preoccupied with the way in which she disposed of her time; had I not, indeed, fled from Balbec in order to make certain that she could no longer meet this or that person with whom I was so afraid of her misbehaving, simply as a joke (a joke at my expense, perhaps), that I had adroitly planned to sever, at one and the same time, by my departure, all her dangerous entanglements? And Albertine was so entirely passive, had so complete a faculty of forgetting things and submitting to pressure, that these relations had indeed been severed and I myself relieved of my haunting dread. But that dread is capable of assuming as many forms as the undefined evil that is its cause. So long as my jealousy was not reincarnate in fresh people, I had enjoyed after the passing of my anguish an interval of calm. But with a chronic malady, the slightest pretext serves to revive it, as also with the vice of the person who is the cause of our jealousy the slightest opportunity may serve her to practise it anew (after a lull of chastity) with different people. I had managed to separate Albertine from her accomplices, and, by so doing, to exorcise my hallucinations; even if it was possible to make her forget people, to cut short her attachments, her sensual inclination was, itself also, chronic and was perhaps only waiting for an opportunity to afford itself an outlet. Now Paris provided just as many opportunities as Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any town whatsoever, she had no need to seek, for the evil existed not in Albertine alone, but in others to whom any opportunity for enjoyment is good. A glance from one, understood at once by the other, brings the two famished souls in contact. And it is easy for a clever woman to appear not to have seen, then five minutes later to join the person who has read her glance and is waiting for her in a side street, and, in a few words, to make an appointment. Who will ever know? And it was so simple for Albertine to tell me, in order that she might continue these practices, that she was anxious to see again some place on the outskirts of Paris that she had liked. And so it was enough that she should return later than usual, that her expedition should have taken an unaccountable time, although it was perfectly easy perhaps to account for it without introducing any sensual reason, for my malady to break out afresh, attached this time to mental pictures which were not of Balbec, and which I would set to work, as with their predecessors, to destroy, as though the destruction of an ephemeral cause could put an end to a congenital malady. I did not take into account the fact that in these acts of destruction, in which I had as an accomplice, in Albertine, her faculty of changing, her ability to forget, almost to hate the recent object of her love, I was sometimes causing a profound grief to one or other of those persons unknown with whom in turn she had taken her pleasure, and that this grief I was causing them in vain, for they would be abandoned, replaced, and, parallel to the path strewn with all the derelicts of her light-hearted infidelities, there would open for me another, pitiless path broken only by an occasional brief respite; so that my suffering could end only with Albertine\u2019s life or with my own. Even in the first days after our return to Paris, not satisfied by the information that Andr\u00e9e and the chauffeur had given me as to their expeditions with my mistress, I had felt the neighbourhood of Paris to be as tormenting as that of Balbec, and had gone off for a few days in the country with Albertine. But everywhere my uncertainty as to what she might be doing was the same; the possibility that it was something wrong as abundant, vigilance even more difficult, with the result that I returned with her to Paris. In leaving Balbec, I had imagined that I was leaving Gomorrah, plucking Albertine from it; in reality, alas, Gomorrah was dispersed to all the ends of the earth. And partly out of jealousy, partly out of ignorance of such joys (a case which is rare indeed), I had arranged unawares this game of hide and seek in which Albertine was always to escape me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I questioned her point-blank: \u201cOh, by the way, Albertine, am I dreaming, or did you tell me that you knew Gilberte Swann?\u201d \u201cYes; that is to say, she used to talk to me at our classes, because she had a set of the French history notes, in fact she was very nice about it, and let me borrow them, and I gave them back the next time I saw her.\u201d \u201cIs she the kind of woman that I object to?\u201d \u201cOh, not at all, quite the opposite.\u201d But, rather than indulge in this sort of criminal investigation, I would often devote to imagining Albertine\u2019s excursion the energy that I did not employ in sharing it, and would speak to my mistress with that ardour which remains intact in our unfulfilled designs. I expressed so keen a longing to see once again some window in the Sainte-Chapelle, so keen a regret that I was not able to go there with her alone, that she said to me lovingly: \u201cWhy, my dear boy, since you seem so keen about it, make a little effort, come with us. We can start as late as you like, whenever you\u2019re ready. And if you\u2019d rather be alone with me, I have only to send Andr\u00e9e home, she can come another time.\u201d But these very entreaties to me to go out added to the calm which allowed me to yield to my desire to remain indoors\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It did not occur to me that the apathy that was indicated by my delegating thus to Andr\u00e9e or the chauffeur the task of soothing my agitation by leaving them to keep watch over Albertine, was paralysing in me, rendering inert all those imaginative impulses of the mind, all those inspirations of the will, which enable us to guess, to forestall, what some one else is about to do; indeed the world of possibilities has always been more open to me than that of real events. This helps us to understand the human heart, but we are apt to be taken in by individuals. My jealousy was born of mental images, a form of self torment not based upon probability. Now there may occur in the lives of men and of nations (and there was to occur, one day, in my own life) a moment when we need to have within us a superintendent of police, a clear-sighted diplomat, a master-detective, who instead of pondering over the concealed possibilities that extend to all the points of the compass, reasons accurately, says to himself: \u201cIf Germany announces this, it means that she intends to do something else, not just \u2018something\u2019 in the abstract but precisely this or that or the other, which she may perhaps have begun already to do.\u201d \u201cIf So-and-So has fled, it is not in the direction a or b or d, but to the point c, and the place to which we must direct our search for him is c.\u201d Alas, this faculty which was not highly developed in me, I allowed to grow slack, to lose its power, to vanish, by acquiring the habit of growing calm the moment that other people were engaged in keeping watch on my behalf\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the reason for my reluctance to leave the house, I should not have liked to explain it to Albertine. I told her that the doctor had ordered me to stay in bed. This was not true. And if it had been true, his prescription would have been powerless to prevent me from accompanying my mistress. I asked her to excuse me from going out with herself and Andr\u00e9e. I shall mention only one of my reasons, which was dictated by prudence. Whenever I went out with Albertine, if she left my side for a moment, I became anxious, began to imagine that she had spoken to, or simply cast a glance at somebody. If she was not in the best of tempers, I thought that I was causing her to miss or to postpone some appointment. Reality is never more than an allurement to an unknown element in quest of which we can never progress very far. It is better not to know, to think as little as possible, not to feed our jealousy with the slightest concrete detail. Unfortunately, even when we eliminate the outward life, incidents are created by the inward life also; though I held aloof from Albertine\u2019s expeditions, the random course of my solitary reflexions furnished me at times with those tiny fragments of the truth which attract to themselves, like a magnet, an inkling of the unknown, which, from that moment, becomes painful. Even if we live in a hermetically sealed compartment, associations of ideas, memories continue to act upon us. But these internal shocks did not occur immediately; no sooner had Albertine started on her drive than I was revivified, were it only for a few moments, by the stimulating virtues of solitude\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took my share of the pleasures of the new day; the arbitrary desire \u2014 the capricious and purely spontaneous inclination to taste them would not have sufficed to place them within my reach, had not the peculiar state of the weather not merely reminded me of their images in the past but affirmed their reality in the present, immediately accessible to all men whom a contingent and consequently negligible circumstance did not compel to remain at home. On certain fine days the weather was so cold, one was in such full communication with the street that it seemed as though a breach had been made in the outer walls of the house, and, whenever a tramcar passed, the sound of its bell throbbed like that of a silver knife striking a wall of glass. But it was most of all in myself that I heard, with intoxication, a new sound rendered by the hidden violin. Its strings are tightened or relaxed by mere changes of temperature, of light, in the world outside. In our person, an instrument which the uniformity of habit has rendered silent, song is born of these digressions, these variations, the source of all music: the change of climate on certain days makes us pass at once from one note to another. We recapture the forgotten air the mathematical inevitability of which we might have deduced, and which for the first few moments we sing without recognising it. By themselves these modifications (which, albeit coming from without, were internal) refashioned for me the world outside. Communicating doors, long barred, opened themselves in my brain. The life of certain towns, the gaiety of certain expeditions resumed their place in my consciousness. All athrob in harmony with the vibrating string, I would have sacrificed my dull life in the past, and all my life to come, erased with the india-rubber of habit, for one of these special, unique moments\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If I had not gone out with Albertine on her long drive, my mind would stray all the farther afield, and, because I had refused to savour with my senses this particular morning, I enjoyed in imagination all the similar mornings, past or possible, or more precisely a certain type of morning of which all those of the same kind were but the intermittent apparition which I had at once recognised; for the keen air blew the book open of its own accord at the right page, and I found clearly set out before my eyes, so that I might follow it from my bed, the Gospel for the day. This ideal morning filled my mind full of a permanent reality, identical with all similar mornings, and infected me with a cheerfulness which my physical ill-health did not diminish: for, inasmuch as our sense of well-being is caused not so much by our sound health as by the unemployed surplus of our strength, we can attain to it, just as much as by increasing our strength, by diminishing our activity. The activity with which I was overflowing and which I kept constantly charged as I lay in bed, made me spring from side to side, with a leaping heart, like a machine which, prevented from moving in space, rotates on its own axis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise came in to light the fire, and to make it draw, threw upon it a handful of twigs, the scent of which, forgotten for a year past, traced round the fireplace a magic circle within which, perceiving myself poring over a book, now at Combray, now at Donci\u00e8res, I was as joyful, while remaining in my bedroom in Paris, as if I had been on the point of starting for a walk along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, or of going to join Saint-Loup and his friends on the training-ground. It often happens that the pleasure which everyone takes in turning over the keepsakes that his memory has collected is keenest in those whom the tyranny of bodily ill-health and the daily hope of recovery prevent, on the one hand, from going out to seek in nature scenes that resemble those memories, and, on the other hand, leave so convinced that they will shortly be able to do so that they can remain gazing at them in a state of desire, of appetite, and not regard them merely as memories, as pictures. But, even if they were never to be anything more than memories to me, even if I, as I recalled them, saw merely pictures, immediately they recreated in me, of me as a whole, by virtue of an identical sensation, the boy, the youth who had first seen them. There had been not merely a change in the weather outside, or, inside the room, the introduction of a fresh scent, there had been in myself a difference of age, the substitution of another person. The scent, in the frosty air, of the twigs of brushwood, was like a fragment of the past, an invisible floe broken off from the ice of an old winter that stole into my room, often variegated moreover with this perfume or that light, as though with a sequence of different years, in which I found myself plunged, overwhelmed, even before I had identified them, by the eagerness of hopes long since abandoned. The sun\u2019s rays fell upon my bed and passed through the transparent shell of my attenuated body, warmed me, made me as hot as a sheet of scorching crystal. Whereupon, a famished convalescent who has already begun to batten upon all the dishes that are still forbidden him, I asked myself whether marriage with Albertine would not spoil my life, as well by making me assume the burden, too heavy for my shoulders, of consecrating myself to another person, as by forcing me to live in absence from myself because of her continual presence and depriving me, forever, of the delights of solitude\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And not of these alone. Even when we ask of the day nothing but desires, there are some \u2014 those that are excited not by things but by people \u2014 whose character it is to be unlike any other. If, on rising from my bed, I went to the window and drew the curtain aside for a moment, it was not merely, as a pianist for a moment turns back the lid of his instrument, to ascertain whether, on the balcony and in the street, the sunlight was tuned to exactly the same pitch as in my memory, it was also to catch a glimpse of some laundress carrying her linen-basket, a bread-seller in her blue apron, a dairymaid in her tucker and sleeves of white linen, carrying the yoke from which her jugs of milk are suspended, some haughty golden-haired miss escorted by her governess, a composite image, in short, which the differences of outline, numerically perhaps insignificant, were enough to make as different from any other as, in a phrase of music, the difference between two notes, an image but for the vision of which I should have impoverished my day of the objects which it might have to offer to my desires of happiness. But, if the surfeit of joy, brought me by the spectacle of women whom it was impossible to imagine a priori, made more desirable, more deserving of exploration, the street, the town, the world, it set me longing, for that very reason, to recover my health, to go out of doors and, without Albertine, to be a free man. How often, at the moment when the unknown woman who was to haunt my dreams passed beneath the window, now on foot, now at the full speed of her motor-car, was I made wretched that my body could not follow my gaze which kept pace with her, and falling upon her as though shot from the embrasure of my window by an arquebus, arrest the flight of the face that held out for me the offer of a happiness which, cloistered thus, I should never know\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of Albertine, on the other hand, I had nothing more to learn. Every day, she seemed to me less attractive. Only, the desire that she aroused in other people, when, upon hearing of it, I began to suffer afresh and was impelled to challenge their possession of her, raised her in my sight to a lofty pinnacle. Pain, she was capable of causing me; joy, never. Pain alone kept my tedious attachment alive. As soon as my pain vanished, and with it the need to soothe it, requiring all my attention, like some agonising distraction, I felt that she meant absolutely nothing to me, that I must mean absolutely nothing to her. It made me wretched that this state should persist, and, at certain moments, I longed to hear of something terrible that she had done, something that would be capable of keeping us at arms-length until I was cured, so that we might then be able to be reconciled, to refashion in a different and more flexible form the chain that bound us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, I was employing a thousand circumstances, a thousand pleasures to procure for her in my society the illusion of that happiness which I did not feel myself capable of giving her. I should have liked, as soon as I was cured, to set off for Venice, but how was I to manage it, if I married Albertine, I, who was so jealous of her that even in Paris whenever I decided to stir from my room it was to go out with her? Even when I stayed in the house all the afternoon, my thoughts accompanied her on her drive, traced a remote, blue horizon, created round the centre that was myself a fluctuating zone of vague uncertainty. \u201cHow completely,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cwould Albertine spare me the anguish of separation if, in the course of one of these drives, seeing that I no longer say anything to her about marriage, she decided not to come back, and went off to her aunt\u2019s, without my having to bid her good-bye!\u201d My heart, now that its scar had begun to heal, was ceasing to adhere to the heart of my mistress; I could by imagination shift her, separate her from myself without pain. No doubt, failing myself, some other man would be her husband, and in her freedom she would meet perhaps with those adventures which filled me with horror. But the day was so fine, I was so certain that she would return in the evening, that even if the idea of possible misbehaviour did enter my mind, I could, by an exercise of free will, imprison it in a part of my brain in which it had no more importance than would have had in my real life the vices of an imaginary person; bringing into play the supple hinges of my thought, I had, with an energy which I felt in my head to be at once physical and mental, as it were a muscular movement and a spiritual impulse, broken away from the state of perpetual preoccupation in which I had until then been confined, and was beginning to move in a free atmosphere, in which the idea of sacrificing everything in order to prevent Albertine from marrying some one else and to put an obstacle in the way of her fondness for women seemed as unreasonable to my own mind as to that of a person who had never known her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, jealousy is one of those intermittent maladies, the cause of which is capricious, imperative, always identical in the same patient, sometimes entirely different in another. There are asthmatic persons who can soothe their crises only by opening the windows, inhaling the full blast of the wind, the pure air of the mountains, others by taking refuge in the heart of the city, in a room heavy with smoke. Rare indeed is the jealous man whose jealousy does not allow certain concessions. One will consent to infidelity, provided that he is told of it, another provided that it is concealed from him, wherein they appear to be equally absurd, since if the latter is more literally deceived inasmuch as the truth is not disclosed to him, the other demands in that truth the food, the extension, the renewal of his sufferings\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is more, these two parallel manias of jealousy extend often beyond words, whether they implore or reject confidences. We see a jealous lover who is jealous only of the women with whom his mistress has relations in his absence, but allows her to give herself to another man, if it is done with his authorisation, near at hand, and, if not actually before his eyes, under his roof. This case is not at all uncommon among elderly men who are in love with young women. Such a man feels the difficulty of winning her favour, sometimes his inability to satisfy her, and, rather than be betrayed, prefers to admit to his house, to an adjoining room, some man whom he considers incapable of giving her bad advice, but not incapable of giving her pleasure. With another man it is just the opposite; never allowing his mistress to go out by herself for a single minute in a town that he knows, he keeps her in a state of bondage, but allows her to go for a month to a place which he does not know, where he cannot form any mental picture of what she may be doing. I had with regard to Albertine both these sorts of sedative mania. I should not have been jealous if she had enjoyed her pleasures in my company, with my encouragement, pleasures over the whole of which I could have kept watch, thus avoiding any fear of falsehood; I might perhaps not have been jealous either if she had removed to a place so unfamiliar and remote that I could not imagine nor find any possibility, feel any temptation to know the manner of her life. In either alternative, my uncertainty would have been killed by a knowledge or an ignorance equally complete\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decline of day plunging me back by an act of memory in a cool atmosphere of long ago, I breathed it with the same delight with which Orpheus inhaled the subtle air, unknown upon this earth, of the Elysian Fields\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But already the day was ending and I was overpowered by the desolation of the evening. Looking mechanically at the clock to see how many hours must elapse before Albertine\u2019s return, I saw that I had still time to dress and go downstairs to ask my landlady, Mme. de Guermantes, for particulars of various becoming garments which I was anxious to procure for my mistress. Sometimes I met the Duchess in the courtyard, going out for a walk, even if the weather was bad, in a close-fitting hat and furs. I knew quite well that, to many people of intelligence, she was merely a lady like any other, the name Duchesse de Guermantes signifying nothing, now that there are no longer any sovereign Duchies or Principalities, but I had adopted a different point of view in my method of enjoying people and places. All the castles of the territories of which she was Duchess, Princess, Viscountess, this lady in furs defying the weather teemed to me to be carrying them on her person, as a figure carved over the lintel of a church door holds in his hand the cathedral that he has built or the city that he has defended. But these castles, these forests, my mind\u2019s eye alone could discern them in the left hand of the lady in furs, whom the King called cousin. My bodily eyes distinguished in it only, on days when the sky was threatening, an umbrella with which the Duchess was not afraid to arm herself. \u201cOne can never be certain, it is wiser, I may find myself miles from home, with a cabman demanding a fare beyond my means.\u201d The words \u2018too dear\u2019 and \u2018beyond my means\u2019 kept recurring all the time in the Duchess\u2019s conversation, as did also: \u2018I am too poor\u2019\u2014 without its being possible to decide whether she spoke thus because she thought it amusing to say that she was poor, being so rich, or because she thought it smart, being so aristocratic, in spite of her affectation of peasant ways, not to attach to riches the importance that people give them who are merely rich and nothing else, and who look down upon the poor. Perhaps it was, rather, a habit contracted at a time in her life when, already rich, but not rich enough to satisfy her needs, considering the expense of keeping up all those properties, she felt a certain shortage of money which she did not wish to appear to be concealing. The things about which we most often jest are generally, on the contrary, the things that embarrass us, but we do not wish to appear to be embarrassed by them, and feel perhaps a secret hope of the further advantage that the person to whom we are talking, hearing us treat the matter as a joke, will conclude that it is not true\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But upon most evenings, at this hour, I could count upon finding the Duchess at home, and I was glad of this, for it was more convenient for me to ask her in detail for the information that Albertine required. And down I went almost without thinking how extraordinary it was that I should be calling upon that mysterious Mme. de Guermantes of my boyhood, simply in order to make use of her for a practical purpose, as one makes use of the telephone, a supernatural instrument before whose miracles we used to stand amazed, and which we now employ without giving it a thought, to summon our tailor or to order ices for a party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine delighted in any sort of finery. I could not deny myself the pleasure of giving her some new trifle every day. And whenever she had spoken to me with rapture of a scarf, a stole, a sunshade which, from the window or as they passed one another in the courtyard, her eyes that so quickly distinguished anything smart, had seen round the throat, over the shoulders, in the hand of Mme. de Guermantes, knowing how the girl\u2019s naturally fastidious taste (refined still further by the lessons in elegance of attire which Elstir\u2019s conversation had been to her) would not be at all satisfied by any mere substitute, even of a pretty thing, such as fills its place in the eyes of the common herd, but differs from it entirely, I went in secret to make the Duchess explain to me where, how, from what model the article had been created that had taken Albertine\u2019s fancy, how I should set about to obtain one exactly similar, in what the creator\u2019s secret, the charm (what Albertine called the \u2018chic\u2018 the \u2018style\u2019) of his manner, the precise name \u2014 the beauty of the material being of importance also \u2014 and quality of the stuffs that I was to insist upon their using\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I mentioned to Albertine, on our return from Balbec, that the Duchesse de Guermantes lived opposite to us, in the same mansion, she had assumed, on hearing the proud title and great name, that air more than indifferent, hostile, contemptuous, which is the sign of an impotent desire in proud and passionate natures. Splendid as Albertine\u2019s nature might be, the fine qualities which it contained were free to develop only amid those hindrances which are our personal tastes, or that lamentation for those of our tastes which we have been obliged to relinquish \u2014 in Albertine\u2019s case snobbishness \u2014 which is called antipathy. Albertine\u2019s antipathy to people in society occupied, for that matter, but a very small part in her nature, and appealed to me as an aspect of the revolutionary spirit \u2014 that is to say an embittered love of the nobility \u2014 engraved upon the opposite side of the French character to that which displays the aristocratic manner of Mme. de Guermantes. To this aristocratic manner Albertine, in view of the impossibility of her acquiring it, would perhaps not have given a thought, but remembering that Elstir had spoken to her of the Duchess as the best dressed woman in Paris, her republican contempt for a Duchess gave place in my mistress to a keen interest in a fashionable woman. She was always asking me to tell her about Mme. de Guermantes, and was glad that I should go to the Duchess to obtain advice as to her own attire. No doubt I might have got this from Mme. Swann and indeed I did once write to her with this intention. But Mme. de Guermantes seemed to me to carry to an even higher pitch the art of dressing. If, on going down for a moment to call upon her, after making sure that she had not gone out and leaving word that I was to be told as soon as Albertine returned, I found the Duchess swathed in the mist of a garment of grey cr\u00eape de chine, I accepted this aspect of her which I felt to be due to complex causes and to be quite inevitable, I let myself be overpowered by the atmosphere which it exhaled, like that of certain late afternoons cushioned in pearly grey by a vaporous fog; if, on the other hand, her indoor gown was Chinese with red and yellow flames, I gazed at it as at a glowing sunset; these garments were not a casual decoration alterable at her pleasure, but a definite and poetical reality like that of the weather, or the light peculiar to a certain hour of the day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of all the outdoor and indoor gowns that Mme. de Guermantes wore, those which seemed most to respond to a definite intention, to be endowed with a special significance, were the garments made by Fortuny from old Venetian models. Is it their historical character, is it rather the fact that each one of them is unique that gives them so special a significance that the pose of the woman who is wearing one while she waits for you to appear or while she talks to you assumes an exceptional importance, as though the costume had been the fruit of a long deliberation and your conversation was detached from the current of everyday life like a scene in a novel? In the novels of Balzac, we see his heroines purposely put on one or another dress on the day on which they are expecting some particular visitor. The dresses of to-day have less character, always excepting the creations of Fortuny. There is no room for vagueness in the novelist\u2019s description, since the gown does really exist, and the merest sketch of it is as naturally preordained as a copy of a work of art. Before putting on one or another of them, the woman has had to make a choice between two garments, not more or less alike but each one profoundly individual, and answering to its name. But the dress did not prevent me from thinking of the woman\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, Mme. de Guermantes seemed to me at this time more attractive than in the days when I was still in love with her. Expecting less of her (whom I no longer went to visit for her own sake), it was almost with the ease and comfort of a man in a room by himself, with his feet on the fender, that I listened to her as though I were reading a book written in the speech of long ago. My mind was sufficiently detached to enjoy in what she said that pure charm of the French language which we no longer find either in the speech or in the literature of the present day. I listened to her conversation as to a folk song deliciously and purely French, I realised that I would have allowed her to belittle Maeterlinck (whom for that matter she now admired, from a feminine weakness of intellect, influenced by those literary fashions whose rays spread slowly), as I realised that M\u00e9rim\u00e9e had belittled Baudelaire, Stendhal Balzac, Paul-Louis Courier Victor Hugo, Meilhac Mallarm\u00e9. I realised that the critic had a far more restricted outlook than his victim, but also a purer vocabulary. That of Mme. de Guermantes, almost as much as that of Saint-Loup\u2019s mother, was purified to an enchanting degree. It is not in the bloodless formulas of the writers of to-day, who say: au fait (for \u2018in reality\u2019), singuli\u00e8rement (for \u2018in particular\u2019), \u00e9tonn\u00e9 (for \u2018struck with amazement\u2019), and the like, that we recapture the old speech and the true pronunciation of words, but in conversing with a Mme. de Guermantes or a Fran\u00e7oise; I had learned from the latter, when I was five years old, that one did not say \u2018the Tarn\u2019 but \u2018the Tar\u2019; not \u2018Beam\u2019 but \u2018Bear.\u2019 The effect of which was that at twenty, when I began to go into society, I had no need to be taught there that one ought not to say, like Mme. Bontemps: \u2018Madame de Beam.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be untrue to pretend that of this territorial and semi-peasant quality which survived in her the Duchess was not fully conscious, indeed she displayed a certain affectation in emphasising it. But, on her part, this was not so much the false simplicity of a great lady aping the countrywoman or the pride of a Duchess bent upon snubbing the rich ladies who express contempt for the peasants whom they do not know as the almost artistic preference of a woman who knows the charm of what belongs to her, and is not going to spoil it with a coat of modern varnish. In the same way, everybody will remember at Dives a Norman innkeeper, landlord of the Guillaume le Conqu\u00e9rant, who carefully refrained \u2014 which is very rare \u2014 from giving his hostelry the modern comforts of an hotel, and, albeit a millionaire, retained the speech, the blouse of a Norman peasant and allowed you to enter his kitchen and watch him prepare with his own hands, as in a farmhouse, a dinner which was nevertheless infinitely better and even more expensive than are the dinners in the most luxurious hotels\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the local sap that survives in the old noble families is not enough, there must also be born of them a person of sufficient intelligence not to despise it, not to conceal it beneath the varnish of society. Mme. de Guermantes, unfortunately clever and Parisian, who, when I first knew her, retained nothing of her native soil but its accent, had at least, when she wished to describe her life as a girl, found for her speech one of those compromises (between what would have seemed too spontaneously provincial on the one hand or artificially literary on the other), one of those compromises which form the attraction of George Sand\u2019s La Petite Fadette or of certain legends preserved by Chateaubriand in his M\u00e9moires d\u2019Outre-Tombe. My chief pleasure was in hearing her tell some anecdote which brought peasants into the picture with herself. The historic names, the old customs gave to these blendings of the castle with the village a distinctly attractive savour. Having remained in contact with the lands over which it once ruled, a certain class of the nobility has remained regional, with the result that the simplest remark unrolls before our eyes a political and physical map of the whole history of France\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there was no affectation, no desire to fabricate a special language, then this manner of pronouncing words was a regular museum of French history displayed in conversation. \u2018My great-uncle Fitt-jam\u2019 was not at all surprising, for we know that the Fitz-James family are proud to boast that they are French nobles, and do not like to hear their name pronounced in the English fashion. One must, incidentally, admire the touching docility of the people who had previously supposed themselves obliged to pronounce certain names phonetically, and who, all of a sudden, after hearing the Duchesse de Guermantes pronounce them otherwise, adopted the pronunciation which they could never have guessed. Thus the Duchess, who had had a great-grandfather in the suite of the Comte de Chambord, liked to tease her husband for having turned Orleanist by proclaiming: \u201cWe old Frochedorf people. . . . \u201d The visitor, who had always imagined that he was correct in saying \u2018Frohsdorf,\u2019 at once turned his coat, and ever afterwards might be heard saying \u2018Frochedorf.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On one occasion when I asked Mme. de Guermantes who a young blood was whom she had introduced to me as her nephew but whose name I had failed to catch, I was none the wiser when from the back of her throat the Duchess uttered in a very loud but quite inarticulate voice: \u201cC\u2019est l\u2019 . . . i Eon . . . l . . . b . . . fr\u00e8re \u00e0 Robert. He makes out that he has the same shape of skull as the ancient Gauls.\u201d Then I realised that she had said: \u201cC\u2019est le petit L\u00e9on,\u201d and that this was the Prince de L\u00e9on, who was indeed Robert de Saint-Loup\u2019s brother-in-law. \u201cI know nothing about his skull,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut the way he dresses, and I must say he does dress quite well, is not at all in the style of those parts. Once when I was staying at Josselin, with the Rohans, we all went over to one of the pilgrimages, where there were peasants from every part of Brittany. A great hulking fellow from one of the L\u00e9on villages stood gaping open-mouthed at Robert\u2019s brother-in-law in his beige breeches! \u2018What are you staring at me like that for?\u2019 said L\u00e9on. \u2018I bet you don\u2019t know who I am?\u2019 The peasant admitted that he did not. \u2018Very well,\u2019 said L\u00e9on, \u2018I\u2019m your Prince.\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 said the peasant, taking off his cap and apologising. \u2018I thought you were an Englische.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if, taking this opportunity, I led Mme. de Guermantes on to talk about the Rohans (with whom her own family had frequently intermarried), her conversation would become impregnated with a hint of the wistful charm of the Pardons, and (as that true poet Pampille would say) with \u201cthe harsh savour of pancakes of black grain fried over a fire of rushes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the Marquis du Lau (whose tragic decline we all know, when, himself deaf, he used to be taken to call on Mme. H . . . who was blind), she would recall the less tragic years when, after the day\u2019s sport, at Guermantes, he would change into slippers before taking tea with the Prince of Wales, to whom he would not admit himself inferior, and with whom, as we see, he stood upon no ceremony. She described all this so picturesquely that she seemed to invest him with the plumed musketeer bonnet of the somewhat vainglorious gentlemen of the P\u00e9rigord\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even in the mere classification of different people, her care to distinguish and indicate their native provinces was in Mme. de Guermantes, when she was her natural self, a great charm which a Parisian-born woman could never have acquired, and those simple names Anjou, Poitou, the P\u00e9rigord, filled her conversation with pictorial landscapes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To revert to the pronunciation and vocabulary of Mme. de Guermantes, it is in this aspect that the nobility shews itself truly conservative, with everything that the word implies at once somewhat puerile and somewhat perilous, stubborn in its resistance to evolution but interesting also to an artist. I was anxious to know the original spelling of the name Jean. I learned it when I received a letter from a nephew of Mme. de Villeparisis who signs himself \u2014 as he was christened, as he figures in Gotha \u2014 Jehan de Villeparisis, with the same handsome, superfluous, heraldic h that we admire, illuminated in vermilion or ultramarine in a Book of Hours or in a window\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, I never had time to prolong these visits indefinitely, for I was anxious, if possible, not to return home after my mistress. But it was only in driblets that I was able to obtain from Mme. de Guermantes that information as to her garments which was of use in helping me to order garments similar in style, so far as it was possible for a young girl to wear them, for Albertine. \u201cFor instance, Madame, that evening when you dined with Mme. de Saint-Euverte, and then went on to the Princesse de Guermantes, you had a dress that was all red, with red shoes, you were marvellous, you reminded me of a sort of great blood-red blossom, a blazing ruby \u2014 now, what was that dress? Is it the sort of thing that a girl can wear?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess, imparting to her tired features the radiant expression that the Princesse des Laumes used to assume when Swann, in years past, paid her compliments, looked, with tears of merriment in her eyes, quizzingly, questioningly and delightedly at M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 who was always there at that hour and who set beaming from behind his monocle a smile that seemed to pardon this outburst of intellectual trash for the sake of the physical excitement of youth which seemed to him to lie beneath it. The Duchess appeared to be saying: \u201cWhat is the matter with him? He must be mad.\u201d Then turning to me with a coaxing air: \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that I looked like a blazing ruby or a blood-red blossom, but I do remember, as it happens, that I had on a red dress: it was red satin, which was being worn that season. Yes, a girl can wear that sort of thing at a pinch, but you told me that your friend never went out in the evening. That is a full evening dress, not a thing that she can put on to pay calls.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is extraordinary is that of the evening in question, which after all was not so very remote, Mme. de Guermantes should remember nothing but what she had been wearing, and should have forgotten a certain incident which nevertheless, as we shall see presently, ought to have mattered to her greatly. It seems that among men and women of action (and people in society are men and women of action on a minute, a microscopic scale, but are nevertheless men and women of action), the mind, overcharged by the need of attending to what is going to happen in an hour\u2019s time, confides only a very few things to the memory. As often as not, for instance, it was not with the object of putting his questioner in the wrong and making himself appear not to have been mistaken that M. de Norpois, when you reminded him of the prophecies he had uttered with regard to an alliance with Germany of which nothing had ever come, would say: \u201cYou must be mistaken, I have no recollection of it whatever, it is not like me, for in that sort of conversation I am always most laconic, and I would never have predicted the success of one of those coups d\u2019\u00e9clat which are often nothing more than coups de t\u00eate and almost always degenerate into coups de force. It is beyond question that in the remote future a Franco-German rapprochement might come into being and would be highly profitable to both countries, nor would France have the worse of the bargain, I dare say, but I have never spoken of it because the fruit is not yet ripe, and if you wish to know my opinion, in asking our late enemies to join with us in solemn wedlock, I consider that we should be setting out to meet a severe rebuff, and that the attempt could end only in disaster.\u201d In saying this M. de Norpois was not being untruthful, he had simply forgotten. We quickly forget what we have not deeply considered, what has been dictated to us by the spirit of imitation, by the passions of our neighbours. These change, and with them our memory undergoes alteration. Even more than diplomats, politicians are unable to remember the point of view which they adopted at a certain moment, and some of their palinodes are due less to a surfeit of ambition than to a shortage of memory. As for people in society, there are very few things that they remember\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes assured me that, at the party to which she had gone in a red gown, she did not remember Mme. de Chaussepierre\u2019s being present, and that I must be mistaken. And yet, heaven knows, the Chaussepierres had been present enough in the minds of both Duke and Duchess since then. For the following reason. M. de Guermantes had been the senior vice-president of the Jockey, when the president died. Certain members of the club who were not popular in society and whose sole pleasure was to blackball the men who did not invite them to their houses started a campaign against the Duc de Guermantes who, certain of being elected, and relatively indifferent to the presidency which was a small matter for a man in his social position, paid no attention. It was urged against him that the Duchess was a Dreyfusard (the Dreyfus case had long been concluded, but twenty years later people were still talking about it, and so far only two years had elapsed), and entertained the Rothschilds, that so much consideration had been shewn of late to certain great international magnates like the Duc de Guermantes, who was half German. The campaign found its ground well prepared, clubs being always jealous of men who are in the public eye, and detesting great fortunes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chaussepierre\u2019s own fortune was no mere pittance, but nobody could take offence at it; he never spent a penny, the couple lived in a modest apartment, the wife went about dressed in black serge. A passionate music-lover, she did indeed give little afternoon parties to which many more singers were invited than to the Guermantes. But no one ever mentioned these parties, no refreshments were served, the husband did not put in an appearance even, and everything went off quite quietly in the obscurity of the Rue de la Chaise. At the Opera, Mme. de Chaussepierre passed unnoticed, always among people whose names recalled the most \u2018die-hard\u2019 element of the intimate circle of Charles X, but people quite obsolete, who went nowhere. On the day of the election, to the general surprise, obscurity triumphed over renown: Chaussepierre, the second vice-president, was elected president of the Jockey, and the Duc de Guermantes was left sitting \u2014 that is to say, in the senior vice-president\u2019s chair. Of course, being president of the Jockey means little or nothing to Princes of the highest rank such as the Guermantes. But not to be it when it is your turn, to see preferred to you a Chaussepierre to whose wife Oriane, two years earlier, had not merely refused to bow but had taken offence that an unknown scarecrow like that should bow to her, this the Duke did find hard to endure. He pretended to be superior to this rebuff, asserting moreover that it was his long-standing friendship with Swann that was at the root of it. Actually his anger never cooled\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One curious thing was that nobody had ever before heard the Duc de Guermantes make use of the quite commonplace expression \u2018out and out,\u2019 but ever since the Jockey election, whenever anybody referred to the Dreyfus case, pat would come \u2018out and out.\u2019\u201cDreyfus case, Dreyfus case, that\u2019s soon said, and it\u2019s a misuse of the term. It is not a question of religion, it\u2019s out and out a political matter.\u201d Five years might go by without your hearing him say \u2018out and out\u2019 again, if during that time nobody mentioned the Dreyfus case, but if, at the end of five years, the name Dreyfus cropped up, \u2018out and out\u2019 would at once follow automatically. The Duke could not, anyhow, bear to hear any mention of the case, \u201cwhich has been responsible,\u201d he would say, \u201cfor so many disasters\u201d albeit he was really conscious of one and one only; his own failure to become president of the Jockey. And so on the afternoon in question, when I reminded Madame de Guermantes of the red gown that she had worn at her cousin\u2019s party, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 was none too well received when, determined to say something, by an association of ideas which remained obscure and which he did not illuminate, he began, twisting his tongue about between his pursed lips: \u201cTalking of the Dreyfus case \u2014\u201d (why in the world of the Dreyfus case, we were talking simply of a red dress, and certainly poor Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, whose only desire was to make himself agreeable, can have had no malicious intention). But the mere name of Dreyfus made the Duc de Guermantes knit his Jupiterian brows. \u201cI was told,\u201d Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 went on, \u201ca jolly good thing, damned clever, \u2018pon my word, that was said by our friend Cartier\u201d (we must warn the reader that this Cartier, Mme. de Villefranche\u2019s brother, was in no way related to the jeweller of that name) \u201cnot that I\u2019m in the least surprised, for he\u2019s got plenty of brains to spare,\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d broke in Oriane, \u201che can spare me his brains. I hardly like to tell you how much your friend Cartier has always bored me, and I have never been able to understand the boundless charm that Charles de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle and his wife seem to find in the creature, for I meet him there every time that I go to their house.\u201d \u201cMy dear Dutt-yess,\u201d replied Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, who was unable to pronounce the soft c, \u201cI think you are very hard upon Cartier. It is true that he has perhaps made himself rather too mutt-y-at home at the La Tr\u00e9-mo\u00eflles\u2019, but after all he does provide Tyarles with a sort of \u2014 what shall I say? \u2014 a sort of fidus Achates, which has become a very rare bird indeed in these days. Anyhow, this is the story as it was told to me. Cartier appears to have said that if M. Zola had gone out of his way to stand his trial and to be convicted, it was in order to enjoy the only sensation he had never yet tried, that of being in prison.\u201d \u201cAnd so he ran away before they could arrest him,\u201d Oriane broke in. \u201cYour story doesn\u2019t hold water. Besides, even if it was plausible, I think his remark absolutely idiotic. If that\u2019s what you call being witty!\u201d \u201cGood grate-ious, my dear Oriane,\u201d replied Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 who, finding himself contradicted, was beginning to lose confidence, \u201cit\u2019s not my remark, I\u2019m telling you it as it was told to me, take it for what\u2019s it worth. Anyhow, it earned M. Cartier a first rate blowing up from that excellent fellow La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle who, and quite rightly, does not like people to discuss what one might call, so to speak, current events, in his drawing-room, and was all the more annoyed because Mme. Alphonse Rothschild was present. Cartier had to listen to a positive jobation from La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle.\u201d \u201cI should think so,\u201d said the Duke, in the worst of tempers, \u201cthe Alphonse Rothschilds, even if they have the tact never to speak of that abominable affair, are Dreyfusards at heart, like all the Jews. Indeed that is an argument ad hominem\u201c (the Duke was a trifle vague in his use of the expression ad hominem) \u201cwhich is not sufficiently made use of to prove the dishonesty of the Jews. If a Frenchman robs or murders somebody, I do not consider myself bound, because he is a Frenchman like myself, to find him innocent. But the Jews will never admit that one of their fellow-countrymen is a traitor, although they know it perfectly well, and never think of the terrible repercussions\u201d (the Duke was thinking, naturally, of that accursed defeat by Chaussepierre) \u201cwhich the crime of one of their people can bring even to . . . Come, Oriane, you\u2019re not going to pretend that it ain\u2019t damning to the Jews that they all support a traitor. You\u2019re not going to tell me that it ain\u2019t because they\u2019re Jews.\u201d \u201cOf course not,\u201d retorted Oriane (feeling, with a trace of irritation, a certain desire to hold her own against Jupiter Tonans and also to set \u2018intellect\u2019 above the Dreyfus case). \u201cPerhaps it is just because they are Jews and know their own race that they realise that a person can be a Jew and not necessarily a traitor and anti-French, as M. Drumont seems to maintain. Certainly, if he\u2019d been a Christian, the Jews wouldn\u2019t have taken any interest in him, but they did so because they knew quite well that if he hadn\u2019t been a Jew people wouldn\u2019t have been so ready to think him a traitor a priori, as my nephew Robert would say.\u201d \u201cWomen never understand a thing about politics,\u201d exclaimed the Duke, fastening his gaze upon the Duchess. \u201cThat shocking crime is not simply a Jewish cause, but out and out an affair of vast national importance which may lead to the most appalling consequences for France, which ought to have driven out all the Jews, whereas I am sorry to say that the measures taken up to the present have been directed (in an ignoble fashion, which will have to be overruled) not against them but against the most eminent of their adversaries, against men of the highest rank, who have been flung into the gutter, to the ruin of our unhappy country.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt that the conversation had taken a wrong turning and reverted hurriedly to the topic of clothes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDo you remember, Madame,\u201d I said, \u201cthe first time that you were friendly with me?\u201d \u201cThe first time that I was friendly with him,\u201d she repeated, turning with a smile to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, the tip of whose nose grew more pointed, his smile more tender out of politeness to Mme. de Guermantes, while his voice, like a knife on the grindstone, emitted various vague and rusty sounds. \u201cYou were wearing a yellow gown with big black flowers.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear boy, that\u2019s the same thing, those are evening dresses.\u201d \u201cAnd your hat with the cornflowers that I liked so much! Still, those are all things of the past. I should like to order for the girl I mentioned to you a fur cloak like the one you had on yesterday morning. Would it be possible for me to see it?\u201d \u201cOf course; Hannibal has to be going in a moment. You shall come to my room and my maid will shew you anything you want to look at. Only, my dear boy, though I shall be delighted to lend you anything, I must warn you that if you have things from Callot\u2019s or Doucet\u2019s or Paquin\u2019s copied by some small dressmaker, the result is never the same.\u201d \u201cBut I never dreamed of going to a small dressmaker, I know quite well it wouldn\u2019t be the same thing, but I should be interested to hear you explain why.\u201d \u201cYou know quite well I can never explain anything, I am a perfect fool, I talk like a peasant. It is a question of handiwork, of style; as far as furs go, I can at least give you a line to my furrier, so that he shan\u2019t rob you. But you realise that even then it will cost you eight or nine thousand francs.\u201d \u201cAnd that indoor gown that you were wearing the other evening, with such a curious smell, dark, fluffy, speckled, streaked with gold like a butterfly\u2019s wing?\u201d \u201cAh! That is one of Fortuny\u2019s. Your young lady can quite well wear that in the house. I have heaps of them; you shall see them presently, in fact I can give you one or two if you like. But I should like you to see one that my cousin Talleyrand has. I must write to her for the loan of it.\u201d \u201cBut you had such charming shoes as well, are they Fortuny\u2019s too?\u201d \u201cNo, I know the ones you mean, they are made of some gilded kid we came across in London, when I was shopping with Consuelo Manchester. It was amazing. I could never make out how they did it, it was just like a golden skin, simply that with a tiny diamond in front. The poor Duchess of Manchester is dead, but if it\u2019s any help to you I can write and ask Lady Warwick or the Duchess of Marlborough to try and get me some more. I wonder, now, if I haven\u2019t a piece of the stuff left. You might be able to have a pair made here. I shall look for it this evening, and let you know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I endeavoured as far as possible to leave the Duchess before Albertine had returned, it often happened that I met in the courtyard as I came away from her door M. de Charlus and Morel on their way to take tea at Jupien\u2019s, a supreme favour for the Baron. I did not encounter them every day but they went there every day. Here we may perhaps remark that the regularity of a habit is generally in proportion to its absurdity. The sensational things, we do as a rule only by fits and starts. But the senseless life, in which the maniac deprives himself of all pleasure and inflicts the greatest discomforts upon himself, is the type that alters least. Every ten years, if we had the curiosity to inquire, we should find the poor wretch still asleep at the hours when he might be living his life, going out at the hours when there is nothing to do but let oneself be murdered in the streets, sipping iced drinks when he is hot, still trying desperately to cure a cold. A slight impulse of energy, for a single day, would be sufficient to change these habits for good and all. But the fact is that this sort of life is almost always the appanage of a person devoid of energy. Vices are another aspect of these monotonous existences which the exercise of will power would suffice to render less painful. These two aspects might be observed simultaneously when M. de Charlus came every day with Morel to take tea at Jupien\u2019s. A single outburst had marred this daily custom. The tailor\u2019s niece having said one day to Morel: \u201cThat\u2019s all right then, come to-morrow and I\u2019ll stand you a tea,\u201d the Baron had quite justifiably considered this expression very vulgar on the lips of a person whom he regarded as almost a prospective daughter-in-law, but as he enjoyed being offensive and became carried away by his own anger, instead of simply saying to Morel that he begged him to give her a lesson in polite manners, the whole of their homeward walk was a succession of violent scenes. In the most insolent, the most arrogant tone: \u201cSo your \u2018touch\u2019 which, I can see, is not necessarily allied to \u2018tact,\u2019 has hindered the normal development of your sense of smell, since you could allow that fetid expression \u2018stand a tea\u2019\u2014 at fifteen centimes, I suppose \u2014 to waft its stench of sewage to my regal nostrils? When you have come to the end of a violin solo, have you ever seen yourself in my house rewarded with a fart, instead of frenzied applause, or a silence more eloquent still, since it is due to exhaustion from the effort to restrain, not what your young woman lavishes upon you, but the sob that you have brought to my lips?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a public official has had similar reproaches heaped upon him by his chief, he invariably loses his post next day. Nothing, on the contrary, could have been more painful to M. de Charlus than to dismiss Morel, and, fearing indeed that he had gone a little too far, he began to sing the girl\u2019s praises in detailed terms, with an abundance of good taste mingled with impertinence. \u201cShe is charming; as you are a musician, I suppose that she seduced you by her voice, which is very beautiful in the high notes, where she seems to await the accompaniment of your B sharp. Her lower register appeals to me less, and that must bear some relation to the triple rise of her strange and slender throat, which when it seems to have come to an end begins again; but these are trivial details, it is her outline that I admire. And as she is a dressmaker and must be handy with her scissors, you must make her give me a charming silhouette of herself cut out in paper.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charlie had paid but little attention to this eulogy, the charms which it extolled in his betrothed having completely escaped his notice. But he said, in reply to M. de Charlus: \u201cThat\u2019s all right, my boy, I shall tell her off properly, and she won\u2019t talk like that again.\u201d If Morel addressed M. de Charlus thus as his \u2018boy,\u2019 it was not that the good-looking violinist was unaware that his own years numbered barely a third of the Baron\u2019s. Nor did he use the expression as Jupien would have done, but with that simplicity which in certain relations postulates that a suppression of the difference in age has tacitly preceded affection. A feigned affection on Morel\u2019s part. In others, a sincere affection. Thus, about this time M. de Charlus received a letter worded as follows: \u201cMy dear Palam\u00e8de, when am I going to see thee again? I am longing terribly for thee and always thinking of thee. PIERRE.\u201d M. de Charlus racked his brains to discover which of his relatives it could be that took the liberty of addressing him so familiarly, and must consequently know him intimately, although he failed to recognise the handwriting. All the Princes to whom the Almanach de Gotha accords a few lines passed in procession for days on end through his mind. And then, all of a sudden, an address written on the back of the letter enlightened him: the writer was the page at a gambling club to which M. de Charlus sometimes went. This page had not felt that he was being discourteous in writing in this tone to M. de Charlus, for whom on the contrary he felt the deepest respect. But he thought that it would not be civil not to address in the second person singular a gentleman who had many times kissed one, and thereby \u2014 he imagined in his simplicity \u2014 bestowed his affection. M. de Charlus was really delighted by this familiarity. He even brought M. de Vaugoubert away from an afternoon party in order to shew him the letter. And yet, heaven knows that M. de Charlus did not care to go about with M. de Vaugoubert. For the latter, his monocle in his eye, kept gazing in all directions at every passing youth. What was worse, emancipating himself when he was with M. de Charlus, he employed a form of speech which the Baron detested. He gave feminine endings to all the masculine words and, being intensely stupid, imagined this pleasantry to be extremely witty, and was continually in fits of laughter. As at the same time he attached enormous importance to his position in the diplomatic service, these deplorable outbursts of merriment in the street were perpetually interrupted by the shock caused him by the simultaneous appearance of somebody in society, or, worse still, of a civil servant. \u201cThat little telegraph messenger,\u201d he said, nudging the disgusted Baron with his elbow, \u201cI used to know her, but she\u2019s turned respectable, the wretch! Oh, that messenger from the Galeries Lafayette, what a dream! Good God, there\u2019s the head of the Commercial Department. I hope he didn\u2019t notice anything. He\u2019s quite capable of mentioning it to the Minister, who would put me on the retired list, all the more as, it appears, he\u2019s so himself.\u201d M. de Charlus was speechless with rage. At length, to bring this infuriating walk to an end, he decided to produce the letter and give it to the Ambassador to read, but warned him to be discreet, for he liked to pretend that Charlie was jealous, in order to be able to make people think that he was enamoured. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added with an indescribable air of benevolence, \u201cwe ought always to try to cause as little trouble as possible.\u201d Before we come back to Jupien\u2019s shop, the author would like to say how deeply he would regret it should any reader be offended by his portrayal of such unusual characters. On the one hand (and this is the less important aspect of the matter), it may be felt that the aristocracy is, in these pages, disproportionately accused of degeneracy in comparison with the other classes of society. Were this true, it would be in no way surprising. The oldest families end by displaying, in a red and bulbous nose, or a deformed chin, characteristic signs in which everyone admires \u2018blood.\u2019 But among these persistent and perpetually developing features, there are others that are not visible, to wit tendencies and tastes. It would be a more serious objection, were there any foundation for it, to say that all this is alien to us, and that we ought to extract truth from the poetry that is close at hand. Art extracted from the most familiar reality does indeed exist and its domain is perhaps the largest of any. But it is no less true that a strong interest, not to say beauty, may be found in actions inspired by a cast of mind so remote from anything that we feel, from anything that we believe, that we cannot ever succeed in understanding them, that they are displayed before our eyes like a spectacle without rhyme or reason. What eould be more poetic than Xerxes, son of Darius, ordering the sea to be scourged with rods for having engulfed his fleet?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We may be certain that Morel, relying on the influence which his personal attractions give him over the girl, communicated to her, as coming from himself, the Baron\u2019s criticism, for the expression \u2018stand you a tea\u2019 disappeared as completely from the tailor\u2019s shop as disappears from a drawing-room some intimate friend who used to call daily, and with whom, for one reason or another, we have quarrelled, or whom we are trying to keep out of sight and meet only outside the house. M. de Charlus was satisfied by the cessation of \u2018stand you a tea.\u2019 He saw in it a proof of his own ascendancy over Morel and the removal of its one little blemish from the girl\u2019s perfection. In short, like everyone of his kind, while genuinely fond of Morel and of the girl who was all but engaged to him, an ardent advocate of their marriage, he thoroughly enjoyed his power to create at his pleasure more or less inoffensive little scenes, aloof from and above which he himself remained as Olympian as his brother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morel had told M. de Charlus that he was in love with Jupien\u2019s niece, and wished to marry her, and the Baron liked to accompany his young friend upon visits in which he played the part of father-in-law to be, indulgent and discreet. Nothing pleased him better\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My personal opinion is that \u2018stand you a tea\u2019 had originated with Morel himself, and that in the blindness of her love the young seamstress had adopted an expression from her beloved which clashed horribly with her own pretty way of speaking. This way of speaking, the charming manners that went with it, the patronage of M. de Charlus brought it about that many customers for whom she had worked received her as a friend, invited her to dinner, introduced her to their friends, though the girl accepted their invitations only with the Baron\u2019s permission and on the evenings that suited him. \u201cA young seamstress received in society?\u201d the reader will exclaim, \u201chow improbable!\u201d If you come to think of it, it was no less improbable that at one time Albertine should have come to see me at midnight, and that she should now be living in my house. And yet this might perhaps have been improbable of anyone else, but not of Albertine, a fatherless and motherless orphan, leading so uncontrolled a life that at first I had taken her, at Balbec, for the mistress of a bicyclist, a girl whose next of kin was Mme. Bontemps who in the old days, at Mme. Swann\u2019s, had admired nothing about her niece but her bad manners and who now shut her eyes, especially if by doing so she might be able to get rid of her by securing for her a wealthy marriage from which a little of the wealth would trickle into the aunt\u2019s pocket (in the highest society, a mother who is very well-born and quite penniless, when she has succeeded in finding a rich bride for her son, allows the young couple to support her, accepts presents of furs, a motor-car, money from a daughter-in-law whom she does not like but whom she introduces to her friends)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day may come when dressmakers \u2014 nor should I find it at all shocking \u2014 will move in society. Jupien\u2019s niece being an exception affords us no base for calculation, for one swallow does not make a summer. In any case, if the very modest advancement of Jupien\u2019s niece did scandalise some people, Morel was not among them, for, in certain respects, his stupidity was so intense that not only did he label \u2018rather a fool\u2019 this girl a thousand times cleverer than himself, and foolish only perhaps in her love for himself, but he actually took to be adventuresses, dressmakers\u2019 assistants in disguise playing at being ladies, the persons of rank and position who invited her to their houses and whose invitations she accepted without a trace of vanity. Naturally these were not Guermantes, nor even people who knew the Guermantes, but rich and smart women of the middle-class, broad-minded enough to feel that it is no disgrace to invite a dressmaker to your house and at the same time servile enough to derive some satisfaction from patronising a girl whom His Highness the Baron de Charlus was in the habit \u2014 without any suggestion, of course, of impropriety \u2014 of visiting daily\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing could have pleased the Baron more than the idea of this marriage, for he felt that in this way Morel would not be taken from him. It appears that Jupien\u2019s niece had been, when scarcely more than a child, \u2018in trouble.\u2019 And M. de Charlus, while he sang her praises to Morel, would have had no hesitation in revealing this secret to his friend, who would be furious, and thus sowing the seeds of discord. For M. de Charlus, although terribly malicious, resembled a great many good people who sing the praises of some man or woman, as a proof of their own generosity, but would avoid like poison the soothing words, so rarely uttered, that would be capable of putting an end to strife. Notwithstanding this, the Baron refrained from making any insinuation, and for two reasons. \u201cIf I tell him,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cthat his ladylove is not spotless, his vanity will be hurt, he will be angry with me. Besides, how am I to know that he is not in love with her? If I say nothing, this fire of straw will burn itself out before long, I shall be able to control their relations as I choose, he will love her only to the extent that I shall allow. If I tell him of his young lady\u2019s past transgression, who knows that my Charlie is not still sufficiently enamoured of her to become jealous. Then I shall by my own doing be converting a harmless and easily controlled flirtation into a serious passion, which is a difficult thing to manage.\u201d For these reasons, M. de Charlus preserved a silence which had only the outward appearance of discretion, but was in another respect meritorious, since it is almost impossible for men of his sort to hold their tongues\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, the girl herself was charming, and M. de Charlus, who found that she satisfied all the aesthetic interest that he was capable of feeling in women, would have liked to have hundreds of photographs of her. Not such a fool as Morel, he was delighted to hear the names of the ladies who invited her to their houses, and whom his social instinct was able to place, but he took care (as he wished to retain his power) not to mention this to Charlie who, a regular idiot in this respect, continued to believe that, apart from the \u2018violin class\u2019 and the Verdurins, there existed only the Guermantes, and the few almost royal houses enumerated by the Baron, all the rest being but \u2018dregs\u2019 or \u2018scum.\u2019 Charlie interpreted these expressions of M. de Charlus literally\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among the reasons which made M. de Charlus look forward to the marriage of the young couple was this, that Jupien\u2019s niece would then be in a sense an extension of Morel\u2019s personality, and so of the Baron\u2019s power over and knowledge of him. As for \u2018betraying\u2019 in the conjugal sense the violinist\u2019s future wife, it would never for a moment have occurred to M. de Charlus to feel the slightest scruple about that. But to have a \u2018young couple\u2019 to manage, to feel himself the redoubtable and all-powerful protector of Morel\u2019s wife, who if she regarded the Baron as a god would thereby prove that Morel had inculcated this idea into her, and would thus contain in herself something of Morel, added a new variety to the form of M. de Charlus\u2019s domination and brought to light in his \u2018creature,\u2019 Morel, a creature the more, that is to say gave the Baron something different, new, curious, to love in him. Perhaps even this domination would be stronger now than it had ever been. For whereas Morel by himself, naked so to speak, often resisted the Baron whom he felt certain of reconquering, once he was married, the thought of his home, his house, his future would alarm him more quickly, he would offer to M. de Charlus\u2019s desires a wider surface, an easier hold. All this, and even, failing anything else, on evenings when he was bored, the prospect of stirring up trouble between husband and wife (the Baron had never objected to battle-pictures) was pleasing to him. Less pleasing, however, than the thought of the state of dependence upon himself in which the young people would live. M. de Charlus\u2019s love for Morel acquired a delicious novelty when he said to himself: \u201cHis wife too will be mine just as much as he is, they will always take care not to annoy me, they will obey my caprices, and thus she will be a sign (which hitherto I have failed to observe) of what I had almost forgotten, what is so very dear to my heart, that to all the world, to everyone who sees that I protect them, house them, to myself, Morel is mine.\u201d This testimony in the eyes of the world and in his own pleased M. de Charlus more than anything. For the possession of what we love is an even greater joy than love itself. Very often those people who conceal this possession from the world do so only from the fear that the beloved object may be taken from them. And their happiness is diminished by this prudent reticence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reader may remember that Morel had once told the Baron that his great ambition was to seduce some young girl, and this girl in particular, that to succeed in his enterprise he would promise to marry her, and, the outrage accomplished, would \u2018cut his hook\u2019; but this confession, what with the declarations of love for Jupien\u2019s niece which Morel had come and poured out to him, M. de Charlus had forgotten. What was more, Morel had quite possibly forgotten it himself. There was perhaps a real gap between Morel\u2019s nature \u2014 as he had cynically admitted, perhaps even artfully exaggerated it \u2014 and the moment at which it would regain control of him. As he became better acquainted with the girl, she had appealed to him, he began to like her. He knew himself so little that he doubtless imagined that he was in love with her, perhaps indeed that he would be in love with her always. To be sure his initial desire, his criminal intention remained, but glossed over by so many layers of sentiment that there is nothing to shew that the violinist would not have been sincere in saying that this vicious desire was not the true motive of his action. There was, moreover, a brief period during which, without his actually admitting it to himself, this marriage appeared to him to be necessary. Morel was suffering at the time from violent cramp in the hand, and found himself obliged to contemplate the possibility of his having to give up the violin. As, in everything but his art, he was astonishingly lazy, the question who was to maintain him loomed before him, and he preferred that it should be Jupien\u2019s niece rather than M. de Charlus, this arrangement offering him greater freedom and also a wider choice of several kinds of women, ranging from the apprentices, perpetually changing, whom he would make Jupien\u2019s niece debauch for him, to the rich and beautiful ladies to whom he would prostitute her. That his future wife might refuse to lend herself to these arrangements, that she could be so perverse never entered Morel\u2019s calculations for a moment. However, they passed into the background, their place being taken by pure love, now that his cramp had ceased. His violin would suffice, together with his allowance from M. de Charlus, whose claims upon him would certainly be reduced once he, Morel, was married to the girl. Marriage was the urgent thing, because of his love, and in the interest of his freedom. He made a formal offer of marriage to Jupien, who consulted his niece. This was wholly unnecessary. The girl\u2019s passion for the violinist streamed round about her, like her hair when she let it down, like the joy in her beaming eyes. In Morel, almost everything that was agreeable or advantageous to him awakened moral emotions and words to correspond, sometimes even melting him to tears. It was therefore sincerely \u2014 if such a word can be applied to him \u2014 that he addressed Jupien\u2019s niece in speeches as steeped in sentimentality (sentimental too are the speeches that so many young noblemen who look forward to a life of complete idleness address to some charming daughter of a middle-class millionaire) as had been steeped in unredeemed vileness the speech he had made to M. de Charlus about the seduction and deflowering of a virgin. Only there was another side to this virtuous enthusiasm for a person who afforded him pleasure and the solemn engagement that he made with her. As soon as the person ceased to afford him pleasure, or indeed if, for example, the obligation to fulfil the promise that he had made caused him displeasure, she at once became the object ef an antipathy which he justified in his own eyes and which, after some neurasthenic disturbance, enabled him to prove to himself, as soon as the balance of his nervous system was restored, that he was, even looking at the matter from a purely virtuous point of view, released from any obligation. Thus, towards the end of his stay at Balbec, he had managed somehow to lose all his money and, not daring to mention the matter to M. de Charlus, looked about for some one to whom he might appeal. He had learned from his father (who at the same time had forbidden him ever to become a \u2018sponger\u2019) that in such circumstances the correct thing is to write to the person whom you intend to ask for a loan, \u201cthat you have to speak to him on business,\u201d to \u201cask him for a business appointment.\u201d This magic formula had so enchanted Morel that he would, I believe, have been glad to lose his money, simply to have the pleasure of asking for an appointment \u2018on business.\u2019 In the course of his life he had found that the formula had not quite the virtue that he supposed. He had discovered that certain people, to whom otherwise he would never have written at all, did not reply within five minutes of receiving his letter asking to speak to them \u2018on business.\u2019 If the afternoon went by without his receiving an answer, it never occurred to him that, to put the best interpretation on the matter, it was quite possible that the gentleman addressed had not yet come home, or had had other letters to write, if indeed he had not gone away from home altogether, fallen ill, or something of that sort. If by an extraordinary stroke of fortune Morel was given an appointment for the following morning, he would accost his intended creditor with: \u201cI was quite surprised not to get an answer, I was wondering if there was anything wrong with you, I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re quite well,\u201d and so forth. Well then, at Balbec, and without telling me that he wished to talk \u2018business\u2019 to him, he had asked me to introduce him to that very Bloch to whom he had made himself so unpleasant a week earlier in the train. Bloch had not hesitated to lend him \u2014 or rather to secure a loan for him, from M. Nissim Bernard, of five thousand francs. From that moment Morel had worshipped Bloch. He asked himself with tears in his eyes how he could shew his indebtedness to a person who had saved his life. Finally, I undertook to ask on his behalf for a thousand francs monthly from M. de Charlus, a sum which he would at once forward to Bloch who would thus find himself repaid within quite a short time. The first month, Morel, still under the impression of Bloch\u2019s generosity, sent him the thousand francs immediately, but after this he doubtless found that a different application of the remaining four thousand francs might be more satisfactory to himself, for he began to say all sorts of unpleasant things about Bloch. The mere sight of Bloch was enough to fill his mind with dark thoughts, and Bloch himself having forgotten the exact amount that he had lent Morel, and having asked him for 3,500 francs instead of 4,000 which would have left the violinist 500 francs to the good, the latter took the line that, in view of so preposterous a fraud, not only would he not pay another centime but his creditor might think himself very fortunate if Morel did not bring an action against him for slander. As he said this his eyes blazed. He did not content himself with asserting that Bloch and M. Nissim Bernard had no cause for complaint against him, but was soon saying that they might consider themselves lucky that he made no complaint against them. Finally, M. Nissim Bernard having apparently stated that Thibaut played as well as Morel, the last-named decided that he ought to take the matter into court, such a remark being calculated to damage him in his profession, then, as there was no longer any justice in France, especially against the Jews (anti-semitism being in Morel the natural effect of a loan of 5,000 francs from an Israelite), took to never going out without a loaded revolver. A similar nervous reaction, in the wake of keen affection, was soon to occur in Morel with regard to the tailor\u2019s niece. It is true that M. de Charlus may have been unconsciously responsible, to some extent, for this change, for he was in the habit of saying, without meaning what he said for an instant, and merely to tease them, that, once they were married, he would never set eyes on them again but would leave them to fly upon their own wings. This idea was, in itself, quite insufficient to detach Morel from the girl; but, lurking in his mind, it was ready when the time came to combine with other analogous ideas, capable, once the compound was formed, of becoming a powerful disruptive agent\nIt was not very often, however, that I was fated to meet M. de Charlus and Morel. Often they had already passed into Jupien\u2019s shop when I came away from the Duchess, for the pleasure that I found in her society was such that I was led to forget not merely the anxious expectation that preceded Albertine\u2019s return, but even the hour of that return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I shall set apart from the other days on which I lingered at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s, one that was distinguished by a trivial incident the cruel significance of which entirely escaped me and did not enter my mind until long afterwards. On this particular afternoon, Mme. de Guermantes had given me, knowing that I was fond of them, some branches of syringa which had been sent to her from the South. When I left the Duchess and went upstairs to our flat, Albertine had already returned, and on the staircase I ran into Andr\u00e9e who seemed to be distressed by the powerful fragrance of the flowers that I was bringing home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat, are you back already?\u201d I said. \u201cOnly this moment, but Albertine had letters to write, so she sent me away.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019s up to any mischief?\u201d \u201cNot at all, she\u2019s writing to her aunt, I think, but you know how she dislikes strong scents, she won\u2019t be particularly pleased to see those syringas.\u201d \u201cHow stupid of me! I shall tell Fran\u00e7oise to put them out on the service stair.\u201d \u201cDo you imagine Albertine won\u2019t notice the scent of them on you? Next to tuberoses they\u2019ve the strongest scent of any flower, I always think; anyhow, I believe Fran\u00e7oise has gone out shopping.\u201d \u201cBut in that case, as I haven\u2019t got my latchkey, how am I to get in?\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019ve only got to ring the bell. Albertine will let you in. Besides, Fran\u00e7oise may have come back by this time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I said good-bye to Andr\u00e9e. I had no sooner pressed the bell than Albertine came to open the door, which required some doing, as Fran\u00e7oise had gone out and Albertine did not know where to turn on the light. At length she was able to let me in, but the scent of the syringas put her to flight. I took them to the kitchen, with the result that my mistress, leaving her letter unfinished (why, I did not understand), had time to go to my room, from which she called to me, and to lay herself down on my bed. Even then, at the actual moment, I saw nothing in all this that was not perfectly natural, at the most a little confused, but in any case unimportant. She had nearly been caught out with Andr\u00e9e and had snatched a brief respite for herself by turning out the lights, going to my room so that I should not see the disordered state of her own bed, and pretending to be busy writing a letter. But we shall see all this later on, a situation the truth of which I never ascertained. In general, and apart from this isolated incident, everything was quite normal when I returned from my visit to the Duchess. Since Albertine never knew whether I might not wish to go out with her before dinner, I usually found in the hall her hat, cloak and umbrella, which she had left lying there in case they should be needed. As soon as, on opening the door, I caught sight of them, the atmosphere of the house became breathable once more. I felt that, instead of a rarefied air, it was happiness that filled it. I was rescued from my melancholy, the sight of these trifles gave me possession of Albertine, I ran to greet her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the days when I did not go down to Mme. de Guermantes, to pass the time somehow, during the hour that preceded the return of my mistress, I would take up an album of Elstir\u2019s work, one of Bergotte\u2019s books, Vinteuil\u2019s sonata\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, just as those works of art which seem to address themselves to the eye or ear alone require that, if we are to enjoy them, our awakened intelligence shall collaborate closely with those organs, I would unconsciously evoke from myself the dreams that Albertine had inspired in me long ago, before I knew her, dreams that had been stifled by the routine of everyday life. I cast them into the composer\u2019s phrase or the painter\u2019s image as into a crucible, or used them to enrich the book that I was reading. And no doubt the book appeared all the more vivid in consequence. But Albertine herself profited just as much by being thus transported out of one of the two worlds to which we have access, and in which we can place alternately the same object, by escaping thus from the crushing weight of matter to play freely in the fluid space of mind. I found myself suddenly and for the instant capable of feeling an ardent desire for this irritating girl. She had at that moment the appearance of a work by Elstir or Bergotte, I felt a momentary enthusiasm for her, seeing her in the perspective of imagination and art\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently some one came to tell me that she had returned; though there was a standing order that her name was not to be mentioned if I was not alone, if for instance I had in the room with me Bloch, whom I would compel to remain with me a little longer so that there should be no risk of his meeting my mistress in the hall. For I concealed the fact that she was staying in the house, and even that I ever saw her there, so afraid was I that one of my friends might fall in love with her, and wait for her outside, or that in a momentary encounter in the passage or the hall she might make a signal and fix an appointment. Then I heard the rustle of Albertine\u2019s petticoats on her way to her own room, for out of discretion and also no doubt in that spirit in which, when we used to go to dinner at la Raspeli\u00e8re, she took care that I should have no cause for jealousy, she did not come to my room, knowing that I was not alone. But it was not only for this reason, as I suddenly realised. I remembered; I had known a different Albertine, then all at once she had changed into another, the Albertine of to-day. And for this change I could hold no one responsible but myself. The admissions that she would have made to me, easily at first, then deliberately, when we were simply friends, had ceased to flow from her as soon as she had suspected that I was in love with her, or, without perhaps naming Love, had divined the existence in me of an inquisitorial sentiment that desires to know, is pained by the knowledge, and seeks to learn yet more. Ever since that day, she had concealed everything from me. She kept away from my room if she thought that my companion was (rarely as this happened) not male but female, she whose eyes used at one time to sparkle so brightly whenever I mentioned a girl: \u201cYou must try and get her to come here. I should like to meet her.\u201d \u201cBut she has what you call a bad style.\u201d \u201cOf course, that makes it all the more fun.\u201d At that moment, I might perhaps have learned all that there was to know. And indeed when in the little Casino she had withdrawn her breast from Andr\u00e9e\u2019s, I believe that this was due not to my presence but to that of Cottard, who was capable, she doubtless thought, of giving her a bad reputation. And yet, even then, she had already begun to \u2018set,\u2019 the confiding speeches no longer issued from her lips, her gestures became reserved. After this, she had stripped herself of everything that could stir my emotions. To those parts of her life of which I knew nothing she ascribed a character the inoffensiveness of which my ignorance made itself her accomplice in accentuating. And now, the transformation was completed, she went straight to her room if I was not alone, not merely from fear of disturbing me, but in order to shew me that she did not care who was with me. There was one thing alone which she would never again do for me, which she would have done only in the days when it would have left me cold, which she would then have done without hesitation for that very reason, namely make me a detailed admission. I should always be obliged, like a judge, to draw indefinite conclusions from imprudences of speech that were perhaps not really inexplicable without postulating criminality. And always she would feel that I was jealous, and judging her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I listened to Albertine\u2019s footsteps with the consoling pleasure of thinking that she would not be going out again that evening, I thought how wonderful it was that for this girl, whom at one time I had supposed that I could never possibly succeed in knowing, the act of returning home every day was nothing else than that of entering my home. The pleasure, a blend of mystery and sensuality, which I had felt, fugitive and fragmentary, at Balbec, on the night when she had come to sleep at the hotel, was completed, stabilised, filled my dwelling, hitherto void, with a permanent store of domestic, almost conjugal bliss (radiating even into the passages) upon which all my senses, either actively, or, when I was alone, in imagination as I waited for her to return, quietly battened. When I had heard the door of Albertine\u2019s room shut behind her, if I had a friend with me, I made haste to get rid of him, not leaving him until I was quite sure that he was on the staircase, down which I might even escort him for a few steps. He warned me that I would catch cold, informing me that our house was indeed icy, a cave of the winds, and that he would not live in it if he was paid to do so. This cold weather was a source of complaint because it had just begun, and people were not yet accustomed to it, but for that very reason it released in me a joy accompanied by an unconscious memory of the first evenings of winter when, in past years, returning from the country, in order to reestablish contact with the forgotten delights of Paris, I used to go to a caf\u00e9-concert. And so it was with a song on my lips that, after bidding my friend good-bye, I climbed the stair again and entered the flat. Summer had flown, carrying the birds with it. But other musicians, invisible, internal, had taken their place. And the icy blast against which Bloch had inveighed, which was whistling delightfully through the ill fitting doors of our apartment was (as the fine days of summer by the woodland birds) passionately greeted with snatches, irrepressibly hummed, from Fragson, Mayol or Paulus. In the passage, Albertine was coming towards me. \u201cI say, while I\u2019m taking off my things, I shall send you Andr\u00e9e, she\u2019s looked in for a minute to say how d\u2019ye do.\u201d And still swathed in the big grey veil, falling from her chinchilla toque, which I had given her at Balbec, she turned from me and went back to her room, as though she had guessed that Andr\u00e9e, whom I had charged with the duty of watching over her, would presently, by relating their day\u2019s adventures in full detail, mentioning their meeting with some person of their acquaintance, impart a certain clarity of outline to the vague regions in which that excursion had been made which had taken the whole day and which I had been incapable of imagining. Andr\u00e9e\u2019s defects had become more evident; she was no longer as pleasant a companion as when I first knew her. One noticed now, on the surface, a sort of bitter uneasiness, ready to gather like a swell on the sea, merely if I happened to mention something that gave pleasure to Albertine and myself. This did not prevent Andr\u00e9e from being kinder to me, liking me better \u2014 and I have had frequent proof of this \u2014 than other more sociable people. But the slightest look of happiness on a person\u2019s face, if it was not caused by herself, gave a shock to her nerves, as unpleasant as that given by a banging door. She could allow the pains in which she had no part, but not the pleasures; if she saw that I was unwell, she was distressed, was sorry for me, would have stayed to nurse me. But if I displayed a satisfaction as trifling as that of stretching myself with a blissful expression as I shut a book, saying: \u201cAh! I have spent a really happy afternoon with this entertaining book,\u201d these words, which would have given pleasure to my mother, to Albertine, to Saint-Loup, provoked in Andr\u00e9e a sort of disapprobation, perhaps simply a sort of nervous irritation. My satisfactions caused her an annoyance which she was unable to conceal. These defects were supplemented by others of a more serious nature; one day when I mentioned that young man so learned in matters of racing and golf, so uneducated in all other respects, Andr\u00e9e said with a sneer: \u201cYou know that his father is a swindler, he only just missed being prosecuted. They\u2019re swaggering now more than ever, but I tell everybody about it. I should love them to bring an action for slander against me. I should be wonderful in the witness-box!\u201d Her eyes sparkled. Well, I discovered that the father had done nothing wrong, and that Andr\u00e9e knew this as well as anybody. But she had thought that the son looked down upon her, had sought for something that would embarrass him, put him to shame, had invented a long story of evidence which she imagined herself called upon to give in court, and, by dint of repeating the details to herself, was perhaps no longer aware that they were not true. And so, in her present state (and even without her fleeting, foolish hatreds), I should not have wished to see her, were it merely on account of that malicious susceptibility which clasped with a harsh and frigid girdle her warmer and better nature. But the information which she alone could give me about my mistress was of too great interest for me to be able to neglect so rare an opportunity of acquiring it. Andr\u00e9e came into my room, shutting the door behind her; they had met a girl they knew, whom Albertine had never mentioned to me. \u201cWhat did they talk about?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell you; I took the opportunity, as Albertine wasn\u2019t alone, to go and buy some worsted.\u201d \u201cBuy some worsted?\u201d \u201cYes, it was Albertine asked me to get it.\u201d \u201cAll the more reason not to have gone, it was perhaps a plot to get you out of the way.\u201d \u201cBut she asked me to go for it before we met her friend.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d I replied, drawing breath again. At once my suspicion revived; she might, for all I knew, have made an appointment beforehand with her friend and have provided herself with an excuse to be left alone when the time came. Besides, could I be certain that it was not my former hypothesis (according to which Andr\u00e9e did not always tell me the truth) that was correct? Andr\u00e9e was perhaps in the plot with Albertine. Love, I used to say to myself, at Balbec, is what we feel for a person whose actions seem rather to arouse our jealousy; we feel that if she were to tell us everything, we might perhaps easily be cured of our love for her. However skilfully jealousy is concealed by him who suffers from it, it is at once detected by her who has inspired it, and who when the time comes is no less skilful. She seeks to lead us off the trail of what might make us unhappy, and succeeds, for, to the man who is not forewarned, how should a casual utterance reveal the falsehoods that lie beneath it? We do not distinguish this utterance from the rest; spoken in terror, it is received without attention. Later on, when we are by ourselves, we shall return to this speech, it will seem to us not altogether adequate to the facts of the case. But do we remember it correctly? It seems as though there arose spontaneously in us, with regard to it and to the accuracy of our memory, an uncertainty of the sort with which, in certain nervous disorders, we can never remember whether we have bolted the door, no better after the fiftieth time than after the first, it would seem that we can repeat the action indefinitely without its ever being accompanied by a precise and liberating memory. At any rate, we can shut the door again, for the fifty-first time. Whereas the disturbing speech exists in the past in an imperfect hearing of it which it does not lie in our power to repeat. Then we concentrate our attention upon other speeches which conceal nothing and the sole remedy which we do not seek is to be ignorant of everything, so as to have no desire for further knowledge\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as jealousy is discovered, it is regarded by her who is its object as a challenge which authorises deception. Moreover, in our endeavour to learn something, it is we who have taken the initiative in lying and deceit. Andr\u00e9e, Aim\u00e9 may promise us that they will say nothing, but will they keep their promise? Bloch could promise nothing because he knew nothing, and Albertine has only to talk to any of the three in order to learn, with the help of what Saint-Loup would have called cross-references, that we are lying to her when we pretend to be indifferent to her actions and morally incapable of having her watched. And so, replacing in this way my habitual boundless uncertainty as to what Albertine might be doing, an uncertainty too indeterminate not to remain painless, which was to jealousy what is to grief that beginning of forgetfulness in which relief is born of vagueness, the little fragment of response which Andr\u00e9e had brought me at once began to raise fresh questions; the only result of my exploration of one sector of the great zone that extended round me had been to banish further from me that unknowable thing which, when we seek to form a definite idea of it, another person\u2019s life invariably is to us. I continued to question Andr\u00e9e, while Albertine, from discretion and in order to leave me free (was she conscious of this?) to question the other, prolonged her toilet in her own room. \u201cI think that Albertine\u2019s uncle and aunt both like me,\u201d I stupidly said to Andr\u00e9e, forgetting her peculiar nature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At once I saw her gelatinous features change. Like a syrup that has turned, her face seemed permanently clouded. Her mouth became bitter. Nothing remained in Andr\u00e9e of that juvenile gaiety which, like all the little band and notwithstanding her feeble health, she had displayed in the year of my first visit to Balbec and which now (it is true that Andr\u00e9e was now several years older) was so speedily eclipsed in her. But I was to make it reappear involuntarily before Andr\u00e9e left me that evening to go home to dinner. \u201cSomebody was singing your praises to me to-day in the most glowing language,\u201d I said to her. Immediately a ray of joy beamed from her eyes, she looked as though she really loved me. She avoided my gaze but smiled at the empty air with a pair of eyes that suddenly became quite round. \u201cWho was it?\u201d she asked, with an artless, avid interest. I told her, and, whoever it was, she was delighted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then the time came for us to part, and she left me. Albertine came to my room; she had undressed, and was wearing one of the charming cr\u00eape de chine wrappers, or one of the Japanese gowns which I had asked Mme. de Guermantes to describe to me, and for some of which supplementary details had been furnished me by Mme. Swann, in a letter that began: \u201cAfter your long eclipse, I felt as I read your letter about my tea-gowns that I was receiving a message from the other world.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine had on her feet a pair of black shoes studded with brilliants which Fran\u00e7oise indignantly called \u2018pattens,\u2019 modelled upon the shoes which, from the drawing-room window, she had seen Mme. de Guermantes wearing in the evening, just as a little later Albertine took to wearing slippers, some of gilded kid, others of chinchilla, the sight of which was pleasant to me because they were all of them signs (which other shoes would not have been) that she was living under my roof. She had also certain things which had not come to her from me, including a fine gold ring. I admired upon it the outspread wings of an eagle. \u201cIt was my aunt gave me it,\u201d she explained. \u201cShe can be quite nice sometimes after all. It makes me feel terribly old, because she gave it to me on my twentieth birthday.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine took a far keener interest in all these pretty things than the Duchess, because, like every obstacle in the way of possession (in my own case the ill health which made travel so difficult and so desirable), poverty, more generous than opulence, gives to women what is better than the garments that they cannot afford to buy, the desire for those garments which is the genuine, detailed, profound knowledge of them. She, because she had never been able to afford these things, I, because in ordering them for her I was seeking to give her pleasure, we were both of us like students who already know all about the pictures which they are longing to go to Dresden or Vienna to see. Whereas rich women, amid the multitude of their hats and gowns, are like those tourists to whom the visit to a gallery, being preceded by no desire, gives merely a sensation of bewilderment, boredom and exhaustion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A particular toque, a particular sable cloak, a particular Doucet wrapper, its sleeves lined with pink, assumed for Albertine, who had observed them, coveted them and, thanks to the exclusiveness and minute nicety that are elements of desire, had at once isolated them from everything else in a void against which the lining or the scarf stood out to perfection, and learned them by heart in every detail \u2014 and for myself who had gone to Mme. de Guermantes in quest of an explanation of what constituted the peculiar merit, the superiority, the smartness of the garment and the inimitable style of the great designer \u2014 an importance, a charm which they certainly did not possess for the Duchess, surfeited before she had even acquired an appetite and would not, indeed, have possessed for myself had I beheld them a few years earlier while accompanying some lady of fashion on one of her wearisome tours of the dressmakers\u2019 shops\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, a lady of fashion was what Albertine was gradually becoming. For, even if each of the things that I ordered for her was the prettiest of its kind, with all the refinements that had been added to it by Mme. de Guermantes or Mme. Swann, she was beginning to possess these things in abundance. But no matter, so long as she admired them from the first, and each of them separately\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we have been smitten by one painter, then by another, we may end by feeling for the whole gallery an admiration that is not frigid, for it is made up of successive enthusiasms, each one exclusive in its day, which finally have joined forces and become reconciled in one whole\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was not, for that matter, frivolous, read a great deal when she was by herself, and used to read aloud when she was with me. She had become extremely intelligent. She would say, though she was quite wrong in saying: \u201cI am appalled when I think that but for you I should still be quite ignorant. Don\u2019t contradict. You have opened up a world of ideas to me which I never suspected, and whatever I may have become I owe entirely to you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It will be remembered that she had spoken in similar terms of my influence over Andr\u00e9e. Had either of them a sentimental regard for me? And, in themselves, what were Albertine and Andr\u00e9e? To learn the answer, I should have to immobilise you, to cease to live in that perpetual expectation, ending always in a different presentment of you, I should have to cease to love you, in order to fix you, to cease to know your interminable and ever disconcerting arrival, oh girls, oh recurrent ray in the swirl wherein we throb with emotion upon seeing you reappear while barely recognising you, in the dizzy velocity of light. That velocity, we should perhaps remain unaware of it and everything would seem to us motionless, did not a sexual attraction set us in pursuit of you, drops of gold always different, and always passing our expectation! On each occasion a girl so little resembles what she was the time before (shattering in fragments as soon as we catch sight of her the memory that we had retained of her and the desire that we were proposing to gratify), that the stability of nature which we ascribe to her is purely fictitious and a convenience of speech. We have been told that some pretty girl is tender, loving, full of the most delicate sentiments. Our imagination accepts this assurance, and when we behold for the first time, within the woven girdle of her golden hair, the rosy disc of her face, we are almost afraid that this too virtuous sister may chill our ardour by her very virtue, that she can never be to us the lover for whom we have been longing. What secrets, at least, we confide in her from the first moment, on the strength of that nobility of heart, what plans we discuss together. But a few days later, we regret that we were so confiding, for the rose-leaf girl, at our second meeting, addresses us in the language of a lascivious Fury. As for the successive portraits which after a pulsation lasting for some days the renewal of the rosy light presents to us, it is not even certain that a momentum external to these girls has not modified their aspect, and this might well have happened with my band of girls at Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People extol to us the gentleness, the purity of a virgin. But afterwards they feel that something more seasoned would please us better, and recommend her to shew more boldness. In herself was she one more than the other? Perhaps not, but capable of yielding to any number of different possibilities in the headlong current of life. With another girl, whose whole attraction lay in something implacable (which we counted upon subduing to our own will), as, for instance, with the terrible jumping girl at Balbec who grazed in her spring the bald pates of startled old gentlemen, what a disappointment when, in the fresh aspect of her, just as we were addressing her in affectionate speeches stimulated by our memory of all her cruelty to other people, we heard her, as her first move in the game, tell us that she was shy, that she could never say anything intelligent to anyone at a first introduction, so frightened was she, and that it was only after a fortnight or so that she would be able to talk to us at her ease. The steel had turned to cotton, there was nothing left for us to attempt to break, since she herself had lost all her consistency. Of her own accord, but by our fault perhaps, for the tender words which we had addressed to Severity had perhaps, even without any deliberate calculation on her part, suggested to her that she ought to be gentle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Distressing as the change may have been to us, it was not altogether maladroit, for our gratitude for all her gentleness would exact more from us perhaps than our delight at overcoming her cruelty. I do not say that a day will not come when, even to these luminous maidens, we shall not assign sharply differentiated characters, but that will be because they have ceased to interest us, because their entry upon the scene will no longer be to our heart the apparition which it expected in a different form and which leaves it overwhelmed every time by fresh incarnations. Their immobility will spring from our indifference to them, which will hand them over to the judgment of our mind. This will not, for that matter, be expressed in any more categorical terms, for after it has decided that some defect which was prominent in one is fortunately absent from the other, it will see that this defect had as its counterpart some priceless merit. So that the false judgment of our intellect, which comes into play only when we have ceased to take any interest, will define permanent characters of girls, which will enlighten us no more than the surprising faces that used to appear every day when, in the dizzy speed of our expectation, our friends presented themselves daily, weekly, too different to allow us, as they never halted in their passage, to classify them, to award degrees of merit. As for our sentiments, we have spoken of them too often to repeat again now that as often as not love is nothing more than the association of the face of a girl (whom otherwise we should soon have found intolerable) with the heartbeats inseparable from an endless, vain expectation, and from some trick that she has played upon us. All this is true not merely of imaginative young men brought into contact with changeable girls. At the stage that our narrative has now reached, it appears, as I have since heard, that Jupien\u2019s niece had altered her opinion of Morel and M. de Charlus. My motorist, reinforcing the love that she felt for Morel, had extolled to her, as existing in the violinist, boundless refinements of delicacy in which she was all too ready to believe. And at the same time Morel never ceased to complain to her of the despotic treatment that he received from M. de Charlus, which she ascribed to malevolence, never imagining that it could be due to love. She was moreover bound to acknowledge that M. de Charlus was tyrannically present at all their meetings. In corroboration of all this, she had heard women in society speak of the Baron\u2019s terrible spite. Now, quite recently, her judgment had been completely reversed. She had discovered in Morel (without ceasing for that reason to love him) depths of malevolence and perfidy, compensated it was true by frequent kindness and genuine feeling, and in M. de Charlus an unimaginable and immense generosity blended with asperities of which she knew nothing. And so she had been unable to arrive at any more definite judgment of what, each in himself, the violinist and his protector really were, than I was able to form of Andr\u00e9e, whom nevertheless I saw every day, or of Albertine who was living with me. On the evenings when the latter did not read aloud to me, she would play to me or begin a game of draughts, or a conversation, either of which I would interrupt with kisses. The simplicity of our relations made them soothing. The very emptiness of her life gave Albertine a sort of eagerness to comply with the only requests that I made of her. Behind this girl, as behind the purple light that used to filter beneath the curtains of my room at Balbec, while outside the concert blared, were shining the blue-green undulations of the sea. Was she not, after all (she in whose heart of hearts there was now regularly installed an idea of myself so familiar that, next to her aunt, I was perhaps the person whom she distinguished least from herself), the girl whom I had seen the first time at Balbec, in her flat polo-cap, with her insistent laughing eyes, a stranger still, exiguous as a silhouette projected against the waves? These effigies preserved intact in our memory, when we recapture them, we are astonished at their unlikeness to the person whom we know, and we begin to realise what a task of remodelling is performed every day by habit. In the charm that Albertine had in Paris, by my fireside, there still survived the desire that had been aroused in me by that insolent and blossoming parade along the beach, and just as Rachel retained in Saint-Loup\u2019s eyes, even after he had made her abandon it, the prestige of her life on the stage, so in this Albertine cloistered in my house, far from Balbec, from which I had hurried her away, there persisted the emotion, the social confusion, the uneasy vanity, the roving desires of life by the seaside. She was so effectively caged that on certain evenings I did not even ask her to leave her room for mine, her to whom at one time all the world gave chase, whom I had found it so hard to overtake as she sped past on her bicycle, whom the lift-boy himself was unable to capture for me, leaving me with scarcely a hope of her coming, although I sat up waiting for her all the night. Had not Albertine been \u2014 out there in front of the Hotel \u2014 like a great actress of the blazing beach, arousing jealousy when she advanced upon that natural stage, not speaking to anyone, thrusting past its regular frequenters, dominating the girls, her friends, and was not this so greatly coveted actress the same who, withdrawn by me from the stage, shut up in my house, was out of reach now of the desires of all the rest, who might hereafter seek for her in vain, sitting now in my room, now in her own, and engaged in tracing or cutting out some pattern?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt, in the first days at Balbec, Albertine seemed to be on a parallel plane to that upon which I was living, but one that had drawn closer (after my visit to Elstir) and had finally become merged in it, as my relations with her, at Balbec, in Paris, then at Balbec again, grew more intimate. Besides, between the two pictures of Balbec, at my first visit and at my second, pictures composed of the same villas from which the same girls walked down to the same sea, what a difference! In Albertine\u2019s friends at the time of my second visit, whom I knew so well, whose good and bad qualities were so clearly engraved on their features, how was I to recapture those fresh, mysterious strangers who at first could not, without making my heart throb, thrust open the door of their bungalow over the grinding sand and set the tamarisks shivering as they came down the path! Their huge eyes had, in the interval, been absorbed into their faces, doubtless because they had ceased to be children, but also because those ravishing strangers, those ravishing actresses of the romantic first year, as to whom I had gone ceaselessly in quest of information, no longer held any mystery for me. They had become obedient to my caprices, a mere grove of budding girls, from among whom I was quite distinctly proud of having plucked, and carried off from them all, their fairest rose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Between the two Balbec scenes, so different one from the other, there was the interval of several years in Paris, the long expanse of which was dotted with all the visits that Albertine had paid me. I saw her in successive years of my life occupying, with regard to myself, different positions, which made me feel the beauty of the interposed gaps, that long extent of time in which I never set eyes on her and against the diaphanous background of which the rosy person that I saw before me was modelled with mysterious shadows and in bold relief. This was due also to the superimposition not merely of the successive images which Albertine had been for me, but also of the great qualities of brain and heart, the defects of character, all alike unsuspected by me, which Albertine, in a germination, a multiplication of herself, a carnal efflorescence in sombre colours, had added to a nature that formerly could scarcely have been said to exist, but was now deep beyond plumbing. For other people, even those of whom we have so often dreamed that they have become nothing more than a picture, a figure by Benozzo Gozzoli standing out upon a background of verdure, as to whom we were prepared to believe that the only variations depended upon the point of view from which we looked at them, their distance from us, the effect of light and shade, these people, while they change in relation to ourselves, change also in themselves, and there had been an enrichment, a solidification and an increase of volume in the figure once so simply outlined against the sea. Moreover, it was not only the sea at the close of day that came to life for me in Albertine, but sometimes the drowsy murmur of the sea upon the shore on moonlit nights\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, indeed, when I rose to fetch a book from my father\u2019s study, and had given my mistress permission to lie down while I was out of the room, she was so tired after her long outing in the morning and afternoon in the open air that, even if I had been away for a moment only, when I returned I found Albertine asleep and did not rouse her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stretched out at full length upon my bed, in an attitude so natural that no art could have designed it, she reminded me of a long blossoming stem that had been laid there, and so indeed she was: the faculty of dreaming which I possessed only in her absence I recovered at such moments in her presence, as though by falling asleep she had become a plant. In this way her sleep did to a certain extent make love possible. When she was present, I spoke to her, but I was too far absent from myself to be able to think. When she was asleep, I no longer needed to talk to her, I knew that she was no longer looking at me, I had no longer any need to live upon my own outer surface\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By shutting her eyes, by losing consciousness, Albertine had stripped off, one after another, the different human characters with which she had deceived me ever since the day when I had first made her acquaintance. She was animated now only by the unconscious life of vegetation, of trees, a life more different from my own, more alien, and yet one that belonged more to me. Her personality did not escape at every moment, as when we were talking, by the channels of her unacknowledged thoughts and of her gaze. She had called back into herself everything of her that lay outside, had taken refuge, enclosed, reabsorbed, in her body. In keeping her before my eyes, in my hands, I had that impression of possessing her altogether, which I never had when she was awake. Her life was submitted to me, exhaled towards me its gentle breath\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I listened to this murmuring, mysterious emanation, soft as a breeze from the sea, fairylike as that moonlight which was her sleep. So long as it lasted, I was free to think about her and at the same time to look at her, and, when her sleep grew deeper, to touch, to kiss her. What I felt then was love in the presence of something as pure, as immaterial in its feelings, as mysterious, as if I had been in the presence of those inanimate creatures which are the beauties of nature. And indeed, as soon as her sleep became at all heavy, she ceased to be merely the plant that she had been; her sleep, on the margin of which I remained musing, with a fresh delight of which I never tired, but could have gone on enjoying indefinitely, was to me an undiscovered country. Her sleep brought within my reach something as calm, as sensually delicious as those nights of full moon on the bay of Balbec, turned quiet as a lake over which the branches barely stir, where stretched out upon the sand one could listen for hours on end to the waves breaking and receding\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I entered the room, I remained standing in the doorway, not venturing to make a sound, and hearing none but that of her breath rising to expire upon her lips at regular intervals, like the reflux of the sea, but drowsier and more gentle. And at the moment when my ear absorbed that divine sound, I felt that there was, condensed in it, the whole person, the whole life of the charming captive, outstretched there before my eyes. Carriages went rattling past in the street, her features remained as motionless, as pure, her breath as light, reduced to the simplest expulsion of the necessary quantity of air. Then, seeing that her sleep would not be disturbed, I advanced cautiously, sat down upon the chair that stood by the bedside, then upon the bed itself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have spent charming evenings talking, playing games with Albertine. but never any so pleasant as when I was watching her sleep. Granted that she might have, as she chatted with me, or played cards, that spontaneity which no actress could have imitated, it was a spontaneity carried to the second degree that was offered me by her sleep. Her hair, falling all along her rosy face, was spread out beside her on the bed, and here and there a separate straight tress gave the same effect of perspective as those moonlit trees, lank and pale, which one sees standing erect and stiff in the backgrounds of Elstir\u2019s Raphaelesque pictures. If Albertine\u2019s lips were closed, her eyelids, on the other hand, seen from the point at which I was standing, seemed so loosely joined that I might almost have questioned whether she really was asleep. At the same time those drooping lids introduced into her face that perfect continuity, unbroken by any intrusion of eyes. There are people whose faces assume a quite unusual beauty and majesty the moment they cease to look out of their eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I measured with my own Albertine outstretched at my feet. Now and then a slight, unaccountable tremor ran through her body, as the leaves of a tree are shaken for a few moments by a sudden breath of wind. She would touch her hair, then, not having arranged it to her liking, would raise her hand to it again with motions so consecutive, so deliberate, that I was convinced that she was about to wake. Not at all, she grew calm again in the sleep from which she had not emerged. After this she lay without moving. She had laid her hand on her bosom with a sinking of the arm so artlessly childlike that I was obliged, as I gazed at her, to suppress the smile that is provoked in us by the solemnity, the innocence and the charm of little children\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I, who was acquainted with many Albertines in one person, seemed now to see many more again, reposing by my side. Her eyebrows, arched as I had never seen them, enclosed the globes of her eyelids like a halcyon\u2019s downy nest. Races, atavisms, vices reposed upon her face. Whenever she moved her head, she created a fresh woman, often one whose existence I had never suspected. I seemed to possess not one, but innumerable girls. Her breathing, as it became gradually deeper, was now regularly stirring her bosom and, through it, her folded hands, her pearls, displaced in a different way by the same movement, like the boats, the anchor chains that are set swaying by the movement of the tide. Then, feeling that the tide of her sleep was full, that I should not ground upon reefs of consciousness covered now by the high water of profound slumber, deliberately, I crept without a sound upon the bed, lay down by her side, clasped her waist in one arm, placed my lips upon her cheek and heart, then upon every part of her body in turn laid my free hand, which also was raised, like the pearls, by Albertine\u2019s breathing; I myself was gently rocked by its regular motion: I had embarked upon the tide of Albertine\u2019s sleep. Sometimes it made me taste a pleasure that was less pure. For this I had no need to make any movement, I allowed my leg to dangle against hers, like an oar which one allows to trail in the water, imparting to it now and again a gentle oscillation like the intermittent flap given to its wing by a bird asleep in the air. I chose, in gazing at her, this aspect of her face which no one ever saw and which was so pleasing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is I suppose comprehensible that the letters which we receive from a person are more or less similar and combine to trace an image of the writer so different from the person whom we know as to constitute a second personality. But how much stranger is it that a woman should be conjoined, like Rosita and Doodica, with another woman whose different beauty makes us infer another character, and that in order to behold one we must look at her in profile, the other in full face. The sound of her breathing as it grew louder might give the illusion of the breathless ecstasy of pleasure and, when mine was at its climax, I could kiss her without having interrupted her sleep. I felt at such moments that I had been possessing her more completely, like an unconscious and unresisting object of dumb nature. I was not affected by the words that she muttered occasionally in her sleep, their meaning escaped me, and besides, whoever the unknown person to whom they referred, it was upon my hand, upon my cheek that her hand, as an occasional tremor recalled it to life, stiffened for an instant. I relished her sleep with a disinterested, soothing love, just as I would remain for hours listening to the unfurling of the waves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps it is laid down that people must be capable of making us suffer intensely before, in the hours of respite, they can procure for us the same soothing calm as Nature. I had not to answer her as when we were engaged in conversation, and even if I could have remained silent, as for that matter I did when it was she that was talking, still while listening to her voice I did not penetrate so far into herself. As I continued to hear, to gather from moment to moment the murmur, soothing as a barely perceptible breeze, of her breath, it was a whole physiological existence that was spread out before me, for me; as I used to remain for hours lying on the beach, in the moonlight, so long could I have remained there gazing at her, listening to her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes one would have said that the sea was becoming rough, that the storm was making itself felt even inside the bay, and like the bay I lay listening to the gathering roar of her breath. Sometimes, when she was too warm, she would take off, already half asleep, her kimono which she flung over my armchair. While she was asleep I would tell myself that all her correspondence was in the inner pocket of this kimono, into which she always thrust her letters. A signature, a written appointment would have sufficed to prove a lie or to dispel a suspicion. When I could see that Albertine was sound asleep, leaving the foot of the bed where I had been standing motionless in contemplation of her, I took a step forward, seized by a burning curiosity, feeling that the secret of this other life lay offering itself to me, flaccid and defenceless, in that armchair. Perhaps I took this step forward also because to stand perfectly still and watch her sleeping became tiring after a while. And so, on tiptoe, constantly turning round to make sure that Albertine was not waking, I made my way to the armchair. There I stopped short, stood for a long time gazing at the kimono, as I had stood for a long time gazing at Albertine. But (and here perhaps I was wrong) never once did I touch the kimono, put my hand in the pocket, examine the letters. In the end, realising that I would never make up my mind, I started back, on tiptoe, returned to Albertine\u2019s bedside and began again to watch her sleeping, her who would tell me nothing, whereas I could see lying across an arm of the chair that kimono which would have told me much. And just as people pay a hundred francs a day for a room at the Hotel at Balbec in order to breathe the sea air, I felt it to be quite natural that I should spend more than that upon her since I had her breath upon my cheek, between her lips which I parted with my own, through which her life flowed against my tongue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this pleasure of seeing her sleep, which was as precious as that of feeling her live, was cut short by another pleasure, that of seeing her wake. It was, carried to a more profound and more mysterious degree, the same pleasure that I felt in having her under my roof. It was gratifying, of course, in the afternoon, when she alighted from the carriage, that it should be to my address that she was returning. It was even more so to me that when from the underworld of sleep she climbed the last steps of the stair of dreams, it was in my room that she was reborn to consciousness and life, that she asked herself for an instant: \u201cWhere am I?\u201d and, seeing all the things in the room round about her, the lamp whose light scarcely made her blink her eyes, was able to assure herself that she was at home, as soon as she realised that she was waking in my home. In that first delicious moment of uncertainty, it seemed to me that once again I took a more complete possession of her since, whereas after an outing it was to her own room that she returned, it was now my room that, as soon as Albertine should have recognised it, was about to enclose, to contain her, without any sign of misgiving in the eyes of my mistress, which remained as calm as if she had never slept at all\nThe uncertainty of awakening revealed by her silence was not at all revealed in her eyes. As soon as she was able to speak she said: \u201cMy \u2014\u2014-\u201d or \u201cMy dearest \u2014\u2014\u201d followed by my Christian name, which, if we give the narrator the same name as the author of this book, would be \u2018My Marcel,\u2019 or \u2018My dearest Marcel.\u2019 After this I would never allow my relatives, by calling me \u2018dearest,\u2019 to rob of their priceless uniqueness the delicious words that Albertine uttered to me. As she uttered them, she pursed her lips in a little pout which she herself transformed into a kiss. As quickly as, earlier in the evening, she had fallen asleep, so quickly had she awoken. No more than my own progression in time, no more than the act of gazing at a. girl seated opposite to me beneath the lamp, which shed upon her a different light from that of the sun when I used to behold her striding along the seashore, was this material enrichment, this autonomous progress of Albertine the determining cause of the difference between my present view of her and my original impression of her at Balbec. A longer term of years might have separated the two images without effecting so complete a change; it had come to pass, essential and sudden, when I learned that my mistress had been virtually brought up by Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s friend. If at one time I had been carried away by excitement when I thought that I saw a trace of mystery in Albertine\u2019s eyes, now I was happy only at the moments when from those eyes, from her cheeks even, as mirroring as her eyes, so gentle now but quickly turning sullen, I succeeded in expelling every trace of mystery\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The image for which I sought, upon which I reposed, against which I would have liked to lean and die, was no longer that of Albertine leading a hidden life, it was that of an Albertine as familiar to me as possible (and for this reason my love could not be lasting unless it was unhappy, for in its nature it did not satisfy my need of mystery), an Albertine who did not reflect a distant world, but desired nothing else \u2014 there were moments when this did indeed appear to be the case \u2014 than to be with me, a person like myself, an Albertine the embodiment of what belonged to me and not of the unknown. When it is in this way, from an hour of anguish caused by another person, when it is from uncertainty whether we shall be able to keep her or she will escape, that love is born, such love bears the mark of the revolution that has created it, it recalls very little of what we had previously seen when we thought of the person in question. And my first impressions at the sight of Albertine, against a background of sea, might to some small extent persist in my love of her: actually, these earlier impressions occupy but a tiny place in a love of this sort; in its strength, in its agony, in its need of comfort and its return to a calm and soothing memory with which we would prefer to abide and to learn nothing more of her whom we love, even if there be something horrible that we ought to know \u2014 would prefer still more to consult only these earlier memories \u2014 such a love is composed of very different material!2Embed"},

anything you say\nBut listen here, daddy\nI got a new feeling\nThat you can't do me this way\nAin't said no to your love\nAnd never did and never never plan to do\nBut if you want to keep me happy, baby\nBetter hear what I'm saying to you\n\nComing to night I might dig being up\nFor floating around on a cloud\nWatching people walking past my window\nPlaying my music out loud\nComing to noon I can't think about nothing\nBut the daylight blazing through\nAnd the afternoon is a no count time\n'Cause I got my business to do\nWell I could probably function\nFor a little conjunction, yeah\nBut I usually like it\nIn the morning much better, yeah\n\nMost people think that the midnight trip\nIs the proper kind of scene\nBut I come on feeling very foggy\nAnd I never can cut it too clean\nPeople think they're at the top of their form\nAfter staying up half of the night\nBut I know after a good night's sleep\nWell I can get it on all right\n\nI ain't never resisted, lord\nWhen you have insisted, no\nBut I usually like it\nIn the morning much better, yeah\n\nEarly in the morning with the sun just up\nAnd the air so fresh and sweet\nFolks just getting their boots pulled on\nAnd they're straggling out to the street\nTaken their time while before they start\nIn to cutting on their wood\nI can't say just what it is sugar\nBut I know it sure feels good\nYou might also likePull the curtain behind me, yeah\nYou better come find me\n'Cause I usually like it\nIn the morning much betterEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1148911",

little gilt invitation\nSaying \"Gilhooley come over for tea\"\nI knew that the Fogarties sent it\nSo I went for old friendship's sake\nBut the first thing they gave me to tackle\nWas a piece of Miss Fogarty's cake\n\nChorus:\nThere were plums and prunes and berries\nRaisins and currants and cinnamon too!\nThere were nuts and cloves and cherries\nAnd a crust that was nailed on with glue!\nThere were caraway seeds in abundance\nThat would give you a fine stomach ache\nThat would kill a man twice after eating a slice\nOf Miss Fogarty's Christmas cake!\nMiss Mulligan wanted to taste it\nBut really there wasn't no use\nFor they worked at it over an hour\nAnd couldn't get none of it loose\nTill Murphy he went for the hatchet\nAnd Kelly came in with a saw\nThat cake was enough by the powers above\nFor to paralyze any man's jaw\n\nChorus\n\nMiss Fogarty, proud as a peacock\nKept smiling and blinking away\nTill she tripped over Flanagan's brogans\nAnd spilled a whole brewing of tea\n\"Oh, Gilhooley\", she cried, \"you're not eating!\nTry a little bit more for my sake!\"\n\"No, thank you\", says I, \"I've no courage to try\nTo force down any more of that cake.\"\n\nChorus\n\nMaloney was took with the colic\nMcNaulty complained of his head\nO'Donnell lay down on the sofa\nAnd swore that he wished he was dead\nMiss Bailey fell down in hysterics\nAnd her legs, they did wriggle and shake\nAnd everyone swore they were poisoned\nJust from eating Miss Fogarty's cake\nYou might also likeChorus\n\nThough the taste is seductive, it makes me refluxive: Miss Fogarty's Christmas

one, and I wouldn't let you run, woah\nThen you turned to me with a look of shame on your face\nAnd your eyes asked a question ever so tenderly, oh\n[Chorus]\nWho will take the blame? Who's gonna bear the shame?\nRight then, I knew how it would always be\nPut the blame, put it on me\nMhm\n\n[Verse 2]\nAt the age of twelve, you were a fine young thing\nBut I felt much older 'cause I had to shoulder the trouble you'd bring\nLike the time you pushed Sonny down and she cut her knee\nWith those same big eyes, you turned and you looked at me, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nWho will take the blame? Who's gonna bear the shame?\nRight then, I knew how it would always be\nPut the blame, put it on me\nPut it on me, put it on me\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow you're all grown up and you're running wild\nAnd they're so surprised 'cause all along, you seemed like such a sweet child\nAnd there's nothing but bad news from all the friends I meet\nHow you've become a, a woman of the streets, oh\nAnd they give me a million and one reasons why\nBut when I analyze it, I know where the real fault lies, oh\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWho will take the blame?

Lyrics\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01\nI wander all night in my vision,\nStepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping,\nBending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,\nWandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory,\nPausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.\nHow solemn they look there, stretch'd and still,\nHow quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles.\nThe wretched features of ennuyes, the white features of corpses, the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of onanists,\nThe gash'd bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0strong-door'd rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from gates, and the dying emerging from gates,\nThe night pervades them and infolds them.\nThe married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his palm on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the hip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of the husband,\nThe sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,\nThe men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,\nAnd the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt.\nThe blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,\nThe prisoner sleeps well in the prison, the runaway son sleeps,\nThe murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep?\nAnd the murder'd person, how does he sleep?\nThe female that loves unrequited sleeps,\nAnd the male that loves unrequited sleeps,\nThe head of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,\nAnd the enraged and treacherous dispositions, all, all sleep.\nI stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the most restless,\nI pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them,\nThe restless sink in their beds, they fitfully sleep.\nNow I pierce the darkness, new beings appear,\nThe earth recedes from me into the night,\nI saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the earth is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 beautiful.\nI go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with the other sleepers\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0each in turn,\nI dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,\nAnd I become the other dreamers.\nI am a dance\u2014play up there! the fit is whirling me fast!\nI am the ever-laughing\u2014it is new moon and twilight,\nI see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts whichever way look,\nCache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where it is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0neither ground nor sea.\nWell do they do their jobs those journeymen divine,\nOnly from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could,\nI reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides,\nAnd surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk,\nTo lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch'd arms, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0resume the way;\nOnward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting\nmusic and wild-flapping pennants of joy!\nI am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician,\nThe emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,\nHe who has been famous and he who shall be famous after to-day,\nThe stammerer, the well-form'd person, the wasted or feeble person.\nI am she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly,\nMy truant lover has come, and it is dark.\nDouble yourself and receive me darkness,\nReceive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without him.\nI roll myself upon you as upon a bed, I resign myself to the dusk.\nHe whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover,\nHe rises with me silently from the bed.\nDarkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty and panting,\nI feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.\nMy hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,\nI would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.\nBe careful darkness! already what was it touch'd me?\nI thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,\nI hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\nI descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,\nPerfume and youth course through me and I am their wake.\nIt is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman's,\nI sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 stockings.\nIt is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight,\nI see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.\nA shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the coffin,\nIt is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 blank here, for reasons.\n(It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy,\nWhoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3\nI see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies\nof the sea,\nHis brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs,\nI see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,\nI hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on\nthe rocks.\nWhat are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?\nWill you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of his middle age?\nSteady and long he struggles,\nHe is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out while his strength\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0holds out,\nThe slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away,\nthey roll him, swing him, turn him,\nHis beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 continually bruis'd on rocks,\nSwiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04\nI turn but do not extricate myself,\nConfused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.\nThe beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound,\nThe tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the drifts.\nI look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the burst as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter and fainter.\nI cannot aid with my wringing fingers,\nI can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me.\nI search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash'd to us alive,\nIn the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05\nNow of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,\nWashington stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench'd\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0hills amid a crowd of officers.\nHis face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops,\nHe lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch'd\nfrom his cheeks,\nHe sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0their parents.\nThe same at last and at last when peace is declared,\nHe stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov'd soldiers\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0all pass through,\nThe officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,\nThe chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek,\nHe kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes hands\nand bids good-by to the army.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06\nNow what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together,\nOf when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the old homestead.\nA red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead,\nOn her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,\nHer hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop'd\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0her face,\nHer step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0she spoke.\nMy mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger,\nShe look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pliant limbs,\nThe more she look'd upon her she loved her,\nNever before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,\nShe made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she cook'd\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0food for her,\nShe had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness.\nThe red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0afternoon she went away,\nO my mother was loth to have her go away,\nAll the week she thought of her, she watch'd for her many a month,\nShe remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,\nBut the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07\nA show of the summer softness\u2014a contact of something unseen\u2014an\namour of the light and air,\nI am jealous and overwhelm'd with

and shall go well.\nI will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes,\nI will duly pass the day O my mother, and duly return to you.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

Album | Romanization | English Translation\n'Hot Sauce' is a cohesive yet diverse album. The title track encapsulates this very well with the Spanish vocal sample (+the distorted version used in verses) as well as the rapid pace and the chanting on the second refrain. It kind of (albeit very subtly) reminded me of Hitchhiker-produced tracks like 127's \"MAD DOG.\" It's followed by \"Diggity,\" which combines hard, punchy, and experimental el\u0435ments with DREAM's cute aesth\u0435tic - making it a fan favorite among many.  \"Dive Into You\" is one of my two personal preferred songs out of all the B-sides. The strong bassline brings power to the rap verses and drops off for harmonic, melody-driven pre-chorus, only to come back bigger immediately after. The soft slowdown at the end perfectly leads into \"My Youth.\" \"Rocket\" gives me the vibe that I'm literally blasting off to space and, at some points, feels like I'm riding a Ferris wheel or doing something of the sort at an amusement park. My second preferred song out of the tracklist is \"Countdown (3, 2, 1).\" The best part is the final verse that comes back unexpectedly after the chorus to bring back the track's punchy energy. It definitely did a good job of giving the impression that something big was about to happen. \"ANL\" makes me feel like it's just rained and the sun is coming back out from the clouds (and also brings me a strange sense of nostalgia). \"Irreplaceable,\" tells the story of an energizing love with a forever lover - and you don't even need to understand a word to know that. And, finally, \"Be There For You\" and \"Rainbow\" are heartfelt ballads that sound like they could fit right into an OST.  Overall, there wasn't a miss on NCT DREAM's latest fully-new release and I'll happily listen to the whole thing over again many times. It was even followed by the 'Hello Future' repackage.\n\n\u2014ckrQuerencia - CHUNG HAOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nThis being CHUNG HA's first studio album, it was expected to exceed expectations! And oh, it did! The album explored a long list of genres thanks to the album's separation into four \"sides\" (NOBLE, SAVAGE, UNKNOWN and PLEASURES). Each side gives off different vibes and rhythms, taking the audience on a rollercoaster of emotions! As for the concept, Querencia (an abstract concept in Spanish) is referring to a place where one can be one\u2019s true self/or to desire. The album truly does justice to the concept of where you can be your true self with the wide range of meaning into the tracks, making it an album that suits every mood. In some instances, the difficulties of a relationship, that \"it\u2019s OK not to be fine\", to show empowerment and confidence, to pick yourself up and come back stronger than those who have betrayed you. At first, I was skeptical of the 21 tracks but I was just blown away! Of course, never doubt Chungha! With hardly any tracks to skip, the album contains everything that fans have come to love about the soloist. I would say my favorite track of the album would be \"Demente ft. Guaynaa\" (including the Spanish Version). The melody and lyrics, just awesome! It is an album to remember and revisit no matter how you are feeling because it has something for everyone!\n\n\u2014HobschiskeWhimsical - Jung Jin HyeongOriginal Album\nI have been well aware of Jung Jin Hyeong\u2019s musical talent for a while, but with the artist\u2019s first full-length album Whimsical, Jin Hyeong undeniably solidifies his place within the South Korean R&B scene. With all of the songs written and composed by the singer himself and each and every one of them being extremely enjoyable, Jung Jin Hyeong\u2019s debut album is a whirlwind of exquisitely performed R&B songs with hints of hip-hop; starting with the title track \u201cBack\u201d and its groovy sound that is followed by marvelous electric guitar notes\u2014a first for the South Korean artist\u2014that makes a strong start for the album. The participation of crewmates Theo and Blase is requested in \u201cNo time\u201d and \u201cDrive\u201d respectively, adding an unexpected edge to each song; the former is a darker track led by its slow beat and acoustic guitar sound, the latter being an upbeat disco-inspired song that vaguely reminds me of electronic music legends Daft Punk, which instantly makes it one of my favorites in the album. But my absolute favorite track is presented in the form of \u201cDowntown,\u201d a Latin-inspired groovy conveyance of a song that urges people to stand up and dance. Jin Hyeong\u2019s charms are further extended to \u201cDrunken texts,\u201d \u201cHours,\u201d and \u201cAlarm,\u201d all different yet equally delightful, with creative lyrics entrusted by the singer\u2019s characteristic sweet and mellow vocals. The final song, a pre-released single featuring hip-hop geniuses pH-1 and Sik-K carrying the name of \u201cLies,\u201d is the perfect closure to an album like Whimsical, with its catchy chorus and the rappers\u2019 additional charisma. It is worth mentioning and recognizing the work of Vangdale, producer of all of the songs in the album, as he was able to seamlessly and flawlessly create different worlds within each song. That being said, Jung Jin Hyeong\u2019s debut album, Whimsical, is an assertive piece of work, as it ensures that the listener will be drawn by the artist\u2019s witty lyrical work and incredible musical sense.\n\u2014loveholicGUESS WHO - ITZYOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nITZY's 'Guess Who' does a good job communicating a broad theme revolving around the rebellious nature of outlaws. The title track, \"\ub9c8.\ud53c.\uc544. (MAFIA) IN THE MORNING,\" appears to narrate a sly and cunning woman in love - stealing a heart and using her so-called trickery to get what she wants. The slick (almost eerie) sound of the instrumental towards the beginning perfectly builds upon this. \"Sorry Not Sorry\" is an anthem of confidence in their abilities and decisions. There's also clearly a thirst to overachieve, fly past all obstacles, and stop at nothing. The heavy guitar strums really top this one-off. Following is \"KIDDING ME,\" which communicates taking a stand against a partner who isn't as committed as you are. The chopped and harsh yet somehow smooth sample that comes in during the chorus communicates strong words and a new beginning perfectly. \"Wild Wild West\" communicates the mean side that one may take in a relationship  (thorns) with a lover that is willing to be there unconditionally even knowing that fact. Some people love a little danger - that's what makes the wild west so appealing. \"SHOOT!\" is about shooting your shot with someone you love deeply, but staying true to yourself and not bending to fit their desires. It alludes to the film Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs - the attractive allure that Red Shoes had when she put them on. In my opinion, this instrumental is by far the funkiest on the album and the creative use of vocal tuning helps a lot to create the feel. Finally, \"TENNIS (0:0)\" is a soft, cozy tone change that acts as a send-off for the project. The acoustic and bass sounds build this well. Overall, 'Guess Who' screams healthy confidence with a bit of vulnerability when needed. I'd definitely listen to it again!\n\n\u2014ckrThe Chaos Chapter: FREEZE - TOMORROW X TOGETHEROriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nLeaders of the fourth generation of K-Pop are back with their third full-length album\u2014The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE. The album is very strong in terms of music, and at the same time, the group freely tries different musical genres and styles, which gives a very natural, pleasant-to-the-ear effect. The subject of the songs still oscillates around the highs and lows of their boy lives on the verge of being teens and young adults. It is also significant that all the members were actively involved in the creation of the album, which makes it even more personal\u2014they all wrote the lyrics, and HUENINGKAI co-produced one of the songs (\"Dear Sputnik.\") The main point of the album is the title track, an emo-rock song \"0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You)\" featuring South Korean R&B singer, Seori. The song is followed by the band's first English song, an upbeat, funky \"Magic,\" which perfectly emphasizes the dancing abilities of the group during performances. When talking about the best songs from the album, it is impossible not to mention \"Anti-Romantic,\" the soft synth-pop ballad that works as the album opener, shows youth's intense feelings of falling in and out of love. The album debuted at No. 5 on Billboard 200 albums chart (a weekly ranking of the most popular albums in the United States) making TXT the third K-Pop group in history to chart multiple albums on the chart in the same year, placing them in the company of BTS and TWICE.\n\n\u2014SiannveSummer Queen - Brave GirlsOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nAs a fan of Brave Girls when \"We Ride\" was released even and before \"Rollin'\" gained the huge success, I was really excited to see what other concepts that the current lineup could show since there wasn't really much information about them then. Summer Queen was the perfect example of what I would've been looking for. A mini-album that you could listen to while you're having fun outdoors, or just chilling by yourself during summer! The first track \"\uce58\ub9db\ubc14\ub78c (Chi Mat Ba Ram)\" is an upbeat song that showcases their unique voices, especially in the chorus. In my opinion, the English version of the song gives off a stronger feeling. Overall, it was a really memorable song and Yuna's line \"Now I'm fearless\" has been stuck in my head since forever. The album has a promotional b-side called \"Pool Party\" which I love a lot because of the retro vibe I get from it. Perfect song if you're going out rollerskating or to a pool party! My favorite on the album \"\ub098 \ud63c\uc790 \uc5ec\ub984 (Summer by myself)\" is all I could ask for a summer song. Smooth producer tag intro? Check. Memorable lyrics and melody? Check. A catchy verse that Eunji and Yujeong participate in? Check! Now on to \"FEVER\". I love this song a lot, of course! It's one of the most chill songs I've ever listened to in my life and in the most positive way ever. I feel like listening to this song if I ever get a fever honestly. If you're a fan of girl groups that know how to make a variety of good summer songs, I suggest you try Brave Girls out!\n\n\u2014seokyoungTaste Of Love - TWICEOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nServing as the tenth mini-album from TWICE, Taste Of Love expresses the girl group\u2019s maturation as they move away from prior \u201cgirlish\u201d concepts and find themselves confronting intense emotions to coincidental encounters. Notably, it even features writing credits from four out of the nine members: Jihyo, Dahyun, Sana and Nayeon. Beginning with a metaphor for being drunk on love, \u201cAlcohol-Free\u201d instantaneously sets the summer theme off by its incorporation of elements derived from Bossa nova style of samba. I\u2019d say it\u2019d be the understatement of the year to admit I\u2019m a *little* obsessed with Dahyun and Chaeyoung\u2019s rap; their flow is as cool as a \u201cmojito with lime\u201d on a hot summer\u2019s day and I wish it were longer! With \u201cFirst Time,\u201d I think we can all relate to the butterflies felt when realizing you\u2019re falling in love with somebody. Seductively, the bass guitar allows amplifying these electrifying feelings. I also believe the post-chorus is undeniably catchy with the shouts of \u201chey!\u201d In retrospect, the one thing that stood out to me was those heavenly falsettos. Furthermore, Jade Thirwall from Little Mix aided the songwriting on this track, helping to encapsulate the feeling of the one language we\u2019re all fluent in: love. Moving on\u2026 did Chaeyoungs\u2019s whispers catch you off-guard? \u2018Cause, they sure did for me! The continuation of the groovy guitar pickings in \u201cScandal,\u201d this time paired with powerful piano chords, demonstrate TWICE's newfound confidence when exploring a riskier, more flirtatious side of love. In turn, \u201cConversation\u201d ventures forwards into a mellow, laidback sound at first. The bubby synth keys help to assist this approach, but when the chorus is reached, we\u2019re introduced to a ritzy bassline. Personally, this is my favorite song on the album - albeit the shortest track, standing at just under 2 minutes and 30 seconds, it takes nothing away from the elegance and sensuality TWICE showcase. \u201cBaby Blue Love\u201d is a real dance-pop vibe, a call-back to the retro 70s/80s shimmering disco-era. Honestly, the urge to get up and dance is almost irresistible. From the title itself, the color baby blue connotes making free-spirited, carefree memories. Finally, \u201cSOS\u201d is precisely the ending we needed to this saga of infatuation. Closing off with more light-hearted fun and thrills, the girls savoring each and every moment spent with their lover, I didn\u2019t think it was possible for TWICE to make a summer-themed album where every track evoked a similar atmosphere, yet was diverse in the manner it was brought out and sung about. Over the years, TWICE have perfected their mellifluous vocals and have been more eager to experiment. If anything, this album is an exquisite example of that, and I am very much excited to create my own memories this summer!\n\n\u2014ZealotOfStockholmRedd - Whee In Original Album | Romanization | English Translation\nAs a big fan of MAMAMOO's R&B vocals and sassy rap verses, I was very excited to check out Whee In's Redd. Starting with the catchy title track \"watercolor,\" she gives an empowering message about self-improvement: It's okay to be selfish if it means you're following your dreams and you're staying true to yourself. Then we have \"Trash,\" featuring rapper pH-1. The intimate track is about showing the pretty and ugly parts of yourself to the person you love. While that may be scary at first, the undeniable passion ends up winning. Contrasting the previous piece, \"OHOO\" is a laid-down love song, perfect to listen to when the sun is setting or when it's raining. If you came for soulful R&B, \"Butterfly\" will be your favorite, featuring the great GSoul. The beautiful and calming melodies create a story about finding 'the one' in your dreams and learning to let go so you can wake up from the fantasy. My highlight is the ending, where both vocalists harmonize and create a new atmosphere together. \"\ubd04\uc774 \ub108\uc5d0\uac8c (Springtime)\" is a cute love letter to Whee In's fans, where she thanks them for always being there for her and brightening her days. Finally, we have my favorite track off the mini-album, \"NO THANKS.\" I tend to love lyrically angsty songs that sound happy, even while tracks like \"Trash\" or \"OHOO\" are more relatable than ever for me right now.  With Redd, Whee In tells an engaging narrative about learning to know your worth so you can experience the love you deserve at last.\n\n\u2014EleventhCassetteLilac - IUOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nActing as a bridge between her 20s and 30s, LILAC is a cathartic album by the Korean singer-songwriter, IU. Running with her theme of age-related projects, the singer brings comfort to her fans on this album. Containing extremely relatable lyrics, at least relatable to me and most people I know, LILAC had a track for every moment. Sonically, the album is a perfect modern pop album, from 2000s R&B to 80s disco-pop to soaring orchestral ballads, IU shares every aspect of herself that we have grown to love. While the lead single is an explosion of springtime excitement like the blossoming of lilacs, I think the album\u2019s real gems lie in the B-side tracks like \u201cTroll\u201d featuring R&B artist DEAN (side note I need new music from DEAN), the bubblegum-pop, \u201c\uc5b4\ud478 (Ah puh),\u201d \u201cCoin,\u201d \"\uc544\uc774\uc640 \ub098\uc758 \ubc14\ub2e4 (My sea)\" and \u201cFlu.\u201d One thing I love about IU's albums is the incredible songwriting collaborations. It shows that she can fit into any style possible, LILAC's credits contain several prominent Korean songwriters including Lee Chan Hyuk, PENOMECO, JUNNY, Sumin, and hitmaker Ryan S. Jhun. IU amplifies her relatable personality through her music and lyrics and LILAC is the perfect example of it.\n\n\u2014ssaa10decSTAYDOM - STAYCOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nAfter the powerful entrance STAYC made to the K-Pop genre in late 2020, making them my favorite girl group debut of the year, the group\u2019s much-anticipated first mini-album STAYDOM was released in April of 2021. Compelled of four songs, this delivery emphasizes the group\u2019s intention of making an impact and gaining their own place in the industry. With unmatched vocals and fun choreography, the lead single \u201cASAP\u201d is an infectious and bubbly refreshing song that positively assures the group\u2019s duality, compared to debut song \u201cSO BAD.\u201d Though based on my taste, their B-side tracks are what shines the most. The confidence-inducing track with a catchy and melodic tune \u201cSO WHAT\u201d encourages the listener to be their own self, regardless of other people\u2019s opinions. My preferred track, \u201c\uc0ac\ub791\uc740 \uc6d0\ub798 \uc774\ub807\uac8c \uc544\ud508 \uac74\uac00\uc694 (LOVE FOOL)\u201d is an easy-to-listen and sweet slow-paced mixture of the members\u2019 diverse vocal colors and meaningful lyrics. Both songs reach their peak during the bridge, both unique yet addicting in the same kind of way. Ending with a remix of \u201cSO BAD,\u201d TAK lends his artistic abilities that make for a song perfect for performances. To say I am excited about STAYC\u2019s future releases is very little compared to the relentless anticipation I have as I look forward to the undeniable success that STAYC will face as they dive more into their talent.\n\n\u2014loveholicEpik High Is Here \u4e0a - EPIK HIGHOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nThe calm, the storm, and the duality of the butterfly meet on Epik High is Here \u4e0a. As an ARMY, I've always been aware of the group, but not so much of their music. But just like how the doors open and close as the pandemic progresses for better or for worse, Epik High proves to be a meaningful catch of hope and ambition in spite of the gloomy future. I would like to recap some of my favorite moments of the album. 'Lesson 0\", a sentimental song driven by piano chords, describes the search for an answer that might not exist. Ending on a perfect resolution, the song suggests that some solution has been proposed. Coming up right after, \"Rosario\" plays with the duality of the butterfly; the song is as \"mellow\" as hearing gunshots in close distance. Ambitious and aggressive, and featuring other A-listers in the game, the song is a rose with pointy thorns. The classical instrumental of \"\ub0b4 \uc598\uae30 \uac19\uc544 (Based on a True Story)\" is as intricate as real love stories themselves. The group wonders why they are reacting so personally to fictional romance; and how ironically, they can only answer with words similar to \"I don't know nan molla.\" \"\uc218\uc0c1\uc18c\uac10 (Acceptance Speech)\" accepts the pressure of fame; it accepts that just like how \"Black clouds are still clouds,\" gold chains are still chains. \"True Crime\" is the song with the EDM-infused chorus, the calm before the storm\u2014when you're driving down a peaceful tunnel that you hope is endless. \"Social Distancing 16\" is short and telling about the music industry within 16 bars; the flow is immaculate despite switching between Tablo and Mithra Jin. Tablo's opening rap verse in \"End of the World\" is as smooth and delightful as sliding into a diner booth, only then to be served with the truth in his verse.\n\n\u2014ANC613WATERFALL - B.IOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nI was going to choose \u201cNumb\u201d to be featured in the Songs List, however, it is quite impossible to single out one song to represent the album. I will admit, I am a fairly new fan of Hanbin. I always knew of him as a songwriter, but I never paid attention to his lyrics on a deeper level. Hanbin\u2019s ability to share a heartbreaking and depressing story through his lyrics but still make the track sound like a summer bop is perfectly on display on WATERFALL. Hanbin also known as B.I professionally expertly hides his pain in the album\u2019s lyrics. Some of the highlights on the album include previously mentioned rock ballad, \u201cNumb,\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d \u201cIllusion,\u201d \"Help Me\" and \u201cDaydream\u201d which also features longtime friend, Lee Hi. Storytelling takes center stage on the album, considering the public scrutiny the artist has faced in the past. Being his first full-length album, WATERFALL becomes an outlet for Hanbin to share his truth. While the production is simple and minimalistic, B.I still incorporates rock, hip-hop, funk, pop, jazz, and ballad sounds in the album. One of my favorite things is when a rapper sings and sounds phenomenal and we hear it once again on the album. The album contains some of B.I\u2019s best vocal deliveries and amidst the heartbreak and darkness, Hanbin manages to find hope and light on WATERFALL which is what makes this album one of the best of the year.\n\n\u2014ssaa10decFragile - eAeonOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\neAeon, the Korean singer-songwriter, also known for being the leader of indie band \ubabb (Mot), returned after nine years with his solo album, Fragile. The release is a very interestingly working mixture of synth-pop and lo-fi, with very honest, vulnerable lyrics and 'love' as a metaphor to talk about fragility throughout the whole album. One of the most interesting songs are \"\uc65c\uc77c\uae4c (I Wonder),\" which creates the vibe that could easily be the soundtrack to the film, probably some dark drama or a spy movie, and \"\uc5b4\uca4c\uba74 (Maybe),\" one of the singles released prior the album, that will make you think about changes, and impact other people make in our lives. For this album, eAeon also collaborated with a R&B singer Jclef (\"Null\"), rapper Swervy (\"Mad Tea Party\"), and rapper-songwriter-composer RM (\"\uadf8\ub7ec\uc9c0 \ub9c8 (Don't)\"). The latter is probably the most known off the album (deservedly). \"\uadf8\ub7ec\uc9c0 \ub9c8 (Don't),\" the story of the relationship gradually falling apart, is not their first collaboration, and once again they created a very unique piece, as both artists share a similar musical sensitivity, and they hold great respect for each other, which translates into the results of their joint work. That being said, despite the rather gloomy subject of the lyrics, the whole album is oddly comforting and definitely worth listening to as we all have the fragility to embrace.\n\n\u2014SiannveTHE FIRST STEP : TREASURE EFFECT - TREASUREOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nTREASURE's first full-length project, THE FIRST STEP : TREASURE EFFECT, showcases the rookies' potential across a multitude of styles. The project includes their first single albums, and I was worried this mesh of drastically different genres would take away from the listening experience. However, the album's musical diversity allows anyone to experience the full treasure effect. TREASURE's first few releases (tracks 4-7) all followed a YG-style EDM approach, making their mark as YG's newest boy group. Their debut \"BOY\" is honestly quite reminiscent of \"DDU-DU DDU-DU\" in terms of sound and structure. Though they formed this EDM image, it didn't restrict them from exploring other genres. \"\uc74c (MMM)\" threw in a hip-hop twist, showcasing more rap than anywhere else on the album. The title track \"MY TREASURE\" is a youthful song with an uplifting message, one that fits their group name TREASURE \u2013 encouraging listeners to keep their heads high on gloomy days and learn to \"treasure\" what they have (themselves). The other B-side tracks on the album also have a bit of everything: \"\ubbf8\uccd0\uac00\ub124 (GOING CRAZY)\" is a house track reminiscent of BIGBANG-era K-Pop while \"\ub098\ub791 \uc788\uc790 (BE WITH ME)\" is a guitar-based acoustic song with a bit of bass and a whistle hook-line. Members' diverse talents are showcased as well, with Asahi co-producing the ballad \"\uc624\ub80c\uc9c0 (Orange)\" and Hyunsuk, Haruto and Yoshi writing most of their raps for the album. They also have strong vocals: Jeongwoo and Jihoon showcased their vocal potential on \"\uc0ac\ub791\ud574 (I Love You)\" and \"B.L.T (BLING LIKE THIS),\" and you can really hear Yedam and his vocals throughout the album; He's finally singing on his own songs. The tracklist is topped off by the Lee Chan Hyuk-penned \"SLOWMOTION,\" a slow song dedicated to the group's journey so far. I can't wait to hear what musical direction TREASURE take in the future. This project is diverse, but remember, it's only the first step.\n\n\u2014PlanNine16Instinct Part 1 - OnlyOneOfOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nThis rookie almost obscure boy group made a lot of buzz this spring with their unique (risque) concept. OnlyOneOf who debuted in 2019 has always incorporated unique themes and concepts in their releases. For fans of the group, it came as no surprise that the group was once again looking towards combining philosophy, art, and music to create thought-provoking songs. Instinct Part 1 is the group\u2019s third mini-album and takes inspiration from Sigmund Freud\u2019s theories of mind. Supported by the title track, \u201clibidO,\u201d Instinct Part 1 explores the themes of intimacy that humans crave especially teenagers. Despite garnering much attention due to its sexy and sensual choreography and visuals, I think it is also important to appreciate the depth in the concept of this album. In a year where most of us were confined to our homes and many times all alone, we all craved intimacy at different levels and in different ways. OnlyOneOf beautifully explored this subconscious drive that we all have on B-side tracks \u201cinstinct/\ubcf8\ub2a5\u201d and \"byredO\". They also talk about the repercussions of the instinct, both when it becomes overbearing or when it is suppressed. Featuring instrumental interludes, Instinct Part 1 is masterfully crafted making it one of the standout albums of 2021 so far. I truly believe that OnlyOneOf has a bright future credited to their unique discography amplified by their immense talent in the studio and on stage.\n\n\u2014ssaa10decYellow - Kang DanielOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nAt 1 AM, I dive straight into this project with no prior knowledge of who KANG DANIEL is and with no familiarity with his music. Now, typically yellow is a vibrant color, symbolizing happiness and joy. However, it seems something dark lurks beneath the surface of this color\u2019s pretense - \u201cyellow\u201d has lost sight of its color and its purpose. What is left is a story that begins with \u201cDigital,\u201d an astounding intro that gives off The Weeknd-esque vibes. Although it has an upbeat feel, it details the troubles of social media and \u2013 thanks to some handy research - specifically the false rumors surrounding Kang before he went on hiatus in November 2019. Moving onto \u201cPARANOIA,\u201d the heavy strums of the bass guitar combined with the distorted synth sounds link to his fragmented state of mind. No wonder it was released as a single - it scratches the surface of his darkness, preparing us to venture deeper into his mind. Though melancholy, Kang never shies away from drawing from personal experiences, ensuring his songs are relatable to listeners. \u201cMisunderstood\u201d does exactly that, whilst also marking his first collaboration with rapper Omega Sapien from Balming Tiger, whose voice meshes remarkably well with Kang\u2019s. Personally, \u201cAntidote\u201d is my favorite track. Utilizing a perfect amount of autotune, Kang desperately holds out faith and hope for better days, no matter how hard life treats him. Furthermore, it was written at what Kang cites as \u201crock bottom,\u201d making it all the more heartfelt for the fans he never stopped thinking about. Finally, \u201cSave U\u201d is a beautifully, optimistic end to the color trilogy. The song, aided by rapper Wonstein, puts into perspective the universal struggles faced both in and out of the spotlight. Overall, the album is vehement, yet eloquent. Truthfully, it is mesmerizing without being enigmatic; its somber mood allows us to focus on the messages Kang succeeds to convey, without any word being lost in translation. Finally, I hope Kang knows how loved he is by his worldwide fans and continues to share his story with such passion!\n\u2014ZealotOfStockholm[&] - LOONAOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nI will admit, I'm a fairly new Orbit. But from the moment I saw the music video for \"Why Not?\", I immediately fell in love with LOONA. And with their newest comeback, [&], my opinion of them only increases. Starting from the intro track, \"&\", the album immediately kicks off with an intense electronic sound. Reusing some elements from the lead single, it's powerful, bold, and sharp. Next is the lead single, \"PTT (Paint The Town)\". With influence from Indian culture and music, this track is has a very intense dance hip-hop sound. LOONA sings about not caring what other people think about you and showing your true colors shamelessly. Showcasing an amazing pre-chorus, and a captivating bridge, with LOONA's vocals, it's an absolutely gorgeous track. After that, we have \"WOW\". A bouncy, upbeat track, LOONA encourages every girl to be proud of who they are, and be themselves without shame. Then, it's \"Be Honest\", my favorite song on the album. A refreshing bop, it's about being honest to yourself and expressing your feelings. In my opinion, LOONA's vocals really shine here, with great melodies and lively raps. Next is the fully English song \"Dance On My Own\". Opening with a simple acoustic guitar, LOONA's vocals have a really nice feel in this song. Then, we have \"A Different Night\" - an emotional ballad with a dreamy, sentimental sound. The ad-libs throughout the song enhance the effect nicely. The album ends with \"U R\", a soft R&B song with lo-fi influence. It's a really good song for chilling in your house at night! Overall, this album transitions very nicely - opening with an intense, powerful intro, and ending with a warm, cozy sound. This is definitely one of my favorite albums, everyone should give it a listen! You'll definitely like at least one track on it!\n\n\u2014crystallized_starstimeabout, - YukikaOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nLet's get one thing out of the way first, Japanese K-pop idol Yukika is my all-time favorite solo artist. She mainly makes city pop songs, a genre inspired by Japanese music made usually in the 1980s. 'timeabout,' is her first mini-album, and in my opinion one of the best mini albums ever released. I'm a sucker for city pop so there was already no way I would've disliked anything on the album. It starts with a synth intro called \"Leap forward\" which makes me feel like I'm time traveling. Then, it leads on to the title track called \"Insomnia\". The song is a groovy and retro track that you would listen to when you're studying. It makes you feel nostalgic and remember memories. \"Lovemonth\" follows after \"Insomnia,\" immediately catching your attention from the addictive and upbeat start and leads you on to the addicting chorus. \"TIME TRAVEL\" has her signature city pop sound on it, a jazzy-ish chorus with sharp vocals. \"Secret\" includes unique melodies that are so unique that it's addicting to listen to. My favorite track on the album, \"PUNG!\" is an easy-to-listen-to song with vocals and an instrumental brought from heaven. It's calm and memorable and I personally love everything about it. When you listen to it with headphones on, it feels like you're floating on clouds. There isn't any reason not to check her out! If you've never listened to city pop before, I promise you that it can easily become your favorite genre. Yukika is a great city pop artist to start off with.\n\n\u2014seokyoungUNNATURAL - WJSNOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nFrom somebody who never listened to WJSN, you might wonder what I listened to, to get into them? It was all because of this album. It all began when my friend recommended this album and shortly, it became one of my favorite albums of all time. This album has many upbeat songs and along with a ballad called \"REWIND\"\u201d. The title song \"UNNATURAL\"\" is a flashy song and has a catchy and fun hook. The second track called \"Last dance\" has an impressive intro with a captivating pizzicato. I personally love the chorus for it as it was stuck in my head for a few days. Moving on to \"SUPER MOON\" is another track with an exciting hook. Member Exy took part in writing the rap lyrics which makes it more exciting to listen to. The fourth track in the album titled \"New Me\" has to be my favorite track on there. With an ambitious message, It\u2019s an extremely captivating retro track that you can never get bored of. I really like retro songs therefore I really loved it. Members Seola and Exy participated in the making of the song. Moving on to the fifth track in the album \"YALLA\" once again, member Exy wrote AND composed this song. What a talented girl! Another one of my favorite tracks on the album, \"YALLA,\" is an electronic pop song with a hard-hitting drop in its chorus. The last song on the album which is \"REWIND\" is a great ballad. Containing the lyrics \"We will be together forever\" it is a very meaningful song. Both promoted tracks, \"UNNATURAL\" and \"Last Dance\" also have beautiful choreographies. In general, the whole album is really fun with memorable hooks and lyrics. So whenever you\u2019re planning on having a party or doing karaoke, you should try playing this album. I really recommend that you listen to this album if you haven't already as you would definitely be impressed.\n\n\u2014WongkaheiDUALITY - I.MOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation\nYes, he served us looks, a fiery flow, and some questionable lyrics, but underneath all that, I.M of MONSTA X delivered some of the most vulnerable moments on his mixtape, DUALITY. Sticking to the theme of the project, Changkyun shares how there are always two sides to a story. He expresses how every emotion whether good or bad has multiple sides to it. The mixtape was promoted with the smooth hip-hop lead single, \u201cGod Damn.\u201d In line with the concept, I.M masterfully cloaks the song with explicit lyrics and sexual innuendos but also manages to add deeper self-reflective layers to it. \u201cHowlin\u2019\u201d finds I.M once again dealing with conflicting feelings about being alone. Known as a sexy R&B crooner, I.M takes a much darker route on \u201cBurn\u201d and \u201cHappy To Die\u201d talking about mental health and the toll that his glamorous idol life takes on him. The album\u2019s resident melodic rap ballad, \u201c\uc2dc\ub4e0 \uaf43 (Flower-ed)\u201d is a somber track written from the perspective of the person left behind after a relationship withers away. With DUALITY, I.M shows a different side to himself. The mixtape highlights his strengths as a rapper and a songwriter. Oftentimes, I.M\u2019s sincerity is lost behind their hard-hitting verses in MONSTA X songs, which is why DUALITY is an even more special project because it allowed him to open himself up to his fans and audience and put himself in a different light.\n\n\u2014ssaa10decNOIR - U-KNOW Original Album | Romanization | English Translation\nI\u2019m a big TVXQ! fan, my IQ on both TVXQ! & TOHOSHINKI is over 3000, that aside I really love this album. I love the robotic feeling of the opening track Time Machine and his harmonization with those \u201cAh-a-a-a-a-a-ah\u201d make his robotic voice pop. Up comes most likely my favorite track off the album Thank U first off I love the MV with the elevator fight scene, him slashing everyone and the border falling, the One-In-The-Chamber scene and how cinematic the whole vibe is. The song is also great, I like the first part of the instrumental where it\u2019s gloomy and it sounds amazing. As well as the dynamic in his voice where he is singing then he\u2019s sounds more further away and more sad. Also the solo sax part is just ear candy. Onto the next track Eeny Meeny is a really good pace changer, from being quite tense to being playful and the instrumental after the second chorus is my favorite part and goes back to the normal instrumental seamlessly. Eeny Meeny made one thing strong a fun vibe and Loco House Party made that theme much more clearer. Having a tropical and fun vibe is honestly great but there is no standout moment in the track. You know the theme that Eeny Meeny made and Loco House Party expanded on? Being upbeat and fun? Need You Right Now just throws that out the window but It\u2019s a nice track and is a good ballad-ishy song. But the track suffers from the same flaw as the last one, no stand out moments. The theme Need You Right Now stopped it actually made another being ballad-ish sounding songs or sounding more sad with La Rosa but the last 3 tracks all suffer from the same thing \u201cNot Having A Standout Moment.\u201d And that\u2019s a big flaw no track is bad mind you but the first 3 make a really good start but then has a bit of a slump. But the biggest flaw is that there\u2019s no theme throughout the whole album. . . But it is my favorite K-Pop album of the year so\u2026 A+\n\n-OKRA233Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1697170", "artist_names": "Joe South", "full_title": "Children by\u00a0Joe\u00a0South", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd3f840b355daf9fe34ddc2d55366059.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd3f840b355daf9fe34ddc2d55366059.999x999x1.jpg", "id": 1697170, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 6261923, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1574627788, "path": "/Joe-south-children-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Joe-south-children-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1969, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1969", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1969", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd3f840b355daf9fe34ddc2d55366059.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd3f840b355daf9fe34ddc2d55366059.999x999x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Children", "title_with_featured": "Children", "updated_by_human_at": 1574630360, "url": "https://genius.com/Joe-south-children-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/364787", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/612ae37d7b388badd9f525a854998c18.778x608x1.jpg", "id": 364787, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ee6eeeb47d4707aaec2875919c316860.608x608x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Joe South", "slug": "Joe-south", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Joe-south"}, "artist": "Joe South", "lyrics": "Children LyricsChildren\nGo and run and jump and play\nYou'll be\nMen and women some day\nThen you'll have to leave\nYour world of make believe\nNow, children\n\nYoung (Children)\nCarefree (Children)\nChildren\nChildren (Children)\nNeed someone to understand\nChildren\nNeed someone to hold their hands\nYeah\nTo cheer you when you're sad\nTo spank you when you're bad now\nChildren\n\nHaughty (Children)\nNaughty (Children)\nChildren\n\nPride goes before destruction\nA holy spirit goes before a fall\nDon't you know that we're all children\nAnd it's all for one and one for all, mm\n\nChildren (Children)\nCall each other names\nChildren\nPlayin' grown-up games\nAnd the thing that's really sad\nWe lose the faith we had\nWhen we were children mm-hmm\nYou might also likeLoud (Children)\nProud (Children)\nChildren\n\nChildren (Children)\nWho think that they are grown\nChildren\nWith children of their own\nFrom the cradle to the grave\nWhy must we all behave like\nChildren?

carry\nYour share of the load\nGirl, can't you take it?\nUntil I make it\nLife is a real bumpy road\n[Chorus]\nNothing succeeds like success, and I guess\nI wanna be just like all of the rest\nLike all the rich men who have been blessed\nNothing succeeds like success\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'll sympathize\nWith all the tears in your eyes\nBut, baby, I can't stay\nI've got a date with success\nAnd unless\nI make it, it won't pay\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd when I get up\nTo the top\nOf the ladder, baby, I'll look down\nI'll reach out my hand to you\nI'll try to pull you through\nI hope you'll still be around\n\n[Chorus]\nNothing succeeds like success, and I guess\nI wanna be just like all of the rest\nLike all the rich men who have been blessed\nNothing succeeds like success\nYou might also

should\nShut your damn mouth, I cannot cuss so damn\nIs the worst word that I can say outta my mouth\nSo when I do this foolish rhyme is fluid\nSpitting like ammunition when I go to it\nI hop to it, it ain't hip hop is it?\nYes it is y'all need to pay us a visit\nWe're D12 reason it ain't just D6\nCause when we stomp you it feels like twelve of us knee clicks\nAh and it goes like that, everybody know y'all give us the mic\u2019 back\n[Verse 2: Bizarre]\nG shit, respect it\nI\u2019ll fuck a bitch that's pregnant and anorexic\nCheck it, I\u2019m up to no good\nYou laughing, I'm fresh Tim Wood-Wood\nPlease don't fucking cuss, motherfucker suck my dick\nDon't talk shit\nYo I\u2019m fucking up\nSo I'ma pass the mic' to my nigga Proof\nBlast off\n\n[Verse 3: Swifty]\nI'm driving seventy-five miles per hour\nSippin' Amaretto sour\nBumpin' \"Money and the Power\"\nI'm on my way to send my enemies some flowers\nWith a sarcastic face\nI murdered the coward\nTryna stop my hustle\nYou get devoured\nYou get covered with more shells and mussels laying awkward\nI bust you\nWith your family laying in Boxford\nI pack something special to keep the cops hurt\nThe word is covered with it so you can't stop dirt\nI'm snatching it\nDon't let the others get it\nThat won't work\nI smoke\nDon't let you hit it when it's burnt\n'Cause he thinks can rap my lyric\nYou besta stay alert\nYou besta stay alert\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Proof]\nAy yo, listen\nI will come at you for mines\nRun at you with nines\nCoat snatcher for dimes\nI'm the punisher of rhymes\nCall us ginsu\nAny bit you get cut through\nYou put the fan in fantast[ic]\nI put the f in [fuck you]\n\n1/6th a partner D12 is darker\nWith hearts I hate as pure as Author\nCerebral is sharper\nAll six sense keen as Peter Parker\nThis is the area 9 sparker\n\nRace through a stage like a wild boar\nMy style of war\nEven worse than Bizarre snore\nPunch the oaked arch the land when I march\nI'm a shark that makes battling into a art\nI'm true with a pen, my category a few would be in\nDon't matter if you anglo, mulatto or nubian\n\nMake the strong fall\nRide on a long haul\nBeat up my last girl 'cause she sucked the wrong ball\nAll y'all MCs whether friend or foe\nPlaying it low, I'm planning to blow ya leg with more\nWith thoughts that make due I penetrate through\nYou got dreams of beating me your alarm clock'll wake you\nHate you, erase your face and disgrace you\nSpray your filet, and then just lace you doe\nMy style is ratchet with the sin\nMost of y'all like homos. Why?\nCause y'all gonna catch it in the end\n[Verse 5: Kuniva]\nI'm a nightmare devious\nWith the most mischievous crew in the industry\nWithout an ounce of lenience\nThe disobedient\nGun grabbing\nGet stashed\nEnd in the back of a paddy wagon\nBragging about a stabbing\nYou dumb rappers get blasted\nBuried alive\nUnder 30 feet of snow\nOn their asses with no casket\nI'm that man\nWho love CAT scans\nA fat chance you'll be seen alive\nAfter being thrown in a black van\nAssassin masked man\nGetting a lap dance\nFrom crack heads\nOn trash cans\nWith my last hand\nPassing in\nI blast women\nRan past grinning\nWhen the mac's spinning\nI suffer from bad living\n\n[Verse 6: Mr. Porter]\nThat's right I'm back y'all\nThe incredible\nHacksaw\nJim Duggan\nStill thugging\nWith the same 4-by-4 thing\nWill press against your mama\nCoochie while we hugging\nYou ain't got problems\nYou just act crazy\nTry having 8 babies\nBy 12 different ladies\nIt don't add up\nDo it?\nI keep saying I'm the daddy\nBut them chickens won't own up to it\nRun right through it\nThat's it\n\n[Verse 7: Bizarre]\nBamm\nGuess who just crushed your party\nI'm Deebo punk\nWhat you got on my 40\nIt's Detroit's finest\nMillion niggas spineless\nI'm too f-ing dope\nYou better rewind this\nDid two pints of Bacardi\nComing to your party\nBlasting everybody\nI'm watching this prostitute\nI said you wanna get down\nShe gave me a frown and said\n54 pounds\nMoney\nI'm blasting niggas if they dummie\nI mire Tim rummie\nWhen I pass the mic' to Eminem\n\n[Swifty]\nWhen I'm running  the script it change directions\nOh Eminem was grabbing it\nSo I'ma let him flow\n\n[Verse 8: Eminem]\nYo\nI'll prolly stir up so much shit in Europe\nI say a bad word and mess the whole tour up\nY'all don't wanna mess with me\nIt ain't ya destiny like child\nI'm never wild when I'm riled up off running like a mile\nYou running to me?\nI'ma punish you\nIf you ever gun at me\nAny MC, who tries to step to

pins\nGettin' pulled\nIf you talk bull\nYour day's in\nI'm blazing\nI'm always in the mood to kill\n7 million ways\nMac-11 pilling the grill\nHow did occasion\nWhat you facing is strictly real\nI got

ain't dealt with no derelict shat\nAnd it can happen' to you quick as you can think\nAs quick as the water rush out of a sink homie\nQuick as you can blink\nImagine if I digested a couple of

Poem in a Books\n\n\n\nTo Justify the Ways of God to Men.\n\nThe Author & Printer W. Blake.\n1804.\n\n\n\np. 2\n\nPREFACE\n\nTHE Stolen and Perverted Writings of Homer & Ovid, of Plato & Cicero, which all Men ought to contemn, are set up by artifice against the Sublime of the Bible: but when the New Age is at leisure to Pronounce, all will be set right & those Grand Works of the more ancient & consciously & professedly Inspired Men will hold their proper rank & the Daughters of Memory shall become the Daughters of Inspiration. Shakspeare & Milton were both curb'd by the general malady & infedlion from the silly Greek & Latin slaves of the Sword.\n\nRouze up O Young Men of the New Age! Set your foreheads against\nlo the ignorant Hirelings! For we have Hirelings in the Camp, the Court, & the University: who would if they could for ever depress Mental & prolong Corporeal War. Painters! on you I call. Sculptors! Architects! Suffer not the fashionable Fools to depress your powers by the prices they pretend to give for contemptible works or the expensive advertizing boasts that they make  of such works; believe Christ & his Apostles that there is a Class of Men whose whole delight is in Destroying. We do not want either Greek or Roman Models if we are but just & true to our own Imaginations, those Worlds of Eternity in which we shall live for ever, in Jesus Our Lord.\n\nAnd did those feet in ancient time\n20 Walk upon England's mountains green,\n\nAnd was the holy Lamb of God\nOn England's pleasant pastures seen.''\n\nAnd did the Countenance Divine\nShine forth upon our clouded hills?\n25 And was Jerusalem builded here\n\nAmong these dark Satanic Mills?\nBring me my Bow of burning gold:\nBring me my Arrows of desire:\nBring me my Spear: O clouds unfold!\n30 Bring me my Chariot of fire :\n\nI will not cease from Mental Fight,\nNor shall my Sword sleep in my hand,\nTill we have built Jerusalem,\nIn England's green & pleasant Land.\n\nWould to God that all the Lord's people were Prophets.\n\nNumbers, xi. ch. 29 v,\nxix\n\nMILTON\n\nBOOK THE FIRST\n\nP- 3\n\nDAUGHTERS of Beulah! Muses who inspire the Poet's Song,\nRecord the journey of immortal Milton thro' your Realms\nOf terror & mild moony lustre, in soft sexual delusions\nOf varied beauty, to delight the wanderer and repose\n5 His burning thirst & freezing hunger! Come into my hand\nBy your mild power; descending down the Nerves of my right arm\nFrom out the Portals of my Brain, where by your ministry\nThe Eternal Great Humanity Divine planted his Paradise,\nAnd in it caus'd the Spe6lres of the Dead to take sweet form\n\n10 In likeness of himself. Tell also of the False Tongue! vegetated\nBeneath your land of shadows : of its sacrifices, and\nIts offerings : even till Jesus, the image of the Invisible God,\nBecame its prey; a curse, an offering, and an atonement\nFor Death Eternal in the heavens of Albion, & before the Gates\n\n15 Of Jerusalem his Emanation, in the heavens beneath Beulah.\n\nSay first ! what mov'd Milton, who walk'd about in Eternity\nOne hundred years, pond'ring the intricate mazes of Providence,\nUnhappy tho' in heav'n, he obey'd, he murmur'd not, he was silent.\nViewing his Sixfold Emanation scatter'd thro' the deep\n20 In torment: To go into the deep her to redeem & himself perish .?\nThat cause at length mov'd Milton to this unexampled deed,\nA Bard's prophetic Song ! for sitting at eternal tables.\nTerrific among the Sons of Albion, in chorus solemn & loud\nA Bard broke forth : all sat attentive to the awful man.\n\n25 Mark well my words! they are of your eternal salvation!\n\nThree Classes are Created by the Hammer of Los, & Woven\n\np. 4 FROM Golgonooza the spiritual Four-fold London eternal,\nIn immense labours & sorrows, ever building, ever falling.\nThro' Albion's four Forests which overspread all the Earth\nFrom London Stone to Blackheath east : to Hounslow west :\n5 To Finchley north : to Norwood south : and the weights\n\nOf Enitharmon's Loom play lulling cadences on the winds of Albion\nFrom Caithness in the north, to Lizard-point & Dover in the south.\n\nI B\n\n\n\nLoud sounds the hammer of Los, & loud his Bellows is heard\nBefore London to Hampstead's breadths & Highgate's heights, To\n10 Stratford & old Bow, & across to the Gardens of Kensington\nOn Tyburn's Brook : loud groans Thames beneath the iron Forge\nOf Rintrah & Palamabron, of Theotorm &c Bromion, to forge the instruments\nOf Harvest: The Plow & Harrow to pass over the Nations.\n\nThe Surrey hills glow like the clinkers of the furnace: Lambeth's Vale\n15 Where Jerusalem's foundations began; where they were laid in ruins,\nWhere they were laid in ruins from every Nation & Oak Groves rooted,\nDark gleams before the Furnace-mouth a heap of burning ashes.\nWhen shall Jerusalem return & overspread all the Nations?\nReturn, return to Lambeth's Vale, O building of human souls!\n20 Thence stony Druid Temples overspread the Island white.\nAnd thence from Jerusalem's ruins, from her walls of salvation\nAnd praise, thro' the whole Earth were rear'd from Ireland\nTo Mexico & Peru west, & east to China & Japan : till Babel\nThe Spedre of Albion frown'd over the Nations in glory & war.\n25 All things begin & end in Albion's ancient Druid rocky shore :\n\nBut now the Starry Heavens are fled from the mighty limbs of Albion.\n\nLoud sounds the Hammer of Los, loud turn the Wheels of Enitharmon :\nHer Looms vibrate with soft affe6l:ions, weaving the Web of Life\nOut from the ashes of the Dead; Los lifts his iron Ladles\n\n30 With molten ore: he heaves the iron cliffs in his rattling chains\nFrom Hyde Park to the Alms-houses of Mile-end & old Bow.\nHere the Three Classes of Mortal Men take their fix'd destinations,\nAnd hence they overspread the Nations of the whole Earth & hence\nThe Web of Life is woven, & the tender sinews of life created,\n\n35 And the three Classes of Men regulated by Los's Hammer, and woven\n\np. 5 BY Enitharmon's Looms & Spun beneath the Spindle of Tirzah.\nThe first. The Eled from before the foundation of the World:\nThe second, The Redeem'd: The Third, The Reprobate & form'd\n\nTo destruction from the mothers womb:\n\nfollow with me my plow.\n\n5 Of the first class was Satan : with incomparable mildness ;\nHis primitive tyrannical attempts on Los; with most endearing love\nHe soft intreated Los to give to him Palamabron's station.\nFor Palamabron return'd with labour wearied every evening :\nPalamabron oft refus'd : and as often Satan ofFer'd\n10 His service, till by repeated offers and repeated intreaties\n\n2\n\n\n\nLos gave to him the Harrow of the Almighty ; alas, blamable\nPalamabron fear'd to be angry lest Satan should accuse him of\nIngratitude, & Los believe the accusation thro' Satan's extreme\nMildness. Satan labour'd all day: it was a thousand years:\n15 In the evening returning terrified, overlabour'd & astonish'd,\nEmbrac'd soft with a brother's tears Palamabron, who also wept.\n\nMark well my words ! they are of your eternal salvation !\n\nNext morning Palamabron rose : the horses of the Harrow\n\nWere madden'd with tormenting fury, & the servants of the Harrow,\n\n20 The Gnomes, accus'd Satan with indignation, fury and fire.\nThen Palamabron, reddening like the Moon in an eclipse,\nSpoke, saying: You know Satan's mildness and his self-imposition,\nSeeming a brother, being a tyrant, even thinking himself a brother\nWhile he is murdering the just; prophetic I behold\n\n25 His future course thro' darkness and despair to eternal death.\nBut we must not be tyrants also : he hath assum'd my place\nFor one whole day, under pretence of pity and love to me!\nMy horses hath he madden'd! and my fellow servants injur'd !\nHow should he, he, know the duties of another? O foolish forbearance!\n\n30 Would I had told Los all my heart ! but patience, O my friends.\nAll may be well: silent remain, while I call Los and Satan.\n\nLoud as the wind of Beulah that unroots the rocks & hills\n\nPalamabron call'd: and Los & Satan came before him :\n\nAnd Palamabron shew'd the horses & the servants. Satan wept,\n\n35 And mildly cursing Palamabron, him accus'd of crimes\n\nHimself had wrought. Los trembled : Satan's blandishments almost\nPerswaded the Prophet of Eternity that Palamabron\nWas Satan's enemy, & that the Gnomes, being Palamabron's friends,\nWere leagued together against Satan thro' ancient enmity.\n\n40 What could Los do? how could he judge, when Satan's self believ'd\nThat he had not oppressed the horses at the Harrow, nor the servants.\n\nSo Los said : Henceforth, Palamabron, let each his own station\nKeep : nor in pity false, nor in officious brotherhood, where\nNone needs, be active. Mean time Palamabron's horses\n45 Rag'd with thick flames redundant, & the Harrow madden'd with fury.\nTrembling Palamabron stood, the strongest of Demons trembled:\nCurbing his living creatures; many of the strongest Gnomes\nThey bit in their wild fury, who also madden'd like wildest beasts. '\n\nMark well my words I they are of your eternal salvation !\n\n3\n\n\n\np. 6 MEAN WHILE went Satan before Los accusing Palamabron :\nHimself exculpating with mildest speech, for himself believ'd\nThat he had not oppress'd nor injur'd the refradtory servants.\n\nBut Satan returning to his Mills (for Palamabron had serv'd\n5 The Mills of Satan as the easier task) found all confusion :\n\nAnd back return'd to Los, not fill'd with vengeance but with tears.\nHimself convinc'd of Palamabron's turpitude. Los beheld\nThe servants of the Mills drunken with wine and dancing wild\nWith shouts and Palamabron's songs, rending the forests green\nlo With ecchoing confusion, tho' the Sun was risen on high.\n\nThen Los took off his left sandal, placing it on his head,\nSignal of solemn mourning: when the servants of the Mills\nBeheld the signal they in silence stood, tho' drunk with wine.\nLos wept ! But Rintrah also came, and Enitharmon on\n15 His arm lean'd tremblingly, observing all these things.\n\nAnd Los said: Ye Genii of the Mills! the Sun is on high.\nYour labours call you: Palamabron is also in sad dilemma:\nHis horses are mad: his Harrow confounded: his companions enrag'd.\nMine is the fault! I should have remember'd that pity divides the soul,\n20 And man, unmans: follow with me my Plow: this mournful day\nMust be a blank in Nature: follow with me, and tomorrow again\nResume your labours, & this day shall be a mournful day.\n\nWildly they follow'd Los and Rintrah, & the Mills were silent:\nThey mourn'd all day, this mournful day of Satan & Palamabron:\n25 And all the Eledl & all the Redeem'd mourn'd one toward another\nUpon the mountains of Albion among the cliffs of the Dead.\n\nThey Plow'd in tears ! incessant pour'd Jehovah's rain & Molech's\nThick fires, contending with the rain, thunder'd above rolling\nTerrible over their heads; Satan wept over Palamabron.\n30 Theotormon & Bromion contended on the side of Satan,\nPitying his youth and beauty, trembling at eternal death.\nMichael contended against Satan in the rolling thunder:\nThulloh the friend of Satan also reprov'd him: faint their reproof.\n\nBut Rintrah who is of the reprobate: of those form'd to destrudion:\n35 In indignation for Satan's soft dissimulation of friendship\nFlam'd^ above all the plowed furrows, angry, red and furious:\nTill Michael sat down in the furrow, weary, dissolv'd in tears.\nSatan, who drave the team beside him, stood angry & red :\n\n4\n\n\n\nHe smote Thulloh & sfew him, & he stood terrible over Michael\n40 Urging him to arise : he wept. Enitharmon saw his tears.\n\nBut Los hid Thulloh from her sight, lest she should die of grief.\nShe wept: she trembled: she kissed Satan: she wept over Michael:\nShe form'd a Space for Satan & Michael & for the poor infedted.\nTrembling she wept over the Space, & clos'd it with a tender Moon.\n\n45 Los secret buried Thulloh, weeping disconsolate over the moony Space.\n\nBut Palamabron called down a Great Solemn Assembly,\nThat he who will not defend Truth, may be compelled to\nDefend a Lie, that he may be snared & caught & taken.\n\np. 7 AND all Eden descended into Palamabron's tent,\nAmong Albion's Druids & Bards in the caves beneath Albion's\nDeath Couch, in the caverns of death, in the corner of the Atlantic.\nAnd in the midst of the Great Assembly Palamabron pray'd:\n5 O God, protedl me from my friends, that they have not power over me:\nThou hast giv'n me power to protedl myself from my bitterest enemies.\n\nMark well my words! they are of your eternal salvation 1\n\nThen rose the Two Witnesses, Rintrah & Palamabron:\nAnd Palamabron appeal'd to all Eden, and receiv'd\n10 Judgment: and Lo! it fell on Rintrah and his rage,\n\nWhich now flam'd high & furious in Satan against Palamabron,\nTill it became a proverb in Eden. Satan is among the Reprobate.\n\nLos in his wrath curs'd heaven & earth, he rent up Nations,\nStanding on Albion's rocks among high-rear'd Druid temples\n15 Which reach the stars of heaven & stretch from pole to pole.\nHe displac'd continents, the oceans fled before his face:\nHe alter'd the poles of the world, east, west & north & south.\nBut he clos'd up Enitharmon from the sight of all these things.\n\nFor Satan flaming with Rintrah's fury hidden beneath his own mildness\n20 Accus'd Palamabron before the Assembly of ingratitude, of malice:\nHe created Seven deadly Sins, drawing out his infernal scroll\nOf Moral laws and cruel punishments upon the clouds of Jehovah,\nTo pervert the Divine voice in its entrance to the earth\nWith thunder of war & trumpet's sound, with armies of disease,\n25 Punishments & deaths muster 'd & number'd. Saying: I am God alone:\nThere is no other: let all obey my principles of moral individuality.\nI have brought them from the uppermost, innermost recesses\nOf my Eternal Mind: transgressors I will rend ofi^for ever,\n\n5\n\n\n\nAs now I rend this accursed Family from my covering.\n\n30 Thus Satan rag'd amidst the Assembly, and his bosom grew\nOpake against the Divine Vision: the paved terraces of\nHis bosom inwards shone with fires, but the stones, becoming opake,\nHid him from sight in an extreme blackness and darkness.\nAnd there a World of deeper Ulro was open'd in the midst\n\n35 Of the Assembly, in Satan's bosom, a vast unfathomable Abyss.\n\nAstonishment held the Assembly in an awful silence: and tears\nFell down as dews of night, & a loud solemn universal groan\nWas utter'd from the east & from the west & from the south\nAnd from the north ; and Satan stood opake, immeasurable,\n40 Covering the east with solid blackness, round his hidden heart,\nWith thunders utter'd from his hidden wheels: accusing loud\nThe Divine Mercy for protecting Palamabron in his tent.\n\nRintrah rear'd up walls of rocks and pour'd rivers & moats\nOf fire round the walls: columns of fire guard around\n45 Between Satan and Palamabron in the terrible darkness.\n\nAnd Satan not having the Science of Wrath, but only of Pity,\nRent them asunder, and wrath was left to wrath, & pity to pity.\nHe sunk down a dreadful Death, unlike the slumbers of Beulah.\n\nThe Separation was terrible: the Dead was repos'd on his Couch\n50 Beneath the Couch of Albion, on the seven mou[n]tains of Rome,\nIn the whole place of the Covering Cherub, Rome, Babylon & Tyre.\nHis Spedlre raging furious descended into its Space.\n\np. 9 HE set his face against Jerusalem to destroy the Eon of Albion.\n\nBut Los hid Enitharmon from the sight of all these things,\nUpon the Thames whose lulling harmony repos'd her soul:\nWhere Beulah lovely terminates in rocky Albion:\n5 Terminating in Hyde Park on Tyburn's awful brook.\n\nAnd the Mills of Satan were separated into a moony Space\nAmong the rocks of Albion's Temples, and Satan's Druid sons\nOffer the Human Vidims throughout all the Earth, and Albion's\nDread Tomb, immortal on his Rock, overshadow'd the whole Earth:\n10 Where Satan making to himself Laws from his own identity\nCompell'd others to serve him in moral gratitude & submission.\nBeing call'd God: setting himself above all that is called God.\nAnd all the Spedlres of the Dead, calling themselves Sons of God,\nIn his Synagogues worship Satan under the Unutterable Name.\n\n6\n\n\n\n15 And it was enquir'd: Why in a Great Solemn Assembly\n\nThe Innocent should be condemn'd for the Guilty? Then an Eternal rose,\n\nSaying: If the Guilty should be condemn'd he must be an Eternal Death,\n\nAnd one must die for another throughout ail Eternity.\n\nSatan is fall'n from his station & never can be redeem'd,\n20 But must be new Created continually moment by moment.\n\nAnd therefore the Class of Satan shall be call'd the Eled, & those\n\nOf Rintrah the Reprobate, & those of Palamabron the Redeem'd :\n\nFor he is redeem'd from Satan's Law, the wrath falling on Rintrah.\n\nAnd the'*efore Palamabron dared not to call a solemn Assembly\n25 Till Satan had assum'd Rintrah's wrath in the day of mourning.\n\nIn a feminine delusion of false pride self-deceiv'd.\n\nSo spake the Eternal, and confirm'd it with a thunderous oath.\n\nBut when Leutha (a Daughter of Beulah) beheld Satan's condemnation.\nShe down descended into the midst of the Great Solemn Assem.bly,\n30 Offering herself a Ransom for Satan, taking on her his Sin.\n\nMark well my words! they are of your eternal salvation!\n\nAnd Leutha stood glowing with varying colours immortal, heart-piercing\nAnd lovely : & her moth-like elegance shone over the Assembly.\n\nAt length, standing upon the golden floor of Palamabron,\n35 She spake: I am the Author of this Sin! by my suggestion\nMy Parent power Satan has committed this transgression.\nI loved Palamabron & I sought to approach his Tent,\nBut beautiful Elynittria with her silver arrows repell'd me.\n\np. 10 FOR her light is terrible to me: I fade before her immortal beauty.\nO wherefore doth a Dragon-form forth issue from my limbs\nTo seize her new born son.'* Ah me! the wretched Leutha!\nThis to prevent, entering the doors of Satan's brain night after night,\n5 Like sweet perfumes I stupified the masculine perceptions\nAnd kept only the feminine awake: hence rose his soft\nDelusory love to Palamabron; admiration join'd with envy!\nCupidity unconquerable! my fault, when at noon of day\nThe Horses of Palamabron call'd for rest and pleasant death:\n10 I sprang out of the breast of Satan, over the Harrow beaming\nIn all my beauty, that I might unloose the flaming steeds\nAs Elynittria used to do; but too well those living creatures\nKnew that I was not Elynittria, and they brake the traces.\n\n7\n\n\n\nBut me the servants of the Harrow saw not, but as a bow\n\n15 Of varying colours on the hills; terribly rag'd the horses.\nSatan astonish'd, and with power above his own controll,\nCompell'd the Gnomes to curb the horses, & to throw banks of sand\nAround the fiery flaming Harrow in labyrinthine forms.\nAnd brooks between to intersedl the meadows in their course.\n\n20 The Harrow cast thick flames : Jehovah thunder'd above.\nChaos & ancient night fled from beneath the fiery Harrow:\nThe Harrow cast thick flames & orb'd us round in concave fire,\nA Hell of our own making, see, its flames still gird me round!\nJehovah thunder'd above: Satan in pride of heart\n\n25 Drove the fierce Harrow among the constellations of Jehovah,\nDrawing a third part in the fires as stubble, north & south.\nTo devour Albion and Jerusalem, the Emanation of Albion,\nDriving the Harrow in Pity's paths: 'twas then, with our dark fires\nWhich now gird round us (O eternal torment) I form'd the Serpent\n\n30 Of precious stones & gold, turn'd poisons on the sultry wastes.\nThe Gnomes in all that day spar'd not; they curs'd Satan bitterly.\nTo do unkind things in kindness: with power arm'd to say\nThe most irritating things in the midst of tears and love:\nThese are the stings of the Serpent! thus did we by them, till thus\n\n35 They in return retaliated, and the Living Creatures madden'd.\nThe Gnomes labour'd. I weeping hid in Satan's inmost brain.\nBut when the Gnomes refus'd to labour more, with blandishments\nI came forth from the head of Satan : back the Gnomes recoil'd\nAnd called me Sin, and for a sign portentous held me. Soon\n\n40 Day sunk and Palamabron return'd, trembling I hid myself\nIn Satan's inmost Palace of his nervous fine wrought Brain:\nFor Elynittria met Satan with all her singing women,\nTerrific in their joy & pouring wine of wildest power,\nThey gave Satan their wine, indignant at the burning wrath.\n\n45 Wild with prophetic fury his former life became like a dream.\nCloth'd in the Serpent's folds, in selfish holiness demanding purity.\nBeing most impure, self-condemn'd to eternal tears, he drove\nMe from his inmost Brain & the doors clos'd with thunder's sound.\n\nDivine Vision who didst create the Female, to repose\n50 The Sleepers of Beulah, pity the repentant Leutha. My\n\np. 1 1 SICK Couch bears the dark shades of Eternal Death infolding\nThe Spedtre of Satan: he furious refuses to repose in sleep:\n\n1 humbly bow in all my Sin before the Throne Divine.\n\nNot so the Sick-one ; Alas, what shall be done him to restore,\n\n8\n\n\n\n5 Who calls the Individual Law Holy, and despises the Saviour,\nGlorying to involve Albion's Body in fires of eternal War?\n\nNow Leutha ceas'd: tears flow'd: but the Divine Pity supported her.\n\nAll is my fault ! We are the Spedre of Luvah, the murderer\nOf Albion! O Vala! O Luvah! O Albion! O lovely Jerusalem!\n10 The Sin was begun in Eternity and will not rest to Eternity,\nTill two Eternitys meet together. Ah! lost! lost! lost! for ever!\n\nSo Leutha spoke. But when she saw that Enitharmon had\nCreated a New Space to prote6t Satan from punishment:\nShe fled to Enitharmon's Tent & hid herself. Loud raging\n\n15 Thunder'd the Assembly dark & clouded, and they ratify 'd.\nThe kind decision of Enitharmon, & gave a Time to the Space,\nEven Six Thousand years, and sent Lucifer for Its Guard.\nBut Lucifer refus'd to die, & in pride he forsook his charge:\nAnd they eleded Molech, and when Molech was impatient\n\n20 The Divine hand found the Two Limits: first of Opacity, then of Contradlion,\nOpacity was named Satan, Contradlion was named Adam.\nTriple Elohim came: Elohim wearied fainted: they eledled Shaddai :\nShaddai angry, Pahad descended: Pahad terrified, they sent Jehovah,\nAnd Jehovah was leprous; loud he call'd stretching his hand to Eternity.\n\n25 For then the Body of Death was perfeded in hypocritic holiness.\n\nAround the Lamb, a Female Tabernacle woven in Cathedron's Looms.\nHe died as a Reprobate, he was Punish'd as a Transgressor:\nGlory! Glory! Glory! to the Holy Lamb of God!\nI touch the heavens as an instrument to glorify the Lord!\n\n30 The Eledl shall meet the Redeem'd on Albion's rocks they shall meet\nAstonish'd at the Transgressor, in him beholding the Saviour.\nAnd the Eledl shall say to the Redeemed: We behold it is of Divine\nMercy alone, of Free Gift and Eledlion that we live:\nOur Virtues & Cruel Goodnesses have deserv'd Eternal Death,\n\n35 Thus they weep upon the fatal Brook of Albion's River.\n\nBut Elynittria met Leutha in the place where she was hidden.\nAnd threw aside her arrows, and laid down her sounding Bow:\nShe sooth'd her with soft words Sc brought her to Palamabron's bed.\nIn moments new created for delusion interwoven round about,\n40 In dreams she bore the shadowy Spedire of Sleep & nam'd him Death:\nIn dreams she bore Rahab the mother of Tirzah & her sisters\nIn Lambeth's vales; in Cambridge & in Oxford, places of Thought,\nIntricate labyrinths of Times and Spaces unknown, that Leutha lived\n\n9 c\n\n\n\nIn Palamabron's Tent, and Oothoon was her charming guard.\n\n45 The Bard Ceas'd. All consider'd and a loud resounding murmur\nContinu'd round the Halls and much they question'd the immortal\nLoud voic'd Bard, and many condemn'd the high toned Song,\nSaying: Pity and Love are too venerable for the imputation\nOf Guilt. Others said: If it is true, if the ads have been performed,\n\n50 Let the Bard himself witness. Where hadst thou this terrible Song.?\n\nThe Bard replied: I am Inspired! I know it is Truth! for I Sing\n\np. 12 ACCORDING to the inspiration of the Poetic Genius,\n\nWho is the eternal all proteding Divine Humanity,\n\nTo whom be Glory & Power & Dominion Evermore. Amen.\n\nThen there was great murmuring in the Heavens of Albion\n5 Concerning Generation & the Vegetative power & concerning\nThe Lamb the Saviour. Albion trembled to Italy, Greece & Egypt\n^To Tartary & Hindostan & China & to Great America,\nShaking the roots & fast foundations of the Earth in doubtfulness:\nThe loud voic'd Bard terrify 'd took refuge in Milton's Bosom.\n\n10 Then Milton rose up from the heavens of Albion ardorous:\nThe whole Assembly wept prophetic, seeing in Milton's face\nAnd in his lineaments divine the shades of Death and Ulro:\nHe took ofFthe robe of the promise, & ungirded himself from the oath of God.\n\nAnd Milton said: I go to Eternal Death! The Nations still\n15 Follow after the detestable Gods of Priam : in pomp\n\nOf warlike selfhood contradicting and blaspheming.\n\nWhen will the Resurredtion come to deliver the sleeping body\n\nFrom corruptibility; O when, Lord Jesus, wilt thou come.''\n\nTarry no longer, for my soul lies at the gates of death.\n20 I will arise and look forth for the morning of the grave :\n\nI will go down to the sepulcher to see if morning breaks:\n\nI will go down to self annihilation and eternal death:\n\nLest the Last Judgment come & find me unannihilate\n\nAnd I be seiz'd & giv'n into the hands of my own Selfhood.\n25 The Lamb of God is seen thro' mists & shadows, hov'ring\n\nOver the sepulchers in clouds of Jehovah & winds of Elohim,\n\nA disk of blood distant; & heav'ns & earths roll dark between.\n\nWhat do I here before the Judgment? without my Emanation?\n\nWith the daughters of memory & not with the daughters of inspiration?\n30 I in my Selfhood am that Satan. I am that Evil One!\n\n10\n\n\n\nHe is my Spedlre! in my obedience to loose him from my Hells,\nTo claim the Hells, my Furnaces, I go to Eternal Death.\n\nAnd Milton said: I go to Eternal Death! Eternity shudder'd\nFor he took the outside course, among the graves of the dead,\n35 A mournful shade. Eternity shudder'd at the image of eternal death.\n\nThen on the verge of Beulah he beheld his own Shadow:\nA mournful form double, hermaphroditic, male & female\nIn one wonderful body, and he enter'd into it\nIn direful pain for the dread shadow, twenty-seven fold\n40 Reach'd to the depths of direst Hell, & thence to Albion's land:\nWhich is this earth of vegetation on which now I write.\n\nThe Seven Angels of the Presence wept over Milton's Shadow:\n\np. 14 AS when a man dreams, he refledls not that his body sleeps.\nElse he would wake; so seem'd he entering his Shadow: but\nWith him the Spirits of the Seven Angels of the Presence\nEntering, they gave him still perceptions of his Sleeping Body\n5 Which now arose and walk'd with them in Eden, as an Eighth\nImage Divine tho^ darken'd, and tho' walking as one walks\nIn sleep: and the Seven comforted and supported him.\n\nLike as a Polypus that vegetates beneath the deep,\nThey saw his Shadow vegetated underneath the Couch\n\nlo Of death : for when he enter'd into his Shadow, Himself,\nHis real and immortal Self; was as appear'd to those\nWho dwell in immortality, as One sleeping on a couch\nOf gold: and those in immortality gave forth their Emanations\nLike Females of sweet beauty, to guard round him & to feed\n\n15 His lips with food of Eden in his cold and dim repose:\nBut to himself he seem'd a wanderer lost in dreary night.\n\nOnwards his Shadow kept its course among the Spedres, call'd\nSatan, but swift as lightning passing them, startled the shades\nOf Hell beheld him in a trail of light as of a comet\n20 That travels into Chaos: so Milton went guarded within.\n\nThe nature of infinity is this : That every thing has its\nOwn Vortex; and when once a traveller thro' Eternity\nHas passed that Vortex, he perceives it roll backward behind\nHis path, into a globe itself infolding, like a sun,\n25 Or like a moon, or like a universe of starry majesty,\n\nWhile he keeps onwards in his wondrous journey on the earth,\n\nII\n\n\n\nOr like a human form, a friend with whom he liv'd benevolent.\n\nAs the eye of man views both the east & west encompassing\n\nIts vortex: and the north & south, with all their starry host:\n30 Also the rising sun & setting moon he views surrounding\n\nHis corn-fields and his valleys of five hundred acres square.\n\nThus is the earth one infinite plane, and not as apparent\n\nTo the weak traveller confin'd beneath the moony shade.\n\nThus is the heaven a vortex pass'd already, and the earth\n35 A vortex not yet pass'd by the traveller thro' Eternity.\n\nFirst Milton saw Albion upon the Rock of Ages,\nDeadly pale outstretch'd and snowy cold, storm cover'd:\nA Giant form of perfe6l beauty outstretch'd on the rock\nIn solemn death: the Sea of Time & Space thunder 'd aloud\n\n40 Against the rock, which was inwrapped with the weeds of death.\nHovering over the cold bosom, in its vortex Milton bent down\nTo the bosom of death : what was underneath soon seem'd above,\nA cloudy heaven mingled with stormy seas in loudest ruin:\nBut as a wintry globe descends precipitant thro' Beulah bursting\n\n45 With thunders loud and terrible: so Milton's shadow fell\nPrecipitant loud thund'ring into the Sea of Time & Space.\nThen first I saw him in the Zenith as a falling star,\nDescending perpendicular, swift as the swallow or swift :\nAnd on my left foot falling on the tarsus, enter'd there,\n\n50 But from my left foot a black cloud redounding spread over Europe.\n\nThen Milton knew that the Three Heavens of Beulah were beheld\nBy him on earth in his bright pilgrimage of sixty years\n\np. 1 5 IN the three females whom his wives, & these three whom his daughters\nHad represented and contain'd, that they might be resum'd\nBy giving up of Selfhood: & they distant view'd his journey\nIn their eternal spheres now Human, tho' their Bodies remain clos'd\n5 In the dark Ulro till the Judgment : also Milton knew, they and\nHimself was Human, tho' now wandering thro' Death's Vale,\nIn conflidl with those Female forms, which in blood & jealousy\nSurrounded him dividing & uniting without end or number.\n\nHe saw the Cruelties of Ulro, and he wrote them down\n10 In iron tablets: and his Wives' & Daughters' names were these:\nRahab and Tirzah, & Milcah & Malah & Noah & Hoglah.\nThey sat rang'd round him as the rocks of Horeb round the land\nOf Canaan: and they wrote in thunder, smoke and fire\n\n12\n\n\n\nHis diftate; and his body was the Rock Sinai: that body,\n15 Which was on earth born to corruption: & the six Females\nAre Hor & Peor & Bashan & Abarim & Lebanon & Hermon,\nSeven rocky masses terrible in the Desarts of Midian.\n\nBut Milton's Human Shadow continu'd journeying above\nThe rocky masses of The Mundane Shell; in the Lands\n20 Of Edom & Aram & Moab & Midian & Amalek.\n\nThe Mundane Shell is a vast Concave Earth: an immense\nHarden'd shadow of all things upon our Vegetated Earth,\nEnlarg'd into dimension & deform'd into indefinite space,\nIn Twenty-seven Heavens and all their Hells; with Chaos\n\n25 And Ancient Night; & Purgatory. It is a cavernous Earth\nOf labyrinthine intricacy twenty-seven-folds of opakeness,\nAnd finishes where the lark mounts; here Milton journeyed\nIn that Region call'd Midian, among the rocks of Horeb.\nFor travellers from Eternity, pass onward to Satan's seat,\n\n30 But travellers to Eternity, pass inward to Golgonooza.\n\nLos, the Vehicular terror, beheld him, & divine Enitharmon\nCall'd all her daughters. Saying: Surely to unloose my bond\nIs this Man come! Satan shall be unloos'd upon Albion!\n\nLos heard in terror Enitharmon's words : in fibrous strength\n35 His limbs shot forth like roots of trees against the forward path\nOf Milton's journey. Urizen beheld the immortal Man.\n\np. 17 AND he also darken'd his brows: freezing dark rocks between\nThe footsteps, and infixing deep the feet in marble beds:\nThat Milton labour'd with his journey, & his feet bled sore\nUpon the clay now chang'd to marble; also Urizen rose,\n5 And met him on the shores of Albion, & by the streams of the brooks.\n\nSilent they met, and silent strove among the streams of Arnon\nEven to Mahanaim, when with cold hand Urizen stoop'd down\nAnd took up water from the river Jordan: pouring on\nTo Milton's brain the icy fluid from his broad cold palm.\n10 But Milton took of the red clay of Succoth, moulding it with care\nBetween his palms: and filling up the furrows of many years.\nBeginning at the feet of Urizen, and on the bones\nCreating new flesh on the Demon cold, and building him.\nAs with new clay, a Human form in the Valley of Beth Peor.\n\n15 Four Universes round the Mundane Egg remain Chaotic.\n\n13\n\n\n\nOne to the North, named Urthona: One to the South, named Urizen:\nOne to the East, named Luvah: One to the West, named Tharmas:\nThey are the Four Zoas that stood around the Throne Divine.\nBut when Luvah assum'd the World of Urizen to the South,\n\n20 And Albion was slain upon his mountains & in his tent:\nAll fell towards the Center in dire ruin, sinking down.\nAnd in the South remains a burning fire: in the East, a void:\nIn the West, a world of raging waters: in the North, a solid.\nUnfathomable, without end. But in the midst of these\n\n25 Is built eternally the Universe of Los and Enitharmon:\nTowards which Milton went, but Urizen oppos'd his path.\n\nThe Man and Demon strove many periods. Rahab beheld.\nStanding on Carmel: Rahab and Tirzah trembled to behold\nThe enormous strife, one giving life, the other giving death\n30 To his adversary, and they sent forth all their sons & daughters\nIn all their beauty to entice Milton across the river.\n\nThe Twofold form Hermaphroditic, and the Double-sexed,\nThe Female-male & the Male-female, self-dividing stood\nBefore him in their beauty, & in cruelties of holiness:\n35 Shining in darkness, glorious upon the deeps of Entuthon.\n\nSaying: Come thou to Ephraim! behold the Kings of Canaan!\n\nThe Beautiful Amalekites, behold the fires of youth\n\nBound with the Chain of Jealousy by Los & Enitharmon!\n\nThe banks of Cam, cold learning's streams, London's dark frowning towers,\n40 Lament upon the winds of Europe in Rephaim's Vale,\n\nBecause Ahania, rent apart into a desolate night,\n\nLaments! & Enion wanders like a weeping inarticulate voice.\n\nAnd Vala labours for her bread & water among the Furnaces.\n\nTherefore bright Tirzah triumphs, putting on all beauty,\n45 And all perfedlion, in her cruel sports among the Vi6lims.\n\nCome bring with thee Jerusalem with songs on the Grecian Lyre!\n\nIn Natural Religion : in experiments on Men.\n\nLet her be OfFer'd up to Holiness: Tirzah numbers her:\n\nShe numbers with her fingers every fibre ere it grow :\n50 Where is the Lamb of God.'' where is the promise of his coming.?\n\nHer shadowy sisters form the bones, even the bones of Horeb,\n\nAround the marrow: and the orbed scull around the brain:\n\nHis Images are born for War, for Sacrifice to Tirzah :\n\nTo Natural Religion! to Tirzah, the Daughter of Rahab the Holy:\n55 She ties the knot of nervous fibres into a white brain !\n\n14\n\n\n\nShe ties the knot of bloody veins into a red hot heart !\nWithin her bosom Albion lies embalm'd, never to awake.\nHand is become a rock: Sinai & Horeb is Hyle & Coban:\nScofield is bound in iron armour before Reuben's Gate :\n60 She ties the knot of milky seed into two lovely Heavens,\n\np. 18 TWO yet but one; each in the other sweet refleded: these\nAre our Three Heavens beneath the shades of Beulah, land of rest :\nCome then to Ephraim & Manasseh, O beloved-one!\nCome to my ivory palaces, O beloved of thy mother !\n5 And let us bind thee in the bands of War & be thou King\nOf Canaan and reign in Hazor where the Twelve Tribes meet.\n\nSo spoke they as in one voice: Silent Milton stood before\nThe darken'd Urizen ; as the sculptor silent stands before\nHis forming image: he walks round it patient labouring,\nlo Thus Milton stood forming bright Urizen, while his Mortal part\nSat frozen in the rock of Horeb : and his Redeemed portion,\nThus form'd the Clay of Urizen; but within that portion\nHis real Human walk'd above in power and majesty,\nTho' darken'd; and the Seven Angels of the Presence attended him.\n\n15 O how can I with my gross tongue that cleaveth to the dust.\nTell of the Four-fold Man in starry numbers fitly order'd,\nOr how can I with my cold hand of clay! But thou, O Lord,\nDo with me as thou wilt! for I am nothing, and vanity\nIf thou chuse to eledl a worm, it shall remove the mountains.\n\n20 For that portion nam'd the Eled:: the Spedlrous body of Milton:\nRedounding from my left foot into Los's Mundane space.\nBrooded over his Body in Horeb against the Resurrection,\nPreparing it for the Great Consummation: red the Cherub on Sinai\nGlow'd: but in terrors folded round his clouds of blood.\n\n25 Now Albion's sleeping Humanity began to turn upon his Couch,\nFeeling the eleftric flame of Milton's awful precipitate descent.\nSeest thou the little winged fly smaller than a grain of sand.^*\nIt has a heart like thee: a brain open to heaven & hell,\nWithinside wondrous & expansive: its gates are not clos'd:\n\n30 I hope thine are not: hence it clothes itself in rich array:\n\nHence thou art cloth'd with human beauty, O thou mortal man.\nSeek not thy heavenly father then beyond the skies:\nThere Chaos dwells & ancient Night & Og & Anak old :\nFor every human heart has gates of brass & bars of adamant,\n\n^5\n\n\n\n35 Which few dare unbar, because dread Og & Anak guard the gates\nTerrific: and each mortal brain is wall'd and moated round\nWithin: and Og & Anak watch here: here is the Seat\nOf Satan in its Webs: for in brain and heart and loins\nGates open behind Satan's Seat to the City of Golgonooza,\n\n40 Which is the spiritual fourfold London, in the loins of Albion.\n\nThus Milton fell thro' Albion's heart, travelling outside of Humanity\nBeyond the Stars in Chaos in Caverns of the Mundane Shell.\n\nBut many of the Eternals rose up from eternal tables,\n\nDrunk with the Spirit, burning round the Couch of death they stood,\n\n45 Looking down into Beulah: wrathful, fill'd with rage:\n\nThey rend the heavens round the Watchers in a fiery circle.\nAnd round the Shadowy Eighth : the Eight close up the Couch\nInto a tabernacle, and flee with cries down to the Deeps:\nWhere Los opens his three wide gates, surrounded by raging fires:\n\n50 They soon find their own place & join the Watchers of the Ulro.\n\nLos saw them and a cold pale horror cover'd o'er his limbs.\nPondering he knew that Rintrah & Palamabron might depart:\nEven as Reuben & as Gad: gave up himself to tears.\nHe sat down on his anvil-stock: and leaned upon the trough,\n55 Looking into the black water, mingling it with tears.\n\nAt last when desperation almost tore his heart in twain\nHe recolleded an old Prophecy in Eden recorded,\nAnd often sung to the loud harp at the immortal feasts:\nThat Milton of the Land of Albion should up ascend\n60 Forwards from Ulro from the Vale of Felpham, and set free\nOre from his Chain of Jealousy : he started at the thought,\n\np. 19 AND down descended into Udan-Adan; it was night:\n\nAnd Satan sat sleeping upon his Couch in Udan-Adan:\n\nHis Spedtre slept, his Shadow woke; when one sleeps th'other wakes.\n\nBut Milton entering my Foot, I saw in the nether\n5 Regions of the Imagination ; also all men on Earth\n\nAnd all in Heaven, saw in the nether regions of the Imagination,\nIn Ulro beneath Beulah, the vast breach of Milton's descent.\nBut I knew not that it was Milton, for man cannot know\nWhat passes in his members till periods of Space & Time\n10 Reveal the secrets of Eternity: for more extensive\n\nThan any other earthly things, are Man's earthly lineaments.\n\n16\n\n\n\nAnd all this Vegetable World appeared on my left Foot\n\nAs a bright sandal form'd immortal of precious stones & gold :\n\nI stooped down & bound it on to walk forward thro' Eternity.\n\n15 There is in Eden a sweet River of milk & liquid pearl\n\nNam'd Ololon: on whose mild banks dwelt those who Milton drove\n\nDown into Ulro: and they wept in long resounding songs\n\nFor seven days of eternity, and the river's living banks,\n\nThe mountains wail'd! & every plant that grew, in solemn sighs lamented.\n\n20 When Luvah's bulls each morning drag the sulphur Sun out of the Deep\nHarness'd with starry harness, black & shining, kept by black slaves\nThat work all night at the starry harness: Strong and vigorous\nThey drag the unwilling Orb : at this time all the Family\nOf Eden heard the lamentation and Providence began.\n\n25 But when the clarions of day sounded they drown'd the lamentation,\nAnd when night came all was silent in Ololon; & all refused to lament\nIn the still night fearing lest they should others molest.\n\nSeven mornings Los heard them, as the poor bird within the shell\nHears its impatient parent bird; and Enitharmon heard them:\n30 But saw them riot, for the blue Mundane Shell inclos'd them in.\n\nAnd they lamented that they had in wrath & fury & fire\nDriven Milton into the Ulro; for now they knew too late\nThat it was Milton the Awakener: they had not heard the Bard,\nWhose Song call'd Milton to the attempt; and Los heard these laments.\n35 He heard them call in prayer all the Divine Family;\n\nAnd he beheld the Cloud of Milton stretching over Europe.\n\nBut all the Family Divine colle6led as Four Suns\nIn the Four Points of heaven. East, West & North & South,\nEnlarging and enlarging till their Disks approach'd each other:\n40 And when they touch'd closed together Southward in One Sun\nOver Ololon: and as One Man, who weeps over his brother\nIn a dark tomb, so all the Family Divine wept over Ololon.\n\nSaying: Milton goes to Eternal Death! so saying they groan'd in spirit\nAnd were troubled! and again the Divine Family groan'd in spirit!\n45 And Ololon said: Let us descend also, and let us give\nOurselves to death in Ulro among the Transgressors,\nIs Virtue a Punisher? O no! how is this wondrous thing?\nThis World beneath, unseen before; this refuge from the wars\nOf Great Eternity! unnatural refuge! unknown by us till now.\n\n17 P\n\n\n\n50 Or are these the pangs of repentance? let us enter into them.\n\nThen the Divine Family said: Six Thousand Years are now\nAccomplish'd in this World of Sorrow; Milton's Angel knew\nThe Universal Dictate: and you also feel this Didate.\nAnd now you know this World of Sorrow, and feel Pity. Obey\n55 The Didlate! Watch over this World, and with your brooding wings\nRenew it to Eternal Life: Lo! I am with you alway:\nBut you cannot renew Milton: he goes to Eternal Death.\n\nSo spake the Family Divine as One Man, even Jesus,\nUniting in One with Ololon & the appearance of One Man,\n60 Jesus the Saviour, appear'd coming in the Clouds of Ololon:\n\np. 20 THO' driven away with the Seven Starry Ones into the Ulro,\nYet the Divine Vision remains Every-where For-ever. Amen.\nAnd Ololon lamented for Milton with a great Lamentation.\n\nWhile Los heard indistindl in fear, what time I bound my sandals\n5 On, to walk forward thro' Eternity, Los descended to me:\nAnd Los behind me stood: a terrible flaming Sun: just close\nBehind my back: I turned round in terror and behold,\nLos stood in that fierce glowing fire; & he also stoop'd down\nAnd bound my sandals on in Udan-Adan: trembhng 1 stood\n10 Exceedingly with fear & terror, standing in the Vale\nOf Lambeth : but he kissed me and wish'd me health.\nAnd I became One Man with him arising in my strength:\n'Twas too late now to recede. Los had enter 'd into my soul:\nHis terrors now posses'd me whole! I arose in fury & strength.\n\n15 I am that Shadowy Prophet who Six Thousand Years ago\n\nFell from my station in the Eternal bosom. Six Thousand Years\nAre finish'd. I return! both Time & Space obey my will.\nI in Six Thousand Years walk up and down: for not one Moment\nOf Time is lost, nor one Event of Space unpermanent,\n\n20 But all remain: every fabric of Six Thousand Years\nRemains permanent: tho' on the Earth where Satan\nFell, and was cut off, all things vanish & are seen no more.\nThey vanish not from me & mine, we guard them first & last.\nThe generations of men run on in the tide of Time,\n\n25 But leave their destin'd lineaments permanent for ever & ever.\nSo spake Los as we went along to his supreme abode.\n\nRintrah and Palamabron met us at the Gate of Golgonooza,\n\n18\n\n\n\nClouded with discontent & brooding in their minds terrible things.\n\nThey said: O Father most beloved! O merciful Parent!\n\n30 Pitying and permitting evil, tho' strong & mighty to destroy.\nWhence is this Shadow terrible? wherefore dost thou refuse\nTo throw him into the Furnaces? knowest thou not that he\nWill unchain Ore? & let loose Satan, Og, Sihon & Anak,\nUpon the Body of Albion? for this he is come! behold it written\n\n35 Upon his fibrous left Foot black: most dismal to our eyes.\n\nThe Shadowy Female shudders thro' heaven in torment inexpressible:\nAnd all the Daughters of Los prophetic wail: yet in deceit\nThey weave a new Religion from new Jealousy of Theotormon.\nMilton's Religion is the cause: there is no end to destrudion.\n\n40 Seeing the Churches at their Period in terror & despair,\nRahab created Voltaire; Tirzah created Rousseau:\nAsserting the Self-righteousness against the Universal Saviour,\nMocking the Confessors & Martyrs, claiming Self-righteousness,\nWith cruel Virtue: making War upon the Lamb's Redeemed:\n\n45 To perpetuate War & Glory, to perpetuate the Laws of Sin.\nThey perverted Swedenborg's Visions in Beulah & in Ulro,\nTo destroy Jerusalem as a Harlot & her Sons as Reprobates,\nTo raise up Mystery the Virgin Harlot, Mother of War,\nBabylon the Great, the Abomination of Desolation.\n\n50 O Swedenborg! strongest of men, the Samson shorn by the Churches:\nShewing the Transgressors in Hell, the proud Warriors in Heaven,\nHeaven as a Punisher, & Hell as One under Punishment:\nWith Laws from Plato & his Greeks to renew the Trojan Gods\nIn Albion: & to deny the value of the Saviour's blood.\n\n55 But then I rais'd up Whitefield, Palamabron rais'd up Westley,\nAnd these are the cries of the Churches before the two Witnesses.\nFaith in God the dear Saviour who took on the likeness of men:\nBecoming obedient to death, even the death of the Cross.\nThe Witnesses lie dead in the Street of the Great City:\n\n60 No Faith is in all the Earth: the Book of God is trodden under Foot!\nHe sent his two Servants Whitefield & Westley: were they Prophets,\nOr were they Idiots or Madmen? shew us Miracles!\n\np. 22 CAN you have greater Miracles than these? Men who devote\nTheir life's whole comfort to intire scorn & injury & death.\nAwake, thou sleeper on the Rock of Eternity, Albion awake!\nThe trumpet of Judgment hath twice sounded: all Nations are awake,\n5 But thou art still heavy and dull: Awake, Albion awake!\n\n19\n\n\n\nLo, Ore arises on the Atlantic. Lo, his blood and fire\n. Glow on America's shore: Albion turns upon his Couch:\nHe listens to the sounds of War, astonished and confounded:\nHe weeps into the Atlantic deep, yet still in dismal dreams\n\nlo Unwaken'd: and the Covering Cherub advances from the East.\nHow long shall we lay dead in the Street of the great City:\nHow long beneath the Covering Cherub give our Emanations?\nMilton will utterly consume us & thee our beloved Father:\nHe hath enter'd into the Covering Cherub, becoming one with\n\n15 Albion's dread Sons, Hand, Hyle & Coban surround him as\nA girdle; Gwendolen & Conwenna as a garment woven\nOf War & Religion; let us descend & bring him chained\nTo Bowlahoola, O father most beloved! O mild Parent!\nCruel in thy mildness, pitying and permitting evil,\n\n20 Tho' strong and mighty to destroy, O Los our beloved Father.\n\nLike the black storm, coming out of Chaos, beyond the stars:\nIt issues thro' the dark & intricate caves of the Mundane Shell,\nPassing the planetary visions, & the well adorned Firmament.\nThe Sun rolls into Chaos & the stars into the Desarts:\n\n25 And then the storms become visible, audible & terrible.\n\nCovering the light of day & rolling down upon the mountains\nDeluge all the country round. Such is a vision of Los,\nWhen Rintrah & Palamabron spake : and such his stormy face\nAppear'd as does the face of heaven, when cover *d with thick storms\n\n30 Pitying and loving tho' in frowns of terrible perturbation.\n\nBut Los dispers'd the clouds even as the strong winds of Jehovah.\nAnd Los thus spoke: O noble Sons, be patient yet a little:\nI have embrac'd the falling Death, he is become one with me:\nO Sons, we live not by wrath, by mercy alone we live!\n\n35 I recoiled an old Prophecy in Eden recorded in gold; and oft\nSung to the harp: That Milton of the land of Albion\nShould up ascend forward from Felpham's Vale & break the Chain\nOf Jealousy from all its roots; be patient therefore, O my Sons.\nThese lovely Females form sweet night and silence and secret\n\n40 Obscurities to hide from Satan's Watch-Fiends Human loves\nAnd graces, lest they write them in their Books & in the Scroll\nOf mortal life, to condemn the accused: who at Satan's Bar\nTremble in Spedtrous Bodies continually day and night.\nWhile on the Earth they live in sorrowful Vegetation.\n\n45 O when shall we tread our Wine-presses in heaven, and Reap\nOur wheat with shoutings of joy, and leave the Earth in peace.''\n\n20\n\n\n\nRemember how Calvin and Luther m fury premature\nSow'd War and stern division between Papists & Protestants.\nLet it not be so now: O go not forth in Martyrdoms & Wars!\n\n50 We were plac'd here by the Universal Brotherhood & Mercy,\nWith powers fitted to circumscribe this dark Satanic death,\nAnd that the Seven Eyes of God may have space for Redemption.\nBut how this is as yet we know not, and we cannot know,\nTill Albion is arisen: then patient wait a little while,\n\n55 Six Thousand years are pass'd away, the end approaches fast:\nThis mighty one is come from Eden, he is of the Eled:,\nWho died from Earth & he is return'd before the Judgment. This thing\nWas never known that one of the holy dead should willing return.\nThen patient wait a little while till the Last Vintage is over:\n\n60 Till we have quench'd the Sun of Salah in the lake of Udan-Adan.\nO my dear Sons: leave not your Father, as your brethren left me:\nTwelve Sons successive fled away in that thousand years of sorrow,\n\np. 23 OF Palamabron's Harrow, & of Rintrah's wrath &fury:\n\nReuben & Manazzoth & Gad & Simeon & Levi,\n\nAnd Ephraim & Judah were Generated, because\n\nThey left me wandering with Tirzah: Enitharmon wept\n5 One thousand years, and all the Earth was in a wat'ry deluge.\n\nWe call'd him Menassheh because of the Generations of Tirzah,\n\nBecause of Satan : & the Seven Eyes of God continually\n\nGuard round them, but I the Fourth Zoa am also set\n\nThe Watchman of Eternity: the Three are not: & I am preserved.\n10 Still my four mighty ones are left to me in Golgonooza,\n\nStill Rintrah fierce, and Palamabron mild & piteous,\n\nTheotormon fill'd with care, Bromion loving Science:\n\nYou O my Sons still guard round Los: O wander not & leave me!\n\nRintrah, thou well rememberest when Amalek & Canaan\n15 Fled with their Sister Moab into that abhorred Void,\n\nThey became Nations in our sight beneath the hands of Tirzah.\n\nAnd Palamabron thou rememberest when Joseph an infant.\n\nStolen from his nurses cradle wrap'd in needle-work\n\nOf emblematic texture, was sold to the Amalekite,\n20 Who carried him down into Egypt where Ephraim & Menassheh\n\nGather'd my Sons together in the Sands of Midian.\n\nAnd if you also flee away and leave your Father's side\n\nFollowing Milton into Ulro, altho' your power is great\n\nSurely you also shall become poor mortal vegetations\n25 Beneath the Moon of Ulro: pity then your Father's tears.\n\n21\n\n\n\nWhen Jesus rais'd Lazarus from the Grave I stood & saw\nLazarus, who is the Vehicular Body of Albion the Redeem'd,\nArise into the Covering Cherub, who is the Spedre of Albion,\nBy martyrdoms to suffer: to watch over the Sleeping Body,\n\n30 Upon his Rock beneath his Tomb. I saw the Covering Cherub\nDivide Four-fold into Four Churches when Lazarus arose,\nPaul, Constantine, Charlemaine, Luther: behold they stand before us\nStretch'd over Europe & Asia: come O Sons, come, come away.\nArise O Sons give all your strength against Eternal Death,\n\n35 Lest we are vegetated, for Cathedron's Looms weave only Death,\nA Web of Death: & were it not for Bowlahoola & AUamanda\nNo Human Form but only a Fibrous Vegetation,\nA Polypus of soft affedions without Thought or Vision,\nMust tremble in the Heavens & Earths thro' all the Ulro space.\n\n40 Throw all the Vegetated Mortals into Bowlahoola:\nBut as to this Eleded Form who is return'd again.\nHe is the Signal that the Last Vintage now approaches,\nNor Vegetation may go on till all the Earth is reap'd.\n\nSo Los spoke. Furious they descended to Bowlahoola & AUamanda:\n45 Indignant, unconvinced by Los's arguments & thun[d]ers rolling:\nThey saw that wrath now sway'd and now pity absorb'd him.\nAs it was so it remain'd & no hope of an end.\n\nBowlahoola is nam'd Law by mortals, Tharmas founded it:\n\nBecause of Satan before Luban in the City of Golgonooza.\n\n50 But Golgonooza is nam'd Art & Manufadlure by mortal men.\n\nIn Bowlahoola Los's Anvils stand & his Furnaces rage:\nThundering the Hammers beat & the Bellows blow loud.\nLiving, self moving, mourning, lamenting & howling incessantly.\nBowlahoola thro' all its porches feels, tho' too fast founded\n\n55 Its pillars & porticoes to tremble at the force\n\nOf mortal or immortal arm : and softly lilling flutes\n\nAccordant with the horrid labours make sweet melody.\n\nThe Bellows are the Animal Lungs: the Hammers the Animal Heart:\n\nThe Furnaces the Stomach for digestion: terrible their fury.\n\n60 Thousands & thousands labour, thousands play on instruments\nStringed or fluted to ameliorate the sorrows of slavery.\nLoud sport the dancers in the dance of death rejoicing in carnage:\nThe hard dentant Hammers are luU'd by the flutes lula lula.\nThe bellowing Furnaces blare by the long sounding clarion,\n\n65 The double drum drowns howls & groans, the shrill fife shrieks & cries:\n\n22\n\n\n\nThe crooked horn mellows the hoarse raving serpent, terrible, but harmonious.\nBowlahoola is the Stomach in every individual man.\n\nLos is by mortals nam'd Time, Enitharmon is nam'd Space:\n\nBut they depidl him bald & aged who is in eternal youth\n70 All powerful and his looks flourish like the brows of morning:\n\nHe is the Spirit of Prophecy, the ever apparent Elias.\n\nTime is the mercy of Eternity; without Time's swiftness.\n\nWhich is the swiftest of all things, all were eternal torment.\n\nAll the Gods of the Kingdoms of Earth labour in Los's Halls:\n75 Every one is a fallen Son of the Spirit of Prophecy:\n\nHe is the Fourth Zoa that stood around the Throne Divine.\n\np. 24 BUT the Wine-press of Los is eastward of Golgonooza before the Seat\nOf Satan: Luvah laid the foundation & Urizen finish'd it in howling woe.\nHow red the sons & daughters of Luvah! here they tread the grapes:\nLaughing & shouting, drunk with odours, many fall o'erwearied,\n5 Drown'd in the wine is many a youth & maiden: those around\n\nLay them on skins of Tygers & of the spotted Leopard & the Wild Ass,\nTill they revive, or bury them in cool grots, making lamentation.\n\nThis Wine-press is call'd War on Earth: it is the Printing- Press\nOf Los: and here he lays his words in order above the mortal brain,\n10 As cogs are form'd in a wheel to turn the cogs of the adverse wheel.\n\nTimbrels & violins sport round the Wine-presses; the little Seed,\nThe sportive Root, the Earth-worm, the gold Beetle, the wise Emmet\nDance round the Wine-presses of Luvah: the Centipede is there:\nThe ground Spider with many eyes: the Mole clothed in velvet:\n\n15 The ambitious Spider in his sullen web: the lucky golden Spinner:\nThe Earwig arm'd : the tender Maggot emblem of immortality:\nThe Flea: Louse: Bug: the Tape-worm: all the Armies of Disease:\nVisible or invisible to the slothful vegetating Man.\nThe Slow Slug: the Grasshopper that sings & laughs & drinks:\n\n20 Winter comes, he folds his slender bones without a murmur.\n\nThe cruel Scorpion is there: the Gnat: Wasp: Hornet & the Honey Bee:\nThe Toad & venomous Newt; the Serpent cloth'd in gems & gold.\nThey throw off their gorgeous raiment: they rejoice with loud jubilee\nAround the Wine-presses of Luvah, naked & drunk with wine.\n\n25 There is the Nettle that stings with soft down, and there\nThe indignant Thistle, whose bitterness is bred in his milk.\nWho feeds on contempt of his neighbour: there all the idle weeds\nThat creep around the obscure places shew their various limbs\n\n23\n\n\n\nNaked in all their beauty dancing round the Wine-presses.\n\n30 But in the Wine-presses the Human grapes sing not nor dance.\n\nThey howl & writhe in shoals of torment: in fierce flames consuming,\nIn chains of iron & in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires:\nIn pits & dens & shades of death: in shapes of torment & woe.\nThe plates & screws & wracks & saws & cords & fires & cisterns,\n\n35 The cruel joys of Luvah's daughters lacerating with knives\nAnd whips their Vidims, & the deadly sport of Luvah's Sons.\n\nThey dance around the dying, & they drink the howl & groan.\nThey catch the shrieks in cups of gold, they hand them to one another :\nThese are the sports of love, & these the sweet delights of amorous play,\n40 Tears of the grape, the death sweat of the cluster, the last sigh\nOf the mild youth who listens to the lureing songs of Luvah.\n\nBut Allamanda, call'd on Earth Commerce, is the Cultivated land\nAround the City of Golgonooza in the Forests of Entuthon:\nHere tne Sons of Los labour against Death Eternal; through all\n45 The Twenty-seven Heavens of Beulah in Ulro, Seat of Satan,\n\nWhich is the False Tongue beneath Beulah : It is the Sense of Touch.\nThe Plow goes forth in tempests & lightnings & the Harrow cruel\nIn blights of the east, the heavy Roller follows in bowlings of woe.\n\nUrizen's sons here labour also; & here are seen the Mills\n50 Of Theotormon on the verge of the Lake of Udan-Adan.\n\nThese are the starry voids of night & the depths & caverns of earth.\nThese Mills are oceans, clouds & waters ungovernable in their fury:\nHere are the stars created & the seeds of all things planted.\nAnd here the Sun & Moon received their fixed destinations.\n\n55 But in Eternity the Four Arts: Poetry, Painting, Music,\n\nAnd Architecture which is Science: are the Four Faces of Man.\nNot so in Time & Space: there Three are shut out, and only\nScience remains thro' Mercy: & by means of Science the Three\nBecome apparent in Time & Space in the Three Professions,\n\n60 Poetry in Religion: Music, Law: Painting, in Physic & Surgery:\nThat Man may live upon Earth all the time of his awaking.\nAnd from these Three Science derives every Occupation of Men:\nAnd Science is divided into Bowlahoola & Allamanda.\n\np. 25 LOUD shout the Sons of Luvah at the Wine-presses, as Los descended\nWith Rintrah & Palamabron in his fires of resistless fury.\n\nThe Wine-press on the Rhine groans loud, but all its central beams\n\n24\n\n\n\nAd more terrific in the central Cities of the Nations,\n5 Where Human Thought is crush'd beneath the iron hand of Power:\nThere Los puts all into the Press, the Opressor & the Opressed\nTogether, ripe for the Harvest & Vintage & ready for the Loom.\n\nThey sang at the Vintage. This is the Last Vintage: & Seed\nShall no more be sown upon Earth till all the Vintage is over,\nlo And all gather'd in, till the Plow has pass'd over the Nations,\nAnd the Harrow & heavy thundering Roller upon the mountains.\n\nAnd loud the Souls howl round the Porches of Golgonooza,\nCrying: O God deliver us to the Heavens or to the Earths\nThat we may preach righteousness & punish the sinner with death.\n15 But Los refused, till all the Vintage of Earth was gathered in.\n\nAnd Los stood & cried to the Labourers of the Vintage in voice of awe :\n\nFellow Labourers! The Great Vintage & Harvest is now upon Earth.\nThe whole extent of the Globe is explored. Every scatter'd Atom\nOf Human Intelled: now is flocking to the sound of the Trumpet.\n\n20 All the Wisdom which was hidden in caves & dens from ancient\nTime, is now sought out from Animal & Vegetable & Mineral.\nThe Awakener is come outstretch'd over Europe : the Vision of God is fulfilled :\nThe Ancient Man upon the Rock of Albion Awakes:\nHe listens to the sounds of War astonish'd & ashamed,\n\n25 He sees his Children mock at Faith and deny Providence.\n\nTherefore you must bind the Sheaves not by Nations or Families: <\n\nYou shall bind them in Three Classes, according to their Classes\nSo shall you bind them: Separating What has been Mixed\nSince Men began to be Wove into Nations by Rahab & Tirzah,\n\n30 Since Albion's Death & Satan's Cutting off from our awful Fields:\nWhen under pretence to benevolence the Eledl Subdu'd All\nFrom the Foundation of the World. The Eled is one Class: You\nShall bind them separate: they cannot Believe in Eternal Life\nExcept by Miracle & a New Birth. The other two Classes:\n\n35 The Reprobate who never cease to Believe, and the Redeem'd\nWho live in doubts & fears perpetually tormented by the Eled,\nThese you shall bind in a twin-bundle for the Consummation:\nBut the Eledt must be saved [from] fires of Eternal Death,\nTo be formed into the Churches of Beulah that they destroy not the Earth.\n\n40 For in every Nation & every Family the Three Classes are born,\nAnd in every Species of Earth, Metal, Tree, Fish, Bird & Beast\nWe form the Mundane Egg, that Spedres coming by fury or amity.\nAll is the same, & every one remains in his own energy.\n\n25 E\n\n\n\nGo forth Reapers with rejoicing, you sowed in tears,\n\n45 But the time of your refreshing cometh: only a little moment\nStill abstain from pleasure & rest, in the labours of eternity.\nAnd you shall Reap the whole Earth from Pole to Pole: from Sea to Sea:\nBeglning at Jerusalem's Inner Court, Lambeth ruin'd and given\nTo the detestable Gods of Priam, to Apollo: and at the Asylum\n\n50 Given to Hercules who labour in Tirzah's Looms for bread.\nWho set Pleasure against Duty: who Create Olympic crowns\nTo make Learning a burden, & the Work of the Holy Spirit, Strife:\nThe Thor & cruel Odin who first rear'd the Polar Caves.\nLambeth mourns, calling Jerusalem: she weeps & looks abroad\n\n55 For the Lord's coming, that Jerusalem may overspread all Nations.\nCrave not for the mortal & perishing delights, but leave them\nTo the weak, and pity the weak as your infant care; Break not\nForth in your wrath lest you also are vegetated by Tirzah.\nWait till the judgement is past, till the Creation is consumed,\n\n60 And then rush forward with me into the glorious spiritual\nVegetation: the Supper of the Lamb & his Bride: and the\nAwaking of Albion our friend and ancient companion.\n\nSo Los spoke. But lightnings of discontent broke on all sides round\nAnd murmurs of thunder rolling heavy long & loud over the mountains,\n65 While Los call'd his Sons around him to the Harvest & the Vintage.\n\nThou seest the Constellations in the deep & wondrous Night:\nThey rise in order and continue their immortal courses\nUpon the mountains & in vales with harp & heavenly song,\nWith flute & clarion: with cups & measures fill'd with foaming wine.\n70 Glitt'ring the streams refledl the Vision of beatitude,\n\nAnd the calm Ocean joys beneath & smooths his awful waves:\n\np. 26 THESE are the Sons of Los, & these the Labourers of the Vintage.\nThou see'st the gorgeous clothed Flies that dance & sport in summer\nUpon the sunny brooks & meadows: every one the dance\nKnows in its intricate mazes of delight artful to weave:\n5 Each one to sound his instruments of music in the dance.\nTo touch each other & recede: to cross & change & return.\nThese are the Children of Los. Thou seest the Trees on mountains:\nThe wind blows heavy, loud they thunder thro' the darksom sky.\nUttering prophecies & speaking instruftive words to the sons\n10 Of men: These are the Sons of Los: These the Visions of Eternity.\nBut we see only as it were the hem of their garments\nWhen with our vegetable eyes we view these wondrous Visions.\n\n26\n\n\n\nThere are two Gates thro' which all Souls descend, One Southward\nFrom Dover Cliff to Lizard Point, the other toward the North,\n15 Caithness & rocky Durness, Pentland & John Groat's House.\n\nThe Souls descending to the Body, wail on the right hand\nOf Los: & those deliver'd from the Body on the left hand.\nFor Los against the east his force continually bends,\nAlong the Valleys of Middlesex from Hounslow to Blackheath,\n20 Lest those Three Heavens of Beulah should the Creation destroy,\nAnd lest they should descend before the north & south Gates:\nGroaning with pity, he among the wailing Souls laments.\n\nAnd these the Labours of the Sons of Los in Allamanda\n\nAnd in the City of Golgonooza: & in Luban: & around\n25 The Lake of Udan-Adan, in the Forests of Entuthon Benython:\n\nWhere Souls incessant wail, being piteous Passions & Desires,\n\nWith neither lineament nor form: but like to wat'ry clouds\n\nThe Passions & Desires descend upon the hungry winds:\n\nFor such alone Sleepers remain meer passion & appetite:\n30 The Sons of Los clothe them & feed & provide houses & fields.\n\nAnd every Generated Body in its inward form\n\nIs a garden of delight & a building of magnificence,\n\nBuilt by the Sons of Los in Bowlahoola & Allamanda:\n\nAnd the herbs & flowers & furniture & beds & chambers\n35 Continually woven in the Looms of Enitharmon's Daughters,\n\nIn bright Cathedron's golden Dome with care & love & tears.\n\nFor the various Classes of Men are all mark'd out determinate\n\nIn Bowlahoola: & as the Spedres choose their affinities.\n\nSo they are born on Earth, & every Class is determinate:\n40 But not by Natural, but by Spiritual power alone. Because\n\nThe Natural power continually seeks & tends to Destrudtion,\n\nEnding in death : which would of itself be Eternal Death.\n\nAnd all are Class'd by Spiritual & not by Natural power.\n\nAnd every Natural Effedl has a Spiritual Cause, and Not\n45 A Natural: for a Natural Cause only seems: it is a Delusion\nOf Ulro & a ratio of the perishing Vegetable Memory.\n\np. 27 SOME Sons of Los surround the Passions with porches of iron & silver,\nCreating form & beauty around the dark regions of sorrow,\nGiving to airy nothing a name and a habitation\nDelightful: with bounds to the Infinite putting off the Indefinite\n5 Into most holy forms of Thought: (such is the power of inspiration).\n\n27\n\n\n\nThey labour incessant, with many tears & afflidions,\nCreating the beautiful House for the piteous sufferer.\n\nOthers, Cabinets richly fabricate of gold & ivory.\n\nFor Doubts & fears unform'd & wretched & melancholy,\n\nlo The little weeping Spedre stands on the threshold of Death\nEternal: and sometimes two Spedtres like lamps quivering\nAnd often malignant they combat (heart-breaking sorrowful & piteous).\nAntamon takes them into his beautiful flexible hands.\nAs the Sower takes the seed or as the Artist his clay\n\n15 Or fine wax, to mould artful a model for golden ornaments,\nThe soft hands of Antamon draw the indelible Line:\nForm immortal with golden pen; such as the Spedre admiring\nPuts on the sweet form; then smiles Antamon bright thro' his windows.\nThe Daughters of beauty look up from their Loom & prepare\n\n20 The integument soft for its clothing with joy & delight.\n\nBut Theotormon & Sotha stand in the Gate of Luban anxious:\nTheir numbers are seven million & seven thousand & seven hundred:\nThey contend with the weak Spedres, they fabricate soothing forms.\nThe Spedre refuses, he seeks cruelty: they create the crested Cock:\n25 Terrified the Spedre screams & rushes in fear into their Net\nOf kindness & compassion & is born a weeping terror.\nOr they create the Lion & Tyger in compassionate thunderings:\nHowling the Spedres flee: they take refuge in Human lineaments.\n\nThe Sons of Ozoth within the Optic Nerve stand fiery glowing :\n30 And the number of his Sons is eight millions & eight.\nThey give delights to the man unknown; artificial riches\nThey give to scorn, & their possessors to trouble & sorrow & care,\nShutting the sun & moon & stars, & trees, & clouds, & waters.\nAnd hills out from the Optic Nerve & hardening it into a bone\n35 Opake, and like the black pebble on the enraged beach.\n\nWhile the poor indigent is like the diamond which tho' cloth'd\nIn ragged covering in the mine, is open all within\nAnd in his hallow'd center holds the heavens of bright eternity.\nOzoth here builds walls of rocks against the surging sea,\n40 And timbers crampt with iron cramps bar in the joys of life\n\nFrom fell destrudion in the Spedrous cunning or rage. He Creates\n\nThe speckled Newt, the Spider & Beetle, the Rat & Mouse,\n\nThe Badger & Fox: they worship before his feet in trembling fear.\n\nBut others of the Sons of Los build Moments & Minutes & Hours\n45 And Days & Months & Years & Ages & Periods: wondrous buildings\n\n28\n\n\n\nAnd every Moment has a Couch of Gold for soft repose,\n(A Moment equals a pulsation of the artery),\nAnd between every two Moments stands a Daughter of Beulah\nTo feed the Sleepers on their Couches with maternal care.\n\n50 And every Minute has an azure Tent with silken Veils:\n\nAnd every Hour has a bright golden Gate carved with skill:\nAnd every Day & Night has Walls of brass & Gates of adamant,\nShining like precious Stones & ornamented with appropriate signs:\nAnd every Month a silver paved Terrace builded high:\n\n55 And every Year invulnerable Barriers with high Towers:\n\nAnd every Age is Moated deep with Bridges of silver & gold:\n\nAnd every Seven Ages is Incircled with a Flaming Fire.\n\nNow Seven Ages is amounting to Two Hundred Years.\n\nEach has its Guard, each Moment, Minute, Hour, Day, Month & Year.\n\n60 All are the work of Fairy hands of the Four Elements:\nThe Guard are Angels of Providence on duty evermore.\nEvery Time less than a pulsation of the artery\nIs equal in its period & value to Six Thousand Years.\n\np. 28 FOR in this Period the Poet's Work is Done; and all the Great\nEvents of Time start forth & are conceiv'd in such a Period,\nWithin a Moment, a Pulsation of the Artery.\n\nThe Sky is an immortal Tent built by the Sons of Los:\n5 And every Space that a Man views around his dwelling-place,\nStanding on his own roof, or in his garden on a mount\nOf twenty-five cubits in height, such space is his Universe:\nAnd on its verge the Sun rises & sets, the Clouds bow\nTo meet the flat Earth & the Sea in such an order'd space:\n\n10 The Starry heavens reach no further, but here bend and set\nOn all sides, & the two Poles turn on their valves of gold :\nAnd if he move his dwelling-place, his heavens also move\nWher'eer he goes & all his neighbourhood bewail his loss :\nSuch are the Spaces called Earth & such its dimension.\n\n15 As to that false appearance which appears to the reasoner\nAs of a Globe rolling thro' Voidness, it is a delusion of Ulro.\nThe Microscope knows not of this nor the Telescope: they alter\nThe ratio of the Spectator's Organs but leave Obje6ts untouch'd.\nFor every Space larger than a red Globule of Man's blood,\n\n20 Is visionary, and is created by the Hammer of Los:\n\nAnd every Space smaller than a Globule of Man's blood opens\nInto Eternity of which this vegetable Earth is but a shadow:\n\n29\n\n\n\nThe red Globule is the unwearied Sun by Los created\nTo measure Time and Space to mortal Men every morning.\n25 Bowlahoola & Allamanda are placed on each side\n\nOf that Pulsation & that Globule, terrible their power.\n\nBut Rintrah & Palamabron govern over Day & Night\nIn Allamanda & Entuthon Benython where Souls wail:\nWhere Ore incessant howls burning in fires of Eternal Youth,\n30 Within the vegetated mortal Nerves; for every Man born is joined\nWithin into One mighty Polypus, and this Polypus is Ore.\n\nBut in the Optic vegetative Nerves Sleep was transformed\nTo Death in old time by Satan the father of Sin & Death:\nAnd Satan is the Speftre of Ore, & Ore is the generate Luvah.\n\n35 But in the Nerves of the Nostrils, Accident being Formed\nInto Substance & Principle, by the cruelties of Demonstration\nIt became Opake & Indefinite : but the Divine Saviour\nFormed it into a Solid by Los's Mathematic power.\nHe named the Opake, Satan: he named the Solid, Adam.\n\n40 And in the Nerves of the Ear (for the Nerves of the Tongue are closed)\nOn Albion's Rock Los stands creating the glorious Sun each morning,\nAnd when unwearied in the evening he creates the Moon,\nDeath to delude, who all in terror at their splendor leaves\nHis prey while Los appoints, & Rintrah & Palamabron guide,\n\n45 The Souls clear from the Rock of Death, that Death himself may wake\nIn his appointed season when the ends of heaven meet.\n\nThen Los conduds the Spirits to be Vegetated into\nGreat Golgonooza, free from the four iron pillars of Satan's Throne,\nTemperance, Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, the four pillars of tyranny,\n50 That Satan's Watch-Fiends touch them not before they Vegetate.\n\nBut Enitharmon and her Daughters take the pleasant charge\n\nTo give them to their lovely heavens till the Great Judgment Day:\n\nSuch is their lovely charge. But Rahab & Tirzah pervert\n\nTheir mild influences, therefore the Seven Eyes of God walk round\n\n55 The Three Heavens of Ulro where Tirzah & her Sisters\nWeave the black Woof of Death upon Entuthon Benython,\nIn the Vale of Surrey where Horeb terminates in Rephaim.\nThe stamping feet of Zelophehad's Daughters are cover'd with Human gore\nUpon the treddles of the Loom: they sing to the winged shuttle\n\n60 The River rises above his banks to wash the Woof:\n\n30\n\n\n\nHe takes it in his arms; he passes it in strength thro* his current.\nThe veil of human miseries is woven over the Ocean,\nFrom the Atlantic to the Great South Sea, the Erythrean.\n\nSuch is the World of Los, the labour of six thousand years:\n65 Thus Nature is a Vision of the Science of the Elohim.\n\n\n\nEND OF THE FIRST BOOK\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\np. 30 How wide the Gulf & Unpassable! between Simplicity ^ Insipidity.\n\nMILTON\n\nContraries are Positives:\nA Negation is not a Contrary,\n\nBOOK THE SECOND\n\nTHERE is a place where Contraries are equally True:\nThis place is called Beulah. It is a pleasure lovely Shadow-\nWhere no dispute can come, Because of those who Sleep.\nInto this place the Sons & Daughters of Ololon descended\n5 With solemn mourning, into Beulah's moony shades & hills\nWeeping for Milton : mute wonder held the Daughters of Beulah,\nEnraptur'd with afFedion sweet and mild benevolence.\n\nBeulah is evermore created around Eternity ; appearing\nTo the Inhabitants of Eden around them on all sides,\n10 But Beulah to its Inhabitants appears within each district,\nAs the beloved infant in his mother's bosom round incircled\nWith arms of love & pity & sweet compassion. But to\nThe Sons of Eden the moony habitations of Beulah\nAre from Great Eternity a mild & pleasant Rest.\n\n15 And it is thus Created. Lo, the Eternal Great Humanity\nTo whom be Glory & Dominion Evermore, Amen,\nWalks among all his awful Family seen in every face:\nAs the breath of the Almighty such are the words of man to man\nIn the great Wars of Eternity, in fury of Poetic Inspiration,\n\n20 To build the Universe stupendous : Mental forms Creating.\n\nBut the Emanations trembled exceedingly, nor could they\nLive, because the Life of Man was too exceeding unbounded.\nHis joy became terrible to them, they trembled & wept,\nCrying with one voice: Give us a habitation & a place\n\n25 In which we may be hidden under the shadow of wings:\n\nFor if we, who are but for a time & who pass away in winter.\nBehold these wonders of Eternity we shall consume:\nBut you, O our Fathers & Brothers, remain in Eternity\nBut grant us a Temporal Habitation, do you speak\n\n30 To us; we will obey your words as you obey Jesus\nThe Eternal who is blessed for ever & ever. Amen.\n\n32\n\n\n\nSo spake the lovely Emanations: & there appeared a pleasant\nMild Shadow above, beneath, & on all sides round.\n\np. 31 INTO this pleasant Shadow all the weak & weary\nLike Women & Children were taken away as on wings\nOf dovelike softness, & shadowy habitations prepared for them.\nBut every man return'd & went still going forward thro'\n5 The Bosom of the Father in Eternity on Eternity,\nNeither did any lack or fall into Error without\nA Shadow to repose in all the Days of happy Eternity.\n\nInto this pleasant Shadow Beulah all Ololon descended,\nAnd when the Daughters of Beulah heard the lamentation\n10 All Beulah wept, for they saw the Lord coming in the Clouds,\nAnd the Shadows of Beulah terminate in rocky Albion.\n\nAnd all Nations wept in affliction. Family by Family:\nGermany wept towards France &: Italy : England wept & trembled\nTowards America: India rose up from his golden bed,\n15 As one awaken'd in the night: they saw the Lord coming\nIn the Clouds of Ololon with Power & Great Glory.\n\nAnd all the Living Creatures of the Four Elements wail'd\n\nWith bitter wailing: these in the aggregate are named Satan\n\nAnd Rahab: they know not of Regeneration, but only of Generation,\n\n20 The Fairies, Nymphs, Gnomes & Genii of the Four Elements,\nUnforgiving & unalterable, these cannot be Regenerated\nBut must be Created, for they know only of Generation.\nThese are the Gods of the Kingdoms of the Earth : in contrarious\nAnd cruel opposition: Element against Element, opposed in War,\n\n25 Not Mental, as the Wars of Eternity, but a Corporeal Strife :\n\nIn Los's Halls continual labouring in the Furnaces of Golgonooza.\nOre howls on the Atlantic: Enitharmon trembles: All Beulah weeps\n\nThou hearest the Nightingale begin the Song of Spring:\nThe Lark sitting upon his earthly bed, just as the morn\n\n30 Appears, listens silent, then springing from the waving Cornfield! loud\nHe leads the Choir of Day: trill, trill, trill, trill,\nMounting upon the wings of light into the Great Expanse,\nReechoing against the lovely blue & shining heavenly Shell.\nHis little throat labours with inspiration; every feather\n\n35 On throat & breast & wings vibrates with the effluence Divine :\nAll Nature listens silent to him, & the awful Sun\nStands still upon the Mountain looking on this little Bird\n\n33 F\n\n\n\nWith eyes of soft humility & wonder, love & awe.\n\nThen Loud from their green covert all the Birds begin their Song:\n\n40 The Thrush, the Linnet & the Goldfinch, Robin & the Wren\nAwake the Sun from his sweet reverie upon the Mountain:\nThe Nightingale again assays his song & thro' the day\nAnd thro' the night warbles luxuriant: every Bird of Song\nAttending his loud harmony with admiration & love.\n\n45 This is a Vision of the Lamentation of Beulah over Ololon.\n\nThou perceivest the Flowers put forth their precious Odours,\nAnd none can tell how from so small a center comes such sweet,\nForgetting that within that Center Eternity expands\nIts ever during doors, that Og & Anak fiercely guard.\n\n50 First e'er the morning breaks joy opens in the flowery bosoms,\n\nJoy even to tears, which the Sun rising dries : first the Wild Thyme\nAnd Meadow-sweet downy and soft, waving among the reeds.\nLight springing on the air lead the sweet Dance, they wake\nThe Honeysuckle sleeping on the Oak: the flaunting beauty\n\n55 Revels along upon the wind : the White-thorn, lovely May,\nOpens her many lovely eyes: listening the Rose still sleeps:\nNone dare to wake her, soon she bursts her crimson curtained bed\nAnd comes forth in the majesty of beauty : every Flower,\nThe Pink, the Jessamine, the Wall-flower, the Carnation\n\n60 The Jonquil, the mild Lilly opes her heavens; every Tree\n\nAnd Flower & Herb soon fill the air with an innumerable Dance,\nYet all in order sweet & lovely. Men are sick with Love :\nSuch is a Vision of the Lamentation of Beulah over Ololon.\n\np. 32 AND the Divine Voice was heard in the Songs of Beulah, Saying\nWhen I first Married you, I gave you all my whole Soul:\nI thought that you would love my loves & joy in my delights,\nSeeking for pleasures in my pleasures, O Daughter of Babylon.\n5 Then thou wast lovely, mild & gentle, now thou art terrible\nIn jealousy & unlovely in my sight, because thou hast cruelly\nCut off my loves in fury till I have no love left for thee.\nThy love depends on him thou lovest & on his dear loves\nDepend thy pleasures, which thou hast cut off by jealousy:\n10 Therefore I shew my Jealousy & set before you Death.\nBehold Milton descended to Redeem the Female Shade\nFrom Death Eternal; such your lot, to be continually Redeem'd\nBy Death & misery of those you love & by Annihilation.\nWhen the Sixfold Female perceives that Milton annihilates\n\n34\n\n\n\n15 Himself: that seeing all his loves by her cut off, heHeaves\nHer also, intirely abstradling himself from Female loves:\nShe shall relent in fear of death; She shall begin to give\nHer maidens to her husband, delighting in his delight.\nAnd then & then alone begins the happy Female joy\n\n20 As it is done in Beulah, & thou, O Virgin Babylon Mother of Whoredoms,\nShalt bring Jerusalem in thine arms in the night watches: and\nNo longer turning her a wandering Harlot in the streets,\nShalt give her into the arms of God your Lord & Husband,\n\nSuch are the Songs of Beulah, in the Lamentations of Ololon.\n\np. 34 AND all the Songs of Beulah sounded comfortable notes\nTo comfort Ololon's lamentation, for they said:\nAre you the Fiery Circle that late drove in fury & fire\nThe Eight Immortal Starry-Ones down into Ulro dark,\n5 Rending the Heavens of Beulah with your thunders & lightnings?\nAnd can you thus lament & can you pity & forgive?\nIs terror chang'd to pity, O wonder of Eternity ?\n\nAnd the Four States of Humanity in its Repose,\n\nWere shewed them. First of Beulah, a most pleasant Sleep\n10 On Couches soft, with mild music, tended by Flowers of Beulah,\n\nSweet Female forms, winged or floating in the air spontaneous:\n\nThe Second State is Alia, & the third State Al-Ulro :\n\nBut the Fourth State is dreadful, it is named Or-Ulro.\n\nThe First State is in the Head, the Second is in the Heart,\n15 The Third in the Loins & Seminal Vessels, & the Fourth\n\nIn the Stomach & Intestines terrible, deadly, unutterable.\n\nAnd he whose Gates are open'd in those Regions of his Body\n\nCan from those Gates view all these wondrous Imaginations.\n\nBut Ololon sought the Or-Ulro & its fiery Gates,\n2c And the Couches of the Martyrs: & many Daughters of Beulah\nAccompany them down to the Ulro with soft melodious tears,\nA long journey & dark thro' Chaos in the track of Milton's course,\nTo where the Contraries of Beulah War beneath Negations Banner.\n\nThen View'd from Milton's Track they see the Ulro, a vast Polypus\n25 Of living fibres down into the Sea of Time & Space growing,\nA self-devouring monstrous Human Death Twenty seven fold:\nWithin it sit Five Females & the nameless Shadowy Mother,\nSpinning it from their bowels with songs of amorous delight\nAnd melting cadences that lure the Sleepers of Beulah down\n\n35\n\n\n\n30 The River Storge (which is Arnon) into the Dead Sea :\n\nAround this Polypus Los continual builds the Mundane Shell.\n\nFour Universes round the Universe of Los remain Chaotic,\nFour intersecting Globes, & the Egg form'd World of Los\nIn midst: stretching from Zenith to Nadir, in midst of Chaos.\n35 One of these Ruin'd Universes is to the North, named Urthona:\nOne in the South, this was the glorious World of Urizen:\nOne to the East, of Luvah: One to the West, of Tharmas.\nBut when Luvah assumed the World of Urizen in the South\nAll fell towards the Center sinking-downward in dire Ruin.\n\n40 Here in these Chaoses the Sons of Ololon took their abode.\nIn chasms of the Mundane Shell which open on all sides round,\nSouthward & by the East within the Breach of Milton's descent.\nTo watch the time, pitying & gentle to awaken Urizen.\nThey stood in a dark land of death, of fiery corroding waters,\n\n45 Where lie in evil death the Four Immortals pale and cold.\nAnd the Eternal Man, even Albion, upon the Rock of Ages.\nSeeing Milton's Shadow, some Daughters of Beulah trembling\nReturn'd, but Ololon remain'd before the Gates of the Dead.\n\n50 And Ololon looked down into the Heavens of Ulro in fear.\nThey said: How are the Wars of man which in Great Eternity\nAppear around, in the External Spheres of Visionary Life,\nHere render'd deadly within the Life & Interior Vision?\nHow are the Beasts & Birds & Fishes & Plants & Minerals\n\n55 Here fix'd into a frozen bulk subjedt to decay & death?\n\nThose Visions of Human Life & Shadows of Wisdom & Knowledge\n\np. 35 ARE here frozen to unexpansive deadly destroying terrors.\nAnd War & Hunting, the Two Fountains of the River of Life,\nAre become Fountains of bitter Death & of Corroding Hell:\nTill Brotherhood is chang'd into a Curse & a Flattery,\n5 By Differences between Ideas, that Ideas themselves, (which are\nThe Divine Members) may be slain in offerings for sin.\nO dreadful Loom of Death! O piteous Female Forms compell'd\nTo weave the Woof of Death! On Camberwell Tirzah's Courts,\nMalah's on Blackheath, Rahab & Noah dwell on Windsor's heights:\n10 Where once the Cherubs of Jerusalem spread to Lambeth's Vale\nMilcah's Pillars shine from Harrow to Hampstead, where Hoglah\nOn Highgate's heights magnificent Weaves over trembling Thames\nTo Shooters' Hill and thence to Blackheath the dark Woof; Loud,\n\n36\n\n\n\nLoud roll the Weights & Spindles over the whole Earth let down\n15 On all sides round to the Four Quarters of the World, eastward on\nEurope to Euphrates & Hindu to Nile & back in Clouds\nOf Death across the Atlantic to America North & South.\n\nSo spake Ololon in reminiscence astonish'd, but they\nCould not behold Golgonooza without passing the Polypus,\n\n20 A wondrous journey not passable by Immortal feet, & none\nBut the Divine Saviour can pass it without annihilation.\nFor Golgonooza cannot be seen till having pass'd the Polypus\nIt is viewed on all sides round by a Four-fold Vision,\nOr till you become Mortal & Vegetable in Sexuality\n\n25 Then you behold its mighty Spires & Domes of ivory & gold\n\nAnd Ololon examined all the Couches of the Dead,\nEven of Los & Enitharmon & all the Sons of Albion\nAnd his Four Zoas terrified & on the verge of Death:\nIn midst of these was Milton's Couch, & when they saw Eight\n30 Immortal Starry-Ones, guarding the Couch in flaming fires.\nThey thunderous utter'd all a universal groan falling down\nProstrate before the Starry Eight asking with tears forgiveness.\nConfessing their crime with humiliation and sorrow.\n\nO how the Starry Eight rejoic'd to see Ololon descended:\n\n35 And now that a wide road was open to Eternity\n\nBy Ololon's descent thro' Beulah to Los & Enitharmon.\nFor mighty were the multitudes of Ololon, vast the extent\nOf their great sway reaching from Ulro to Eternity,\nSurrounding the Mundane Shell outside in its Caverns\n\n40 And through Beulah, and all silent forbare to contend\n\nWith Ololon, for they saw the Lord in the Clouds of Ololon.\n\nThere is a Moment in each Day that Satan cannot find.\n\nNor can his Watch Fiends find it, but the Industrious find\nThis Moment & it multiply, & when it once is found\n45 It renovates every Moment of the Day if rightly placed:\nIn this Moment Ololon descended to Los & Enitharmon\nUnseen beyond the Mundane Shell, Southward in Milton's track.\n\nJust in this Moment when the morning odours rise abroad.\nAnd first from the Wild Thyme, stands a Fountain in a rock\n50 Of crystal flowing into two Streams, one flows thro' Golgonooza\nAnd thro' Beulah to Eden beneath Los's western Wall :\nThe other flows thro' the Aerial Void & all the Churches\n\n37\n\n\n\nMeeting again in Golgonooza beyond Satans Seat.\n\nThe Wild Thyme is Los's Messenger to Eden, a mighty Demon,\n55 Terrible, deadly & poisonous his presence in Ulro dark.\nTherefore he appears only a small Root creeping in grass\nCovering over the Rock of Odours his bright purple mantle:\nBeside the Fount above the Lark's Nest in Golgonooza.\nLuvah slept here in death & here is Luvah's empty Tomb:\n60 Ololon sat beside this Fountain on the Rock of Odours.\n\nJust at the place to where the Lark mounts is a Crystal Gate:\nIt is the enterance of the First Heaven, named Luther : for\nThe Lark is Los's Messenger thro' the Twenty seven Churches,\nThat the Seven Eyes of God, who walk even to Satan's Seat\n65 Thro' all the Twenty-seven Heavens, may not slumber nor sleep.\nBut the Lark's Nest is at the Gate of Los, at the eastern\nGate of wide Golgonooza & the Lark is Los's Messenger.\n\np. 2^ WHEN on the highest lift of his light pinions he arrives\nAt that bright Gate, another Lark meets him, & back to back\nThey touch their pinions, tip [to] tip: and each descend\nTo their respedive Earths & there all night consult with Angels\n5 Of Providence & with the eyes of God all night in slumbers\nInspired; & at the dawn of day send out another Lark\nInto another Heaven to carry news upon his wings.\nThus are the Messengers dispatch'd till they reach the Earth again\nIn the East Gate of Golgonooza, & the Twenty-eighth bright\n10 Lark met the Female Ololon descending into my Garden.\nThus it appears to Mortal eyes & those of the Ulro Heavens\nBut not thus to Immortals: the Lark is a mighty Angel.\n\nFor Ololon step'd into the Polypus within the Mundane Shell:\nThey could not step into Vegetable Worlds without becoming\n\n15 The enemies of Humanity except in a Female Form:\nAnd as One Female Ololon and all its mighty Hosts\nAppear'd: a Virgin of twelve years: nor time nor space was\nTo the perception of the Virgin Ololon, but as the\nFlash of lightning, but more quick, the Virgin in my Garden\n\n20 Before my Cottage stood, for the Satanic Space is delusion.\n\nFor When Los join'd with me he took me in his fiery whirlwind:\nMy Vegetated portion was hurried from Lambeth's shades :\nHe set me down in Felpham's Vale & prepar'd a beautiful\nCottage for me, that in three years I might write all these Visions,\n\n38\n\n\n\n25 To display Nature's cruel holiness: the deceits of Natural Religion.\nWalking in my Cottage Garden, sudden I beheld\nThe Virgin Ololon & address'd her as a Daughter of Beulah.\n\nVirgin of Providence, fear not to enter into my Cottage.\nWhat is thy message to thy friend: What am I now to do?\n30 Is it again to plunge into deeper afflidlion? behold me\nReady to obey, but pity thou my Shadow of Delight:\nEnter my Cottage, comfort her, for she is sick with fatigue.\n\np. 37 THE Virgin answer'd: Knowest thou of Milton who descended,\n\nDriven from Eternity; him I seek, terrified at my Ad\n\nIn Great Eternity which thou knowest: I come him to seek.\n\nSo Ololon utter'd in words distind the anxious thought:\n5 Mild was the voice but more distindl than any earthly.\nThat Milton's Shadow heard, & condensing all his Fibres\nInto a strength impregnable of majesty & beauty infinite,\nI saw he was the Covering Cherub & within him Satan\nAnd Rahab in an outside which is fallacious within,\n10 Beyond the outline of Identity in the Selfhood deadly:\n\nAnd he appear'd the Wicker Man of Scandinavia, in whom\nJerusalem's children consume in flames among the Stars.\n\nDescending down into my Garden a Human Wonder of God,\nReaching from heaven to earth, a Cloud & Human Form,\n15 I beheld Milton with astonishment & in him beheld\n\nThe Monstrous Churches of Beulah, the Gods of Ulro dark,\nTwelve monstrous dishumanized terrors. Synagogues of Satan,\nA Double Twelve & Thrice Nine: such their divisions.\n\nAnd these their Names & their Places within the Mundane Shell.\n\n20 In Tyre & Sidon I saw Baal & Ashtaroth. In Moab Chemosh:\nIn Ammon Molech: loud his Furnaces rage among the Wheels\nOf Og, & pealing loud the cries of the Vidtims of Fire:\nAnd pale his Priestesses unfolded in Veils of Pestilence, border'd\nWith War: Woven in Looms of Tyre & Sidon by beautiful Ashtaroth.\n\n25 In Palestine Dagon, Sea Monster: worship'd o'er the Sea.\nThammuz in Lebanon & Rimmon in Damascus curtain'd:\nOsiris, Isis, Orus, in Egypt : dark their Tabernacles on Nile\nFloating with solemn songs, & on the Lakes of Egypt nightly\nWith pomp even till morning break & Osiris appear in the sky.\n\n30 But Belial of Sodom & Gomorrha, obscure Demon of Bribes\n\n39\n\n\n\nAnd secret Assasl nations, not worship'd nor ador'd: but\n\nWith the finger on the h'ps & the back turn'd to the light.\n\nAnd Saturn, Jove & Rhea of the Isles of the Sea remote.\n\nThese Twelve Gods, are the Twelve Speftre Sons of the Druid Albion\n\n35 And these the names of the Twenty-seven Heavens & their Churches.\nAdam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch,\nMethuselah, Lamech: these are Giants, mighty. Hermaphroditic.\nNoah, Shem, Arphaxad, Cainan the second, Salah, Heber,\nPeleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah, these are the Female-Males,\n\n40 A Male within a Female hid as in an Ark & Curtains.\nAbraham, Moses, Solomon, Paul, Constantine, Charlemaine,\nLuther, these seven are the Male-Females, the Dragon Forms,\nReligion hid in War, a Dragon red & hidden Harlot.\n\nAll these are seen in Milton's Shadow who is the Covering Cherub,\n45 The Spedre of Albion, in which the Sped:re of Luvah inhabits,\nIn the Newtonian Voids between the Substances of Creation.\n\nFor the Chaotic Voids outside of the Stars are measured by\nThe Stars, which are the boundaries of Kingdoms, Provinces\n\n50 And Empires of Chaos invisible to the Vegetable Man.\nThe Kingdom of Og is in Orion: Sihon is in Ophiucus.\nOg has Twenty-seven Distridts: Sihon's Distridts Twenty-one,\nFrom Star to Star, Mountains & Valleys, terrible dimension\nStretched out, compose the Mundane Shell, a mighty Incrustation\n\n55 Of Forty-eight deformed Human Wonders of the Almighty\nWith Caverns whose remotest bottoms meet again beyond\nThe Mundane Shell in Golgonooza, but the Fires of Los rage\nIn the remotest bottoms of the Caves, that none can pass\nInto Eternity that way, but all descend to Los\n\n60 To Bowlahoola & AUamanda & to Entuthon Benython.\n\nThe Heavens are the Cherub: the Twelve Gods are Satan:\n\np. 39 AND the Forty-eight Starry Regions are Cities of the Levites,\nThe Heads of the Great Polypus. Four-fold twelve enormity\nIn mighty & mysterious comingling, enemy with enemy.\nWoven by Urizen into Sexes from his mantle of years.\n5 And Milton colleding all his fibres into impregnable strength\nDescended down a Paved work of all kinds of precious stones\nOut from the eastern sky; descending down into my Cottage\nGarden, clothed in black, severe & silent he descended.\n\n40\n\n\n\nThe Spedre of Satan stood upon the roaring sea & beheld\nlo Milton within his sleeping Humanity: trembling & shudd'ring\nHe stood upon the waves a Twenty seven fold mighty Demon\nGorgeous & beautiful: loud roll his thunders against Milton:\nLoud Satan thunder'd, loud & dark upon mild Felpham shore,\nNot daring to touch one fibre he howl'd round upon the Sea.\n\n15 I also stood in Satan's bosom & beheld its desolations:\n\nA ruin'd Man: a ruin'd building of God, not made with hands:\nIts plains of burning sand, its mountains of marble terrible:\nIts pits & declivities flowing with molten ore & fountains\nOf pitch & nitre: its ruin'd palaces & cities & mighty works:\n\n20 Its furnaces of afflidion, in which his Angels & Emanations\nLabour with blacken'd visages among its stupendous ruins,\nArches & Pyramids & porches, colonades & domes.\nIn which dwells Mystery, Babylon, here is her secret place.\nFrom hence she comes forth in the Churches in delight,\n\n25 Here is her cup fill'd with its poisons, in these horrid vales,\nAnd here her scarlet Veil woven in pestilence & war;\nHere is Jerusalem bound in chains in the Dens of Babylon.\n\nIn the Eastern porch of Satan's Universe Milton stood & said:\n\nSatan! my Spedtre! I know my power thee to annihilate,\n\n30 And be a greater in thy place, & be thy Tabernacle,\nA covering for thee to do thy will, till one greater comes\nAnd smites me as I smote thee & becomes my covering.\nSuch are the Laws of thy false Heav'ns: but Laws of Eternity\nAre not such: know thou! I come to Self Annihilation.\n\n35 Such are the Laws of Eternity, that each shall mutually\nAnnihilate himself for others' good, as I for thee.\nThy purpose & the purpose of thy Priests & of thy Churches\nIs to impress on men the fear of death; to teach\nTrembling & fear, terror, constri6lion : abjedl selfishness.\n\n40 Mine is to teach Men to despise death & to go on\nIn fearless majesty annihilating Self, laughing to scorn\nThy Laws & terrors, shaking down thy Synagogues, as webs.\nI come to discover before Heav'n & Hell the Self righteousness\nIn all its Hypocritic turpitude, opening to every eye\n\n45 These wonders of Satan's holiness, shewing to the Earth\nThe Idol Virtues of the Natural Heart, & Satan's Seat\nExplore in all its Selfish Natural Virtue & put off\nIn Self annihilation all that is not of God alone:\n\n41\n\n\n\nTo put off Self & all I have, ever & ever. Amen.\n\n50 Satan heard, Coming in a cloud, with trumpets & flaming fire.\nSaying: I am God the judge of all, the living & the dead.\nFall therefore down & worship me, submit thy supreme\nDidate, to my eternal Will & to my dictate bow.\nI hold the Balances of Right & Just & mine the Sword:\n\n55 Seven Angels bear my Name & in those Seven I appear.\nBut I alone am God & I alone in Heav'n & Earth\nOf all that live dare utter this, others tremble & bow :\n\np. 40 TILL all Things become One Great Satan in Holiness\nOppos'd to Mercy, and the Divine Delusion Jesus be no more.\n\nSuddenly around Milton on my Path, the Starry Seven\nBurn'd terrible: my Path became a solid fire, as bright\n5 As the clear Sun & Milton silent came down on my Path.\nAnd there went forth from the Starry limbs of the Seven, Forms\nHuman, with Trumpets innumerable, sounding articulate\nAs the Seven spake: and they stood in a mighty Column of Fire\nSurrounding Felpham's Vale, reaching to the Mundane Shell, Saying:\n\n10 Awake, Albion awake ! reclaim thy Reasoning Spe6tre. Subdue\nHim to the Divine Mercy. Cast him down into the Lake\nOf Los, that ever burneth with fire, ever & ever, Amen!\nLet the Four Zoas awake from Slumbers of Six thousand years.\n\nThen loud the Furnaces of Los were heard; & seen as Seven Heavens\n15 Stretching from South to North over the mountains of Albion.\n\nSatan heard; trembling round his Body, he incircled it:\nHe trembled with exceeding great trembling & astonishment,\nHowling in his Spedtre round his Body hung'ring to devour.\nBut fearing for the pain, for if he touches a Vital\n\n20 His torment is unendurable: therefore he cannot devour:\nBut howls round it as a lion round his prey continually.\nLoud Satan thunder'd, loud & dark upon mild Felpham's Shore,\nComing in a Cloud with Trumpets & with Fiery Flame,\nAn awful Form eastward from midst of a bright Paved-work\n\n25 Of precious stones by Cherubim surrounded: so permitted\n(Lest he should fall apart in his Eternal Death) to imitate\nThe Eternal Great Humanity Divine surrounded by\nHis Cherubim & Seraphim in ever happy Eternity.\nBeneath sat Chaos: Sin on his right hand. Death on his left,\n\n42\n\n\n\n30 And Ancient Night spread over all the heav'n his Mantle of Laws.\nHe trembled with exceeding great trembling & astonishment.\n\nThen Albion rose up in the Night of Beulah on his Couch\nOf dread repose seen by the visionary eye: his face is toward\nThe east, toward Jerusalem's Gates: groaning he sat above\n\n35 His rocks, London & Bath & Legions & Edinburgh\n\nAre the four pillars of his Throne: his left foot near London\nCovers the shades of Tyburn : his instep from Windsor\nTo Primrose Hill stretching to Highgate & Holloway.\nLondon is between his knees: its basements fourfold:\n\n40 His right foot stretches to the sea on Dover cliffs, his heel\nOn Canterbury's ruins; his right hand covers lofty Wales:\nHis left Scotland; his bosom girt with gold involves\nYork, Edinburgh, Durham & Carlisle, & on the front\nBath, Oxford, Cambridge, Norwich : his right elbow\n\n45 Leans on the Rocks of Erin's Land, Ireland, ancient nation.\nHis head bends over London: he sees his embodied Spedtre\nTrembling before him with exceeding great trembling & fear.\nHe views Jerusalem & Babylon, his tears flow down:\nHe mov'd his right foot to Cornwall, his left to the Rocks of Bognor:\n\n50 He strove to rise to walk into the Deep, but strength failing\nForbad, & down with dreadful groans he sunk upon his Couch\nIn moony Beulah. Los his strong Guard Walks round beneath the Moon.\n\nUrizen faints in terror striving among the Brooks of Arnon\nWith Milton's Spirit: as the Plowman or Artificer or Shepherd\n\n55 While in the labours of his Calling sends his Thought abroad\nTo labour in the ocean or in the starry heaven. So Milton\nLabour 'd in Chasms of the Mundane Shell tho' here before\nMy Cottage midst the Starry Seven, where the Virgin Ololon\nStood trembling in the Porch: loud Satan thunder'd on the stormy Sea,\n\n60 Circling Albion's Chffs, in which the Four-fold World resides\nTho' seen in fallacy outside: a fallacy of Satan's Churches.\n\np. 42 BEFORE Ololon Milton stood & perciev'd the Eternal Form\nOf that mild Vision: wondrous were their ads by me unknown\nExcept remotely: and I heard Ololon say to Milton:\n\nI see thee strive upon the Brooks of Arnon, there a dread\nS And awful Man I see, o'ercover'd with the mantle of years.\nI behold Los & Urizen, I behold Ore & Tharmas,\nThe Four Zoas of Albion, & thy Spirit with them striving,\n\n43\n\n\n\nIn Self annihilation giving thy life to thy enemies.\n\nAre those who contemn Religion & seek to annihilate it\nlo Become in their Femin[in]e portions the causes & promoters\n\nOf these Religions, how is this thing: this Newtonian Phantasm,\n\nThis Voltaire & Rousseau: this Hume & Gibbon & Bolingbroke:\n\nThis Natural Religion; this impossible absurdity?\n\nIs Ololon the cause of this? O where shall I hide my face?\n15 These tears fall for the httle ones, the Children of Jerusalem,\n\nLest they be annihilated in thy annihilation.\n\nNo sooner she had spoke but Rahab Babylon appear'd\nEastward upon the Paved work across Europe & Asia,\nGlorious as the midday Sun in Satan's bosom glowing:\n20 A Female hidden in a Male, Religion hidden in War,\n\nNam'd Moral Virtue: cruel two-fold Monster shining bright,\nA Dragon red & hidden Harlot which John in Patmos saw.\n\nAnd all beneath the Nations innumerable of Ulro\nAppear'd, the Seven Kingdoms of Canaan & Five Baalim\n25 Of Philistea into Twelve divided, call'd after the Names\nOf Israel: as they are in Eden. Mountain, River & Plain,\nCity & sandy Desart intermingled beyond mortal ken.\n\nBut turning toward Ololon in terrible majesty Milton\nReplied: Obey thou the Words of the Inspired Man.\n\n30 All that can be (can be) annihilated must be annihilated\nThat the Children of Jerusalem may be saved from slavery.\nThere is a Negation, & there is a Contrary:\nThe Negation must be destroy'd to redeem the Contraries.\nThe Negation is the Spedlre: the Reasoning Power in Man:\n\n35 This is a false Body: an Incrustation over my Immortal\n\nSpirit; a Selfhood which must be put off & annihilated alway,\nTo cleanse the Face of my Spirit by Self-examination:\n\np. 43 TO bathe in the waters of Life: to wash off the Not Human.\nI come in Self-annihilation & the grandeur of Inspiration,\nTo cast off Rational Demonstration by Faith in the Saviour,\nTo cast off the rotten rags of Memory by Inspiration,\n5 To cast off Bacon, Locke & Newton from Albion's covering.\nTo take off his filthy garments & clothe him with Imagination,\nTo cast aside from Poetry, all that is not Inspiration\nThat it no longer shall dare to mock with the aspersion of Madness,\nCast on the Inspired by the tame high finisher of paltry Blots:\n\n44\n\n\n\nlo Indefinite or paltry Rhymes: or paltry Harmonies:\n\nWho creeps into State Government like a catterpiller to destroy,\nTo cast off the idiot Questioner who is always questioning,\nBut never capable of answering, who sits with a sly grin\nSilent plotting when to question like a thief in a cave:\n\n15 Who publishes doubt & calls it knowledge: whose Science is Despair:\nWhose pretence to knowledge is Envy: whose whole Science is\nTo destroy the wisdom of ages to gratify ravenous Envy,\nThat rages round him like a Wolf day & night without rest.\nHe smiles with condescension: he talks of Benevolence & Virtue:\n\n20 And those who a6l with Benevolence & Virtue they murder time on time.\nThese are the destroyers of Jerusalem, those are the murderers\nOf Jesus, who deny the Faith & mock at Eternal Life:\nWho pretend to Poetry that they may destroy Imagination,\nBy imitation of Nature's Images drawn from Remembrance.\n\n25 These are the Sexual Garments, the Abomination of Desolation,\nHiding the Human Lineaments as with an Ark & Curtains\nWhich Jesus rent: & now shall wholly purge away with Fire\nTill Generation is swallow'd up in Regeneration.\n\nThen trembled the Virgin Ololon & reply 'd in clouds of despair:\n\n30 Is this our Femin[in]e Portion, the Six- fold Miltonic Female?\nTerribly this Portion trembles before thee, O awful Man.\nAltho' our Human Power can sustain the severe contentions\nOf Friendship, our Sexual cannot: but flies into the Ulro.\nHence arose all our terrors in Eternity: & now remembrance\n\n35 Returns upon us: are we contraries, O Milton, Thou & I,\nO Immortal,? how were we led to War the Wars of Death.''\nIs this the Void Outside of Existence, which if enter'd into\n\np. 44 BECOMES a Womb? & is this the Death Couch of Albion?\nThou goest to Eternal Death & all must go with thee.\n\nSo saying the Virgin divided Six-fold, & with a shriek\nDolorous that ran thro' all Creation, a Double Six-fold Wonder:\n5 Away from Ololon she divided & fled into the depths\nOf Milton's Shadow as a Dove upon the stormy Sea.\n\nThen as a Moony Ark Ololon descended to Felpham's Vales,\nIn clouds of blood, in streams of gore, with dreadful thunderings.\nInto the Fires of Intelledl that rejoic'd in Felpham's Vale\n10 Around the Starry Eight: with one accord the Starry Eight became\nOne Man, Jesus the Saviour, wonderful! round his limbs\n\n45\n\n\n\nThe Clouds of Ololon folded as a Garment dipped in blood,\nWritten within & without in woven letters: & the Writing\nIs the Divine Revelation in the Litteral expression:\n15 A Garment of War. I heard it nam'd the Woof of Six Thousand Years.\n\nAnd I beheld the Twenty-four Cities of Albion\nArise upon their Thrones to Judge the Nations of the Earth:\nAnd the Immortal Four in whom the Twenty- four appear Four- fold\nArose around Albion's body: Jesus wept, & walked forth\n20 From Felpham's Vale clothed in Clouds of blood, to enter into\nAlbion's Bosom, the bosom of death, & the Four surrounded him\nIn the Column of Fire in Felpham's Vale: then to their mouths the Four\nApplied their Four Trumpets, & then sounded to the Four winds.\n\nTerror struck in the Vale I stood at that immortal sound:\n25 My bones trembled, I fell outstretch'd upon the path\nA moment, & my Soul returned into its mortal state.\nTo ResurreAion & Judgment in the Vegetable Body :\nAnd my sweet Shadow of delight stood trembling by my side.\n\nImmediately the Lark mounted with a loud trill from Felpham's Vale,\n30 And the Wild Thyme from Wimbleton's green & impurpled Hills.\nAnd Los & Enitharmon rose over the Hills of Surrey:\nTheir clouds roll over London with a south wind: soft Oothoon\nPants in the Vales of Lambeth, weeping o'er her Human Harvest.\nLos listens to the Cry of the Poor Man : his Cloud\n35 Over London in volume terrific, low bended in anger.\n\nRintrah & Palamabron view the Human Harvest beneath.\nTheir Wine-presses & Barns stand open: the Ovens are prepar'd:\nThe Waggons ready: terrific Lions & Tygers sport & play:\nAll Animals upon the Earth are preparM in all their strength\n\np. 45 TO go forth to the Great Harvest & Vintage of the Nations.\n\n\n\nFinis.\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n\nEXTRA PAGES.\n\np. 3* BENEATH the Plow of Rintrah & the Harrow of the Almighty,\nIn the hands of Palamabron, Where the Starry Mills of Satan\nAre built beneath the Earth & Waters of the Mundane Shell:\nHere the Three Classes of Men take their Sexual texture Woven.\n5 The Sexual is Threefold : the Human is Fourfold.\n\nIf you account it Wisdom when you are angry to be silent, and\nNot to shew it: I do not account that Wisdom, but Folly.\nEvery Man's Wisdom is peculiar to his own Individuality.\nO Satan, my youngest born, art thou not Prince of the Starry Hosts,\nlo And of the Wheels of Heaven, to turn the Mills day & night?\nArt thou not Newton's Pantocrator, weaving the Woof of Locke?\nTo Mortals thy Mills seem every thing, & the Harrow of Shaddai\nA Scheme of Human Condudt invisible & incomprehensible.\nGet to thy Labours at the Mills & leave me to my wrath.\n\n15 Satan was going to reply, but Los roU'd his loud thunders.\n\nAnger me not! thou canst not drive the Harrow in pity's paths:\nThy Work is Eternal Death with Mills & Ovens & Cauldrons.\nTrouble me no more, thou canst not have Eternal Life.\n\nSo Los spoke : Satan trembling obey'd, weeping along the way.\n\n20 Mark well my words! they are of your eternal Salvation!\n\nBetween South Molton Street & Stratford Place: Calvary's foot:\nWhere the Vidims were preparing for sacrifice their Cherubim:\nAround their loins pour'd forth their arrows, & their bosoms beam\nWith all colours of precious stones, and their inmost palaces\n\n25 Resounded with preparation of animals wild & tame.\n\n(Mark well my words: Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies)\nMocking Druidical Mathematical Proportion of Length, Bredth, Highth:\nDisplaying Naked Beauty: with Flute & Harp & Song.\n\n\n\np. 5* BY Enitharmon's looms when Albion was slain upon his Mountains,\nAnd in his tent, through envy of the living form, even of the Divine Vision,\nAnd of the sports of wisdom in the Human Imagination,\nWhich is the Divine Body of the Lord Jesus blessed for ever.\nMark well my words, they are of your eternal salvation.\n\n47\n\n\n\nUrizen lay in darkness and solitude in chains of the mind locked up.\nLos seized his hammer and tongs ; he laboured at his resolute anvil\nAmong indefinite Druid rocks, and snows of doubt and reasoning.\n\nRefusing all definite form the Abstract Horror roofed, stony hard;\n10 And a first age passed over, and a state of dismal woe.\n\nDown sunk with fright a red hot globe, round, burning, deep.\nDeep down into the abyss, panting, conglobing, trembling ;\nAnd a second age passed over, and a state of dismal woe.\n\nRolling round into two little orbs, and closed in two little caves,\n15 The ages beheld the Abyss, lest bones of solitude freeze all over;\nAnd a third age passed over, and a state of dismal woe.\n\nFrom beneath his orbs of vision two ears in close volutions\nShot spiring out in the deep darkness and petrified as they grew;\nAnd a fourth age passed over, and a state of dismal woe.\n\n20 Hanging upon the wind two nostrils bent down into the deep.\nAnd a fifth age passed over, and a state of dismal woe.\n\nIn ghastly torment sick, a tongue of hunger and thirst flamed out.\nAnd a sixth age passed over, and a state of dismal woe.\n\nEnraged and stifled without and within, in terror and woe he threw his\n25 Right arm to the north, his left arm to the south, and his feet\nStamped the nether abyss in trembling and howling and dismay.\nAnd a seventh age passed over, and a state of dismal woe.\n\nTerrified, Los stood in the abyss, and his immortal limbs\nGrew deadly pale. He became what he beheld, for a red\n\n30 Round globe sunk down from his Bosom into the Deep. In pangs\nHe hovered, it trembling and weeping. Trembling it shook\nThe nether abyss in tremblings. He wept over it, he cherished it\nIn deadly, sickening pain, till separated into a female pale\nAs the cloud that brings the snow. All the while from his Back\n\n35 A blue fluid exuded in sinews, hardening in the abyss.\nTill it separated into a male form howling in jealousy.\nWithin, labouring; beholding without, \u2014 from particulars to generals\nSubduing his Spedre. They builded the Looms of Generation ;\nThey builded great Golgonooga, Time on Times, ages on ages.\n\n40 First Ore was born, then the Shadowy Female, then all Los's family.\nAt last Enitharmon brought forth Satan, refusing Form. In vain\nThe Miller of Eternity made subservient to the Great Harvest,\n\n48\n\n\n\nThat he may go to his own Place, Prince of the Starry Wheels.\n\np. 8* THEN Los & Enitharmon knew that Satan is Urizen,\nDrawn down by Ore & the Shadowy Female into Generation.\nOft Enitharmon enter'd weeping into the Space, there appearing\nAn aged Woman raving along the Streets (The Space is named\n5 Canaan): then she returned to Los, weary, frighted as from dreams.\n\nThe nature of a Female Space is this: it shrinks the Organs\nOf Life till they become finite & Itself seems Infinite.\n\nAnd Satan vibrated in the immensity of the Space: limited\nTo those without but Infinite to those within: it fell down and\nlo Became Canaan: closing Los from Eternity in Albion's Cliffs.\nA mighty Fiend against the Divine Humanity must'ring to War.\n\nSatan: Ah me! is gone to his own place, said Los: their Gods\nI will not worship in their Churches, nor King in their Theatres.\nElynittria! whence is this Jealousy running along the mountains,'*\n\n15 British Women were not Jealous when Greek & Roman were Jealous.\nEvery thing in Eternity shines by its own Internal light: but thou\nDarkenest every Internal light with the arrows of thy quiver.\nBound up in the horns of Jealousy to a deadly fading Moon.\nAnd Ocalythron binds the Sun into a Jealous Globe,\n\n20 That every thing is fix'd, Opake without Internal light.\n\nSo Los lamented over Satan who triumphant divided the Nations\n\n\n\np. 17* AND Tharmas Demon of the Waters, & Ore, who is Luvah.\n\nThe Shadowy Female seeing Milton, howled in her lamentation\n\nOver the Deeps, outstretching her Twenty seven Heavens over Albion.\n\nAnd thus the Shadowy Female howls in articulate howlings:\n\nI will lament over Milton in the lamentations of the afflidled:\nMy Garments shall be woven of sighs & heart broken lamentations:\nThe misery of unhappy Families shall be drawn out into its border,\nWrought with the needle with dire sufferings, poverty, pain & woe.\nAlong the rocky Island & thence throughout the whole Earth\nThere shall be the sick Father & his starving Family: there\nThe Prisoner in the Stone Dungeon & the Slave at the Mill.\n\n49 K\n\n\n\nI will have writings written all over it in Human Words,\nThat every Infant that is born upon the Earth shall read\nAnd get by rote as a hard task of a life of sixty years.\n\n15 I will have Kings inwoven upon it, & Councellors & Mighty Men:\nThe Famine shall clasp it together with buckles & Clasps,\nAnd the Pestilence shall be its fringe & the War its girdle,\nTo divide into Rahab & Tirzah that Milton may come to our tents.\nFor I will put on the Human Form & take the Image of God,\n\n20 Even Pity & Humanity, but my Clothing shall be Cruelty:\nAnd I will put on Holiness as a breastplate & as a helmet,\nAnd all my ornaments shall be of the gold of broken hearts.\nAnd the precious stones of anxiety & care & desperation & death\nAnd repentance for sin & sorrow & punishment & fear,\n\n25 To defend me from thy terrors, O Ore! my only beloved!\n\nOre answer'd: Take not the Human Form, O loveliest. Take not\nTerror upon thee! Behold how I am, & tremble lest thou also\nConsume in my Consummation: but thou maist take a Form\nFemale & lovely, that cannot consume in Man's consummation.\n\n30 Wherefore dost thou Create & Weave this Satan for a Covering.^\nWhen thou attemptest to put on the Human Form, my wrath\nBurns to the top of heaven against thee in Jealousy & Fear.\nThen I rend thee asunder, then I howl over thy clay & ashes.\nWhen wilt thou put on the Female Form as in times of old,\n\n35 With a Garment of Pity & Compassion like the Garment of God?\nHis Garments are long sufferings for the Children of Men,\nJerusalem is his Garment & not thy Covering Cherub, O lovely\nShadow of my dehght, who wanderest seeking for the prey.\n\nSo spoke Ore, when Oothoon & Leutha hover'd over his Couch\n40 Of fire in interchange of Beauty & Perfection in the darkness.\n\nOpening interiorly into Jerusalem & Babylon shining glorious.\nIn the Shadowy Female's bosom Jealous her darkness grew:\nHowlings fill'd all the desolate places in accusations of Sin,\nIn Female beauty shining in the unform'd void, & Ore in vain\n45 Stretch'd out his hands of fire, & wooed: they triumph in his pain.\n\nThus darken'd the Shadowy Female tenfold, & Ore tenfold\nGlow'd on his rocky Couch against the darkness: loud thunders\nTold of the enormous conflift. Earthquake beneath, around.\nRent the Immortal Females, limb from limb & joint from joint,\n\n50\n\n\n\n50 And moved the fast foundations of the Earth to wake the Dead.\nUrizen emerged from his Rocky Form & from his Snows.\n\np. 32* AND Milton oft sat up on the Couch of Death & oft conversed\nIn vision & dream beatific with the Seven Angels of the Presence:\nI have turned my back upon these Heavens builded on cruelty.\nMy Speftre still wandering thro' them follows my Emanation,\n5 He hunts her footsteps thro' the snow & the wintry hail & rain.\nThe idiot Reasoner laughs at the Man of Imagination,\nAnd from laughter proceeds to murder by undervaluing calumny.\n\nThen Hillel, who is Lucifer, replied over the Couch of Death,\nAnd thus the Seven Angels instructed him & thus they converse:\n\n10 We are not Individuals but States: Combinations of Individuals.\n\nWe were Angels of the Divine Presence: & were Druids in Annandale,\nCompell'd to combine into Form by Satan, the Spedlre of Albion,\nWho made himself a God & destroyed the Human Form Divine.\nBut the Divine Humanity & Mercy gave us a Human Form,\n\n15 Because we were combin'd in Freedom & holy Brotherhood:\n\nWhile those combined by Satan's Tyranny, first in the blood of War\nAnd Sacrifice, & next in Chains of imprisonment, are Shapeless Rocks\nRetaining only Satan's Mathematic Holiness, Length, Bredth & Highth.\nCalling the Human Imagination: which is the Divine Vision & Fruition\n\n20 In which Man liveth eternally: madness & blasphemy, against\n\nIts own Qualities, which are Servants of Humanity, not Gods or Lords.\nDistinguish therefore States from Individuals in those States.\nStates Change: but Individual Identities never change nor cease.\nYou cannot go to Eternal Death in that which can never Die.\n\n25 Satan & Adam are States Created into Twenty-seven Churches:\nAnd thou, O Milton, art a State about to be Created,\nCalled Eternal Annihilation, that none but the Living shall\nDare to enter: & they shall enter triumphant over Death\nAnd Hell and the Grave: States that are not, but ah! Seem to be.\n\n30 Judge then of thy Own Self: thy Eternal Lineaments explore.\n\nWhat is Eternal & what Changeable? & what Annihilable?\n\nThe Imagination is not a State: it is the Human Existence itself.\n\nAfFedlion or Love becomes a State when divided from Imagination.\n\nThe Memory is a State always, & the Reason is a State\n35 Created to be Annihilated, & a new Ratio Created.\n\n51\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\nWhatever can be Created can be Annihilated: Forms cannot.\nThe Oak is cut down by the Ax, the Lamb falls by the Knife,\nBut their Forms Eternal exist, For ever. Amen. Hallelujah !\n\nThus they converse with the Dead, watching round the Couch of Death:\n\nFor God himself enters Death's Door always with those that enter,\n\nAnd lays down in the Grave with them, in Visions of Eternity,\n\nTill they awake & see Jesus, & the Linen Clothes lying\n\nThat the Females had Woven for them, & the Gates of their Father's House.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1551244", "artist_names": "The Young Rascals", "full_title": "Hold On by\u00a0The\u00a0Young Rascals", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/785a79798ccccf7d1394fe421450e2e3.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/785a79798ccccf7d1394fe421450e2e3.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 1551244, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429896405, "path": "/The-young-rascals-hold-on-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-young-rascals-hold-on-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1969, "month": 12, "day": 15}, "release_date_for_display": "December 15, 1969", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Dec. 15, 1969", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/785a79798ccccf7d1394fe421450e2e3.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/785a79798ccccf7d1394fe421450e2e3.1000x1000x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Hold On", "title_with_featured": "Hold On", "updated_by_human_at": 1486971680, "url": "https://genius.com/The-young-rascals-hold-on-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/253981", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b46c7f1239aca796f844ff81218caa1c.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 253981, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b46c7f1239aca796f844ff81218caa1c.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "y", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Young Rascals", "slug": "The-young-rascals", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-young-rascals"}, "artist": "The Young Rascals", "lyrics": "Hold On LyricsHold on, I'll tell you in a minute\nI got a mind to go out and get it\nHold on, I'll tell you in a minute\nI been thinkin' \u2018bout life and livin'\n\nYou sure lookin' fine pretty woman\nI'd like to get to know you little better\nMaybe learn to live up on a star\nNow what you think of that girl\n\nJust like a bee needs a hive\nI need your love to keep me alive\nDo you hear what I say ?\nI want you to hold on, I'll tell you in a minute\nWhen an apple's ripe, you gotta pick it\nHold on, I'll tell you in a minute\nI got a feelin' that I'm gonna get it\n\nI've seen you walkin' around little darlin'\nI like the way you got it all together\nWhat you think of you and me baby\nIt would be out-of-site, would you like to go out tonight ?

I doubt if my guardian were altogether taken by surprise when he received the representation, though it caused him much uneasiness and disappointment. He and Richard were often closeted together, late at night and early in the morning, and passed whole days in London, and had innumerable appointments with Mr. Kenge, and laboured through a quantity of disagreeable business. While they were thus employed, my guardian, though he underwent considerable inconvenience from the state of the wind and rubbed his head so constantly that not a single hair upon it ever rested in its right place, was as genial with Ada and me as at any other time, but maintained a steady reserve on these matters. And as our utmost endeavours could only elicit from Richard himself sweeping assurances that everything was going on capitally and that it really was all right at last, our anxiety was not much relieved by him.\n\nWe learnt, however, as the time went on, that a new application was made to the Lord Chancellor on Richard's behalf as an infant and a ward, and I don't know what, and that there was a quantity of talking, and that the Lord Chancellor described him in open court as a vexatious and capricious infant, and that the matter was adjourned and readjourned, and referred, and reported on, and petitioned about until Richard began to doubt (as he told us) whether, if he entered the army at all, it would not be as a veteran of seventy or eighty years of age. At last an appointment was made for him to see the Lord Chancellor again in his private room, and there the Lord Chancellor very seriously reproved him for trifling with time and not knowing his mind\u2014\"a pretty good joke, I think,\" said Richard, \"from that quarter!\"\u2014and at last it was settled that his application should be granted. His name was entered at the Horse Guards as an applicant for an ensign's commission; the purchase-money was deposited at an agent's; and Richard, in his usual characteristic way, plunged into a violent course of military study and got up at five o'clock every morning to practise the broadsword exercise.\n\nThus, vacation succeeded term, and term succeeded vacation. We sometimes heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce as being in the paper or out of the paper, or as being to be mentioned, or as being to be spoken to; and it came on, and it went off. Richard, who was now in a professor's house in London, was able to be with us less frequently than before; my guardian still maintained the same reserve; and so time passed until the commission was obtained and Richard received directions with it to join a regiment in Ireland.\n\nHe arrived post-haste with the intelligence one evening, and had a long conference with my guardian. Upwards of an hour elapsed before my guardian put his head into the room where Ada and I were sitting and said, \"Come in, my dears!\" We went in and found Richard, whom we had last seen in high spirits, leaning on the chimney-piece looking mortified and angry.\n\n\"Rick and I, Ada,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"are not quite of one mind. Come, come, Rick, put a brighter face upon it!\"\n\n\"You are very hard with me, sir,\" said Richard. \"The harder because you have been so considerate to me in all other respects and have done me kindnesses that I can never acknowledge. I never could have been set right without you, sir.\"\n\"Well, well!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"I want to set you more right yet. I want to set you more right with yourself.\"\n\n\"I hope you will excuse my saying, sir,\" returned Richard in a fiery way, but yet respectfully, \"that I think I am the best judge about myself.\"\n\n\"I hope you will excuse my saying, my dear Rick,\" observed Mr. Jarndyce with the sweetest cheerfulness and good humour, \"that it's quite natural in you to think so, but I don't think so. I must do my duty, Rick, or you could never care for me in cool blood; and I hope you will always care for me, cool and hot.\"\n\nAda had turned so pale that he made her sit down in his reading-chair and sat beside her.\n\n\"It's nothing, my dear,\" he said, \"it's nothing. Rick and I have only had a friendly difference, which we must state to you, for you are the theme. Now you are afraid of what's coming.\"\n\n\"I am not indeed, cousin John,\" replied Ada with a smile, \"if it is to come from you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear. Do you give me a minute's calm attention, without looking at Rick. And, little woman, do you likewise. My dear girl,\" putting his hand on hers as it lay on the side of the easy-chair, \"you recollect the talk we had, we four when the little woman told me of a little love affair?\"\n\n\"It is not likely that either Richard or I can ever forget your kindness that day, cousin John.\"\n\n\"I can never forget it,\" said Richard.\n\n\"And I can never forget it,\" said Ada.\n\n\"So much the easier what I have to say, and so much the easier for us to agree,\" returned my guardian, his face irradiated by the gentleness and honour of his heart. \"Ada, my bird, you should know that Rick has now chosen his profession for the last time. All that he has of certainty will be expended when he is fully equipped. He has exhausted his resources and is bound henceforward to the tree he has planted.\"\n\n\"Quite true that I have exhausted my present resources, and I am quite content to know it. But what I have of certainty, sir,\" said Richard, \"is not all I have.\"\n\n\"Rick, Rick!\" cried my guardian with a sudden terror in his manner, and in an altered voice, and putting up his hands as if he would have stopped his ears. \"For the love of God, don't found a hope or expectation on the family curse! Whatever you do on this side the grave, never give one lingering glance towards the horrible phantom that has haunted us so many years. Better to borrow, better to beg, better to die!\"\nWe were all startled by the fervour of this warning. Richard bit his lip and held his breath, and glanced at me as if he felt, and knew that I felt too, how much he needed it.\n\n\"Ada, my dear,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, recovering his cheerfulness, \"these are strong words of advice, but I live in Bleak House and have seen a sight here. Enough of that. All Richard had to start him in the race of life is ventured. I recommend to him and you, for his sake and your own, that he should depart from us with the understanding that there is no sort of contract between you. I must go further. I will be plain with you both. You were to confide freely in me, and I will confide freely in you. I ask you wholly to relinquish, for the present, any tie but your relationship.\"\n\n\"Better to say at once, sir,\" returned Richard, \"that you renounce all confidence in me and that you advise Ada to do the same.\"\n\n\"Better to say nothing of the sort, Rick, because I don't mean it.\"\n\n\"You think I have begun ill, sir,\" retorted Richard. \"I HAVE, I know.\"\n\n\"How I hoped you would begin, and how go on, I told you when we spoke of these things last,\" said Mr. Jarndyce in a cordial and encouraging manner. \"You have not made that beginning yet, but there is a time for all things, and yours is not gone by; rather, it is just now fully come. Make a clear beginning altogether. You two (very young, my dears) are cousins. As yet, you are nothing more. What more may come must come of being worked out, Rick, and no sooner.\"\n\n\"You are very hard with me, sir,\" said Richard. \"Harder than I could have supposed you would be.\"\n\n\"My dear boy,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I am harder with myself when I do anything that gives you pain. You have your remedy in your own hands. Ada, it is better for him that he should be free and that there should be no youthful engagement between you. Rick, it is better for her, much better; you owe it to her. Come! Each of you will do what is best for the other, if not what is best for yourselves.\"\n\n\"Why is it best, sir?\" returned Richard hastily. \"It was not when we opened our hearts to you. You did not say so then.\"\n\n\"I have had experience since. I don't blame you, Rick, but I have had experience since.\"\n\n\"You mean of me, sir.\"\n\n\"Well! Yes, of both of you,\" said Mr. Jarndyce kindly. \"The time is not come for your standing pledged to one another. It is not right, and I must not recognize it. Come, come, my young cousins, begin afresh! Bygones shall be bygones, and a new page turned for you to write your lives in.\"\n\nRichard gave an anxious glance at Ada but said nothing.\n\"I have avoided saying one word to either of you or to Esther,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"until now, in order that we might be open as the day, and all on equal terms. I now affectionately advise, I now most earnestly entreat, you two to part as you came here. Leave all else to time, truth, and steadfastness. If you do otherwise, you will do wrong, and you will have made me do wrong in ever bringing you together.\"\n\nA long silence succeeded.\n\n\"Cousin Richard,\" said Ada then, raising her blue eyes tenderly to his face, \"after what our cousin John has said, I think no choice is left us. Your mind may be quite at ease about me, for you will leave me here under his care and will be sure that I can have nothing to wish for\u2014quite sure if I guide myself by his advice. I\u2014I don't doubt, cousin Richard,\" said Ada, a little confused, \"that you are very fond of me, and I\u2014I don't think you will fall in love with anybody else. But I should like you to consider well about it too, as I should like you to be in all things very happy. You may trust in me, cousin Richard. I am not at all changeable; but I am not unreasonable, and should never blame you. Even cousins may be sorry to part; and in truth I am very, very sorry, Richard, though I know it's for your welfare. I shall always think of you affectionately, and often talk of you with Esther, and\u2014and perhaps you will sometimes think a little of me, cousin Richard. So now,\" said Ada, going up to him and giving him her trembling hand, \"we are only cousins again, Richard\u2014for the time perhaps\u2014and I pray for a blessing on my dear cousin, wherever he goes!\"\n\nIt was strange to me that Richard should not be able to forgive my guardian for entertaining the very same opinion of him which he himself had expressed of himself in much stronger terms to me. But it was certainly the case. I observed with great regret that from this hour he never was as free and open with Mr. Jarndyce as he had been before. He had every reason given him to be so, but he was not; and solely on his side, an estrangement began to arise between them.\n\nIn the business of preparation and equipment he soon lost himself, and even his grief at parting from Ada, who remained in Hertfordshire while he, Mr. Jarndyce, and I went up to London for a week. He remembered her by fits and starts, even with bursts of tears, and at such times would confide to me the heaviest self-reproaches. But in a few minutes he would recklessly conjure up some undefinable means by which they were both to be made rich and happy for ever, and would become as gay as possible.\n\nIt was a busy time, and I trotted about with him all day long, buying a variety of things of which he stood in need. Of the things he would have bought if he had been left to his own ways I say nothing. He was perfectly confidential with me, and often talked so sensibly and feelingly about his faults and his vigorous resolutions, and dwelt so much upon the encouragement he derived from these conversations that I could never have been tired if I had tried.\n\nThere used, in that week, to come backward and forward to our lodging to fence with Richard a person who had formerly been a cavalry soldier; he was a fine bluff-looking man, of a frank free bearing, with whom Richard had practised for some months. I heard so much about him, not only from Richard, but from my guardian too, that I was purposely in the room with my work one morning after breakfast when he came.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. George,\" said my guardian, who happened to be alone with me. \"Mr. Carstone will be here directly. Meanwhile, Miss Summerson is very happy to see you, I know. Sit down.\"\n\nHe sat down, a little disconcerted by my presence, I thought, and without looking at me, drew his heavy sunburnt hand across and across his upper lip.\n\n\"You are as punctual as the sun,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Military time, sir,\" he replied. \"Force of habit. A mere habit in me, sir. I am not at all business-like.\"\n\n\"Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Not much of a one, sir. I keep a shooting gallery, but not much of a one.\"\n\n\"And what kind of a shot and what kind of a swordsman do you make of Mr. Carstone?\" said my guardian.\n\n\"Pretty good, sir,\" he replied, folding his arms upon his broad chest and looking very large. \"If Mr. Carstone was to give his full mind to it, he would come out very good.\"\n\n\"But he don't, I suppose?\" said my guardian.\n\n\"He did at first, sir, but not afterwards. Not his full mind. Perhaps he has something else upon it\u2014some young lady, perhaps.\" His bright dark eyes glanced at me for the first time.\n\n\"He has not me upon his mind, I assure you, Mr. George,\" said I, laughing, \"though you seem to suspect me.\"\n\nHe reddened a little through his brown and made me a trooper's bow. \"No offence, I hope, miss. I am one of the roughs.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said I. \"I take it as a compliment.\"\n\nIf he had not looked at me before, he looked at me now in three or four quick successive glances. \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" he said to my guardian with a manly kind of diffidence, \"but you did me the honour to mention the young lady's name\u2014\"\n\n\"Miss Summerson.\"\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" he repeated, and looked at me again.\n\n\"Do you know the name?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, miss. To my knowledge I never heard it. I thought I had seen you somewhere.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" I returned, raising my head from my work to look at him; and there was something so genuine in his speech and manner that I was glad of the opportunity. \"I remember faces very well.\"\n\n\"So do I, miss!\" he returned, meeting my look with the fullness of his dark eyes and broad forehead. \"Humph! What set me off, now, upon that!\"\n\nHis once more reddening through his brown and being disconcerted by his efforts to remember the association brought my guardian to his relief.\n\n\"Have you many pupils, Mr. George?\"\n\n\"They vary in their number, sir. Mostly they're but a small lot to live by.\"\n\n\"And what classes of chance people come to practise at your gallery?\"\n\n\"All sorts, sir. Natives and foreigners. From gentlemen to 'prentices. I have had Frenchwomen come, before now, and show themselves dabs at pistol-shooting. Mad people out of number, of course, but THEY go everywhere where the doors stand open.\"\n\n\"People don't come with grudges and schemes of finishing their practice with live targets, I hope?\" said my guardian, smiling.\n\n\"Not much of that, sir, though that HAS happened. Mostly they come for skill\u2014or idleness. Six of one, and half-a-dozen of the other. I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. George, sitting stiffly upright and squaring an elbow on each knee, \"but I believe you're a Chancery suitor, if I have heard correct?\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say I am.\"\n\n\"I have had one of YOUR compatriots in my time, sir.\"\n\n\"A Chancery suitor?\" returned my guardian. \"How was that?\"\n\n\"Why, the man was so badgered and worried and tortured by being knocked about from post to pillar, and from pillar to post,\" said Mr. George, \"that he got out of sorts. I don't believe he had any idea of taking aim at anybody, but he was in that condition of resentment and violence that he would come and pay for fifty shots and fire away till he was red hot. One day I said to him when there was nobody by and he had been talking to me angrily about his wrongs, 'If this practice is a safety-valve, comrade, well and good; but I don't altogether like your being so bent upon it in your present state of mind; I'd rather you took to something else.' I was on my guard for a blow, he was that passionate; but he received it in very good part and left off directly. We shook hands and struck up a sort of friendship.\"\n\n\"What was that man?\" asked my guardian in a new tone of interest.\n\n\"Why, he began by being a small Shropshire farmer before they made a baited bull of him,\" said Mr. George.\n\n\"Was his name Gridley?\"\n\n\"It was, sir.\"\n\nMr. George directed another succession of quick bright glances at me as my guardian and I exchanged a word or two of surprise at the coincidence, and I therefore explained to him how we knew the name. He made me another of his soldierly bows in acknowledgment of what he called my condescension.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said as he looked at me, \"what it is that sets me off again\u2014but\u2014bosh! What's my head running against!\" He passed one of his heavy hands over his crisp dark hair as if to sweep the broken thoughts out of his mind and sat a little forward, with one arm akimbo and the other resting on his leg, looking in a brown study at the ground.\n\n\"I am sorry to learn that the same state of mind has got this Gridley into new troubles and that he is in hiding,\" said my guardian.\n\n\"So I am told, sir,\" returned Mr. George, still musing and looking on the ground. \"So I am told.\"\n\n\"You don't know where?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" returned the trooper, lifting up his eyes and coming out of his reverie. \"I can't say anything about him. He will be worn out soon, I expect. You may file a strong man's heart away for a good many years, but it will tell all of a sudden at last.\"\n\nRichard's entrance stopped the conversation. Mr. George rose, made me another of his soldierly bows, wished my guardian a good day, and strode heavily out of the room.\n\nThis was the morning of the day appointed for Richard's departure. We had no more purchases to make now; I had completed all his packing early in the afternoon; and our time was disengaged until night, when he was to go to Liverpool for Holyhead. Jarndyce and Jarndyce being again expected to come on that day, Richard proposed to me that we should go down to the court and hear what passed. As it was his last day, and he was eager to go, and I had never been there, I gave my consent and we walked down to Westminster, where the court was then sitting. We beguiled the way with arrangements concerning the letters that Richard was to write to me and the letters that I was to write to him and with a great many hopeful projects. My guardian knew where we were going and therefore was not with us.\n\nWhen we came to the court, there was the Lord Chancellor\u2014the same whom I had seen in his private room in Lincoln's Inn\u2014sitting in great state and gravity on the bench, with the mace and seals on a red table below him and an immense flat nosegay, like a little garden, which scented the whole court. Below the table, again, was a long row of solicitors, with bundles of papers on the matting at their feet; and then there were the gentlemen of the bar in wigs and gowns\u2014some awake and some asleep, and one talking, and nobody paying much attention to what he said. The Lord Chancellor leaned back in his very easy chair with his elbow on the cushioned arm and his forehead resting on his hand; some of those who were present dozed; some read the newspapers; some walked about or whispered in groups: all seemed perfectly at their ease, by no means in a hurry, very unconcerned, and extremely comfortable.\n\nTo see everything going on so smoothly and to think of the roughness of the suitors' lives and deaths; to see all that full dress and ceremony and to think of the waste, and want, and beggared misery it represented; to consider that while the sickness of hope deferred was raging in so many hearts this polite show went calmly on from day to day, and year to year, in such good order and composure; to behold the Lord Chancellor and the whole array of practitioners under him looking at one another and at the spectators as if nobody had ever heard that all over England the name in which they were assembled was a bitter jest, was held in universal horror, contempt, and indignation, was known for something so flagrant and bad that little short of a miracle could bring any good out of it to any one\u2014this was so curious and self-contradictory to me, who had no experience of it, that it was at first incredible, and I could not comprehend it. I sat where Richard put me, and tried to listen, and looked about me; but there seemed to be no reality in the whole scene except poor little Miss Flite, the madwoman, standing on a bench and nodding at it.\n\nMiss Flite soon espied us and came to where we sat. She gave me a gracious welcome to her domain and indicated, with much gratification and pride, its principal attractions. Mr. Kenge also came to speak to us and did the honours of the place in much the same way, with the bland modesty of a proprietor. It was not a very good day for a visit, he said; he would have preferred the first day of term; but it was imposing, it was imposing.\n\nWhen we had been there half an hour or so, the case in progress\u2014if I may use a phrase so ridiculous in such a connexion\u2014seemed to die out of its own vapidity, without coming, or being by anybody expected to come, to any result. The Lord Chancellor then threw down a bundle of papers from his desk to the gentlemen below him, and somebody said, \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce.\" Upon this there was a buzz, and a laugh, and a general withdrawal of the bystanders, and a bringing in of great heaps, and piles, and bags and bags full of papers.\n\nI think it came on \"for further directions\"\u2014about some bill of costs, to the best of my understanding, which was confused enough. But I counted twenty-three gentlemen in wigs who said they were \"in it,\" and none of them appeared to understand it much better than I. They chatted about it with the Lord Chancellor, and contradicted and explained among themselves, and some of them said it was this way, and some of them said it was that way, and some of them jocosely proposed to read huge volumes of affidavits, and there was more buzzing and laughing, and everybody concerned was in a state of idle entertainment, and nothing could be made of it by anybody. After an hour or so of this, and a good many speeches being begun and cut short, it was \"referred back for the present,\" as Mr. Kenge said, and the papers were bundled up again before the clerks had finished bringing them in.\n\nI glanced at Richard on the termination of these hopeless proceedings and was shocked to see the worn look of his handsome young face. \"It can't last for ever, Dame Durden. Better luck next time!\" was all he said.\n\nI had seen Mr. Guppy bringing in papers and arranging them for Mr. Kenge; and he had seen me and made me a forlorn bow, which rendered me desirous to get out of the court. Richard had given me his arm and was taking me away when Mr. Guppy came up.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Carstone,\" said he in a whisper, \"and Miss Summerson's also, but there's a lady here, a friend of mine, who knows her and wishes to have the pleasure of shaking hands.\" As he spoke, I saw before me, as if she had started into bodily shape from my remembrance, Mrs. Rachael of my godmother's house.\n\n\"How do you do, Esther?\" said she. \"Do you recollect me?\"\n\nI gave her my hand and told her yes and that she was very little altered.\n\n\"I wonder you remember those times, Esther,\" she returned with her old asperity. \"They are changed now. Well! I am glad to see you, and glad you are not too proud to know me.\" But indeed she seemed disappointed that I was not.\n\n\"Proud, Mrs. Rachael!\" I remonstrated.\n\n\"I am married, Esther,\" she returned, coldly correcting me, \"and am Mrs. Chadband. Well! I wish you good day, and I hope you'll do well.\"\n\nMr. Guppy, who had been attentive to this short dialogue, heaved a sigh in my ear and elbowed his own and Mrs. Rachael's way through the confused little crowd of people coming in and going out, which we were in the midst of and which the change in the business had brought together. Richard and I were making our way through it, and I was yet in the first chill of the late unexpected recognition when I saw, coming towards us, but not seeing us, no less a person than Mr. George. He made nothing of the people about him as he tramped on, staring over their heads into the body of the court.\n\n\"George!\" said Richard as I called his attention to him.\n\n\"You are well met, sir,\" he returned. \"And you, miss. Could you point a person out for me, I want? I don't understand these places.\"\n\nTurning as he spoke and making an easy way for us, he stopped when we were out of the press in a corner behind a great red curtain.\n\n\"There's a little cracked old woman,\" he began, \"that\u2014\"\n\nI put up my finger, for Miss Flite was close by me, having kept beside me all the time and having called the attention of several of her legal acquaintance to me (as I had overheard to my confusion) by whispering in their ears, \"Hush! Fitz Jarndyce on my left!\"\n\n\"Hem!\" said Mr. George. \"You remember, miss, that we passed some conversation on a certain man this morning? Gridley,\" in a low whisper behind his hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I.\n\n\"He is hiding at my place. I couldn't mention it. Hadn't his authority. He is on his last march, miss, and has a whim to see her. He says they can feel for one another, and she has been almost as good as a friend to him here. I came down to look for her, for when I sat by Gridley this afternoon, I seemed to hear the roll of the muffled drums.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell her?\" said I.\n\n\"Would you be so good?\" he returned with a glance of something like apprehension at Miss Flite. \"It's a providence I met you, miss; I doubt if I should have known how to get on with that lady.\" And he put one hand in his breast and stood upright in a martial attitude as I informed little Miss Flite, in her ear, of the purport of his kind errand.\n\n\"My angry friend from Shropshire! Almost as celebrated as myself!\" she exclaimed. \"Now really! My dear, I will wait upon him with the greatest pleasure.\"\n\n\"He is living concealed at Mr. George's,\" said I. \"Hush! This is Mr. George.\"\n\n\"In\u2014deed!\" returned Miss Flite. \"Very proud to have the honour! A military man, my dear. You know, a perfect general!\" she whispered to me.\n\nPoor Miss Flite deemed it necessary to be so courtly and polite, as a mark of her respect for the army, and to curtsy so very often that it was no easy matter to get her out of the court. When this was at last done, and addressing Mr. George as \"General,\" she gave him her arm, to the great entertainment of some idlers who were looking on, he was so discomposed and begged me so respectfully \"not to desert him\" that I could not make up my mind to do it, especially as Miss Flite was always tractable with me and as she too said, \"Fitz Jarndyce, my dear, you will accompany us, of course.\" As Richard seemed quite willing, and even anxious, that we should see them safely to their destination, we agreed to do so. And as Mr. George informed us that Gridley's mind had run on Mr. Jarndyce all the afternoon after hearing of their interview in the morning, I wrote a hasty note in pencil to my guardian to say where we were gone and why. Mr. George sealed it at a coffee-house, that it might lead to no discovery, and we sent it off by a ticket-porter.\n\nWe then took a hackney-coach and drove away to the neighbourhood of Leicester Square. We walked through some narrow courts, for which Mr. George apologized, and soon came to the shooting gallery, the door of which was closed. As he pulled a bell-handle which hung by a chain to the door-post, a very respectable old gentleman with grey hair, wearing spectacles, and dressed in a black spencer and gaiters and a broad-brimmed hat, and carrying a large gold-beaded cane, addressed him.\n\n\"I ask your pardon, my good friend,\" said he, \"but is this George's Shooting Gallery?\"\n\n\"It is, sir,\" returned Mr. George, glancing up at the great letters in which that inscription was painted on the whitewashed wall.\n\n\"Oh! To be sure!\" said the old gentleman, following his eyes. \"Thank you. Have you rung the bell?\"\n\n\"My name is George, sir, and I have rung the bell.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed?\" said the old gentleman. \"Your name is George? Then I am here as soon as you, you see. You came for me, no doubt?\"\n\n\"No, sir. You have the advantage of me.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed?\" said the old gentleman. \"Then it was your young man who came for me. I am a physician and was requested\u2014five minutes ago\u2014to come and visit a sick man at George's Shooting Gallery.\"\n\n\"The muffled drums,\" said Mr. George, turning to Richard and me and gravely shaking his head. \"It's quite correct, sir. Will you please to walk in.\"\n\nThe door being at that moment opened by a very singular-looking little man in a green-baize cap and apron, whose face and hands and dress were blackened all over, we passed along a dreary passage into a large building with bare brick walls where there were targets, and guns, and swords, and other things of that kind. When we had all arrived here, the physician stopped, and taking off his hat, appeared to vanish by magic and to leave another and quite a different man in his place.\n\n\"Now lookee here, George,\" said the man, turning quickly round upon him and tapping him on the breast with a large forefinger. \"You know me, and I know you. You're a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world. My name's Bucket, as you are aware, and I have got a peace-warrant against Gridley. You have kept him out of the way a long time, and you have been artful in it, and it does you credit.\"\n\nMr. George, looking hard at him, bit his lip and shook his head.\n\n\"Now, George,\" said the other, keeping close to him, \"you're a sensible man and a well-conducted man; that's what YOU are, beyond a doubt. And mind you, I don't talk to you as a common character, because you have served your country and you know that when duty calls we must obey. Consequently you're very far from wanting to give trouble. If I required assistance, you'd assist me; that's what YOU'D do. Phil Squod, don't you go a-sidling round the gallery like that\"\u2014the dirty little man was shuffling about with his shoulder against the wall, and his eyes on the intruder, in a manner that looked threatening\u2014\"because I know you and won't have it.\"\n\n\"Phil!\" said Mr. George.\n\n\"Yes, guv'ner.\"\n\n\"Be quiet.\"\n\nThe little man, with a low growl, stood still.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Mr. Bucket, \"you'll excuse anything that may appear to be disagreeable in this, for my name's Inspector Bucket of the Detective, and I have a duty to perform. George, I know where my man is because I was on the roof last night and saw him through the skylight, and you along with him. He is in there, you know,\" pointing; \"that's where HE is\u2014on a sofy. Now I must see my man, and I must tell my man to consider himself in custody; but you know me, and you know I don't want to take any uncomfortable measures. You give me your word, as from one man to another (and an old soldier, mind you, likewise), that it's honourable between us two, and I'll accommodate you to the utmost of my power.\"\n\n\"I give it,\" was the reply. \"But it wasn't handsome in you, Mr. Bucket.\"\n\n\"Gammon, George! Not handsome?\" said Mr. Bucket, tapping him on his broad breast again and shaking hands with him. \"I don't say it wasn't handsome in you to keep my man so close, do I? Be equally good-tempered to me, old boy! Old William Tell, Old Shaw, the Life Guardsman! Why, he's a model of the whole British army in himself, ladies and gentlemen. I'd give a fifty-pun' note to be such a figure of a man!\"\n\nThe affair being brought to this head, Mr. George, after a little consideration, proposed to go in first to his comrade (as he called him), taking Miss Flite with him. Mr. Bucket agreeing, they went away to the further end of the gallery, leaving us sitting and standing by a table covered with guns. Mr. Bucket took this opportunity of entering into a little light conversation, asking me if I were afraid of fire-arms, as most young ladies were; asking Richard if he were a good shot; asking Phil Squod which he considered the best of those rifles and what it might be worth first-hand, telling him in return that it was a pity he ever gave way to his temper, for he was naturally so amiable that he might have been a young woman, and making himself generally agreeable.\n\nAfter a time he followed us to the further end of the gallery, and Richard and I were going quietly away when Mr. George came after us. He said that if we had no objection to see his comrade, he would take a visit from us very kindly. The words had hardly passed his lips when the bell was rung and my guardian appeared, \"on the chance,\" he slightly observed, \"of being able to do any little thing for a poor fellow involved in the same misfortune as himself.\" We all four went back together and went into the place where Gridley was.\n\nIt was a bare room, partitioned off from the gallery with unpainted wood. As the screening was not more than eight or ten feet high and only enclosed the sides, not the top, the rafters of the high gallery roof were overhead, and the skylight through which Mr. Bucket had looked down. The sun was low\u2014near setting\u2014and its light came redly in above, without descending to the ground. Upon a plain canvas-covered sofa lay the man from Shropshire, dressed much as we had seen him last, but so changed that at first I recognized no likeness in his colourless face to what I recollected.\n\nHe had been still writing in his hiding-place, and still dwelling on his grievances, hour after hour. A table and some shelves were covered with manuscript papers and with worn pens and a medley of such tokens. Touchingly and awfully drawn together, he and the little mad woman were side by side and, as it were, alone. She sat on a chair holding his hand, and none of us went close to them.\n\nHis voice had faded, with the old expression of his face, with his strength, with his anger, with his resistance to the wrongs that had at last subdued him. The faintest shadow of an object full of form and colour is such a picture of it as he was of the man from Shropshire whom we had spoken with before.\n\nHe inclined his head to Richard and me and spoke to my guardian.\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce, it is very kind of you to come to see me. I am not long to be seen, I think. I am very glad to take your hand, sir. You are a good man, superior to injustice, and God knows I honour you.\"\n\nThey shook hands earnestly, and my guardian said some words of comfort to him.\n\n\"It may seem strange to you, sir,\" returned Gridley; \"I should not have liked to see you if this had been the first time of our meeting. But you know I made a fight for it, you know I stood up with my single hand against them all, you know I told them the truth to the last, and told them what they were, and what they had done to me; so I don't mind your seeing me, this wreck.\"\n\n\"You have been courageous with them many and many a time,\" returned my guardian.\n\n\"Sir, I have been,\" with a faint smile. \"I told you what would come of it when I ceased to be so, and see here! Look at us\u2014look at us!\" He drew the hand Miss Flite held through her arm and brought her something nearer to him.\n\n\"This ends it. Of all my old associations, of all my old pursuits and hopes, of all the living and the dead world, this one poor soul alone comes natural to me, and I am fit for. There is a tie of many suffering years between us two, and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that Chancery has not broken.\"\n\n\"Accept my blessing, Gridley,\" said Miss Flite in tears. \"Accept my blessing!\"\n\n\"I thought, boastfully, that they never could break my heart, Mr. Jarndyce. I was resolved that they should not. I did believe that I could, and would, charge them with being the mockery they were until I died of some bodily disorder. But I am worn out. How long I have been wearing out, I don't know; I seemed to break down in an hour. I hope they may never come to hear of it. I hope everybody here will lead them to believe that I died defying them, consistently and perseveringly, as I did through so many years.\"\n\nHere Mr. Bucket, who was sitting in a corner by the door, good-naturedly offered such consolation as he could administer.\n\n\"Come, come!\" he said from his corner. \"Don't go on in that way, Mr. Gridley. You are only a little low. We are all of us a little low sometimes. I am. Hold up, hold up! You'll lose your temper with the whole round of 'em, again and again; and I shall take you on a score of warrants yet, if I have luck.\"\n\nHe only shook his head.\n\n\"Don't shake your head,\" said Mr. Bucket. \"Nod it; that's what I want to see you do. Why, Lord bless your soul, what times we have had together! Haven't I seen you in the Fleet over and over again for contempt? Haven't I come into court, twenty afternoons for no other purpose than to see you pin the Chancellor like a bull-dog? Don't you remember when you first began to threaten the lawyers, and the peace was sworn against you two or three times a week? Ask the little old lady there; she has been always present. Hold up, Mr. Gridley, hold up, sir!\"\n\n\"What are you going to do about him?\" asked George in a low voice.\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" said Bucket in the same tone. Then resuming his encouragement, he pursued aloud: \"Worn out, Mr. Gridley? After dodging me for all these weeks and forcing me to climb the roof here like a tom cat and to come to see you as a doctor? That ain't like being worn out. I should think not! Now I tell you what you want. You want excitement, you know, to keep YOU up; that's what YOU want. You're used to it, and you can't do without it. I couldn't myself. Very well, then; here's this warrant got by Mr. Tulkinghorn of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and backed into half-a-dozen counties since. What do you say to coming along with me, upon this warrant, and having a good angry argument before the magistrates? It'll do you good; it'll freshen you up and get you into training for another turn at the Chancellor. Give in? Why, I am surprised to hear a man of your energy talk of giving in. You mustn't do that. You're half the fun of the fair in the Court of Chancery. George, you lend Mr. Gridley a hand, and let's see now whether he won't be better up than down.\"\n\n\"He is very weak,\" said the trooper in a low voice.\n\n\"Is he?\" returned Bucket anxiously. \"I only want to rouse him. I don't like to see an old acquaintance giving in like this. It would cheer him up more than anything if I could make him a little waxy with me. He's welcome to drop into me, right and left, if he likes. I shall never take advantage of it.\"\n\nThe roof rang with a scream from Miss Flite, which still rings in my ears.\n\n\"Oh, no, Gridley!\" she cried as he fell heavily and calmly back from before her. \"Not without my blessing. After so many years!\"\n\nThe sun was down, the light had gradually stolen from the roof, and the shadow had crept upward. But to me the shadow of that pair, one living and one dead, fell heavier on Richard's departure than the darkness of the darkest night. And through Richard's farewell words I heard it echoed: \"Of all my old associations, of all my old pursuits and hopes, of all the living and the dead world, this one poor soul alone comes natural to me, and I am fit for.

you've gone to found someone new\n'Cause I can feel his presence, girl, whenever I'm kissing you\nHow can you ask me to try, try and understand\nWell, just put yourself in my place\nGo on, see if you can\n[Chorus]\nI'm begging you no, oh don't you let him (Don't, don't you let him) (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)\nI'm begging you no, don't you let him (Don't, don't you let him)\nDon't let him, don't let him take your love from me\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo what if he whispers how much he loves you in your ear\nBut pay no mind 'cause I love you much more my dear\nMy love can move  mountains\nThat's how strong it is for you\nIf you ever walk away in to his arms\nWhich will surely break my heart in two\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm begging you no, oh don't you let him (Don't, don't you let him) Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me\nI'm begging you no, don't you let him (Don't, don't you let him)\nDon't let him, don't let him take your love from me\n\n[Bridge]\nDon't break my heart (Don't you do it)\nWoo, don't break my heart (Don't you do it)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf you leave me for him you would truly be unfair\nJust ask yourself, whenever you needed me, wasn't I always there\nNow, I'm begging you, begging you, down on bended knees\nWomen, women torn apart please stay here with me\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'm begging you no, oh don't you let him (Don't, don't

CONTEMPT OF MATRIMONY.\n\nIn consequence of my inability in cotton-picking, Epps was in the habit of hiring me out on sugar plantations during the season of cane-cutting and sugar-making. He received for my services a dollar a day, with the money supplying my place on his cotton plantation. Cutting cane was an employment that suited me, and for three successive years I held the lead row at Hawkins', leading a gang of from fifty to an hundred hands.\n\nIn a previous chapter the mode of cultivating cotton is described. This may be the proper place to speak of the manner of cultivating cane.\n\nThe ground is prepared in beds, the same as it is prepared for the reception of the cotton seed, except it is ploughed deeper. Drills are made in the same manner. Planting commences in January, and continues until April. It is necessary to plant a sugar field only once in three years. Three crops are taken before the seed or plant is exhausted.\n\nThree gangs are employed in the operation. One draws the cane from the rick, or stack, cutting the top and flags from the stalk, leaving only that part which is sound and healthy. Each joint of the cane has an eye, like the eye of a potato, which sends forth a sprout when buried in the soil. Another gang lays the cane in the drill, placing two stalks side by side in such manner that joints will occur once in four or six inches. The third gang follows with hoes, drawing earth upon the stalks, and covering them to the depth of three inches.\n\nIn four weeks, at the farthest, the sprouts appear above the ground, and from this time forward grow with great rapidity. A sugar field is hoed three times, the same as cotton, save that a greater quantity of earth is drawn to the roots. By the first of August hoeing is usually over. About the middle of September, whatever is required for seed is cut and tacked in ricks, as they are termed. In October it is ready for the mill or sugar-house, and then the general cutting begins. The blade of a cane-knife is fifteen inches long, three inches wide in the middle, and tapering towards the point and handle. The blade is thin, and in order to be at all serviceable must be kept very sharp. Every third hand takes the lead of two others, one of whom is on each side of him. The lead hand, in the first place, with a blow of his knife shears the flags from the stalk. He next cuts off the top down as far as it is green. He must be careful to sever all the green from the ripe part, inasmuch as the juice of the former sours the molasses, and renders it unsalable. Then he severs the stalk at the root, and lays it directly behind him. His right and left hand companions lay their stalks, when cut in the same manner, upon his. To every three hands there is a cart, which follows, and the stalks are thrown into it by the younger slaves, when it is drawn to the sugar-house and ground.\nIf the planter apprehends a frost, the cane is winrowed. Winrowing is the cutting the stalks at an early period and throwing them lengthwise in the water furrow in such a manner that the tops will cover the butts of the stalks. They will remain in this condition three weeks or a month without souring, and secure from frost. When the proper time arrives, they are taken up, trimmed and carted to the sugarhouse.\n\nIn the month of January the slaves enter the field again to prepare for another crop. The ground is now strewn with the tops, and flags cut from the past year's cane. On a dry day fire is set to this combustible refuse, which sweeps over the field, leaving it bare and clean, and ready for the hoes. The earth is loosened about the roots of the old stubble, and in process of time another crop springs up from the last year's seed. It is the same the year following; but the third year the seed has exhausted its strength, and the field must be ploughed and planted again. The second year the cane is sweeter and yields more than the first, and the third year more than the second.\n\nDuring the three seasons I labored on Hawkins' plantation, I was employed a considerable portion of the time in the sugar-house. He is celebrated as the producer of the finest variety of white sugar. The following is a general description of his sugar-house and the process of manufacture:\n\nThe mill is an immense brick building, standing on the shore of the bayou. Running out from the building is an open shed, at least an hundred feet in length and forty or fifty feet in width. The boiler in which the steam is generated is situated outside the main building; the machinery and engine rest on a brick pier, fifteen feet above the floor, within the body of the building. The machinery turns two great iron rollers, between two and three feet in diameter and six or eight feet in length. They are elevated above the brick pier, and roll in towards each other. An endless carrier, made of chain and wood, like leathern belts used in small mills, extends from the iron rollers out of the main building and through the entire length of the open shed. The carts in which the cane is brought from the field as fast as it is cut, are unloaded at the sides of the shed. All along the endless carrier are ranged slave children, whose business it is to place the cane upon it, when it is conveyed through the shed into the main building, where it falls between the rollers, is crushed, and drops upon another carrier that conveys it out of the main building in an opposite direction, depositing it in the top of a chimney upon a fire beneath, which consumes it. It is necessary to burn it in this manner, because otherwise it would soon fill the building, and more especially because it would soon sour and engender disease. The juice of the cane falls into a conductor underneath the iron rollers, and is carried into a reservoir. Pipes convey it from thence into five filterers, holding several hogsheads each. These filterers are filled with bone-black, a substance resembling pulverized charcoal. It is made of bones calcinated in close vessels, and is used for the purpose of decolorizing, by filtration, the cane juice before boiling. Through these five filterers it passes in succession, and then runs into a large reservoir underneath the ground floor, from whence it is carried up, by means of a steam pump, into a clarifier made of sheet iron, where it is heated by steam until it boils. From the first clarifier it is carried in pipes to a second and a third, and thence into close iron pans, through which tubes pass, filled with steam. While in a boiling state it flows through three pans in succession, and is then carried in other pipes down to the coolers on the ground floor. Coolers are wooden boxes with sieve bottoms made of the finest wire. As soon as the syrup passes into the coolers, and is met by the air, it grains, and the molasses at once escapes through the sieves into a cistern below. It is then white or loaf sugar of the finest kind\u2014clear, clean, and as white as snow. When cool, it is taken out, packed in hogsheads, and is ready for market. The molasses is then carried from the cistern into the upper story again, and by another process converted into brown sugar.\n\nThere are larger mills, and those constructed differently from the one thus imperfectly described, but none, perhaps, more celebrated than this anywhere on Bayou Boeuf. Lambert, of New-Orleans, is a partner of Hawkins. He is a man of vast wealth, holding, as I have been told, an interest in over forty different sugar plantations in Louisiana.\n\nThe only respite from constant labor the slave has through the whole year, is during the Christmas holidays. Epps allowed us three\u2014others allow four, five and six days, according to the measure of their generosity. It is the only time to which they look forward with any interest or pleasure. They are glad when night comes, not only because it brings them a few hours repose, but because it brings them one day nearer Christmas. It is hailed with equal delight by the old and the young; even Uncle Abram ceases to glorify Andrew Jackson, and Patsey forgets her many sorrows amid the general hilarity of the holidays. It \u2014is the time of feasting, and frolicking, and fiddling\u2014 the carnival season with the children of bondage. They are the only days when they are allowed a little restricted liberty, and heartily indeed do they enjoy it.\n\nIt is the custom for one planter to give a \"Christmas supper,\" inviting the shaves from neighboring plantations to join his own on the occasion; for instance, one year it is given by Epps, the next by Marshall, the next by Hawkins, and so on. Usually from three to five hundred are assembled, coming together on foot, in carts, on horseback, on mules, riding double and triple, sometimes a boy and girl, at others a girl and two boys, and at others again a boy, a girl and an old woman. Uncle Abram astride a mule, with Aunt Phebe and Patsey behind him, trotting towards a Christmas supper, would be no uncommon sight on Bayou Boeuf.\n\nThen, too, \"of all days i' the year,\" they array themselves in their best attire. The cotton coat has been washed clean, the stump of a tallow candle has been applied to the shoes, and if so fortunate as to possess a rimless or a crownless hat, it is placed jauntily on the head. They are welcomed with equal cordiality, however, if they come bare-headed and bare-footed to the feast. As a general thing, the women wear handkerchiefs tied about their heads, but if chance has thrown in their way a fiery red ribbon, or a cast-off bonnet of their mistress' grandmother, it is sure to be worn on such occasions. Red\u2014the deep blood red\u2014is decidedly the favorite color among the enslaved damsels of my acquaintance. If a red ribbon does not encircle the neck, you will be certain to find all the hair of their woolly heads tied up with red strings of one sort or another.\n\nThe table is spread in the open air, and loaded with varieties of meat and piles of vegetables. Bacon and corn meal at such times are dispensed with. Sometimes the cooking is performed in the kitchen on the plantation, at others in the shade of wide branching trees. In the latter case, a ditch is dug in the ground, and wood laid in and burned until it is filled with glowing coals, over which chickens, ducks, turkeys, pigs, and not unfrequently the entire body of a wild ox, are roasted. They are furnished also with flour, of which biscuits are made, and often with peach and other preserves, with tarts, and every manner and description of pies, except the mince, that being an article of pastry as yet unknown among them. Only the slave who has lived all the years on his scanty allowance of meal and bacon, can appreciate such suppers. White people in great numbers assemble to witness the gastronomical enjoyments.\n\nThey seat themselves at the rustic table\u2014the males on one side, the females on the other. The two between whom there may have been an exchange of tenderness, invariably manage to sit opposite; for the omnipresent Cupid disdains not to hurl his arrows into the simple hearts of slaves. Unalloyed and exulting happiness lights up the dark faces of them all. The ivory teeth, contrasting with their black complexions, exhibit two long, white streaks the whole extent of the table. All round the bountiful board a multitude of eyes roll in ecstacy. Giggling and laughter and the clattering of cutlery and crockery succeed. Cuffee's elbow hunches his neighbor's side, impelled by an involuntary impulse of delight; Nelly shakes her finger at Sambo and laughs, she knows not why, and so the fun and merriment flows on.\n\nWhen the viands have disappeared, and the hungry maws of the children of toil are satisfied, then, next in the order of amusement, is the Christmas dance. My business on these gala days always was to play on the violin. The African race is a music-loving one, proverbially; and many there were among my fellow\u2014bondsmen whose organs of tune were strikingly developed, and who could thumb the banjo with dexterity; but at the expense of appearing egotistical, I must nevertheless, declare, that I was considered the Ole Bull of Bayou Boeuf. My master often received letters, sometimes from a distance of ten miles, requesting him to send me to play at a ball or festival of the whites. He received his compensation, and usually I also returned with many picayunes jingling in my pockets\u2014the extra contributions of those to whose delight I had administered. In this manner I became more acquainted than I otherwise would, up and down the bayou. The young men and maidens of Holmesville always knew there was to be a jollification somewhere, whenever Platt Epps was seen passing through the town with his fiddle in his hand. \"Where are you going now, Platt?\" and \"What is coming off tonight, Platt?\" would be interrogatories issuing from every door and window, and many a time when there was no special hurry, yielding to pressing importunities, Platt would draw his bow, and sitting astride his mule, perhaps, discourse musically to a crowd of delighted children, gathered around him in the street.\n\nAlas! had it not been for my beloved violin, I scarcely can conceive how I could have endured the long years of bondage. It introduced me to great houses \u2014relieved me of many days' labor in the field\u2014supplied me with conveniences for my cabin\u2014with pipes and tobacco, and extra pairs of shoes, and oftentimes led me away from the presence of a hard master, to witness scenes of jollity and mirth. It was my companion\u2014the friend of my bosom triumphing loudly when I was joyful, and uttering its soft, melodious consolations when I was sad. Often, at midnight, when sleep had fled affrighted from the cabin, and my soul was disturbed and troubled with the contemplation of my fate, it would sing me a song of peace. On holy Sabbath days, when an hour or two of leisure was allowed, it would accompany me to some quiet place on the bayou bank, and, lifting up its voice, discourse kindly and pleasantly indeed. It heralded my name round the country\u2014made me friends, who, otherwise would not have noticed me\u2014 gave me an honored seat at the yearly feasts, and secured the loudest and heartiest welcome of them all at the Christmas dance. The Christmas dance! Oh, ye pleasure-seeking sons and daughters of idleness, who move with measured step, listless and snail-like, through the slow-winding cotillon, if ye wish to look upon the celerity, if not the \"poetry of motion\"\u2014 upon genuine happiness, rampant and unrestrained\u2014 go down to Louisiana, and see the slaves dancing in the starlight of a Christmas night.\n\nOn that particular Christmas I have now in my mind, a description whereof will serve as a description of the day generally, Miss Lively and Mr. Sam, the first belonging to Stewart, the latter to Roberts, started the ball. It was well known that Sam cherished an ardent passion for Lively, as also did one of Marshall's and another of Carey's boys; for Lively was lively indeed, and a heart-breaking coquette withal. It was a victory for Sam Roberts, when, rising from the repast, she gave him her hand for the first \"figure\" in preference to either of his rivals. They were somewhat crest-fallen, and, shaking their heads angrily, rather intimated they would like to pitch into Mr. Sam and hurt him badly. But not an emotion of wrath ruffled the placid bosom of Samuel as his legs flew like drum-sticks down the outside and up the middle, by the side of his bewitching partner. The whole company cheered them vociferously, and, excited with the applause, they continued \"tearing down\" after all the others had become exhausted and halted a moment to recover breath. But Sam's superhuman exertions overcame him finally, leaving Lively alone, yet whirling like a top. Thereupon one of Sam's rivals, Pete Marshall, dashed in, and, with might and main, leaped and shuffled and threw himself into every conceivable shape, as if determined to show Miss Lively and all the world that Sam Roberts was of no account.\nPete's affection, however, was greater than his discretion. Such violent exercise took the breath out of him directly, and he dropped like an empty bag Then was the time for Harry Carey to try his hand; but Lively also soon out-winded him, amidst hurrahs and shouts, fully sustaining her well-earned reputation of being the \"fastest gal\" on the bayou.\n\nOne \"set\" off, another takes its place, he or she remaining longest on the floor receiving the most uproarious commendation, and so the dancing continues until broad daylight. It does not cease with the sound of the fiddle, but in that case they set up a music peculiar to themselves. This is called \"patting,\" accompanied with one of those unmeaning songs, composed rather for its adaptation to a certain tune or measure, than for the purpose of expressing any distinct idea. The patting is performed by striking the hands on the knees, then striking the hands together, then striking the right shoulder with one hand, the left with the other\u2014all the while keeping time with the feet, and singing, perhaps, this song:Harper's creek and roarin' ribber,\nThar, my dear, we'll live forebber;\nDen we'll go to de Ingin nation,\nAll I walls in dis creation,\nIs pretty little wife and big plantation.\n\nChorus. Up dat oak and down dat ribber,\nTwo overseers and one little niggerOr, if these words are not adapted to the tune called for, it may be that \"Old Hog Eye\" is\u2014a rather solemn and startling specimen of versification, not, however, to be appreciated unless heard at the South. It runneth as follows:Who's been here since I've been gone?\nPretty little gal wid a josey on.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hog Eye!\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Old Hog Eye!\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And Hosey too!\n\nNever see de like since I was born,\nHere come a little gal wid a josey on.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hog Eye!\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Old Hog Eye!\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And Hosey too!Or, may be the following, perhaps, equally nonsensical, but full of melody, nevertheless, as it flows from the negro's mouth:Ebo Dick and Jurdan's Jo,\nThem two niggers stole my yo'.\nChorus. \u00a0 \u00a0 Hop Jim along,\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Walk Jim along,\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Talk Jim along,&c.Old black Dan, as black as tar,\nHe dam glad he was not dar.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hop Jim along,&c.\nDuring the remaining holidays succeeding Christmas, they are provided with passes, and permitted to go where they please within a limited distance, or they may remain and labor on the plantation, in which case they are paid for it. It is very rarely, however, that the latter alternative is accepted. They may be seen at these times hurrying in all directions, as happy looking mortals as can be found on the face of the earth. They are different beings from what they are in the field; the temporary relaxation, the brief deliverance from fear, and from the lash, producing an entire metamorphosis in their appearance and demeanor. In visiting, riding, renewing old friendships, or, perchance, reviving some old attachment, or pursuing whatever pleasure may suggest itself; the time is occupied. Such is \"southern life as it is\" three days in the year, as I found it\u2014 the other three hundred and sixty-two being days of weariness, and fear, and suffering, and unremitting labor.\n\nMarriage is frequently contracted during the holidays, if such an institution may be said to exist among them. The only ceremony required before entering into that \"holy estate,\" is to obtain the consent of the respective owners. It is usually encouraged by the masters of female slaves. Either party can have as many husbands or wives as the owner will permit, and either is at liberty to discard the other at pleasure. The law in relation to divorce, or to bigamy, and so forth, is not applicable to property, of course. If the wife does not belong on the same plantation with the husband, the latter is permitted to visit her on Saturday nights, if the distance is not too far. Uncle Abram's wife lived seven miles from Epps', on Bayou Huff Power. He had permission to visit her once a fortnight, but he was growing old, as has been said, and truth to say, had latterly well nigh forgotten her. Uncle Abram had no time to spare from his meditations on General Jackson\u2014connubial dalliance being well enough for the young and thoughtless, but unbecoming a grave and solemn philosopher like himself.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1172749", "artist_names": "The Cowsills", "full_title": "Silver Threads and Golden Needles by\u00a0The\u00a0Cowsills",

Westwood]\nYo, it's Tim Westwood TV, we're back up in the Crib Session and doing it real heavy for the streets\nShout out to all of the Farm, #OFB\nSJ, Bandokay, Double Lz\nAll of OFB up in the building, shout out to the Sinners, Headie One and Abz, let's go\nProject X\nGhosty\nPart 1\n\n[Verse 1: Bandokay]\nJust circled once, can't circle once so we circle back two times\nAll it takes is one gang sign for me to pop up and blow out your mind\nYou ain't moving in disguise, tell bro \"turn right\", tryna do him at traffic lights\nTwo opps in a day by surprise, no knives, so I swing my arms with my guys\nThis bad B keeps telling me lies, she reminds me of A1FromThe9\nMy aunties want to see me shine, don't want me in the 9 tryna air this bine\nTell Lerkz I'll do it any time, my family, my bro, my slime\nAnd if we got Tuggzy in ends, then I got him to 'cause that's bro from time\nBroadwater Farm, on the line with the spin ting spinning like Thorpe Park rides\nLate night glides, 4 doors or bikes, just tryna make this beat like Sykes\nOFB don't do it for the stripes, cock it, lean back, is that an opp in sight?\nShe wanna be with Bando for the night, whoosh, why's this girl so hyped?\n[Verse 2: Double Lz]\nMe and SJ in the back of the ride, we're going on a glide, tryna drive on Drive\nWell, ask 'bout me, I'm a violent guy, who's them yutes? Bro, spin that ride\nTried leave one in his headie, no lie, within one week, five opps got diced\nBut shout out Bando, that's my guy, we're bad boys, no Marcus and Mike\nLil Jojo got bored up twice, you don't wanna see Jib with his pirate knife\nOn the opp block really be searching for deals, tryna bore him like I bored up Snipes\nAnd that's no caps, no lies, 8 millimeters of Rambo knives\nIn N22 we raised the crimes, gang jump out and wave our knives\n\n[Verse 3: Bandokay]\nI'm in the 9 tryna fish, no prawn and if you don't run, get filled with corn\nT-shirts get torn, this shotgun's sawn, chop it the same size as Shawn\nLook, Bando from morning to morn', bad B back come big like Swarmz\nCivilians all beeping their horns for spinning this coupe for a brown skin jawn\nOFB's on form, Niners respawn and most of them mans been bored\nThem points get scored, Swifty got floored, Lampost got sent to the lord\nI ride out in bruck down Fords tryna crash off corn or swing my sword\nBad B come thick like Steff, in London my cats called Bando jawn\n\n[Verse 4: Double Lz]\nHold one in the head but it's nothing like unicorns\nAnd the way DV got bored up then survived, what a fucking miracle\nL\u2019z OFB, I'm a local criminal, jump out gang, Xin Zhao, get physical\nGot down shh, keep it to a minimal, bake with him, get baked with him\nMan slap at crowds, I ain't doing individuals\nHe too quick, buss lefts and rights, I remember that time on a one hour glide\nThat was me on the ride with this 6 plus 9, in the two two's on the back of the bike\nI've done fell in love with glides, I pulled a pack top, tell me if I'm lying\nMan, drop it, drop it then bang, slap, clap it then when they die\nYou might also like[Verse 5: SJ]\nGet sent south side, no Bagel, fuck a Bagel, slap corn at your Mac D's\nThese dumb little opp boys can't at me, try Gun Lean and get shot from the back seat\nTion Wayne gun leans but don't back beef, SJ, I\u2019ll buss man up, I\u2019m a bad breed\nReverse it, corn get crashy, Toyan dashed off, he's a athlete\n\n[Verse 6: Bandokay]\nWe just circled once, can't circle once so we circle back two times\nAll it takes is one gang sign for

don't like man, it's like man I got all these bad B's tryna line man\nIn a bando, me and Bando dice gang, dice back, send him back where the line back\nI dare any opp boys try man, knife man and swing mans head where these guys hang\nFeds tryna link OFB to these bootings, these opps ain't losing\nSelection of guns, mans choosing, choosing, it's a hand ting, mans choosing\nGang jump out, that's way more than a bruising\nLord forgive me and they keep it moving, add a K on the gang, little man don't lose it\n\n[Verse 9: Double Lz]\nOFB's got too much skengs\nWhen we circle round on the opp block, don't bring phones, just waps instead\nWe ain't leaving angles bent, too many back doors popped on them\nTrip up, drop, oh damn, you're stressed\nFree Bradz, free Ingz, OYY keeps taking my

that back!\n\n[HERMES, spoken]\nShe was no stranger to the wind\n\n[EURYDICE, spoken]\nIt's everything we have!\n\n[HERMES, spoken]\nBut she had not seen nothing\n\n[EURYDICE]\nOrpheus!\n\n[HERMES, spoken]\nLike the mighty storm she got caught in\n\n[EURYDICE]\n(spoken)\nOrpheus!\n(sung)\nShelter us!\n\n[HERMES, spoken]\nOnly took a minute\n\n[EURYDICE]\nHarbor me!\n\n[HERMES, spoken]\nBut the wrath of the gods was in it\n\n[PERSEPHONE]\nEvery year, it's getting worse\nHadestown, hell on Earth!\nDid you think I'd be impressed\nWith this neon necropolis?\nLover, what have you become?\nCoal cars and oil drums\nWarehouse walls and factory floors\nI don't know you anymore\nAnd in the meantime up above\nThe harvest dies and people starve\nOceans rise and overflow\nIt ain't right and it ain't natural\n\n[HADES]\nLover, everything I do\nI do it for the love of you\nIf you don't even want my love\nI'll give it to someone who does\nSomeone grateful for her fate\nSomeone who appreciates\nThe comforts of a gilded cage\nAnd doesn't try to fly away\nThe moment Mother Nature calls\nSomeone who could love these walls\nThat hold her close and keep her safe\nAnd think of them as my embrace\n\n[ORPHEUS and (COMPANY)]\nSinging la la la la la la la... (Low, keep your head, keep your head low)\n\n[EURYDICE]\nShelter us\n\n[HADES]\nThink of them as my embrace\n\n[ORPHEUS and (COMPANY)]\nLa la la la la la la...
