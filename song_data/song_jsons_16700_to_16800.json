replication of the one found on AvatarSpirit.net. This page is a tool for further exploration after the initial reading.]Act I\n\n(OPEN on a pale blue sky, panning down to reveal the tops of a vast deciduous forest. The trees are blanketed in leaves of fiery reds and oranges; there is just a hint of green left on one or two. The air is alive with the CHIRRPS and WHIRRS of insects. The pan stops on wide branch. A little yellow beetle scuttles from around the backside of the branch, toward the trunk. The bug is suddenly covered in a rapidly growing shadow as MOMO swoops in from above. Before he can catch it, the beetle's carapace opens like a ladybug\u2019s, and it flies off while he peeks under his paws to see if he got it. Discovering he hasn't, Momo leaps after it.\n\nCut to the forest from just below canopy level, looking up. The beetle flies up the tree trunk with Momo climbing in pursuit and CHITTERING. They ring the tree then descend.\n\nCut to the base of the tree. A pile of slightly lumpy red nuts sits in the foreground. The beetle enters from OC and lands on the ground. Momo lands in a pounce from the same direction, but once again the beetle flies off before he can catch it. He watches it, then notices the fruit.\n\nThe camera pulls back to reveal the neat pile of about a dozen or so apple-like nuts sitting on a pile of leaves. Other than the leaf pile, the ground is bare dirt. Momo's ears prick straight up.\n\nCut to the little clearing with the pile of fruit. Momo pounces on it from OC. Suddenly, copper-colored slats snap up from the leaves and surround him in a globe. The snare\u2019s slats run longitudinally; the \u201cpoles\u201d are parallel to the ground. The globe shifts so that the \u2018north pole' is on top and the camera pans up into the canopy as the snare and its cargo spring into the air, where two other snares hang.\nCut to a place just below canopy level. Momo's snare comes to a jerking stop at about the same level in the air as the two other snares. They are also occupied: large brown baboon-like animals BARK noisily, as they hold onto the slats like prison bars and pull on them. The momentum of the ascent leaves Momo's snare\u2014and Momo\u2014spinning.\n\nCut to another clearing in the forest. Between trees AANG, KATARA, SOKKA and APPA are visible at the far end, taking a break from travel.)\n\nAang: Where's Momo?\n\n(Momo's yowl echoes through the forest.\n\nCut to Aang standing in the foreground with Katara and Sokka sitting on the ground. They look around, trying to tell where the call came from.\n\nFade to the clearing with the snares, looking up from ground level. Aang wanders in from OC, drawn by Momo's urgent CALLS. With a sweep of his arms, He airbends to leap, climbing to Momo's height by rebounding up off close-by tree trunks.)\n\nAang: Hang on Momo!\n\n(Cut to a tree branch. It extends out of a main part of the tree. Attached to the trunk is a small winch. A rope enters the winch from lower on the trunk OC, then continues up to an eyeloop bolt attached to the underside of the branch, before hanging straight down. Aang ascends in from OC. He sits, then flips over the branch and dangles beneath it like an acrobat on a trapeze. He grabs the rope, releases a latch on the winch, and carefully feeds more line.\n\nCut to the ground, as Sokka and Katara ease the snare down to the ground between them and together pull the squeaky slats apart enough to make an exit. Momo immediately hops out and runs to the foreground to finish a handful of the nuts, his peril forgotten. Sokka and Katara release the snare, and Sokka GROANS and slaps his forehead at the lack of gratitude. Aang jumps down from above and looks up. Sokka and Katara also look up.\n\nCut to the other two snares. The Hog Monkeys in them MOAN pleadingly. The traps are suspended near each other on a different branch.)\n\nAang: All right\u2014you too.\n\n(He crouches, then springs up in a spiraling column of airbent wind that carries him up to the camera and OC. Sokka reaches behind.)\n\nSokka: This is gonna take forever.\n(Sokka throws his boomerang in one fluid move; with a WHIZ it zips up and OC.\n\nJust below the branch, the ropes come from opposite directions, but they parallel each other as they hang down from curved staples. With a WHIZ, the boomerang enters and exists the scene, cutting the both ropes in the process. The ropes fall away; There\u2019s the sound of CRASHES and panicked beast BARKS.\n\nThe camera pans slightly as Aang arrives from OC: he\u2019s hanging below the branch and hugging it as he inches over to the first staple. He pauses to look upside-down at the ground below.)\n\nAang: That works...\n\n(On the ground, the hog monkeys are loose; their cages like open clamshells. They walk on all fours to the foreground. One disappears between the framing trees, the other climbs up the tree framing the left and disappears. Sokka approaches one of the busted snares and kneels to examine it, as Aang enters by skidding down the trunk and root of a tree in the background.)\n\nSokka: These are Fire Nation traps\u2014you can tell from the metalwork. We'd better pack up camp, and get moving.\n\n(Sokka\u2019s hands pull taught the bindings on a roll of gear.\n\nCut to the clearing from over Aang's shoulder. Katara hands a gear roll up to Aang, who is sitting on Appa's head. Sokka sees this. He leaves his roll and walks over to them.)\n\nSokka: Ah-ah...no flying this time.\nKatara: What?\n\n(Aang hands the roll to Sokka, who puts it on the ground.)\n\nAang: Why wouldn't we fly?\nSokka: Think about it. Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It\u2019s because they spot Appa\u2014he's just too noticeable.\nKatara: What! Appa's not too noticeable!\nSokka: He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head\u2014it's kinda hard to miss him!\n(Appa turns his head and GROANS at Sokka. Aang is in the \u2018driver's seat' holding his reigns.)\n\nAang (gently to Appa): Sokka's just jealous \u2018cause he doesn't have an arrow.\nSokka (to Aang OC): I know you all want to fly, but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk.\nKatara: Who made you the boss?\nSokka: I'm not the boss\u2014I'm the leader.\nKatara (incredulous): You're the leader? But your voice still cracks!\nSokka: I'm the oldest and I'm a warrior. (tries to speak deeper) So...I'm the leader!\nKatara: If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean, he is the Avatar.\nSokka: Are you kidding\u2014he's just a goofy kid!\n\n(Cut to Aang, dangling from Appa's horn: upside-down by his hands with his legs sticking out into space. Appa looks rather unimpressed.)\n\nAang: He's right.\n\n(Cut to Katara and Sokka again. Sokka has his pack on his back.)\n\nKatara: Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl.\nSokka: I-I've kissed a girl\u2014you...just haven't met her.\nKatara: Who? Gran-gran? I've met Gran-gran.\nSokka: No\u2014besides Gran-gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot and a leader has to trust his instincts.\nKatara: Okay, we'll try it your way Oh Wise Leader.\n\n(Aang steps over, now wearing a backpack. Momo is sitting on the top.)\n\nAang: Who knows\u2014walking might be fun.\n\n(Cut to the forest. Between trees the group trudges along, with Sokka in front, followed by Aang/Momo, Katara and Appa)\n\nAang: Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?\nKatara: I don't know Aang. Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts\u2014they seem to know everything.\nSokka: Ha ha. Very funny.\nAang: I'm tired of carrying this pack.\nKatara: You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's Instincts!\nAang: That's a great idea! Hey, Sokka's Instincts, would you mind\u2014\nSokka: Okay, okay\u2014I get it. Look guys, I'm tired too. But the important thing is that-- (He pushes the branches from two rust red-leafed bushes and holds them, focussing his attention on Aang and Katara.) --we're safe from...the\u2014 (He finally turns around to see what's beyond the bushes.) --Fire...Nation...\n\n(Sokka, Aang Katara and Momo have just walked into a clearing with a Fire Nation encampment in it. On the opposite end of the clearing are three Pavilion tents, and an active fire pit with logs as benches on two sides. The camp is occupied.\n\nCut to the reaction of the soldiers\u2014most of them seated or crouching near the fire with bowls in hand. The surprise of others. On a couple of soldiers seated closest to the tents, which have doorflaps with the Fire Nation emblem on them. One of these soldiers has a patch over his left eye.\n\nBack to Momo and the Trio.)\n\nSokka: RUN!\n\n(As they drop their packs, The soldiers leap up from the logs, swords out. The one-eyed soldier takes a bender's stance and launches a fist-full of fire at them. The fire misses them\u2014mostly\u2014but sets the bushes behind them alight.)\n\nSokka: We're cut off! (Meanwhile, the left sleeve of his tunic is on fire.)\nAang: Sokka, your shirt!\n\n(Sokka looks, and YELLS in panic.\n\nKatara uncorks a skin container and begins to bend the contents\u2014water\u2014into a flowing ribbon. The ribbon splashes against Sokka's tunic, putting it out. Katara redirects the ribbon back into the waterskin and replaces the cap.\n\nThe trio is surrounded: the burning bushes behind them, the soldiers all around. They put their backs together and face the warriors, ready to fight if necessary.)\n\nSokka: If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.\nKatara (quietly): What are you doing?\nSokka: Bluffing?\n\n(The One-eyed Captain smiles from his lines.)\n\nCaptain: You? Promise not to hurt us?\n\n(There is a quiet ZIP and THUD. The Captain looks surprised for a moment, then groans and collapses face first on the ground. His men lower their weapons a little.)\n\nAang: Nice work, Sokka! How'd ya do that?\nSokka: Uh...instinct?\nKatara: Look!\n\n(She points to somewhere above. Blur to a figure standing on the massive branch of a nearby tree. The person drops something and draws two blades from the middle of his back.. He steps off the back of the branch, his weapons held high. Instead of falling straight down, the weapons seem to catch on the branch, allowing him to sling himself in the direction of the camp. The stranger kicks over two of the soldiers farthest from the Trio; he lands with a foot on each of their backs.\n\nHe is JET. He is a young man\u2014about Sokka's age. Except for a red vest, he's dressed from neck to toe in dark green clothing. What little armor he has (shoulder caps and hip/upper thigh covers) are mismatched. He has a shaggy mane of brown hair, and a twig held in his teeth.\n\nHe rushes forward, his shuang gou (twin hook sword) in each hand. He hooks a leg each on another pair of soldiers and sends them head over heels. With a polished body flip, he launches them through the air. They end up in a heap on top of their prone captain.\nJet lands on his feet, ready for more.)\n\nJet: Down you go.\n\n(The trio looks up from the little pile-up at him. They've gone from surprise to varying degrees of pleasure (Katara) awe (Aang) and incredulity (Sokka).\n\nA soldier rushes up from behind Jet, sword raised. The young man hooks his opponent's sword hand as he spins. Jet finishes where he started\u2014ready to face a new opponent\u2014while his opponent is sent flying. The man lands at the feet of a quartet of sword holders. The closest then looks up.)\n\nSoldier: They're in the trees!\n\n(A small boy drops from above and lands on the soldier's shoulders, then spins his helmet around, blinding him. He staggers off, his small attacker still on his shoulders and laughing all the while. Before the remaining three swordsmen can react, arrows ZIP from above, disarming each man without hurting him.\n\nBlur up to the archer sitting on a branch. He reaches for a quiver on his back and fits two arrows to the string of his bow. The archer swings backward, until he is hanging beneath the branch by his knees. He lets his arrows fly.\n\nCut to another quartet of soldiers. The foremost two have their swords knocked from their hands by the arrows, while an individual leaps from a low branch to the ground.\nAs the two disarmed soldiers run off, a swordsman charges the newcomer. This freedom fighter ducks, lets the swordsman run into (and across) his back, and tosses his opponent up onto the branch with a shrug. The second swordsman is more cautious, but with speed and strength the rebel grabs him, spins him around and throws him. The barehanded rebel turns and heads for new targets before his old one hits the ground. Meanwhile, a boy with a knife and red facepaint drops to the foreground and runs off to fight.\n\nCut to Jet, who watches over his shoulder as Katara uses her water to take on an OC foe and beside her Aang bends the air, dragging two soldiers in a dusty circle around the pair.\n\nCut to Sokka, boomerang raised in both hands, shouting a war cry. A soldier charges him, but before they meet Jet enters the scene. He uses his swords to pole vault him into the chest of the swordsman, who goes flying in the opposite direction OC. Sokka stops shouting and sags out of his battle stance.)\n\nSokka: Hey, he was mine!\nJet: Gotta be quicker next time.\n\n(Jet turns and rejoins the battle. Katara is left impressed, while a grumpy Sokka walks off.\n\nCut to two soldiers backing towards the forest, but before they can escape, a massive rebel drops to the ground. As they turn to face him, their faces register shock as he comes out of his drop crouch...and towers above them. Quickly however, they recover and take a battle stance. The grinning giant simply reaches over his shoulder and pulls out a log thicker than a man's leg. He raises it two-handed over his head, and with a growl lowers the boom.\n\nJet turns from his current opponent to watch the two swordsman backing away, their swords bent beyond use. They drop them and flee. He grins and turns to face the determined spearman. The man jabs for his throat, but he catches the spearshaft with the hooks of his swords. They struggle for a moment, before Jet spins and sidesteps the spear. With one sword free, he hooks the man, who goes flying. The soldier's spear is also sent flying. Its butt-end strikes the back of a nearby swordsman's helmet, knocking him out. The sagging soldier reveals his opponent to be Sokka, ready to receive an attack with his war club. He looks at the downed man.)\n\nSokka (frustrated): Man!\n\n(Another spearman attempts to strike at Jet from behind. Just in time Jet catches the spearpoint in the space between the grip and the crescent-shaped guard of his sword and redirects it away from his head. The soldier quickly follows the spear, pushing it free and facing the young man again with a flourish. Jet also quickly recovers his stance. Jet catches the speartip with his hooks this time and angles the spear into the ground. He runs up it, leaps, kicks off the back of the soldier's helmet and stumbles a few steps forward before stopping in front of Katara as if he'd meant to do all of it.)\n\nJet (nonchalantly): Hey.\nKatara: Hi.\n\n(Together they turn to take in the camp, now deserted by all but the newcomers.)\n\nAang (awed): You just took out a whole army almost single-handed!\nSokka: Army? Pfft. There were only, like, twenty guys!\nJet: My name is Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters. Sneers-- (The Weaponless rebel, who is eating from one of the soldier's bowls) --Longshot (The archer; he raises his paddy-hat covered head at his name) --Smellerbee (The rebel with the facepaint and knife. His knife between his teeth, a captured Fire Nation Sword slung across his back and he has one in each hand. He brandishes them when Jet names him) --The Duke and Pipsqueak. (They are standing next to each other. The Duke is the littlest rebel, the one who rode the soldier's shoulders. He raises his quarterstaff slightly at his name. Pipsqueak is the giant, who puts his log away as his name is called.)\n\n(Aang walks up to the Duke and Pipsqueak.)\n\nAang (to the Duke, chuckling): Pipsqueak\u2014that's a funny name.\n\n(The Duke sniffles, his nose is runny and his helmet hides shed tears. Pan up to the \"real\" Pipsqueak, slightly glowering. He bends down.)\n\nPipsqueak: You think my name is funny?\n\n(Aang looks a little nervous. He plasters a smile on his face.)\n\nAang: It's hilarious.\n\n(Back on Pipsqueak, who goes from glower to guffaw in a heartbeat. Aang, Pipsqueak and the Duke share the laugh together. Pipsqueak slaps Aang on the back, which unintentionally knocks the Avatar flat. The Duke stops laughing, but smiles again when Aang looks up and chuckles weakly: all among friends. FADE OUT.)\n\n\n\nAct II\n\n(FADE IN on the Fire Nation camp. The central fire is out, and members of Jet's freedom fighters are near it, checking weapons (Longshot) or investigating supply crates (Sneers). Sokka watches as Smellerbee passes him with an armful of staves.\n\nJet is reclining against the trunk of a tree on the perimeter of the camp. Katara approaches.)\n\nKatara: Um...thanks for saving us Jet. We were lucky you were there.\nJet: I should be thanking you. We were waiting to ambush those soldiers all morning\u2014we just needed the right distraction. And then you guys stumbled in.\nKatara: We were relying on instincts.\nJet: You'll get yourself killed doing that.\n\n(Sokka is close enough to hear the conversation. He closes his eyes in frustration at his bad call and walks away. Behind him, Pipsqueak and the Duke investigate the inside of a barrel next to one of the pavilion tents. The Duke reaches in and pulls away a finger coated with green goo. He sniffs it experimentally.)\n\nThe Duke: Hey Jet\u2014these barrels are filled with blasting jelly.\nJet: That's a great score.\n\n(Pipsqueak holds up a large crate.)\n\nPipsqueak: And these boxes are filled with jelly candy!\nJet: Also good. Let's not get those mixed up.\n\n(Aang and Momo watch Pipsqueak, the Duke and Sneers loading up a four-wheeled wagon.)\n\nPipsqueak: We'll take the stuff back to the hideout.\nAang: You guys have a hideout?\nJet: You wanna see it?\n\n(Katara literally slides up to him from OC. Her hands are clasped together; she's practically begging.)\n\nKatara: Yes we wanna see it!\n\n(Cut to Jet's face. His brow softens, but his self-assured smile never wavers.\n\nFade to everyone walking along the forest floor. Pipsqueak pulls the laden wagon next to Appa. The trunks are massive enough to make even Appa small. In front, Jet has stopped)\n\nJet: We're here.\nSokka: Where...there's nothing here!\nJet: Hold this.\n\n(Jet hands Sokka a rope with a loop on the end. The other end is somewhere above them.)\n\nSokka: Why...what's this do?\n\n(The loop ends up around Sokka's wrist. Without warning, he is pulled up by his arm into a nearby tree canopy. As a final insult, Sokka gets momentarily stuck in the leafy branches before he disappears.)\n\nSokka: Woah!\n\n(Jet offers a similar rope to Aang and Momo.)\n\nJet: Aang?\nAang: I'll get up on my own.\n\n(Momo launches himself from Aang's shoulder. Aang follows with an Airbender leap. Jet holds a rope and offers his free hand to Katara.)\n\nJet: Grab hold of me Katara.\n\n(She takes his hand. The colors take on a softer quality as he pulls her into a spin that ends with her against his chest. She blushes noticeably. The rope slowly pulls them into the air, the embrace Katara's only means of support. She smiles nervously then looks around and up at Jet. He focuses on their ascent: the handsome heroic rogue.\n\nCut to a plank-covered platform high in the canopy. Color is back to normal. Jet and Katara rise through a hole in the 'floor' then land on it with a jump when jet lets go of the still ascending rope. Wooden stairs spiral up the trunk and suspension bridge links their platform to elsewhere. All workmanship is of 'treehouse' quality.\n\nAang and Momo slide across the scene on a foreground rope.)\n\nAang: Nice place you got!\n\n(As Jet and Katara walk towards the bridge, the shot pans to reveal several nearby trees have the same platforms, stairs and bridges. Several platforms have tent-like huts.\n\nCut to Jet and Katara surveying the parts of the tree village below them.)\n\nKatara: It's beautiful up here!\nJet: It's beautiful...and more importantly the Fire Nation can't find us.\n\n(Smellerbee releases his rope and lands near them.)\n\nSmellerbee: They would love to find you. Wouldn't they, Jet?\nJet: It's not gonna happen, Smellerbee.\n\n(A couple of sentries watch from above as Momo and Aang zipline by again. The others are walking along a bridge.)\n\nKatara: Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?\nJet: I guess you could say I've been causing them a little trouble. See, they took over a nearby Earth Kingdom town a few years back.\n\n(cut to Jet and Katara leading the group. Pipsqueak is right behind.)\n\nPipsqueak: We've been ambushin' their troops, cutting off their supply lines, and doing anything we can to mess with \u2018em.\n\n(Sokka is doing his level best to see over Pipsqueak\u2014he keeps hopping to get a peek over the giant's shoulders.)\n\nJet: One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation out of here for good and free that town.\nKatara: That's so brave.\n\n(Sokka comes up from behind\u2014he's somehow made it past Pipsqueak.)\n\nSokka (Sarcastically): Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a treehouse.\nKatara: Don't pay any attention to my brother.\nJet: No problem. He probably had a rough day.\nKatara: So, you all live here?\n\n(Sokka, ignored, sinks back behind them.)\n\nJet: That's right. Longshot over there? (cut to Longshot and the Duke walking silently. Longshot's head is slightly bowed) His town got burned down by the fire Nation. And we found the Duke trying to steal our food. I don't think he ever really had a home.\nKatara: What about you?\n\n(Jet stops. The group, except for Katara moves on.)\n\nJet: Fire Nation killed my parents. I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever.\nKatara: Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.\nJet: I'm so sorry, Katara.\n\n(Fade from the two of them alone on the suspension bridge, looking out, to the blue sky above the canopy. A cloud of cawing birds is disturbed as Appa raises his head through the dense leafy branches with a grumble.\n\nIn the hideout below, Ropes with Glowing lanterns hang between branches. Sentries keep watch on several upper platforms while the group sits at a banquet table on a huge platform.\n\nWhile the group eating and drinking. Jet stands and climbs onto the table.)\n\nJet: Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine.\n\n(His followers at the table and on upper platforms cheer. Katara and Aang watch with smiles, Sokka looks grumpy.)\n\nJet: I got a special joy from the look on one soldier's face, when the Duke dropped down on his helmet and rode him like a wild hog monkey.\n\n(The helmet-less Duke is sitting on the platform between Longshot and Smellerbee. He stands, joins Jet on the table and amid cheers takes a victory walk around a fish platter.)\n\nJet: Now, the Fire Nation thinks they don't have to worry about a couple of kids hiding in the trees. (He prepares to take a drink from his wooden cup) Maybe they're right.\n\n(His followers BOO at that.)\n\nJet: Or maybe...they are dead wrong.\n\n(His face is bathed in an angry red from the lanterns. His followers CHEER wildly. He leaves the table and sits on the platform between Sokka and Katara)\n\nKatara: Hey Jet, nice speech.\nJet: Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and Aang. That was some great bending I saw out there today.\nKatara: Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. I could use some more training. (She blushes.)\nJet: Avatar huh? Very nice.\nAang: Thanks Jet.\nJet: So I might know a way that you and Aang can help in our struggle.\nSokka: Unfortunately we have to leave tonight. (He stands and walks away.)\nJet: Sokka, you're kidding me! I needed you on an important mission tomorrow.\n\n(Sokka stops, and turns.)\n\nSokka: What mission?\n\n(Fade to the top of the forest the next day. Jet and Sokka are perched in branches on the same tree. Jet cups his hands and makes a whistle like a birdcall; several trees down Pipsqueak and Smellerbee step into view from their branches. There is a reply call.\n\nSokka rams his jawbone knife into the trunk of the tree.)\n\nJet: What are you doing?\nSokka: Shh...it amplifies vibrations.\nJet (impressed): Good trick.\n\n(Sokka cups his hands around the pommel \u2018bone' and puts his ear to it.)\n\nSokka: Nothing yet. (Lowers his voice) Wait! Yes, someone's approaching.\nJet (low voice): How many?\nSokka: I think there's just one.\n\n(Jet whistles again.)\n\nJet: Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon.\n\n(Sokka pulls the knife out of the tree and waits. His eyes go wide when the 'someone' comes into view: a stooped OLD MAN with a cane. He wears a simple red robe.)\n\nSokka (Low): Wait! False alarm...he's just an old man.\n\n(Jet stands and extends his hook swords anyway, then leaps to the ground in front of the traveler. Sokka watches with horror.)\n\nJet: What are you doing in our woods, you leech.\nOld Man: Please sir, I'm just a traveler.\n\n(Jet takes a step, and with one swipe of his sword sends the man's can flying from his hand. The old man backs away, but when he tries to flee the way he came, he runs face first into Pipsqueak's chest. The force of the impact knocks him to the ground; the giant looms over him. He tries to crawl away, but Pipsqueak's foot on his backside effectively pins him.)\n\nJet: Do you like destroying towns? Do you like destroying families? Do you?!\nOld Man (frightened): Oh...please let me go...have mercy...\nJet: Does the Fire Nation let people go?! Does the Fire Nation have mercy?!\n\n(Jet winds up a kick, but his foot is snagged by Sokka's club before it can be delivered. Sokka releases him)\n\nSokka: Jet, he's just an old man!\nJet: He's Fire Nation! Search him!\n\n(Pipsqueak holds the prisoner and Smellerbee steps up)\n\nSokka: But he's not hurting anyone!\nJet: Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight!\nSmellerbee: We've got his stuff, Jet. (He holds up a shoulder satchel the old man was carrying. The old man is back on the ground.)\nSokka: This doesn't feel right.\nJet: It's what has to be done\u2014now let's get outta here.\n\n(Jet pushes past Sokka. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee follow. Sokka looks at the old man still on his hands and knees.)\n\nJet: Come on Sokka!\n\n(Sokka slowly turns then runs after the others.\n\nAt the hideout, Aang and Momo are playing with the ziplines again. He leaps to a platform.)\n\nAang: Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me!\n\n(Aang is wearing a satchel\u2014not the old man's\u2014and pulls a small pellet from it. With a sly grin, he tosses it at the platform next to Momo, where it explodes with a pop. Momo puffs up like a startled cat. He GROWLS, then lunges for the satchel. Momo then sits on Aang's shoulder and tosses pellets at his feet. Aang dances about wildly.)\n\nAang: Ow! Quit it!\n\n(Sokka is oblivious of it all. He's sitting with his back to the trunk and staring at the platform before him, frowning. Katara walks up.)\n\nKatara: Hey Sokka. Is Jet back?\nSokka: Yeah\u2014he's back. But we're leaving.\nAang: What?\nKatara: But I made him this hat.\n\n(She pulls from behind her back a cap made out of stitched leaves with a flower on top. The workmanship is unimpressive.)\n\nSokka: Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.\nKatara: What? No, he's not.\nSokka: He's messed up Katara.\nAang: He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life\u2014a really fun way of life.\nSokka: He beat and robbed a harmless old man!\nKatara: I wanna hear Jet's side of the story.\n\n(Cut to Jet.)\n\nJet: Sokka\u2014you told them what happened but you didn't mention that the guy was Fire Nation?\n\n(Jet and the trio are in a lantern-lit hut: at least one wall is made of wood. Jet is sitting on a hammock-bed, the others stand. Sokka stands grumpily as far away as he can get. Aang is wearing the hat Katara made; he looks like an acorn)\n\nKatara: No, he conveniently left that part out.\nSokka: Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian\nJet: He was an assassin, Sokka.\n\n(Jet pulls out a knife and thrusts it into a nearby block of wood. It is a sinister looking curved blade. There are four spikes evenly spaced along the grip, with enough space for fingers to go between them. There is a ring on the butt of the knife.)\n\nJet: See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife. (He pulls on the ring and removes a small glass tube filled with red liquid). He was sent to eliminate me\u2014you helped save my life, Sokka.\nKatara: I knew there was an explanation\nSokka: I didn't see any knife!\nJet: That's because he was concealing it.\nKatara: See Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife.\nSokka: There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things. (He leaves.)\nJet: Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet. I really need your help.\nAang: What can we do?\nJet: The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest. If you both use water bending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires. But if you leave now, they'll destroy the whole valley.\n\n(Aang and Katara look at each other. Fade to them entering their hut. Sokka is tying up a roll on the floor.)\n\nKatara: We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest!\nSokka: I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him.\nKatara: You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader!\nSokka: Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct\u2014\nKatara: Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet. Come on Aang.\nAang: Sorry Sokka.\n\n(They leave the hut. Fade to the night sky above the canopy. A full moon shines on Appa, who is on his back and snoring up a storm as he sleeps.\n\nInside the Trio's hut, Sokka sleeps propped up against his still-packed gear while the others sleep in their bedrolls.)\n\nJet: Let's go.\n\n(Sokka stirs then snaps awake. He pulls the door flap aside enough to see some of Jet's followers descending on the rope lines. He leaves the hut, and takes a rope line down to a lower branch. On the ground below him, Jet's freedom fighters are quietly pushing the loaded wagon as Jet leads them out of the camp. Sokka stealthily follows.\n\nIn the dark valley, the walled town sits on the far side of a river that cuts through the forest. Upstream, and up toward the wall of the valley there is an old falls, and beyond that a man-made dam. A bare cliff off to the reservoir's left provides the view.\n\nJet and his boys emerge form the forest. He goes to the edge and looks down on the dam below. The reservoir behind it is low. He turns back to the wagon.)\n\nJet: Now listen\u2014you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal. If the reservoir isn't full, the Fire Nation troops could survive.\n\n(The Duke jumps off the wagon.)\n\nDuke: But what about the people in the town\u2014won't they get wiped out too?\n\n(Jet places a hand on the Duke's shoulder.)\n\nJet: Look Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation. (to Longshot): Now don't blow the dam until I give the signal\u2014got it?\n\n(Longshot nods. Sokka watches incredulously from the bushes. He frowns, and hears rustling just before Pipsqueak drags him out by his topknot. Smellerbee's knife is instantly at his throat.)\n\nSmellerbee (sneering): Where do you think you're going, ponytail?\n\n(FADE OUT.)\n\n\n\nAct III\n\n(FADE IN on Jet, standing near the edge of the cliff. As he watches, Pipsqueak and Smellerbee drag Sokka between them. Pipsqueak still has a handful of Sokka's topknot.)\n\nJet: Sokka. I'm glad you decided to join us.\n\n(His captors send Sokka to his knees. He rubs his shoulder.)\n\nSokka: I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.\nJet: Our plan is to rid the valley of the Fire Nation.\nSokka: There are people living there Jet\u2014mothers and fathers and children.\nJet: We can't win without making some sacrifices.\n\n(Sokka points an accusing finger at Jet.)\n\nSokka: You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!\nJet: Because they don't understand the demands of war. Not like you and I do.\nSokka: I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want.\nJet: I was hoping you'd have an open mind, but I can see you've made your choice.\n\n(Pipsqueak and Smellerbee grab for Sokka. Before he can even react, Jet has his wrist pinned with the hooks of his shuang gou. Sokka's other hand is forced behind his back.\n\nJet: I can't let you warn Katara and Aang. (Jet releases Sokka's hand; it is immediately forced behind his back.) Take him for a walk--a long walk.\nSokka: You can't do this!\nJet: Cheer up, Sokka. We're gonna win a great victory against the Fire Nation today.\n\n(Fade to the riverside upriver from the dam. The collected water behind it is much less than the larger cavity of the reservoir. The river leading to down to it is a thread compared to its \u2018rainy season' gully. Jet, Katara and Aang are seen walking upriver along its west bank.)\n\nKatara: Jet\u2014I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting.\nJet: No worries\u2014he already apologized.\nAang: Really? (Aang and Katara stop and look at one another.) Sokka apologized?\nJet: Yeah\u2014I was surprised too. I got the sense that maybe you talked to him or something.\nKatara: Yeah, I did.\nJet: I guess something you said got through to him. Anyhow, he went out on a scouting mission with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.\nKatara: I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes.\n\n(They are now walking in the gully, beside the \u2018river'. Aang pauses after noticing something strange, then is launched into the air by a blast from the geyser he was standing on.)\n\nJet: All right, we're here. Underground water's trying to escape through these vents. I need you guys to help it along.\nKatara: ...I've never used bending on water I can't see. I don't know...\n\n(Jet stands behind her and places his hands on her shoulders.)\n\nJet: Katara. You can do this.\nAang (back on the ground): What about me?\nJet: I know the Avatar can do this.\n\n(Aang and Katara stand on either side of one of the many smoking holes in the gully. While Jet looks on, they perform bending gestures: they look like they are encouraging something up. After a few minutes, a bloby stream of water emerges from the hole. They pull it to their height, then send it toward the river where it continues to flow like a giant garden hose. The water quickly joins the river.)\n\nJet: Yes! Good job! This river empties into the reservoir--a few more geysers and it'll be full.\nAang: Look, there's another steam vent.\n\n(Aang and Katara walk off in its direction.)\n\nJet: Okay. You two keep it up\u2014I'll go check on things at the reservoir. (He turns and walks away.)\nKatara: When we're done we'll meet you over there.\nJet: Actually...probably better if you meet me back at the hideout when you're done.\n\n(Jet resumes walking away Aang and Katara bend the next geyser into another fountain.)\n\nAang: ...I bet that's enough\u2014and I'm not just saying that to be lazy.\n\n(Around them, a half dozen fountains flow into the river.)\n\nKatara: Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir.\nAang: I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout.\nKatara: Well, we finished early--I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.\n\n(Fade from Katara to a path in the forest. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee follow Sokka, who has his hands tied behind his back. Smellerbee gives his prisoner a shove; Sokka stumbles but remains on his feet.)\n\nSmellerbee: Come on\u2014move along!\nSokka: How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town?\nPipsqueak: Hey listen Sokka, Jet's a great leader. We follow what he says, and things always turn out okay.\n\n(Sokka notices a couple of snare leaf-piles nearby. They identical to the one that enticed Momo, right down to the pile of nuts.)\n\nSokka: If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn.\n\n(Sokka sprints off in the direction of the snares. Smellerbee makes a grab for him, but misses.)\n\nSmellerbee: Hey!\n\n(They give chase. Sokka leaps over the leaf piles. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee don't, and end up snared and hanging many feet up in the air.)\n\nSokka: While you two are up there you might want to practice your knot-work. (He holds up his now-worthless bindings, then turns and walks away.)\nPipsqueak: Hey Smellerbee\u2014you gonna eat your leechee nuts? (A nut strikes him in the head and lands in the pile he's holding.) Ooh. (He picks one up and licks his lips.)\n\n(Katara and Aang are standing on the edge of the cliff. At the base of the dam, four of Jet's people are unloading barrels from the wagon and arranging them.)\n\nKatara: ...What are they doing?\nAang: Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation.\nKatara: Why would they need blasting jelly?\n\n(Zoom on Aang, as he gets it.)\n\nAang: Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam.\nKatara: What? No--that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that.\n\n(Aang snaps his glider wings open.)\n\nAang: I've gotta stop him. (He runs for the edge.)\nKatara (less convinced): Jet wouldn't do that.\n\n(Before Aang can reach the edge, Jet crosses his path from behind and snatches the glider. Aang is left wobbling precariously on the edge, and uses an airbending move to get himself back on stable footing.)\n\nJet: Yes I would.\nKatara: Jet\u2014why?\nJet: Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think. Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother\u2014we can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again.\nKatara: This isn't the answer!\nJet: I want you to understand me Katara. I thought your brother would understand, but\u2014\nKatara: Where's Sokka?\n\n(Tears fall from her eyes. Jet reaches out and touches her face.)\n\nJet: Katara.\n\n(She bows her head, then with a SHOUT sends Jet flying with the water from her waterskin. She draws it back into the skin when she's done.)\n\nAang: I need to get to the dam.\n\n(Aang's closed glider is on the ground. As he reaches for it, the crescent end of one of Jet's shuang gou pins it like an axe. Jet has the two weapons hook to hook; with a yank he pulls the sword and Aang's glider to him.)\n\nJet: You're not going anywhere without your glider.\n\n(Jet swings the swords\u2014still hook to hook\u2014at Aang. Aang summersaults backwards to avoid the extra reach. Aang finishes his retreat in a nearby tree.)\n\nAang: I'm not gonna fight you, Jet.\nJet: You'll have to if you want your glider back.\n\n(Aang retreats back into the forest, as Jet hooks the branch and pulls himself up. Katara follows on the ground. Jet attacks; Aang defends himself with balls of air, which Jet ducks. Jet attacks head on, but Aang blocks with his arms and sends his opponent flying into a tree trunk with an air kick. Jet combines his swords again and advances. Aang avoids the flail-like move and sends another air blast. Jet stoops down and lets the air flow over and past him, then lunges.\n\nThey continue the chase through the many levels of the forest. Jet catches up to Aang and sends them both freefalling, attacking as they go. They both end up on a branch. Jet continues his attack. Aang avoids it all. Jet charges again, but Aang hits him with a jetstream of air. Jet falls. He recovers, but looses the glider in the process. Before Aang can get to the ground Jet kicks him into a trunk. He lands with a thud next to his glider.\n\nA small tributary flows past him. Aang is slow to get up. Before Jet can take more than a step however, he his hit by a large water strike. Katara is there; she uses water from the river to throw Jet against the trunk of the tree. Over and over she attacks; Jet is unable to cut the water and its force plasters him against the trunk. She bends the water to ice; the soggy renegade is left frozen from toe to neck.)\n\nKatara: Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me\u2014you're sick and I trusted you!\n\n(A signal call is heard. Katara and Aang are startled, then look to the valley beyond\u2014where it's coming from. Jet gives an answer call.)\n\nKatara: What are you doing?\nJet: You're too late.\nKatara (horrified): No!\n\n(Aang snaps open his glider and runs for the nearby cliff/waterfall. His glider's wing is so shredded however, that he has no lift and slams back into the ground near the edge. Katara runs over to help him.)\n\nAang: Sokka's still out there\u2014he's our only chance.\nKatara: Come on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Please.\n\n(Cut to a tree. Longshot stands on a branch, his bow pulled. He has a fire arrow on the string He sights, then lets it fly.\n\nIt arcs down to the base of the dam.\n\nKatara watches.)\n\nKatara (whisper): No...\n\n(The center of the dam explodes in a cloud of smoke and fire. Katara and Aang watch a massive wall of water go over the \u2018dry' falls and down to the town.\n\nInside the town the streets are empty except for the occasional barrel and a market table with cabbages. The water rushes through the open gate, as a cresting wave dwarfs it. The wall and gate are swallowed as the wave strikes the town.\n\nThe flotsam carried away includes a smiling doll in a purple dress.)\n\nAang: Sokka didn't make it in time.\nKatara: All those people...(She turns in rage back to Jet.) Jet\u2014you monster!\nJet: This was a victory, Katara. Remember that. The Fire Nation is gone and this valley will be safe.\nSokka: It will be safe\u2014without you.\n\n(In shock, Jet looks up to see Sokka, Appa and Momo rise from below the level of the cliff. Sokka has Appa's reins.)\n\nKatara: Sokka!\nSokka: I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time.\nJet: What!\nSokka: At first they didn't believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy. But one man vouched for me\u2014the old man you attacked. He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time.\n\n(What Sokka describes is seen in monochrome pictures.\n\nThe townsfolk are seen on high ground above the river, on the bank opposite the town. A LITTLE GIRL runs down to the water's edge as the doll floats by. She retrieves it.)\n\nLittle Girl (Happily): Missus Pretty! (She hugs her doll.)\nJet: Sokka, you fool! We could've freed this valley!\nSokka: Who would be free\u2014everyone would be dead.\nJet: You traitor!\nSokka: No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people.\nJet: Katara. Please\u2014help me.\nKatara: Goodbye Jet.\n\n(Sokka gives Appa's reigns a flick.)\n\nSokka: Yip yip.\n\n(Jet is left behind on the ground, still frozen to the tree.\n\nThe sky they fly in is empty, save a few wispy clouds.)\n\nAang: We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town instead?\nKatara: Lemme guess\u2014your instincts told you.\nSokka: Hey\u2014sometimes they're right.\nAang: Um...Sokka? You know we're going the wrong way, right?\n\n(Sokka is surprised, but quickly recovers.)\n\nSokka: ...And sometimes they're wrong. (With a grin, he pulls Appa's reigns. They fly off screen, then reappear going in the opposite direction. FADE OUT.)\n\n\n\n[End Credits]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1372003", "artist_names": "Sammy Hagar", "full_title": "Never Give Up by\u00a0Sammy\u00a0Hagar",

Run Lyrics[Verse 1]\nNight ain't a friend\nIt's black and so still\nIt waits like a cat\nThen moves in for the kill\nIt casts its shadows high on the wall\nIt's giving me no peace at all\nNow you're gone\nThe pain goes on\nYou're so deep into me\nNow I'm begging you to\nSet me free\n[Chorus]\nI've got nowhere to run\nNowhere to hide\nNo way to stop\nThis hurt deep inside\nThat you gave to me\nNowhere to run\nI've got nowhere to run\nNowhere to hide\nNo way to stop\nThis hurt deep inside\nThat you gave to me\nNowhere to run\nI've got nowhere to run\nNowhere to hide\nNo way to stop\nThis hurt deep inside\nThat you gave to me\nNowhere to run\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe sound of your voice\nIt comes in the night\nIt stays with me there\nUntil the light\nWhen you say the words\nThat you said before\nWhen you said you'd stay\nYou walked out the door\nI can take the afternoon\nBut then comes the night\nInstead I walk the floor\nTill the light\nSee Santana LiveGet tickets as low as $136You might also like[Chorus]\nI've got nowhere to run\nNowhere to hide\nNo way to stop\nThis hurt deep inside\nThat you gave to me\nNowhere to run\nI've got nowhere to run\nNowhere to hide\nNo way to

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me\nThe sound so ominously tearing through the silence\nI cannot move, I'm standing\nNumb and frozen\nAmong the things I love so dearly\nThe books, the paintings and the furniture\nHelp me\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob\nNone of my friends would be so stupidly impatient\nAnd they don't dare to come here\nAnymore now\nBut how I loved our secret meetings\nWe talked and talked in quiet voices\nSmiling\n[Chorus]\nNow I hear them moving\nMuffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm\nCracking up\nVoices growing louder, irritation building\nAnd I'm close to fainting\nCracking up\nThey must know by now I'm in here trembling\nIn a terror ever-growing\nCracking up\nMy whole world is falling, going crazy\nThere is no escaping now, I'm\nCracking up\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThese walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation\nAnd seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces\nAnd now they've come to take me\nCome to break me\nAnd yet it isn't unexpected\nI have been waiting for these visitors\nHelp me\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I hear them moving\nMuffled noises coming, through the door I feel I'm\nCracking up\nVoices growing louder, irritation building\nAnd I'm close to fainting\nCracking up\nThey must know by now I'm in here trembling\nIn a terror ever-growing\nCracking up\nMy whole world is falling, going crazy\nThere is no escaping now, I'm\nCracking up\nYou might also like[Interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I hear them moving\nMuffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm\nCracking up\nVoices growing louder, irritation building\nAnd I'm close to fainting\nCracking up\n(I have been waiting for these visitors)\nThey must know by now I'm in here trembling\nIn a terror ever-growing\nCracking up\n(I have been waiting for these visitors)\nMy whole world is falling, going crazy\nThere is no escaping now, I'm\nCracking up\n(I have been waiting for these visitors)\nNow I hear them moving\nMuffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm\nCracking up\n(I have been waiting for these visitors)\nVoices growing louder, irritation

miss\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd on the days that followed\nI listened to his words\nI strained to understand him\nI chased his thoughts like birds\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou will see light in the darkness\nYou will make some sense of this\nWhen you've made your secret journey\nYou will find this love you miss\n\n[Chorus 2]\nYou will see light in the darkness\nYou will make some sense of this\nYou will see a joy

BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--DAY\n\nAn ESTABLISHING SHOT of Brodie's store in the heart of Red\nBank.\n\nBRODIE (O.S.)\nNo fucking way!\n\nWE GO TIGHT on the huge, cartoon sign of BRODIE outside to--\n\nINT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--LATER\n\nBRODIE himself, holding a stack of comics in one hand and a\nDixie cup in the other, Jay and Silent Bob follow him as he\nputs new books in the racks.\n\nBRODIE\nDante and Randal slapped you with a\nrestraining order?!\n\nJAY\nJudge said if we go within a hundred\nfeet of the stores, we get thrown\ninto County.\n\nBRODIE\nSo you gonna abide by the court's\nruling or you gonna go Bandit--\nReynolds style?\n\nJAY\nFuck yeah! You know what they make\nyou do in county? Toss the fucking\nsalad! I don't like this fuck's\nasshole; I'm gonna do it for some\nstranger?\n\nBRODIE\nI guess if you really wanted to hang\nout in from of a convenience store,\nyou could just buy your own now--\nwhat with all that money you guys\nmade.\n\nJAY\nHell yeah, bitch.\n(beat)\nWait a second--what money?\n\nBRODIE\nThe money from the movie, dumb-ass.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck are you babbling about?\n\nBRODIE\n(pulling a bagged-and-\nboarded issue down\nfrom the wall)\nThe Bluntman and Chronic movie.\n(dawns on him)\nOh my God--don't tell me you have no\nidea there's a movie being made of\nthe comic you two were the basis\nfor.\n\nJAY\nWhat?! Since when?\n\nBRODIE\nGoddamit, man--\n(taps his wrist)\nHere's the pulse, alright. And here's\nyour finger--\n(shoves his hand down\nthe back of his pants)\n--far from the pulse, jammed straight\nup your ass.\n(extracts hand and\nextends it to Jay)\nSay--would you like a chocolate\ncovered pretzel?\n\nBrodie leads them back to the counter.\n\nBRODIE\nYou see, kids, if you read Wizard,\nyou'd know it's the top story this\nmonth.  Check it out.\n\nBrodie hands Jay and Silent Bob a copy of Wizard, opened to\nthe headline: Snootchie Bootchies! Bluntman and Chronic Get\nBig Screen Treatment!  There are pictures of HOLDEN MCNEIL\nAND BANKY EDWARDS, as well as drawings of Bluntman and\nChronic.\n\nJAY\nWhen the fuck did this happen?!\n\nBRODIE\nWell, after X-Men hit at the box\noffice, all the studios started buying\nup every comic property they could\nget their hands on. Miramax optioned\nBluntman and Chronic.\n\nJAY\nMiramax? I thought they only made\nclassy flicks like The Piano and The\nCrying Game?\n\nBRODIE\nYeah, well once they made She's All\nThat, everything went to hell. So\nyou're saying you haven't gotten a\ncut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil\nand Banky Edwards used to pay you\nlikeness rights for the comic book?\n\nJAY\nWe haven't seen a fucking dime for\nno movie!\n\nBRODIE\nWell boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think\nHolden and Banky owe you some of the\nproverbial phat cash. I mean they're\nmaking a movie based on characters\nthat are based on you and Quiet\nRobert.\n\nJAY\nIt ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a\npair of stupid-ass superheroes that\nrun around saying \"Snitchy-Nitchies\"\nor something.\n\nBRODIE\nI believe it \"Snootchie Boochies.\"\nRegardless--you're getting screwed.\nIf I was you guys, I'd confront Holden\nMcNeil and ask him for my movie check.\n\nJAY\nShit yeah. We gotsa get paid.\n\nBRODIE\nAnd on that note, we cue the music.\n\nJay lays down a House bass beat. Brodie complements it with\nhis own beat.\n\nEXT. POTZER'S INC--DAY\n\nJay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building\nand knock.\n\nINT. POTZER'S INC--DAY\n\nHolden McNeil, opens the door and smiles.\n\nHOLDEN\nWell! I have been waiting years to\ndo this.\n(smiles)\nLook at these morose motherfuckers\nright here. Smells like someone shit\nin their cereal. Bunngg!\n\nJay and Silent Bob enter. Holden closes the door, following\nthem.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck took you so long\nanswering your damn door? You trying\nto talk another girlfriend of yours\ninto some of that gay-ass three-way\naction with your buddy?\n\nHOLDEN\nNo, I was just showering your mother's\nstink off me after I gave her a quick\njump and sent her home. But now that\nyou mention it--\n(to Bob)\nThanks, you know. You could've made\nthe moral of that story you told me\na bit more clear.\n\nSilent Bob shrugs.\n\nHOLDEN\nSo what brings you two dirt merchants\nto my neck of the woods?\n\nJAY\nOh, I'll tell you what our necks are\ndoing in your woods--\n\nSilent Bob holds up the Wizard article.\n\nJAY\nWhere's our motherfucking movie check?\n\nHOLDEN\nYou heard about that too, Hunh? Well,\nI've got nothing to do with it. That's\nBanky's deal. He owns the property\nnow. I signed my half of the Bluntman\nand Chronic right over to him years\nago.\n\nJAY\nWhy the fuck would you do a thing\nlike that?\n\nHOLDEN\nBecause I'm almost thirty, for God's\nsake--why on earth would I want to\nkeep writing about characters whose\ncentral preoccupations are weed and\ndick and fart jokes? You gotta grow,\nman. Don't you ever want more for\nyourself?\n(off Silent Bob)\nI know this poor, hapless sonovabitch\ndoes. I look in his doe eyes and I\nsee a man crying out, \"When, Lord?\nWhen the fuck can your servant ditch\nthis foul-mouthed little chucklehead\nto whom I am a constant victim of\nhis folly, and who bombards me and\nthose around us with grade-A\nfoolishness that prevents me from\neven getting to kiss a girl? Fuck!\nWhen?!\n\nSilent Bob nod like he's finally understood. Jay looks at\nhim, hurt, and Bob tried to downplay the comment's truth.\n\nJAY\nI'm the chucklehead? Fuck you--you're\nthe dumb-ass who gave away his comic,\nand now you ain't got no fat movie\ncheck neither.\n\nHOLDEN\nWhen you're right, you're right. I\nwish I'd broken off a little piece\nfor myself. Because if the buzz is\nany indication, the movie's gonna\nmake some huge bank.\n\nJAY\nWhat buzz?\n\nHOLDEN\nThe Internet buzz.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck is the Internet?\n\nINT. OFFICE OF POTZER'S INC--LATER\n\nHolden's at a computer terminal. Jay and Silent bob look\nover his shoulder.\n\nHOLDEN\nThe Internet is a communication device\nthat allows people the world over to\nbitch about movies and share\npornography with one another.\n(off monitor)\nHere's what we're looking for: \"Movie\nPoopShoot.com\"\n\nJAY\n(to Bob)\n\"PoopChute.\" Yeaaahhh.\n\nHOLDEN\nThis is a site full of militant movie\nbuffs: sad bastards who live in their\nparents' basements, downloading\nscripts and trading what they believe\nto be inside info about movies and\nactors they despise yet can't stop\ndiscussing. This is where you go if\nyou wanna hear frustrated would-be\nfilmmakers mouth off with their two-\nbit, arm-chair-director's opinions\non how they all could've made a better\nEpisode One.\n\nOn the computer monitor, we see the site mainpage load up.\nHolden begins navigating the site.\n\nHOLDEN\nHere. This is about the Bluntman\nmovie.\n(reading)\n\"Inside sources tell me Miramax is\nstarting production this Friday on\ntheir adaptation of underground comic\nfave Bluntman and Chronic.\"\n\nJAY\nFriday?! Shit. Does it say who's\nplaying us in the movie?\n\nHOLDEN\nNo, but if it's Miramax, I'm sure\nit'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.\nThey put'em in a bunch of movies.\n\nJAY\nWho?\n\nHOLDEN\nYou know--the guys from Good Will\nHunting.\n\nJAY\nYou mean the fucking movie with Mork\nfrom Ork in it?\n\nHOLDEN\nYeah, I'm not too big a fan either.\nThough Affleck was the bomb in\nPhantoms.\n\nJAY\nWord, bitch. Phantoms like a\nmotherfucker.\n\nHolden and Jay slap hands. Holden points at the monitor again.\n\nHOLDEN\nNow down here is where you can gauge\nthe buzz. This is the Shoot Back\narea. It's where people who read the\nnews get to chime in with their two\ncents. Here's what a guy who goes by\nthe chick-magnet Net handle of \"Wampa-\nOne\" thinks about Bluntman and\nChronic.\n(reading)\n\"Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid\nalter egos Jay and Silent Bob only\nwork in small doses, if at all. They\ndon't deserve their own movie.\"\n(to Jay)\nHe's got a point.\n\nJAY\nFuck him. What's the next one say?\n\nHOLDEN\n(reading)\n\"Bluntman and Chronic is the worst\ncomic I ever read. Jay and Silent\nBob are stupid characters. A couple\nof stoners who spout dumb-ass\ncatchphrases like a third-rate Cheech\nand Chong or Bill and Ted. Fuck Jay\nand Silent Bob. Fuck them up their\nstupid asses.\"\n\nJAY\nWho the fuck said that shit?!\n\nHOLDEN\nA guy who calls himself \"Magnolia-\nFan.\"  Check out what the guy after\nhim said: \"Jay and Silent Bob are\nterrible, one-note jokes that only\nstoners laugh at.  They're fucking\nclown shoes. If they were real, I'd\nbeat the shit out of them for being\nso stupid. I can't believe Miramax\nwould have anything to so with this\nshit. I, for one, will be boycotting\nthis movie. Who's with me?\"\n(leans back)\nAnd then there are about fifty more\nposts from people who agree to join\nSpartacus-here's boycott of the flick.\n\nJAY\n(grimly)\nI'm gonna kill all these fucks--\n\nHOLDEN\nAh, let it go. Number one, they're a\nbunch of jealous little dicks who\nuse the anonymity of the Net to insult\npeople who're doing what they wish\nthey were doing, and number two,\nthey're not really talking about you\nguys--they talking about Bluntman\nand Chronic.\n\nJAY\nBut they said Jay and Silent Bob!\nThey used our real names. It doesn't\nmatter that there's a comic book\nversion of us and a real version,\n'cause nobody knows we're real in\nreal life.\n\nHOLDEN\nReally.\n\nJAY\nYeah! And all these people who read\nthat shit think the real Jay and\nSilent Bob are a couple of faggots\n'cause of that all these dicks are\nwriting about the comic book Jay and\nSilent Bob! And maybe one night, me\nand Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch,\nand she'll be like \"Oooo! I want to\nsuck youse guys dicks off. What's\nyour names?\"  And I'll be like, \"Jay\nand Silent Bob.\" And she'll be like,\n\"Oh--I read on the Internet that\nyouse guys were little fucking\njerkoffs.\"  And then she goes and\nsucks two other guys's dicks off\ninstead! Well fuck that!  We gotta\nput a stop to these hateful sonsa-\nbitches before they ruin our good\nnames!\n\nHOLDEN\nFirst off, I don't know how good\nyour names really are. Secondly,\nthere's not much you can do about\nstopping this bile. The Internet's\ngiven everyone in America a voice,\nand everyone in American has chosen\nto use that voice to bitch about\nmovies. As long as there's a Bluntman\nand Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are\ngonna have something negative to say\nabout it.  Jay steams, thinking.\nThen, a light dawns on him.\n\nJAY\nBut wait a second--if there wasn't a\nBluntman and Chronic movie, then no\none would be saying shit about Jay\nand Silent Bob, right?\n\nHOLDEN\nThey're not saying anything about\nyou now--they're talking about\nfictional characters!\n\nJAY\n(oblivious to Holden;\nto Bob)\nSo all we gotta do is stop 'em from\nmaking the movie!\n\nHOLDEN\nYeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of\nthousands of dollars in royalties\nyou're due in the process. Are you\nfucking retarded? Look, I'm probably\nnot alone in the opinion that this\nflick is the worst idea since Greedo\nshooting first. I mean, a Jay and\nSilent Bob movie? Who would pay to\nsee that?\n\nHolden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for\na beat. Then--\n\nHOLDEN\nBut since it is happening, you might\nas well just ignore the idiots on\nthe Internet, go find Banky, and get\nyour \"motherfucking movie check.\" As\nyou so succinctly put it. That's\nwhat's important here.\n\nJAY\nNo, Holden McNeil--what's important\nhere is that there's a bunch of\nmotherfuckers we don't even know\ncalling us assholes on the Internet\nto a bunch of teenagers and guys who\ncan't even get laid. Putting a stop\nto that is the most important thing\nwe could ever do.\n(off monitor)\nWhen did it say they're making that\nmovie?\n\nHOLDEN\nThey start this Friday.\n\nJAY\nSo if today's Tuesday, that gives us--\n(counts)\nEight days.\n\nHOLDEN\nIt's more like three days.\n\nJAY\nRight. Three days to stop that stupid\nfucking movie from getting made!\nC'mon, Silent Bob--\n\nJay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.\n\nJAY\nWe're going to Hollywood.\n\nThey stride off. Holden shakes his head.\n\nHOLDEN\nNow that's what I call the Blunt\nleading the Blunt.\n\nEXT. BUS STATION--DAY\n\nJay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled \"Los\nAngeles.\" They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After\na beat, they re-emerge.\n\nJAY\nTickets?

Are we in\nHollywood yet or not?\n\nDRIVER\nPlease sit down, sir.\n\nJay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat.\n\nJAY\nWhy don't you take your seat Ralph\nKramden--\n\nJay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nI'm fucking bored, man. There ain't\nshit to so on this bus.\n\nSilent Bob mimes jerking off.\n\nJAY\nI already did that. Twice.\n\nSilent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across\nthe aisle and spots a CHILD IN A HELMET playing a handheld\nvideo game. He leans over to him.\n\nJAY\nYo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn.\n\nCHILD\nLeave me alone, little kid.\n\nThe Child gives him the finger. Jay goes wide-eyed, turning\nto Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nThat fuck called me a little kid and\ngave me the finger! Go kick his ass!\n\nSilent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, \"He's\nten years old.\"\n\nJAY\nYou're my muscle, ain'tcha?\n\nSilent Bob kind of nods.\n\nJAY\nSo go open a can of whup-ass on that\nlittle fuck, and get me his game!\n\nSilent Bob sighs and stands. He climbs over Jay into the\naisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and\nregisters doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on.\n\nSilent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches\nfor his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts\npunching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his\nseat, trying to look nonchalant. The Child stops crying. Jay\nlooks at Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nYou're one tough motherfucker, you\nknow that?\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY\n\nThe bus pulls over by the side of the road.\n\nINT. BUS--DAY\n\nThe Bus Driver heads down the aisle toward the back of the\nbus, followed by pissed-off PASSENGERS.\n\nPASSENGER\nThey been in there going on half an\nhour now! Two of them! Doing God\nknows what!\n\nThe Bus Driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts.\n\nDRIVER\nThis bus isn't moving another inch\nunless you clear out of there right\nnow!\n\nNo answer. The Bus Driver bangs on the door harder.\n\nDRIVER\nDO YOU HEAR ME?! OPEN THIS DOOR!\nNOW!!\n\nThe door handle turns, the door swings wide, and massive\namounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the\nbus. The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed\ninto the bathroom, holding a massive joint.\n\nJAY\nUm--I think something's burning back\nhere.\n\nEXT. ROADSIDE--LATER\n\nAs the bus pulls away, Jay and Silent Bob are revealed, left\nbehind.\n\nJAY\nThe whole fucking world's against\nus, dude. I swear to God.\n\nSilent Bob nods. Jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching.\n\nEXT. ROADSIDE--LATER\n\nJay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still.\n\nJAY\nThis sucks balls, man. How come we\nain't getting no rides?\n\nVOICE\n'Cause you're doing it all wrong.\n\nJay and Bob look behind them. There's a GUY hitching as well.\n\nGUY\nYou gotta induce the drivers a little.\n\nJAY\nLike how?\n\nGUY\nLike this.\n\nThe GUY holds out his sign to them. It reads: Will Give Head\nFor Ride.\n\nJAY\nYeah, but what happens when you get\nin the car, and you don't make with\nthe head? Don't they kick your ass\nto the curb?\n\nGUY\nSure--if you don't make with the\nhead.\n\nJay and Bob look at him for a long beat. Then--\n\nJAY\nEww! You eat the cock?!?\n\nGUY\nYeah. If it'll get me a few hundred\nmiles across country. I'll take a\nshot in the mouth.\n\nJAY\nYeah, but we ain't gay.\n\nGUY\nWell, neither am I. But have you\nseen the price of bus tickets lately?\nShit--I don't wanna cough up two\nhundred bucks just to get to Chicago.\n\nJAY\nWell, I don't wanna cough up some\ndude's sperm!\n\nGUY\nDon't be so suburban--this is the\nnew millennium. Gay, straight--it's\nall the same now. There're no more\nlines.\n\nJay draws a line on the ground with his foot.\n\nJAY\nThere's one. On this side of it, we\nain't gay.\n\nGUY\nAll hitchers do this. Why do you\nthink people pick us up? If you get\na ride, it's expected--I don't care\nwho the driver is. It's the first\nrule in the Book.\n\nJAY\nWhat book?\n\nGUY\nThe unwritten Book of the Road.\n\nA TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy\npoints to it, as if to say \"See?\" The passenger-side door\nopens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He\nlooks out the window at Jay and Bob.\n\nGUY\nFollow the rules of the Book, and\nyou'll get where you're going in no\ntime.  Excuse me.\n\nThrough the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go\nface-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers\nsmiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road.\n\nJay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR\npulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window\nand leans toward them.\n\nNUN\nYou two boys need a ride?\n\nINT. CAR--LATER\n\nThe NUN drives, smiling. Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back\nseat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun.\n\nNUN\nYou both don't have to sit back there.\nOne of you can sit up here with me.\n\nSilent Bob shakes his head \"no\" to Jay. Jay shrugs and climbs\nup front.\n\nNUN\nSo where are you boys from?\n\nJAY\nNew Jersey.\n\nNUN\nWhat brings you to Indiana?\n\nJAY\nWe're going to Hollywood.\n\nNUN\nHollywood, hunh? That's a long ways\naway.\n\nJAY\nYeah--we're lucky you picked us up.\n\nNUN\nWell, do unto others.

You know how lonely it\ngets on the road? Thanks to the Book,\nI'm never alone--if you know what I\nmean.\n\nJAY\nI guess. This guy back there explained\nit to us. But I didn't think you'd\nbe into that.\n\nNUN\nAre you kidding? I've dedicated my\nlife to it. Every hour of every day.\n\nJAY\nShit--you nuns are alright.\n\nNUN\nYou live by the Book, too?\n\nJAY\nYou picked us up, didn't you? I gotta.\n\nNUN\nThat's good to hear. But it takes\ndeed, not words. It's a lot easier\nto say you live by the Book than to\nactually do it.\n(looks at him)\nCan you do it?\n\nJAY\nYou want me to do it right now?\n\nNUN\nNo time like the present, right?\n\nJay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head\n\"no.\" Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and\nstarts to bend down.\n\nJAY\nAlright.\n(he suddenly stops)\nYou hear that? She's not a Catholic.\nShe's a Presbyterian.\n\nJay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed.\n\nEXT. ROADSIDE--DAY\n\nThe Nun's car screeched to the side of the road. Jay gets\nkicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun. Silent\nBob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his\nmouth. He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth.\n\nJAY\nDude--she had seventies bush.\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--NIGHT\n\nJay and Bob continue hitching.\n\nJAY\nI can't believe this shit. Five hours\nand not a single ride. Every day,\nmillions of people hitch to Hollywood\nand stop studios from making movies\nabout 'em. But when you and me try\nit, it's like we're trapped in a\nfucking cartoon!\n\nA familiar-looking VAN pulls up in the other side of the\nraid, The horn beeps.  Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug,\nand race across the street, get in. The van pulls off.\n\nINT. VAN--NIGHT\n\nJay and Bob sit in the back of the can and stare at--\n\nA clean-cut GUY, a Bookish woman in glasses, a red headed\nBeauty, a stoner DUDE, and a GREAT DANE.\n\nJay looks at Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nZoinks, yo\n\nGUY\nAnd now we can finally solve the\nmystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls!\nPull off their masks and let's see\nwho they really are!\n\nBOOKISH\nI don't think they are masks.\n\nBEAUTY\nI don't think they're Hitchhiking\nGirls either.\n\nBOOKISH\nGhouls, you fucking moron.

VAN--WEED VISION\n\nAs Jay and Bob toke up, we go all SLO-MO and 70's freaky\n(with the image seeming to SWIM). Through their stoned haze,\nwe see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling\nabout their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken\noff to reveal a man inside a costume.\n\nJay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint\nand look back.  Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total\ndebauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy\ncackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief. Bookish\nand Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other.\nThe Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says--\n\nGREAT DANE\nRi, Ray rand Rirent Rob\n\nThe Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking\nway out of its sheath. It's monstrous. Jay and Bob go wide-\neyed.\n\nJAY\nLook at his fuckin' lipstick!!! He's\ngot a stoner-boner!!!\n\nJay and Bob smile and pass out.\n\nWe cut back to the gang, who now appear as they did prior to\nWeed-Vision. They stare at the O.C.

Where can we get\nsome breakfast?\n\nBob looks around, and then locks on something O.C. He points,\nand Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.\n\nEXT.

He tugs at Silent Bob's arm.\n\nJAY\nYo--check that shit out: the Internet.\nLet's see if those fucks said\nsomething new about us and that stupid\nflick.\n\nBob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar\nand types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look\nat the screen and go wide-eyed.\n\nJAY\n\"Any movie based on Jay and Silent\nBob is gonna lick balls, because\nthey both, in fact, lick balls.

Then all you\nmotherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay\nand Silent Bob.\n\nSilent Bob finishes typing and presses \"Return\". He and Jay\nnod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking\nup at the menu board.\n\nJAY\nThat'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat\nour Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get\nback on the road, get to Hollywood,\nand stop that fucking movie from\ngetting made. No more hairy-bush\nnuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye\non the prize, and not let nothing--\nand I mean NOTHING--distract me.\n\nAs Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and\nfreezes.  A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all\nin SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in\nthe World. She's bathed in light, glowing.\n\nShe bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.\n\nJay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then\nat the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's\neyes, getting zero response.\n\nJAY'S POV\n\nThe Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to\nher breasts, then down to her crotch.\n\nJay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle\nof the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss\non her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager\nto get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous\nwith the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.\n\nBut it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to\nSilent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls\nhis eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it\nover Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She\nsmiles at the zombified Jay.\n\nGIRL\n(off cup)\nOh my God. Do you get free refills\nwith that?\n\nJAY\nOh, what--this? I just wear this for\nprotection. You know--so no guys try\nto grab my shit.\n\nGIRL\nHi. I'm Justice.\n\nJAY\n(dreamily)\nAnd I am so fucking yours--\n\nSilent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze.\n\nJAY\nI mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my\nhereto life-mate, Silent Bob.\n\nJUSTICE\nIt's nice to meet you.\n\nJAY\nJustice, hunh? That's a nice name.\n(under his breath, to\nBob)\nJay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F-\nU-C-K-I-N-G--\n(back to Justice)\nSo you come here often?\n\nJUSTICE\nOh, I'm not from around here. My\nfriends and I are taking a road trip,\nand we just stopped to grab something\nto eat.\n\nJAY\nYour friends, hunh? Where they at?\n\nJUSTICE\n(pointing)\nOut there. By that van.\n\nJay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other\ngorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair\naround, looking incredibly sexy.\n\nWithout looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him--\n\nJAY\nDude--I think I just filled the cup.\n\nINT. VAN--DAY\n\nJay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the\nother Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food\nto her friends.\n\nJAY\nLadies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent\nBob are in the Hizz-ouse!!!\n\nSISSY\nWho the fuck are these guys?\n\nJUSTICE\nThis is Jay and Silent Bob.\n(to Jay and Bob)\nGuys, this is Sissy, Missy, and\nChrissy.\n\nCHRISSY\nWhere the fuck did they come from?\n\nJUSTICE\nI met 'em inside. They're gonna hitch\na ride.\n\nSISSY\nI don't know if that's such a great\nidea. Jussy.\n\nJAY\nSure it is, Juggs.\n\nMISSY\nOh my god--he just called Sissy\n\"Juggs\"!\n\nCHRISSY\nI'm on it.\n\nChrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife.\n\nJUSTICE\nChrissy, no!\n\nSissy stops Chrissy, shoving a burger into her hands.\n\nSISSY\nWe're in the middle of suburbia,\nChrissy. Let's try to act like it.\n\nCHRISSY\n\n}\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nAnd what-stupid ass little foul-\nmouthed bitch-boys don't get their\nballs cut off in suburbia?\n\nJAY\n(oblivious)\nWhat's with the knife? We having\ncake or something?\n\nCHRISSY\nHoly shit--he's retarded, to boot.\n\nJAY\n(to Silent Bob)\nYo--she called you retarded.\n\nSISSY\n(to Justice)\nWhat's wrong with you, Justice? You\ndo remember where we're going, don't\nyou?\n\nMISSY\nThat we do have a job to do?\n\nJUSTICE\nThey're just gonna tag along for a\nfew miles. They won't get in the\nway, I promise.\n(cutesy)\nPlease?\n\nSISSY\nFine--they can ride with us. But\nthey're so out of here before we get\nto Boulder.\n\nJUSTICE\nHonest Injun.\n\nCHRISSY\n\"Honest Injun\"?\n(to Sissy)\nI can't believe what a pushover you\nare.\n\nJAY\nAnd I can't believe fine-ass bitches\nlike yourselves eat that shit. Don't\nyou know fast food makes girls fart?\n\nSuddenly, Jay and Bob are parted by BRENT, who's getting\ninto the van.\n\nBRENT\nSay--what's all this talk about\nfarting?\n\nSissy, Missy, and Chrissy immediately go from disgusted to\nsweet and airy, totally switching characters.\n\nSISSY/CHRISSY/MISSY\nHi Brent!\n\nSISSY\nThis is Brent. He's with us, too.\n\nCHRISSY\nBrent, tell these sillies that girls\ndon't fart.\n\nBRENT\nOf course they don't! Only skeevy\nstoners fart.\n\nThe very white Brent puts his hand out to be slapped by Jay\nand Silent Bob.\n\nBRENT\nWhat up, homies?\n(off the Girls)\nWow, Three guys, four girls--\n(to Jay and Bob)\nWhat's the count boys?\n\nJay and Bob look at each other and roll their eyes.\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY\n\nThe van drives down the road. We hear singing from inside.\n\nINT. VAN--DAY\n\nBrent strums a guitar and sings, as the Girls and Jay and\nBob listen, rolling eyes.\n\nBRENT\nHey there mister science-guy. Don't\nspray that aerosol in my eye. For I\ndon't really want to die. I'm a noble\nrabbit!\n\nJAY\nWhat're you guys, like a cover band\nor something?\n\nSISSY\nWe're the Kansas State chapter of\nS.A.A.C.--Students Against Animal\nCruelty.\n\nCHRISSY\nAnd we're on our way to Colorado to\ngive Provasik a piece of our minds!\n\nEveryone lets out a whoop, except Jay and Bob.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck are you bitches babbling\nabout?\n\nBRENT\nHey! Watch the language little boy.\nThere are females present.\n\nJay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts\nthem.\n\nJUSTICE\nProvasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical\nlab where they perform gross\nexperiments on animals.\n\nJAY\nSo, what kind of animals are we\ntalking about here--like bears and\nrhinos?\n\nBRENT\nNo--more like rabbits, dogs, cats...\nheck, even monkeys, If we don't speak\nfor them, who will?\n(touches Justice's\narm)\nRight, Jussy?\n\nJay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition.  After\na beat, he relaxes.\n\nJAY\nHey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you\nover here for a second?\n\nBrent joins Jay, strumming his guitar. Jay addresses him\nconfidentially.\n\nJAY\nBe honest, yo--you're down with this\nfor the fine-ass pussy, right?\n\nBRENT\nI'm down with this because I love\nanimals, stupid.\n\nJAY\nEven sheep?\n\nBRENT\nOf course. Sheep are beautiful\ncreatures.\n\nJAY\nThey are beautiful, aren't they?\n\nBRENT\nOh God, yes.\n\nJAY\nSo then you'd fuck a sheep?\n\nBRENT\nWhat is your damage little boy? You've\ngot a sick and twisted world\nperspective.\n\nJAY\nNo, you misunderstand me, Prince\nValiant. I mean if you were another\nsheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if\nyou were another sheep?\n\nBRENT\nI--suppose so.\n\nJAY\nThat's what I thought.\n(suddenly loudly, to\nall)\nYO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF\nUS! HE JUST SAID HE'D FUCK A SHEEP!\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY\n\nThe side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled\nout of the moving vehicle. Jay throws his guitar at him as\nwell, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off.\n\nJAY\nYA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!!\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--LATER\n\nThe van drives down the road.\n\nINT. VAN--SAME\n\nMissy drives. Sissy sits in the passenger seat. Chrissy kneels\nbetween them.\n\nCHRISSY\nWhat the fuck are we gonna do now?\n\nSISSY\nShut up, I'm thinking.\n\nIn the back, Justice studies some blueprints. Jay joins her,\nand she quickly folds them up.\n\nJAY\nIs Hollywood near where we're going?\n\nJUSTICE\nIs that where you guys are from?\n\nJAY\nCh'yeah, right. Jersey represent!\n\nJUSTICE\nOh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you\nall the way out here?\n\nJAY\nWell, we couldn't hang in front of\nthe Quick Stop no more, 'cause of\nthe strainen-en order, which sucks\nass 'cause it's been like our home\nsince we were kids. Silent Bob even\nbusted his cherry there.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Bob)\nYou did? I'll bet she was a lucky\ngirl.\n\nBob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has\nstrayed.\n\nJAY\nLook, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying\nto tell a story here.\n\nJUSTICE\nSorry.\n\nJAY\nAnyway, we were talking to Brodie\nand he said there's gonna be a\nBluntman and Chronic movie. So we\nwent to see Holden McNeil, and he\nshowed us the Internet, and that's\nwhere we found all these fucking\nlittle jerkoffs were saying shit\nabout us. So we decided to go to\nHollywood and stop the movie from\ngetting made.  And now we're here.\n\nJUSTICE\nWow. I have no idea what you just\nsaid.\n\nJAY\nYeah, I get that a lot. So you like\nanimals, huh?\n\nJUSTICE\nSure.\n\nJAY\nThat's cool. Even snakes?\n\nJUSTICE\nYou can't exclude an animal just\nbecause it's not cuddly. Of course I\nlike snakes.\n\nJAY\nHow about trouser snakes?\n\nJUSTICE\nWhat's a trouser snake?\n\nJust then, a little JAY DEVIL appears on Jay's left shoulder.\n\nJAY DEVIL\n(to Jay)\nWhat the fuck are you waiting for?\nShe went for the setup! Reach in\nyour fucking pants, and pull yer\ncock out, bitch! That's the kinda\nshit girls like!\n\nSuddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right\nshoulder.\n\nJAY DEVIL 2\nRight about here's where the angel's\nsupposed to show up and tell you not\nto pull your dick out. But we bitch-\nslapped that little fuck and sent\nhim packing, so it's smooth sailing.\nLet 'er rip, boy!\n\nThey disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his\nhand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick,\nwhen suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder,\nrubbing a swollen jaw.\n\nJAY ANGEL\nSorry I'm late. So what's the deal\nhere?\n(looks down)\nOh, shit--you're not thinking of\nwhipping your dick out at this fine\npiece of woman, are you?\n\nJay thinks, then nods \"Yes.\" The Jay Angel rolls his eyes,\nand slaps him.\n\nJAY ANGEL\nTell you what: look at Silent Bob.\nSee if he thinks it's a good idea to\nwhip your dick out.\n\nJay looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in\nhis pants to Jay and shakes his head \"no,\" sternly. Jay\nwithdraws his hand from his pants. The Jay Angel nods,\nsatisfied.\n\nJAY ANGEL\nThat's it, boy--put the dick down.\nYou gotta go from the heart, yo. No\nlittle perv bullshit will do for\nthis one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de\nla Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the\nshit out of two suckerpunching little\nbitches. Remember--don't pull your\ndick out until she asks you to.\n(beat)\nOr until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg!\nThe Jay Angel blinks away. Justice\nlooks at Jay, a bit confused.\n\nJAY\nDon't ask.\n(beat)\nSo, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like\nme do to help the animals?\n\nJUSTICE\nYou really don't want to help us--\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\nSure I do. I'd do anything for you.\n\nJustice smiles. Jay tries to recover.\n\nJAY\nI mean, youse guys! I'd do anything\nfor youse guys. For the lift and\nshit.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou sure?\n\nJAY\nSure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I.\nFuck\n\nJUSTICE\nWell--okay. Let me talk it over with\nthe other girls and get back to you.\n\nJAY\nYou do that.\n\nJay takes Justice's hand and kisses it.\n\nJAY\nI'll be right here.\n\nHe winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the\ncan, near Silent Bob.  He's still smiling at Justice and\nwinking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly,\nthen imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls.\n\nJAY\nFuck you. Fatty.\n\nEXT. CONVENIENCE STORY--DAY\n\nThe van pulls up and all pile out, stretching. The Girls\nhead toward the store.  Justice calls over to Jay and Silent\nBob.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou guys want anything from inside?\n\nJAY\nNo, we're cool, thanks hon.\n\nJustice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study\nthe front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a\nplace to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one.\nAfter a beat--\n\nJAY\nIt just ain't the same, is it? This\nplace licks balls compared to Quick\nStop.\n\nSilent Bob shakes his head \"Yeah.\"\n\nJAY\nAnd speaking of licking balls--how\n'bout that Justice chick? She is too\nfine.  And she smells so fucking\npretty. She's got a nice voice, too.\nAnd that body?  Smoking. You know,\nshe never once said \"fuck off,\" when\nI was talking to her, or pulled out\nthe pepper spray, or nothing. I tell\nya, Lunchbox--she could be the one.\n\nINT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY\n\nJustice is at the microwave when she's suddenly surrounded\nby the other girls.\n\nMISSY\nSmooth move, Justice.\n\nCHRISSY\n(slapping Justice\nupside the head)\nNice going, Four Eyes!\n\nJUSTICE\nOw!\n\nSISSY\nWhy the fuck did you let that little\nstoner throw Brent our of the van?!\n\nJUSTICE\nOh please--if I had to listen to one\nmore of those stupid songs, I was\ngoing to throw him out myself.\n\nSISSY\nWe needed Brent, Justice! He was our\npatsy!\n\nJUSTICE\nWe'll find someone else. Besides, I\ndidn't see you trying to stop Jay\nfrom throwing him out.\n\nSISSY\nBecause I didn't want to blow our\ncover!\n\nJUSTICE\nCover, shmover--you all hated his\nsongs, too.\n\nCHRISSY\nNot as much as I hate you.\n\nJustice offers Chrissy a cold glance,\n\nCHRISSY\nFuck, if I don't get to kill someone\nsoon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone!\n\nSISSY\n(rubbing Chrissy's\nshoulders)\nDon't mind Chrissy. She's just a\nlittle too wound for sound.\n\nCHRISSY\nThen how about you help me take the\nedge off?\n\nChrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot\nand heavy in the middle of the convenience store. Other\ncustomers regard them wide-eyed.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Customers)\nThey're really good friends.\n\nSISSY\n(TO CHRISSY AND MISSY)\nWould you two knock it off? We're in\nthe fucking heartland here! Try to\nblend!\n\nJUSTICE\nThey already do--she's the milkmaid,\nand she's the cow.\n\nCHRISSY\nOh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow,\nbitch. And now I'm gonna rip your\nhead off and fuck your spine stump.\n\nSISSY\nEnough!\n(calm to Justice)\nWe have a very simple gang here,\nJustice. I'm the brains, Chrissy's\nthe brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl.\nBut lately, I'm having a hard time\nfiguring out what you're doing here.\n\nJUSTICE\nThat makes two of us.\n\nCHRISSY\nShit--your name doesn't even fit the\nrhyme scheme.\n\nJUSTICE\nThat's because very few names rhyme\nwith \"douchebag.\"\n\nCHRISSY\n(getting in her face)\nYou're dancing on my last nerve,\nStrawberry Shortcake.\n(to Sissy)\nYou deal with the weak link. I'm\ngonna take Missy into the dirty\nconvenience store bathroom and hate-\nfuck the shit out of her.\n\nChrissy drags Missy off. Justice and Sissy watch them go.\n\nJUSTICE\nAnd you said letting them read all\nthat Anais Nin wouldn't amount to\nanything.\n\nSISSY\nDon't change the subject. You know\nwhat you have to do now, right? Since\nyou let our patsy slip away, you've\ngotta convince the little kid and\nthat fat guy to take his place.\nThey've gotta break into Provasik\nnow.\n\nJUSTICE\nUh-uh!\n\nSISSY\nUh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out\nof this gang. Just use the little\none's crush to convince him, since\nhe's so fucking in love with you.\n\nJUSTICE\nJay? No he's not.\n\nSISSY\nWhat--am I blind? He wasn't kissing\nyour hand back in the van like he\nwas fucking Lord Byron?\n\nJUSTICE\nWell, maybe he was just raised with\nmanners.\n\nEXT.

CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY\n\nSissy continues to confront Justice.\n\nSISSY\nYou're the one that brought the kid\nin, Jussy. So you've gotta make\namends.\n\nJUSTICE\nJay is not taking Brent's place as\nthe patsy.\n\nSISSY\nThat kid and his quite friend are\nour only options at this point. Now\nwe got about two hours before we get\nto Boulder. That gives you plenty of\nof time to work on him.\n\nJUSTICE\nI'm not gonna do it.\n\nSISSY\nWhy the fuck not?\n\nJUSTICE\nBecause he's just to so innocent!\n\nJustice looks out the window and smiles, seeing Jay dancing\nalongside Bob.\n\nJUSTICE\nLook at him--\n\nEXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME\n\nJay's dancing still, but now we hear what he's SINGING to\nSilent Bob.\n\nJAY\nI'm gonna finger-fuck her tight little\nasshole!

CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME\n\nSissy eyeballs Justice, who's still looking out at Jay.\n\nSISSY\nWho's it going to be, Jussy--him or\nus?\n\nJustice looks at Sissy. Sissy nods at her. Justice looks\nback out at Jay.\n\nINT. VAN--DAY\n\nJustice talks to Jay and Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nSteal a monkey? Shit--no problem.\n\nJUSTICE\nIt's not really stealing--it's\nliberating it, and--\n(finally hears him)\nWait a second--did you say, \"No\nproblem\"?\n\nJAY\nYeah, Fuck--we steal monkeys all the\ntime.\n(to Bob)\nRight, Lunchbox?\n\nSilent Bob glares at Jay.\n\nJUSTICE\nIt's not like it's a bad thing. It's\nfor a good cause.\n\nJAY\nOh, it for the best cause, mon cheri--\n(takes her hand)\nThe cause of love.\n(kisses her hand,\nthen releases)\nSnoogans--\n\nJUSTICE\nWhat the heck is that?\n\nJAY\nWhat's what?\n\nJUSTICE\n\"Snoogans,\" I believe it was.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck do you think it means?\nIt means \"I'm kidding.\"\n\nJUSTICE\nOhhh. Well, that's too bad.\n\nShe smiles at Jay, touches his chin and heads to the front\nof the van. Jay plays it cool until she's out of sight, then\nhumps silent Bob's leg like a dog.\n\nJAY\n(singing)\nI can't believe I'm gonna get some\npussy for stealing a monkey!\n(speaking)\nIf I'd known it was that easy, I'd've\nbeen stealing monkeys since I was\nlike seven and shit.\n\nJay looks at Silent Bob, who clearly disapproves.\n\nJAY\nDon't, motherfucker. Don't you ruin\nthis for me. Me and Justice are gonna\nget married one day, so don't be\ngiving me that \"we-ain't-stealing-no-\nmonkey\" look.  I'm Morris Day; you're\nJerome, bitch. Don't forget that.\nThat girl? That girl's in love with\nme.\n\nUp front, Justice talks to Sissy, while Missy drives.\n\nJUSTICE\nThey're gonna do it.\n\nSISSY\nGood. They do their part--\n(pats a video camera)\nAnd we'll do ours.\n\nJustice eyes Sissy, then slumps in her seat.\n\nEXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT\n\nThe Van rolls up across the street from the Provasik Labs,\nparking in front of another large building.\n\nINT. VAN--SAME\n\nJay and Silent bob get out, along with Justice. They wear\nNinja masks. Missy and Chrissy follow.\n\nJUSTICE\nRemember--we meet back here when\nyou're done. You sure you're okay\nwith this?\n\nJAY\nAs sure as I am that you're the\nhottest bitch I ever seen.\n\nChrissy lunges at Jay, Missy holds her back, dragging Chrissy\naway.\n\nJAY\nWhat's twisting that bitch's tits?\n\nJUSTICE\nMaybe it's because women don't like\nto be called \"bitches,\" Jay.\n\nJAY\nThey don't? Well how 'bout \"piece of\nass\"?\n\nJUSTICE\nHow about not.\n\nJAY\nWell, what the fuck am I supposed to\ncall you, then?\n\nJUSTICE\nSomething sweet, you big goof.\nSomething nice.\n\nJAY\n(thinks; then)\nBoo-boo kitty fuck.\n\nJUSTICE\n(laughing)\nOkay.  That's a start.\n\nSissy jumps out of the van, holding the video camera, aiming\nit at Jay and Bob.\n\nSISSY\nJay, before you go, could you say\nsomething into the camera about the\nclitoris.\n\nJAY\nWhat?\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Sissy)\nMan you are such a bitch--\n\nSISSY\n(off Justice; to Jay)\nShe's just a little embarrassed.\nSee, Jussy and I are putting together\nthis documentary for our Human\nSexuality class, and we need a male\nperspective on the clitoris.\n\nJAY\nThe female clitoris?\n\nSISSY\nUh--yeah.\n\nJUSTICE\nJay, you don't have to do this.\n\nShe elbows Sissy.\n\nJAY\nNah, it's cool, hon. There's a few\nthings I can say about the clit that\nI's like you to hear.\n(clears throat; into\ncamera)\nI am the master of the clit! I make\nthat shit work! It does what ever\nthe fuck I tell it to do!  No one\nrules the clit like me!\n(off Silent Bob)\nNot this little fuck! None of you\nlittle fucks out there! I am the\nclit commander!!! Remember that--\ncommander of all clits!\n\nJay proceeds to make some pussy-eating faces. Justice shakes\nher head at Sissy, who snaps the camera closed and smiles.\n\nSISSY\nAwesome. Knock 'em dead, Tiger.\n\nSissy climbs back into the van.\n\nJAY\n(to Justice)\nSo--can I get a little kiss for good\nluck?\n\nJustice smiles at Jay, then kisses him sweetly on the lips.\n\nJAY\nSo--can I get a little blow job for\ngood luck?\n\nJustice smiles and pulls Jay's mask down. He heads off,\nrevealing Silent Bob behind him, lips puckered, handing in\nmidair. Jay reached back into the frame, pulling Bob out.\nJustice watches them go.\n\nSISSY\nJussy. C'mon.\n\nJustice climbs back into the van.\n\nINT. VAN--SAME\n\nJustice sits, glaring at Sissy.\n\nSISSY\nHey, Lover-girl.

While we're executing\nPhase Two, you edit that tape and\ngrab a new car.\n\nMISSY\nNo sweat.\n\nSISSY\nLet's suit up.\n\nEXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT\n\nJay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn,\nstopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN\nout of his coat. He fires it into the air as Jay quickly\ngives the \"metal\" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame.\n\nINT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT\n\nIt's dead quiet and still. Then, the pair smash through a\nwindow, landing in the floor in a ball. They lift their Ninja\nhoods. Jay glares at Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nYou fat fuck--\n\nINT.

VAN--NIGHT\n\nThe quartet piles out of the van, and we get our first look\nat them: sexily geared up for action, wearing all black.\nThey head for a SEPARATE BUILDING.  Stopping at the front\ndoor.\n\nSissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures\nelaborately back, racing away into the night. Justice offers\nSissy a look.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou are so gay.\n\nChrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a\ndigital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four\ndifferent digits. The door lock CLICKS open.\n\nSISSY\nOnce we're inside, I want complete\nsilence.\n(holding up high-tech\ndevice)\nMissy whipped this up. It counts our\ndecibel level. If it goes into the\nred--alarm, we're dead. So not even\nthe slightest noise, got it?\n\nJustice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed\nclosely by Chrissy.  Justice lingers at the door, taking one\nlast look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay\nand Bob.\n\nSISSY\n(pokes her head back\nout)\nJustice! Move your ass!\n\nJustice heads inside. We PAN up to reveal a sign that reads:\nBOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE.\n\nINT. PROVASIK TESTING ROOM--NIGHT\n\nJay and Bob stand there, looking around the room.\n\nIt's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking\nANIMALS.  A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his\neyes and hits him.\n\nJAY\nStay frosty, you big fucking softie.\nWe've got a job to do.\n\nSilent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade\nthrough the cages. Jay stops at an EMERGENCY BOX hanging on\nthe wall. Inside it, there's a pistol.\n\nJAY\nCheck this out, Lunchbox. Animal\ntranquilizer.

At the\nother end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS.\n\nSissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays\nthe air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor,\nwhich rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly,\nwithin the mist, laser beams become apparent.\n\nSissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few\nsteps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs\nforward and does an impressive series of flips down the\nhallway, not touching a single laser beam.\n\nChrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.\n\nOnce Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of\nthe hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture\nto Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series\nof flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm.\n\nChrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.\n\nJustice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to\nChrissy.\n\nChrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams,\nSissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly.\n\nThen, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are\neven more impressive than the other two, including running\nup walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes\nthe last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice,\narms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud,\nmanly FART.\n\nThe decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING\nthrough the building.\n\nCHRISSY\nHoly fuck--the little stoner was\nright--\n\nSissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds.

Now\nwe got what we came for, so let's\nget the fuck out!\n\nSilent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn. Jay shakes\nhis head frustrated.\n\nJAY\nYeah, it's sad!

Uhhh--\n\nAs he climaxes, a ganging at the door disrupts him.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWHAT?! WHAT?! I'M READING!\n\nDEPUTY (O.S.)\nSir, we got a report of a break-in\nat Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing\nlab.\n\nWillenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine.\nThere's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nHave you read this article on the\nmule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I\nwish that was in our jurisdiction--\nI'd shut down every last one of those\nass-cock chuggers, personally.\n\nThe Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then\nat Willenholly.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWhat? \"Ass\" means \"donkey.\"\n\nDEPUTY\nYes, sir.\n(hands him a fax)\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(looks at fax)\nBoulder, hunh?

This\ninvestigation is now under my\njurisdiction.\n\nCOP 1\nOh really? And why is that?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nBecause someone let a whole mess of\nanimals out of their cages, sir.\n\nCOP 1\nWell, we believe that was just a\ndiversionary tactic used to call\nattention away from the real heist\nover here at the Diamond Exchange.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nYeah, right. That's a believable\nscenario. It sounds more like\nsomething out of a bad movie.\n\nWillenholly and the Cop look at the camera. Then, another\nCOP joins them.\n\nCOP 2\nSir, the Provasik people say they've\nrounded all their animals up, except\nfor one: an orangutan.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nListen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our\nfugitive has been on the run for 6\nhours!  Average simian foot speed\nover uneven ground--barring injuries\nor preoccupation with tire tubes,\nmites or bananas--is four miles an\nhour. That gives us a radius of twenty\nmiles.\n\nCOP 3\n(calling out from\ncrowd)\nTwenty-four, sir!\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWhat?\n\nCOP 3\nSix hours times four miles an hour\nis twenty-four.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(doing the math in\nhis head)\nYes. Yes, you're right. My bad. Twenty-\nfour miles. Now what I want out of\nall of you is a hard target search.\n\nCOP 4\nExcuse me, sir?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nYeah?\n\nCOP 4\nWhat does that mean, exactly--a \"hard\ntarget search\"? What's a \"hard\ntarget\"?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWell. It's--a target--that's--hard.\nAnyway--\n\nCOP 4\nSo are you referring to the search's\nlevel of difficulty? Or is the hard\ntarget the monkey?\n\nCOP 3\nOr the people who stole the monkey?\n\nThe COPS now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of\n\"Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,\"etc.\nWillenholly rubs his temples.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nOkay, how about this? What I want\nout of all of you is a thorough search\nof every gas station, residence,\nwarehouse, farmhouse, henhouse,\nouthouse, and doghouse in that area!\nCheckpoints go up at fifteen miles!\n\nCOP 1\nWouldn't it make sense to put them\nup at every twenty-four miles--seeing\nas that's how far they'd have gotten\nin the last six hours?\n\nThey begin chattering amongst themselves again. Willenholly\nlooks at them all, defeated. He starts to cry.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nThis is so frustrating. It's just so\nhard sometimes--\n(yelling)\nYOUR FUGITIVE'S NAME IS SUZANNE! GO\nFIND HER!\n\nAnother COP joins Willenholly, carrying a large, fat envelope.\n\nCOP 5\nSir, this was just delivered to the\nstation.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWhat is it?\n\nCOP 5\nIt's a tape from the terrorists who're\nclaiming credit for the break-in.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nIs it VHS or Beta?

Talking\nme into Dogma was one thing, but\nthis--\n\nBEN\nI'm sorry this is taking you away\nfrom whatever-gay-killers-on-horses-\nwho-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely-\nflick you're supposed to be doing\nthis week.\n\nMATT\nOh--I'm touchy-feely? I take it you\nnever saw Forces of Nature?\n\nBEN\nYou're like a child. What've I been\ntelling you? Sometimes you've gotta\ndo the safe picture. Sometimes, you\ndo it for art. Sometimes, it's the\npayback picture your friend says you\nowe him--\n\nThey take a beat and look at the camera. Then--\n\nBEN\nAnd sometimes, you go back to the\nwell.\n\nMATT\nAnd sometimes, you do Reindeer Games.\n\nBEN\nNow that's just mean.\n\nJay turns excitedly to Bob.\n\nJAY\nThis has gotta be the Bluntman Flick,\n'cause that's those two fucks from\nthat Mork movie! Now all we gotta do\nis figure out a way to get close to\nthem--\n\nThe A.D. grabs Jay and Bob by the arms and drags them onto\nthe set, placing them near Ben and Matt in the scene.\n\nA.D.\nJust stand there and react. Don't\nsay anything.\n\nBob goes a little wide-eyed. Jay smiles at him.\n\nJAY\n(off A.D.'s comment)\nThat's pretty funny.\n\nA.D.\n(calling out)\nAlright, people. Lock it up. Let's\ngo for picture.\n\nJay and Bob eye Ben and Matt fiercely, Ben and Matt are\noblivious.\n\nJAY\nOn the count of three, we rush those\nfucks and beat the shit out of 'em.\n'Cause if they're all fucked up,\nthey can't make the move, right?\nAlright, then.  One--two--\n\nCLAPPER/LOADER (O.S.)\nGood Will Hunting Two: Hunting Season.\n\nJay and Bob freeze and look at each other, then O.C.\n\nThe Clapper/Loader holds a clapboard in front of Ben's face.\nIt does indeed, read: Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season.\n\nCLAPPER/LOADER\nScene sixteen, take five.\n\nThe Clapper/Loader claps the board closed and races off. Ben\nlooks to Gus.\n\nBEN\nAction, Gus?\n\nGus looks up from counting his money.\n\nGUS\nJesus, Ben--I said I'm busy.\n\nBen shakes his head and then starts the scene with CLARK.\n\nBEN/CHUCKIE\nYou should check it out, it's a good\ncourse. But, you know, frankly, I\nfound the class rather elementary.\n\nCLARK\nYou know, I don't doubt that it was.\nI remember that class. It was just\nbetween recess and lunch.\n\nBEN/CHUCKIE\nAre we gonna have a problem, again?\n\nCLARK\nThere's no problem. I was still just\nhoping you might give me some insight\ninto the evolution of the market\neconomy in the Southern Colonies.\nSee, Wood says--\n\nMATT/WILL\n(stepping in)\nWhat'd I say? Didn't I say you'd be\nback here regurgitating Gordon Wood.\nBut you forgot about Vickers--\n\nCLARK\nNo, I just read Vickers, so I'm up\non inherited wealth, Hunting. But\nyou're not the angry, brilliant young\nmind you once were, just itching to\nvent your frustrations.\n\nIn the background, Jay and Silent Bob get bored and head out\nof the shot. After a beat, they get pushed back in by the\nA.D.\n\nCLARK\nOnce Sean told you it wasn't your\nfault, you lost the edge, William.\nYou stopped hitting the books with a\nvengeance, and now I've read shit\nyou haven't even heard about yet.\nFace facts, my friend--love made you\na soft little pussy boy, unable to\nstand up to an academic showdown,\nlike you used to. You're just no\nlonger that good--Will Hunting.\n(gets in his face)\nNow how do you like them apples?\n\nMatt/Will turns away angrily, facing Ben/Chuckie, looking\ndownwards, steaming.\n\nBEN/CHUCKIE\nI don't like the sound of them apples.\nWill, what're we gonna do now?\n\nMATT/WILL\nChuckie--\n(snarling)\nIt's Hunting season.\n\nMatt/Will spins to face Clark with two huge guns in his hands.\nHe blows Clark away, Jay and Bob hit the deck. Matt/Will\nstands there, guns smoking.\n\nBEN/CHUCKIE\nApple sauce, bitch.\n\nSuddenly the door to the soundstage swings open, and the\nSecurity guard Jay knocked out rushes in, followed by other\nSECURITY GUARDS who comb the place.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nSorry to interrupt, sirs, but have a\nten-oh-seven on our hands.\n\nBEN\nWait a second! I wasn't with any\nhookers today!\n\nThe Security Guard sees Jay and Bob crouched behind Ben, He\npoints, screaming.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nTHERE THEY ARE!\n\nBen and Matt turn to Jay and Bob, Jay smiles.\n\nJAY\nAffleck, you're the bomb in Phantoms,\nyo.\n\nJay and Bob then race out-of-frame, closely followed by the\nSecurity guards.  Matt head off, arms thrown in the air.\n\nMATT\nIf anyone's looking for me, I'll be\nin my trailer trying to figure out\nhow I got here from an Academy Award.\n\nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY\n\nJay and Bob rush out, pulling a bench in front of the door,\nblocking it. They race ten feet to another soundstage across\nfrom them and head inside a door.\n\nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME\n\nJay and Silent Bob rush in to see--\n\nWes Craven getting ready to direct a scene with a familiar-\nlooking GHOSTFACE KILLER and SHANNEN DOHERTY. The\nClapper/Loader's clapboard reads: Scream 4\n\nCLAPPER/LOADER\nScream four, scene thirty-seven,\ntake one.\n(claps it and rushes\noff)\n\nWES CRAVEN\nAction!\n\nThe Killer chases Shannen around the room, falling over stuff,\nuntil she hits him with a lamp, knocking him out.\n\nSHANNEN DOHERTY\nAlright, you bastard! Let's see who\nyou really are!\n\nShannen pulls the mask off the short performer to reveal\nSUZANNE.\n\nJay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed.\n\nSHANNEN DOHERTY\nFucking Miramax--\n(getting up)\nCUT!\n\nShannen heads over to Wes, holding the mask.\n\nWES CRAVEN\nShannen, usually I say \"cut.\"\n\nSHANNEN DOHERTY\nA monkey? Jesus, you guys aren't\neven trying anymore, are you?\n\nWES CRAVEN\nThe market research suggest that\npeople love monkeys.\n\nJay and Silent Bob rush in, grab Suzanne.\n\nJAY\nWE LOVE THIS MONKEY!\n\nThey rush out. West shrugs to Shannen.\n\nWES CRAVEN\nSee?\n\nSecurity Guards race through, chasing after the exited pair.\n\nEXT. LOT--DAY\n\nJay and Bob race through the lot, with Bob carrying Suzanne.\nOn a fake New York city street, another movie is shooting.\nThe trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until--\n\nAt the end of the alley, a set GOLF CART pulls up, and four\nSecurity Guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking\ntheir path. Jay and Bob stop dead, looking back to see the\nother Security Guards gaining.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck are we gonna do?\n\nJust then, a P.A. on a bike pulls up nearby. He ditches the\nbike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front.\n\nJay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and\njump on, putting Suzanne in the basket. They start pedaling\naway furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse.\nSilent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart.\n\nJAY\nPUNCH IT!!!\n\nBob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the\nvehicle, taking flight,\n\nBelow, the Security Guards stare in awe as--\n\nJay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front\nbasket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a\nsoundstage) a la E.T.\n\nJay and Bob look down, then at each other. They smile. Then\nthey look ahead and let out a scream.\n\nThe bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage\nBuilding.\n\nINT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY\n\nThe Bike lands, and Jay and Bob, and Suzanne go tumbling\nonto the floor covered in glass. They look up to see.\n\nJAMES VAN DER BEEK AND JASON BIGGS dressed as Jay and Silent\nBob, looking down as them.\n\nJAMES\nHoly shit--that looked like it hurt.\n\nJASON\nAre you guys alright?\n(off Suzanne)\nHey! They've got a monkey!\n\nJay and Bob look at their twins, then at each other.\n\nJAY\nYo, I think that shit just kicked\nin.\n\nJAMES\nLet's get you guys on your feet.\n\nJames and Jason help Jay and Silent Bob to their feet. All\nstare at one another, perplexed,\n\nThen--\n\nJAY\n(to James)\nSee man?  Its never, \"Hey--you were\nin Loser, or, \"Dude--you rocked in\nBoys and Girls.\" It always comes\nback to that fucking pie! I'm haunted\nby it.!\n\nJAMES\nWell, you put your dick in a pie,\ndude--\n\nJASON\nEnough!\n(to Jay)\nJason Biggs.\n\nJAY\nYo-you really get to third base with\nthe Russsian chick like you did in\nthe movies?\n\nJASON\nYou mean Shannon? Sadly, no.\n\nJAY\nShe's fucking hot, man. If I was\nyou, I'd been like--\n\nJay mimes a series of sexual maneuvers. Jason and James look\non, bewildered.\n\nJAY\n(off James's-look)\nWhat, man? You never did one of these?\n\nJay starts miming again, and suddenly stops, staring at James,\nblown away.\n\nJAY\nHoly shit? You're the Dawson!\n\nJAMES\nIt's James, actually. James Van Der\nBeek.\n\nJAY\nYo, what's up with Pacey stealing\nJoey away from you? If I was you, I\nwould've drowned his ass in your\nCreek and shit!\n\nJAMES\nI know, Because what--is Josh better\nlooking than me? Fuck, no. I mean,\nwho on earth is better looking that\nme? I ask you.\n\nJAY\nJoey, man! She's too fine! Yo--did\nyou ever get to third base with her?\n\nJAMES\nWell, there was this one time--\n(catching himself)\nWait a second--who are you guys?!\n\nJASON\nThey're our stunt doubles, dumbass.\n(to Jay)\nRight?\n\nJAY\nStunt doubles for what?\n\nJAMES\nThe movie we start shooting in a few\nminutes--Bluntman and Chronic Strike\nBack.\n\nJASON\n(to Bob)\nYou're doubling me. I'm playing\nBluntman, AKA Silent Bill.\n\nJAMES\nBob\n\nJASON\nRight. And he's playing Chronic. AKA\nRay.\n\nJAMES\nJay! Shit, did you even read the\nscript?\n\nJASON\nThere's a script?\n\nJay and Bob stare at them, blankly. Then Jay puts up his\nfinger, indicating they should wait a minute. He gets into a\nhuddle with Silent Bob and Suzanne.\n\nJAY\nThese are the guys who are playing\nus, yo. We take them out, and bickety-\nbam! No movie.\n\nSilent Bob nods at Jay, then Suzanne. Suzanne heads off,\nleaving Jay and Bob to huddle.\n\nJASON\n(off Jay and Bob, to\nJames)\nWhat's with the weird, gay huddle\ngoing on over there?\n\nJAMES\nWhat's gay about it? It's two guys\ntalking in a corner. Man--why are\nyou such a homophobe.\n\nJASON\nI'm not a homophobe.\n\nJAMES\nYou are. You're always calling things\ngay. \"Ooo--look at the gay huddle,\ndude!\"\n\nSuzanne approaches them.\n\nJASON\nHey--look at the monkey.\n\nJAMES\nNext you're going to tell me the\nmonkey's gay.\n\nJASON\nHe's so cute--\n(to Suzanne)\nC'mere. Monkey. C'mere--\n\nSuzanne pulls Jason and James out of the frame.\n\nWhile Jay and Silent Bob continue to huddle, the sounds of a\nbeating are heard, O.C.\n\nJAY\nAlright, here's what we do: start\nswinging, and don't stop until those\nyoung Hollywood fucks are out of\ncommission. Ready? Break!\n\nJay and Bob spin to face Jason and James--only to go wide-\neyed. Suzanne stands atop the fallen actors, who are bloodied\nand beaten and knocked out cold. She holds her hands skyward,\nclasped like a champion.\n\nJAY\nThat's one funky monkey.\n\nSuddenly there's a banging at the door of the dressing room.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nMister Biggs?  Mister Van... Der--\nBeek? This is Security. We've got a\npair of intruders at large, and they\ncrashed through a window we thought\nmight be yours.\n\nJAY\n(to door; deepening\nvoice)\nUh--yeah. They're in here.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nDo they have you hostage? Should we\ncall your publicists?\n\nJAY\nNO! I mean, we kicked those guys'\nasses bad. They're--knocked out.\n\nEXT. DRESSING ROOM--SAME\n\nThe Security Guards stand outside a door marked James.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nGreat work, sirs! If you let us in,\nwe'll take over--\n\nJAY (O.S.)\n(through door)\nNO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in\nhere! Together!\n\nThe Security guard look at one another.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nUh--okay. We'll just be--outside the\ndoor, sirs.\n\nThe Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job\nface to the rest.\n\nINT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY\n\nBob opens an AIR VENT in the wall. He puts Suzanne into it\nand hands her the tranquilizer gun, miming to her. She nods,\nand starts crawling through the ductwork, Bob closes the\nvent again, and starts rifling through a nearby closet.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck are we gonna do?! How\nare we gonna get out of here without\nthem seeing us?\n\nSilent Bob pulls a pair of hangered COSTUMES from the closet,\nsmiling.\n\nEXT. LOT--DAY\n\nThe Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a\nwaiting Cop Car. The pair are still dressed like Jay and\nSilent Bob.\n\nJAMES\nYOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS!\n\nJASON\nHEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M\nTHE PIE-FUCKER.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\n(to Cops)\nHe'll be the pie--in prison.\n\nINT. SOUNDSTAGE HALLWAY--DAY\n\nJay and Bob creep toward a door (we don't see the outfits).\n\nJAY\nThis was a good idea, Lunchbox. In\nthese outfits we're totally incognito.\n\nSuddenly, and A.D. appears, grabbing them by the shoulders.\n\nA.D.\nMister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek?\nGreat--you've changed costumes\nalready. Let's get you to set.\n(pulling them off)\nThe director doesn't like to be kept\nwaiting.\n\nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--BLUNTCAVE SET\n\nIt looks like the Batcave, but it's not. Off to the side,\nnear the monitor and chair setup, a black DIRECTOR eyeballs\nthe hustling, white crew.\n\nDIRECTOR\nLook at all these crackers, Seventy\nmillion dollars and I can't even get\na black grip?\n\nA white P.A. brings a cup of latte to the Director.\n\nP.A.\nHere's your coffee, sir.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(eyes the coffee)\nYou spit in this?  Because I know\nall you white folks are pissed off\nthat the studio'd entrust a multi-\nmillion dollar to a brother.\n\nP.A.\nI didn't spit in it, sir.\n\nDIRECTOR\nThen taste it! Go on!\n\nThe P.A. takes the cup and sips from it. He tries to hand it\nback to the Director.\n\nP.A.\nIt's all good, sir.\n\nDIRECTOR\nNo it ain't all good. Oh, you think\nI want it now, after your lips touched\nthe cup? Get the fuck off my set!\n\nP.A.\nYou the man, sir.\n\nDIRECTOR\nNo you the Man! And that's the\nproblem!\n\nThe Director glares at the scared P.A., as he cautiously\nskulks off. BANKY EDWARDS approaches.\n\nBANKY\nUh, Chaka? Yeah, hi--I'm Banky\nEdwards, the creator of Bluntman and\nChronic. We met a few weeks back.\nI'm the executive producer.\n\nDIRECTOR/CHAKA\nOh--you're the executive producer,\nhunh? Well go \"produce\" me a latte\nno white folks spit in--okay Fucky?\n\nBANKY\nBanky. I just wanted you to know\nthat I respect your work as an artist.\nI'm something of an artist myself. I\nwas the inker on the comic book.\n\nCHAKA\nAn inker? What, like you trace?\n\nBanky's face drops as the A.D. joins them.\n\nA.D.\nBiggs and Van Der Beek are on the\nset, Chaka.\n\nCHAKA\nI don't see 'em. Where are they?\n(into bullhorn)\nWHERE THE FUCK ARE THE STARS OF THIS\nPIECE OF SHIT?!\n\nOn the Bluntcave set, two massive doors open in the fake\nrock. Smoke pours in, and Jay and Silent Bob--now dressed as\nBLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC--step from the darkness. Jay and Bob\nsurvey the set, amazed.\n\nJAY\nThis must've set 'em back a couple\nhundred bucks.\n\nCHAKA\nLook at this shit.\n(off their outfits)\nA gay hood ornament, and the color\nPurple.\n\nJAY\nWho the fuck are you?\n\nCHAKA\nWho the fuck am I? I'm the fucking\ndirector, is who I am. Chaka Luther\nKing. The creator of all of this.\n\nJAY\nWait a sec--I thought Holden and\nBanky created this shit.\n\nCHAKA\nAnd I'm stealing it. I'm taking it\nback for all the shit you people\nhave stolen from us! Did you know, I\ncame up with the idea for Sesame\nStreet before PBS? I was going to\ncall it N.W.P.--Niggaz with Puppets.\n(beat)\nAlright--enough small talk. Let's\nshoot it.\n\nChaka heads back toward his monitor. Jay and Bob are confused.\n\nJAY\nWait, wait, wait!! Aren't you gonna\ndirect us?\n\nCHAKA\nI'll be directing you to the food\nstamps line after I fire your ass,\nif you talk back like that to me\nagain!\n\nJAY\nBut we don't know what we're supposed\nto do here. We didn't even read the\nscript.\n\nCHAKA\nSo? Neither did I. Shit, neither did\nthe studio.\n(pointing O.C.)\nLook man, it's not hard. In this\nscene, the bad guy breaks into the\nBluntcave.  You make up some shit,\nfight him for a while, I film it, I\nyell \"cut,\" and then head back to my\ntrailer, where I got more white women\nwaiting for me there than the first\nlifeboat off the Titanic!\n(confidentially)\nThey all want a part of the movie,\nand I got just the part for 'em.\n\nJay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed, as Chaka heads off.\n\nCHAKA\nLET'S ROLL WITH THE NEW!\n\nA.D. (O.S.)\nQUIET ON THE SET! THIS IS A TAKE!\n\nChaka climbs behind his monitor. The P.A. is waiting for him\nwith another cup of coffee.\n\nP.A.\nI got you another cup of coffee,\nsir. Spit free.\n\nChaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down.\n\nThe Clapper/Loader jumps in front of the startled Jay and\nBob, getting ready.  After a beat, he turns to Silent Bob.\n\nCLAPPER/LOADER\nI just wanna say that I loved when\nyou fucked that pie.\n(calling off)\nBLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC STRIKE BACK,\nSCENE THIRTY-SEVEN, TAKE ONE!\n\nThe clapper/Loader shuts the clapboard and races off. From\nbehind the monitor,\n\nChaka calls out--\n\nCHAKA\nACTION!\n\nJay and Bob (as Bluntman and Chronic) look at each other for\na beat. Then--\n\nJAY/CHRONIC\nUh--Snootchie Bootchies.\n\nSuddenly, the wall to their left explodes. Jay and Bob hit\nthe deck. Through the smoking rubble steps COCK-KNOCKER--the\narch--nemesis of Bluntman and Chronic.  He's a normal-looking\nman with huge, overgrown FISTS.\n\nJAY/CHRONIC\nWhat the fuck?\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\nYou thought I'd never find your\nprecious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp\nKnight? But now you and your sidekick\nare finally in the grasp of Cock-\nKnocker!\n\nJAY/CHRONIC\nWhy do they call you \"Cock-Knocker\"?\n\nCock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls.\nJay drops to his knees, wailing. Cock-Knocker then pulls a\nvibrator-looking device from his cape.  He presses a button\non it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a\nlight saber.\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\nAny last words before I bust your\nballs, Bluntman?\n\nSilent Bob quickly looks right, then left. His eyes fall on--\n\nA wall of armaments, on which hands a SILVER BONG, under the\nplacard: BONG SABER--EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE.\nIt's out of his reach.\n\nSilent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating. He reached his\nhand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick.\n\nSuddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip.\nThe Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive\npose. Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair\nstart light saber dueling.\n\nCHAKA\n(from behind monitor)\nDamn! Now that was one special effect!\nThis picture's gonna make House Party\nlook like House Party Two!\n\nA.D.\nOr House Party Three?\n\nCHAKA\nShut the fuck up!\n\nCock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive\nblade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the\nladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He\nlands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock-\nKnocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on\nhis ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver\na saber kill-shot, when we hear--\n\nJAY (O.S.)\nYO-BITCH-FISTS!\n\nCock-Knocker turns to see--\n\nJay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a\ndouble-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la\nthe Darth Maul light saber in Episode One).\n\nJAY\nCall me Darth Balls. Bunngg.\n\nJay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong\nSaber.\n\nCHAKA\n(from behind the\nmonitor)\nI think George Lucas is going to sue\nsomebody--\n\nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY\n\nWillenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a\nshotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside\nthe flashing red light.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(looking around)\nSo, this is Hollywood?\n(suddenly full of\npurpose)\nLights, camera, action, Jay and Silent\nBob.\n\nWillenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door.\n\nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY\n\nThe door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two\nshots, O.C.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nFREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!!\n\nWillenholly goes wide-eyed.\n\nIt's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a\nkid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a\nBarney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare\nback at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking\nbullet holes in it. Mooby collapses.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nOh my God--\n(to kids)\nUm--sorry. That was supposed to be a\nwarning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm\non the wrong, uh--wrong set.\n\nThe Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the\nO.C. Willenholly.\n\nKID\nYou killed Mooby--\n(to Kids)\nLET'S GET HIM!!!\n\nThe Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as\nhe's attacked.\n\nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME\n\nJay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle.\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\n(breaking character)\nYou are not upstaging me, Van Der\nBeek!\n\nJay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker,\nhacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear\nreactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade\nthe attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other\nhand.\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\n(to O.C. Chaka)\nCHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A\n\"CUT\"!\n\nOn cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's\nhuge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire).\n\nSilent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber,\nJay grins at Cock-Knocker.\n\nJAY\nNow whose balls have been busted,\nbitch?\n\nSuddenly, a gun shot rings out.\n\nAll turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun\nfirst on Jay, then Bob.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nThe C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and\nSilent Bob!\n(revealing badge:\ncalling out)\nEveryone stay calm. I'm a Federal\nWildlife Marshal. These men are the\nleaders of a terrorist organization\nwanted for the abduction of a monkey.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nThey didn't really steal that monkey.\n\nAll turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows.\nWillenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops.\n\nJUSTICE\nIt was just a diversion so we could\nsteal these.\n\nJustice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing\nthem.\n\nJUSTICE\nAnd they're not the leaders of\nC.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nNo--the clit's real. The female orgasm\nis a myth.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Jay)\nAre you guys alright?\n\nJAY\nI thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty\nFuck.\n\nJUSTICE\n(smiling)\nYou remembered.\n(back to business)\nIt was a frame-up, Jay. Sissy. Missy,\nChrissy, and I are international\njewel thieves. We were setting you\nup as a patsy, but I couldn't go\nthrough with it, because I... because\nI love you.\n\nJAY\nYeah? So that means you'll fuck me,\nright?\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nIf she does, it'll be considered\nnecrophilia.\n\nAll turn to see Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy slinking from the\nshadows, guns drawn.\n\nSISSY\nBecause she's gonna be one dead bitch.\n(to Justice)\nHi, Jussy. We catch you at a bad\ntime?\n\nMISSY\nYou should've just let these guys go\ndown, Jussy.\n\nJAY\nHey, I wanted to go down, but I was\nwaiting until I got to know her a\nlittle better. See, there was this\nlittle angel on my shoulder, and he\nsaid--\n\nCHRISSY\nShut the fuck up before I shoot you\nwhere you stand in your pansy red\nbooties.\n\nJAY\n(looking down)\nHoly shit, I am wearing pansy red\nbooties!\n(to Bob)\nMan--why the fuck didn't you tell\nme?\n\nSISSY\nLet's have those diamonds, Jussy.\n\nJUSTICE\nI can't do that, Sissy\n\nSISSY\n(points her gun at\nJay)\nThen lover--boy gets one in the brain.\n\nCHAKA\nYO!\n\nAll turn to look at Chaka.\n\nCHAKA\nWould any of you lovely ladies like\na private audition to be in my movie?\n\nJustice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand. It lands on\nthe ground discharging. Then everyone starts shooting and\nrunning for cover.\n\nJay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile.\n\nMissy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed\ncraft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start\nfiring at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren\ncraft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented\ncan of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are\nout of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and\nreload. From behind his table,\n\nWillenholly yells--\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME?!?! I'M\nJUST A FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL!!!\n\nCHRISSY\nTWO REASONS: ONE--WE'RE WALKING,\nTALKING BAD GIRLS, CLICHES!\n\nMISSY\nAND TWO: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nONLY ON THE OUTSIDE!\n\nThe Girls and Willenholly both pop back up and open fire\nagain.\n\nChaka ducks behind the monitor.\n\nCHAKA\nA shitload of white people with guns?\nTime to get my black ass out of here!\n\nHe races off, passing Justice and Sissy, who circle each\nother defensively, striking kung fu poses.\n\nSISSY\nYou really let me down, Justice.\nThrowing it all away for a little\nstoner with bad pronunciation.\n\nJAY (O.S.)\nHEY!\n\nJUSTICE\n(ignoring him)\nWhat's it gonna be, Sissy? Which\nfighting style do you want me to\nkick your ass in?\n\nSISSY\nAre you kidding me? I taught you all\nall your moves myself. There's not a\nstyle you can bust that I can't defend\nagainst.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou're no match for my \"Shaolin Monk.\"\n\nSISSY\nYeah, but I can bury you with my\n\"Crouching Tiger.\"\n\nJUSTICE\nA little \"Venus's--flytrap\"?\n\nSISSY\nI'll counter with \"Dragon Crane.\"\n\nJUSTICE\nHow about a little \"Bitch, My Man\nAin't Yo Baby's Daddy\"?\n\nSISSY\n(beat; smiles)\nBring it on.\n\nJustice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch\ninto a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and\nscreaming.\n\nBehind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action.\n\nJAY\nYo--I hope one of 'em rips the other\none's shirt off and we see some tit.\n\nBoth Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding. Banky joins\nthem, crawling in on his belly, covering his head.\n\nBANKY\nMister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I\njust wanted to say hi. I'm--\n\nJAY\nBanky fucking Edwards! Just the\nmotherfucker we came to see!\n\nBANKY\n(shocked)\nHoly shit! What the fuck are you\nguys doing here?!\n\nSissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the\nfloor, screeching.  Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.\n\nBANKY\nStop the movie?! Are you crazy?!\n\nJAY\nAll these assholes are calling us\nnames on the Internet, 'cause of\nthis stupid movie!\n\nBANKY\nI feel for you boys--I really do.\nThose Net snipers can be really cruel.\nBut Miramax paid me a shitload of\nmoney for Bluntman and Chronic, so\nit occurs to me that people bad-\nmouthing you on some web-site is\nnone of my FUCKING CONCERN!\n\nSILENT BOB\nOh--but I think it is.\n\nBanky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes.\n\nJAY\nHere we go again--\n\nSILENT BOB\nShut the fuck up.\n(to Banky)\nWe had a deal with you on the comics\nfor likeness rights. And as we're\nnot only the artistic basis but also\nthe character basis for your\nintellectual property, Bluntman and\nChronic, when we said property was\noptioned by Miramax Films you were\nlegally obliged to secure our\npermission to transfer the concept\nto another medium. As you failed to\ndo that, you're in breach of the\noriginal contract--ergo, you find\nyourself in a very actionable\nposition.\n\nBanky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a\nbeat, Jay adds--\n\nJAY\nYeah.\n\nJustice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head\nand kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.\n\nBANKY\nSo, what do you guys want, to go\naway and take your lady friends with\nyou?\n\nJAY\nShitcan this movie so we don't get\ncalled names on the Internet anymore.\n\nBANKY\nEven if there's no movie, people are\nstill free to talk shit about you on\nthe Internet. That's what the\nInternet's for: slandering others\nanonymously.  Stopping the flick\nisn't going to stop that!\n\nIn the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the\nair.\n\nJAY\nWell this isn't fair!  We went to\nHollywood, I fell in love, we stole\na monkey, we got shot at, and got\npunched in the motherfucking nuts!\nWe ain't leaving empty-handed!\n\nOn cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap.\n\nJAY\nWhat's up baby? You look good!\n\nBANKY\nIsn't that your girlfriend's enemy?\n\nJAY\nOh yeah.\n(pushing Sissy off\nhim)\nGet the fuck offa me, pig!\n\nSissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair.\n\nJay, Bob, and Banky continue.\n\nBANKY\nYou guys are gonna ruin my movie\ncareer.\n\nJAY\nWell, we want something for our mental\nanguish.\n\nBANKY\nTell you what: we'll settle this\nmonetarily. I'll give you half of\nwhat I made.\n\nJAY\nHalf?!?\n\nBANKY\nHalf's not good enough?  Fine--I'll\ngive you two-thirds of what I made!\n\nJAY\nFuck-you--you already said half? You\ncan't take it back!\n\nSilent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand.\n\nBANKY\nDone\n\nJustice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing\neach other.\n\nSISSY\nYour shit is so tired, Justice!\n\nJUSTICE\nCall me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH!\n\nJustice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage.\n\nSissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop\nMissy and Chrissy, knocking them out.\n\nWillenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nHello? Truce?\n(beat)\nI think I killed both of them.\n\nSuddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing\na tranquilizer dart in his ass, and SUZANNE standing behind\nhim, holding the gun up in the air.  Justice surveys her\nhandiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the Bluntmobile.\n\nJUSTICE\nC'mon guys. It's over.\n\nJay, Bob, and Banky pop up from behind the car and join her.\n\nJAY\nYo, I was just about to jump in there\nand get your back.\n\nThen, the SOUND of SIRENS rings out in the distance.\n\nJAY\nHoly shit, the cops! We gotta get\nout of here!\n\nJUSTICE\nNo. I'm tired of running.\n\nJustice lifts Willenholly into a sitting position and taps\nhis face.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou awake, Marshal? Marshal?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(tries to move but\ncan't)\nOh my God, I'm paralyzed. The monkey\nshot me in the ass and paralyzed me!\nOh the irony!\n\nJUSTICE\n(off Suzanne's gun)\nYou're not paralyzed. It was just a\ntranquilizer.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nJesus! Tranqued by a little monkey!\nMy friends in the Bureau are never\ngonna let me live this down!\n\nJUSTICE\nYou have friends in the F.B.I.?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(crying)\nThey all made it in, but I failed\nthe exam. Why the hell else do you\nthink I became a Federal Wildlife\nMarshal? 'Cause I'm a joke!\n\nJustice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking.\nThen--\n\nJUSTICE\nMaybe not. I can make you a deal\nthat'll get you into the F.B.I.,\nregardless of test scores.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWhat kind of deal?\n\nJUSTICE\nYou drop the charges against Jay and\nSilent Bob and say you never found\nthe ape.  Make sure the world knows\nthey're not in control of any C.L.I.T.\n\nJAY\nNow wait a second--\n\nJUSTICE\nI'll explain later, Jay\n(to Willenholly)\nIn exchange, I'll give you the\ndiamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy,\nMissy, Chrissy, and myself. But I\nwant a reduced sentence.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nYou'd be willing to do that?\n\nJUSTICE\n(off Jay)\nFor him? I'd be willing to do\nanything.\n\nJustice stands and takes Jay by the hands.\n\nJUSTICE\nI'm an international jewel thief\nwho's facing a jail sentence.\n\nJAY\nThat's alright. I'm a junkie with a\nmonkey.\n\nJUSTICE\nIf I go to prison, will you wait for\nme?\n\nJAY\nI don't know. Will we fuck when you\nget out?\n\nJustice smiles and kisses Jay Passionately. The kiss should\nsay it all, but--\n\nJAY\nDon't change the subject. Will we\nfuck when you get out?\n\nJUSTICE\nSnoogans.\n\nJustice and Jay kiss again.\n\nSuzanne reached up to Silent Bob, who picks her up. She grabs\nhis face and kisses him.\n\nWillenholly looks to Banky.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWow. There's a lot of love in the\nroom.\n\nBANKY\nRegardless of what you may have heard.\nI do not kiss guys.\n\nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE--LATER\n\nJustice and Jay are still kissing, until Willenholly pulls\nher away and loads her into the waiting Cop Car.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nSorry, Justice. We've gotta go.\n(to Jay: friendly)\nHey--stop stealing monkeys.\n\nJAY\nFuck you.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nFair enough.\n\nWillenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the\ncar.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Jay)\nWait for me.\n\nJAY\nWhat--here?\n\nJay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away,\nleaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky. They start walking\ndown the lot.\n\nBANKY\nWell, boys--you're rich in love--\n(indicating Jay)\nWell, you're in love. And to top\nthat off, you've got your own monkey.\nWhat more could two guys from Jersey\npossibly want?\n\nJAY\nAll those fucks to stop talking shit\nabout us on the Internet, for\nstarters.\n\nBANKY\nWhat do I keep telling you? There's\nnot much you can do to stop that.\nWell, short of showing up at all\ntheir houses and beating the shit\nout of them, I guess.\n\nJay and Bob suddenly freeze. They look at each other and\nsmile.\n\nJAY\n(to Bob)\nYou know--with all that money we're\ngonna make we can buy a lotta plane\ntickets.\n\nSTART THE JAY AND BOB KICKASS MONTAGE\n\nEXT. SKY--DAY\n\nA passenger JET flies through the sky.\n\nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET--DAY\n\nJay and Bob stand across the street from a house. They check\nthe address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod\nat each other, and cross the street.\n\nINT. HOUSE--DAY\n\nThe doorbell rings. A MOTHER answers it to see Jay and Silent\nBob standing in the doorway.\n\nMOTHER\nCan I help you?\n\nJAY\nYes. Ma'am, Does--\n(reading of paper)\nWilliam Dusky live here?\n\nMOTHER\nYes. He's my son.\n\nJAY\nMay we talk to him, please.\n\nMOTHER\nOne moment.\n\nShe walks away. After a beat, a fifteen-year-old KID comes\nto the door.\n\nKID\nYeah?\n\nJAY\nYo--do you post as--\n(reading off paper)\nMagnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot.com?\n\nKID\nYeah.\n\nJAY\nAnd did you write \"Fuck Jay and Silent\nBob. Fuck them up their stupid asses?\n\nKID\nYeah, a while ago. So?\n\nJay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the KID, pull him\noutside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front\nlawn.\n\nEXT. SKY--DAY\n\nThe passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite\ndirection.\n\nEXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE--DAY\n\nJay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers.\nThey speak, she heads inside, and another KID comes to the\ndoor.\n\nJAY\nOn Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say\nJay and Silent Bob--\n(reading off paper)\n\"--are fucking clown shoes. If they\nwere real, I'd beat the shit out of\nthem for being so stupid.\"\n\nKID\n(chuckling)\nYeah.\n\nJAY\nReally--\n\nAgain, Jay and Bob pull the Kid outside and beat the shit\nout of him.\n\nINT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY\n\nJay and Bob beat the shit out of a CLERK.\n\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY--DAY\n\nJay and Bob beat the shit out of a WOMAN.\n\nEXT. RECTORY--DAY\n\nJay and Bob beat the shit out of a PRIEST.\n\nINT. OFFICE--DAY\n\nJay and Bob beat the shit out of a BUSINESSMAN.\n\nEXT. MOVIE THEATRE--NIGHT\n\nThe marquee reads: JASON BIGGS AND JAMES VAN DER BEEK ARE\nBLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC!\n\nWORLD PREMIERE!\n\nThe front doors open and the CROWD lets out. First we see\nDANTE and RANDAL.\n\nRANDAL\nNow that was worse then Clash of the\nTitans.\n\nDANTE\nI still can't believe Judy Dench\nplayed me.\n\nRANDAL\nHey--remind me to renew that\nrestraining order.\n\nDANTE\nWhy?\n\nRANDAL\nBecause I'm gonna blast the flick on\nthe Internet tonight.\n\nSTEVE-DAVE and WALT exit.\n\nSTEVE-DAVE\nWhy can't Hollywood ever make a decent\ncomic book movie?\n\nWALT\nTell'em Steve-Dave!\n\nSTEVE-DAVE\nWould you stop saying that?\n\nALYSSA and TRISH come out.\n\nTRISH\nWell, that was just another paean to\nmale adolescence and its refusal to\ngrow up.\n\nALYSSA\nYeah, sis--but it was better than\nMallrats. At least Holden had the\ngood sense to keep his name off of\nit.\n\nTRISH\nWhy wouldn't Miramax option his other\ncomic instead? You know--the one he\ndrew about you and him and your\nrelationship?\n\nALYSSA\nYou mean Chasing Amy? That would\nnever work as a movie.\n\nBANKY and HOOPER exit.\n\nBANKY\nI'm so fucking embarrassed--\n\nHOOPER\nHoney, you should be. They took your\ncharacters and reduced them to one\nninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was\nlike watching Batman and Robin again.\n\nBANKY\nThanks. That means a lot coming from\nthe guy who pretends to be Shaft as\nopposed to the guy who takes shaft.\n\nHOOPER\nI don't hear you complaining nightly.\nIn fact, the only thing I do hear\nyou say is \"Yes, Hooper! Cradle the\nballs and work the shaft!\"\n\nBANKY\n(looking around)\nHey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in\npublic!\n\nA guy behind them calls out to Banks.\n\nGUY\nNice movie, you fucking Tracer!\n\nBANKY\n(recognizing him)\nYou--!\n\nGUY\nThat's right, you sonovabitch! I'm\nback for round two!\n\nBanky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him,\nwhile Hooper tries to break them up.\n\nWILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a\nprison uniform.  They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nYou know, I don't get out to the\nmovies much. But I'd have to say\nBluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!\n\nJUSTICE\nAre these leg cuffs really necessary?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nDon't make me shoot you, Justice.\n\nAnd finally, Jay and Silent Bob come out.\n\nJAY\nYO! THE PARTY'S ACROSS THE STREET,\nFEATURING THE GREATEST BAND IN THE\nWORLD: MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME!!!\n\nWHIP PAN to Morris day and The Time on stage, performing\n\"The Bird.\" During the song, Morris points to--\n\nJay and Bob, who are dancing with Suzanne and Justice (who's\nstill in cuffs, flanked by the Guards). Jay looks to Bob,\nthey nod at each other and--\n\nJay and Silent Bob, join Morris Day and the TIME onstage,\nand dance us out to the coda, which reads--\n\nCODA\n\nBluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3\nmillion at the box office. It was the biggest commercial\nfailure in the history of Miramax films.  The film was roundly\ndrubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat\nboards, and over the course of the next year, while they\nwaited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay\nand Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out\nof them.\n\nCREDITS. THEN--\n\nINT. NOWHERE\n\nA familiar WOMAN closes a book that's marked: THE VIEW\nASKEWNIVERSE.

knees\nGet the cards on the table\nNo need to pretend\nYou've got to be cruel to be kind\nHe can sell you his love and you know, you will pay but\n\n[Chorus]\nHe's a liar\nHe's a liar, and I should know!\nLiar\nHe's a liar, and I should know, ahh!\n[Verse 2]\nWell, they told me I fell but I just don't remember\nI was standing face down, they were there at my feet\nThere was smoke in the air and the sweet smell of leather\nI was through the window and down in the street\nWell, I'm cold and I'm hungry but I'm still alive\nAnd it's not how I want it to be\nThere's a hand on my shoulder\nHe said I'll survive but\n\n[Chorus]\nHe's a liar\nHe's a liar, and I should know!\nHe's a liar\nHe's a liar, and I should know, ahh!\n\n[Release]\nWas it not for the man that was blocking the drive\nWas it

somehow, half sit down\nWithout help, make shift to even speak, you see,\nFortified by the sip of...why, 'tis wine,\nVelletri,--and not vinegar and gall,\nSo changed and good the times grow! Thanks, kind Sir!\nOh, but one sip's enough! I want my head\nTo save my neck, there's work awaits me still.\nHow cautious and considerate...aie, aie, aie,\nNot your fault, sweet Sir! Come, you take to heart\nAn ordinary matter. Law is law.\nNoblemen were exempt, the vulgar thought,\nFrom racking, but, since law thinks otherwise,\nI have been put to the rack: all's over now,\nAnd neither wrist--what men style, out of joint:\nIf any harm be, 'tis the shoulder-blade,\nThe left one, that seems wrong i' the socket,--Sirs,\nMuch could not happen, I was quick to faint,\nBeing past my prime of life, and out of health.\nIn short I thank you,--yes, and mean the word.\nNeeds must the Court be slow to understand\nHow this quite novel form of taking pain,\nThis getting tortured merely in the flesh,\nAmounts to almost an agreeable change\nIn my case, me fastidious, plied too much\nWith opposite treatment, used (forgive the joke)\nTo the rasp-tooth toying with this brain of mine,\nAnd, in and out my heart, the play o' the probe.\nFour years have I been operated on\nI' the soul, do you see--its tense or tremulous part--\nMy self-respect, my care for a good name,\nPride in an old one, love of kindred--just\nA mother, brothers, sisters, and the like,\nThat looked up to my face when days were dim,\nAnd fancied they found light there--no one spot,\nFoppishly sensitive, but has paid its pang.\nThat, and not this you now oblige me with,\nThat was the Vigil-torment, if you please!\nThe poor old noble House that drew the rags\nO' the Franceschini's once superb array\nClose round her, hoped to slink unchallenged by,--\nPluck off these! Turn the drapery inside out\nAnd teach the tittering town how scarlet wears!\nShow men the lucklessness, the improvidence\nOf the easy-natured Count before this Count,\nThe father I have some slight feeling for,\nWho let the world slide, nor foresaw that friends\nThen proud to cap and kiss the patron's shoe,\nWould, when the purse he left held spider-webs,\nProperly push his child to wall one day!\nMimic the tetchy humour, furtive glance\nAnd brow where half was furious half fatigued,\nO' the same son got to be of middle age,\nSour, saturnine,--your humble servant here;--\nWhen things go cross and the young wife, he finds\nTake to the window at a whistle's bid,\nAnd yet demurs thereon, preposterous fool!--\nWhereat the worthies judge he wants advice\nAnd beg to civilly ask what's evil here,\nPerhaps remonstrate on the habit they deem\nHe's given unduly to, of beating her\n? Oh, sure he beats her--why says John so else,\nWho is cousin to George who is sib to Tecla's self\nWho cooks the meal and combs the lady's hair?\nWhat? 'Tis my wrist you merely dislocate\nFor the future when you mean me martyrdom?\n--Let the old mother's economy alone,\nHow the brocade-strips saved o' the seamy side\nO' the wedding-gown buy raiment for a year?\n--How she can dress and dish up--lordly dish\nFit for a duke, lamb's head and purtenance--\nWith her proud hands, feast household so a week?\nNo word o' the wine rejoicing God and man\nThe less when three-parts water? Then, I say,\nA trifle of torture to the flesh, like yours,\nWhile soul is spared such foretaste of hell-fire,\nIs naught. But I curtail the catalogue\nThrough policy,--a rhetorician's trick,--\nBecause I would reserve some choicer points\nO' the practice, more exactly parallel--\n(Having an eye to climax) with what gift,\nEventual grace the Court may have in store\nI' the way of plague--my crown of punishments.\nWhen I am hanged or headed, time enough\nTo prove the tenderness of only that,\nMere heading, hanging,--not their counterpart,\nNot demonstration public and precise\nThat I, having married the mongrel of a drab,\nAm bound to grant that mongrel-brat, my wife,\nHer mother's birthright-licence as is just,--\nLet her sleep undisturbed, i' the family style,\nHer sleep out in the embraces of a priest,\nNor disallow their bastard as my heir!\nYour sole mistake,--dare I submit so much\nTo the reverend Court?--has been in all this pains\nTo make a stone roll down hill,--rack and wrench\nAnd rend a man to pieces, all for what?\nWhy--make him ope mouth in his own defence,\nShow cause for what he has done, the irregular deed,\n(Since that he did it, scarce dispute can be)\nAnd clear his fame a little, beside the luck\nOf stopping even yet, if possible,\nDiscomfort to his flesh from noose or axe--\nFor that, out come the implements of law!\nMay it content my lords the gracious Court\nTo listen only half so patient-long\nAs I will in that sense profusely speak,\nAnd--fie, they shall not call in screws to help!\nI killed Pompilia Franceschini, Sirs;\nKilled too the Comparini, husband, wife,\nWho called themselves, by a notorious lie,\nHer father and her mother to ruin me.\nThere's the irregular deed: you want no more\nThan right interpretation of the same,\nAnd truth so far--am I to understand?\nTo that then, with convenient speed,--because\nNow I consider,--yes, despite my boast,\nThere is an ailing in this omoplat\nMay clip my speech all too abruptly close,\nWhatever the good-will in me. Now for truth!\nI' the name of the indivisible Trinity!\nWill my lords, in the plentitude of their light,\nWeigh well that all this trouble has come on me\nThrough my persistent treading in the paths\nWhere I was trained to go,--wearing that yoke\nMy shoulder was predestined to receive,\nBorn to the hereditary stoop and crease?\nNoble, I recognised my nobler still,\nThe church, my suzerain; no mock-mistress, she;\nThe secular owned the spiritual: mates of mine\nHave thrown their careless hoofs up at her call\n\"Forsake the clover and come drag my wain!\"\nThere they go cropping: I protruded nose\nTo halter, bent my back of docile beast,\nAnd now am whealed, one wide wound all of me,\nFor being found at the eleventh hour o' the day\nPadding the mill-track, not neck-deep in grass:\n--My one fault, I am stiffened by my work,\n--My one reward, I help the Court to smile!\nI am representative of a great line,\nOne of the first of the old families\nIn Arezzo, ancientest of Tuscan towns.\nWhen my worst foe is fain to challenge this,\nHis worst exception runs--not first in rank\nBut second, noble in the next degree\nOnly; not malice 'self maligns me more.\nSo, my lord opposite has composed, we know,\nA marvel of a book, sustains the point\nThat Francis boasts the primacy 'mid saints;\nYet not inaptly hath his argument\nObtained response from yon my other lord\nIn thesis published with the world's applause\n--Rather 'tis Dominic such post befits:\nWhy, at the worst, Francis stays Francis still,\nSecond in rank to Dominic it may be,\nStill, very saintly, very like our Lord;\nAnd I at least descend from a Guido once\nHomager to the Empire, nought below--\nOf which account as proof that, none o' the line\nHaving a single gift beyond brave blood,\nOr able to do aught but give, give, give\nIn blood and brain, in house and land and cash,\nNot get and garner as the vulgar may,\nWe become poor as Francis or our Lord.\nBe that as it likes you, Sirs,--whenever it chanced\nMyself grew capable anyway of remark,\n(Which was soon--penury makes wit premature)\nThis struck me, I was poor who should be rich\nOr pay that fault to the world which trifles not\nWhen lineage lacks the flag yet lifts the pole:\nTherefore I must make more forthwith, transfer\nMy stranded self, born fish with gill and fin\nFit for the deep sea, now left bare-backed\nIn slush and sand, a show to crawlers vile\nReared of the low-tide and aright therein.\nThe enviable youth with the old name,\nWide chest, stout arms, sound brow and pricking veins,\nA heartful of desire, man's natural load,\nA brainful of belief, the noble's lot,--\nAll this life, cramped and gasping, high and dry\nI' the wave's retreat,--the misery, good my lords,\nWhich made you merriment at Rome of late,--\nIt made me reason, rather--muse, demand\n--Why our bare dropping palace, in the street\nWhere such-an-one whose grandfather sold tripe\nWas adding to his purchased pile a fourth\nTall tower, could hardly show a turret sound?\nWhy Beatrice Countess, whose son I am,\nCowered in the winter-time as she spun flax,\nBlew on the earthen basket of live ash.\nInstead of jaunting forth in coach and six\nLike such-another widow who ne'er was wed?\nI asked my fellows, how came this about?\n\"Why, Jack, the suttler's child, perhaps the camp's,\n\"Went to the wars, fought sturdily, took a town\n\"And got rewarded as was natural.\n\"She of the coach and six--excuse me there!\n\"Why, don't you know the story of her friend?\n\"A clown dressed vines on somebody's estate,\n\"His boy recoiled from muck, liked Latin more,\n\"Stuck to his pen, and got to be a priest,\n\"Till one day...don't you mind that telling tract\n\"Against Molinos, the old Cardinal wrote?\n\"He penned and dropped it in the patron's desk\n\"Who, deep in thought and absent much of mind,\n\"Licensed the thing, allowed it for his own;\n\"Quick came promotion,--suum cuique, Count!\n\"Oh, he can pay for coach and six, be sure!\"\n\"--Well, let me go, do likewise: war's the word--\n\"That way the Franceschini worked at first,\n\"I'll take my turn, try soldiership.\"--\"What, you?\n\"The eldest son and heir and prop o' the house,\n\"So do you see your duty?

Try the Church,\n\"The tonsure, and,--since heresy's but half-slain\n\"Even by the Cardinal's tract he thought he wrote,--\n\"Have at Molinos!\"--\"Have at a fool's head!\n\"You a priest? How were marriage possible?\n\"There must be Franceschini till time ends--\n\"That's your vocation. Make your brothers priests,\n\"Paul shall be porporate, and Girolamo step\n\"Red-stockinged in the presence when you choose,\n\"But save one Franceschini for the age!\n\"Be not the vine but dig and dung its root,\n\"Be not a priest but gird up priesthood's loins,\n\"With one foot in Arezzo stride to Rome,\n\"Spend yourself there and bring the purchase back!\n\"Go hence to Rome, be guided!\"\nSo I was.\nI turned alike from the hill-side zig-zag thread\nOf way to the table-land a soldier takes,\nAlike from the low-lying pasture-place\nWhere churchmen graze, recline, and ruminate,\n--Ventured to mount no platform like my lords\nWho judge the world, bear brain I dare not brag--\nBut stationed me, might thus the expression serve,\nAs who should fetch and carry, come and go,\nMeddle and make i' the cause my lords love most--\nThe public weal, which hangs to the law, which holds\nBy the Church, which happens to be through God himself.\nHumbly I helped the Church till here I stand,--\nOr would stand but for the omoplat, you see!\nBidden qualify for Rome, I, having a field,\nWent, sold it, laid the sum at Peter's foot:\nWhich means--I settled home-accounts with speed,\nSet apart just a modicum should suffice\nTo keep the villa's head above the waves\nOf weed inundating its oil and wine,\nAnd prop roof, stanchion wall o' the palace so\nIt should keep breath i' the body, hold its own\nAmid the advance of neighbouring loftiness--\n(People like building where they used to beg)--\nTill succoured one day,--shared the residue\nBetween my mother and brothers and sisters there,\nBlack-eyed babe Donna This and Donna That,\nAs near to starving as might decently be,\n--Left myself journey-charges, change of suit,\nA purse to put i' the pocket of the Groom\nO' the Chamber of the patron, and a glove\nWith a ring to it for the digits of the niece\nSure to be helpful in his household,--then\nStarted for Rome, and led the life prescribed.\nClose to the Church, though clean of it, I assumed\nThree or four orders of no consequence,\nThey cast out evil spirits and exorcise,\nFor example; bind a man to nothing more,\nGive clerical savour to his layman's-salt,\nFacilitate his claim to loaf and fish\nShould miracle leave, beyond what feeds the flock,\nFragments to brim the basket of a friend--\nWhile, for the world's sake, I rode, danced, and gamed,\nQuitted me like a courtier, measured mine\nWith whatsoever blade had fame in fence,\n--Ready to let the basket go its round\nEven though my turn was come to help myself,\nShould Dives count on me at dinner-time\nAs just the understander of a joke\nAnd not immoderate in repartee.\nUtrique sic paratus, Sirs, I said\n\"Here,\" (in the fortitude of years fifteen,\nSo good a pedagogue is penury)\n\"Here wait, do service,--serving and to serve!\n\"And, in due time, I nowise doubt at all,\n\"The recognition of my service comes.\n\"Next year I'm only sixteen. I can wait.\"\nI waited thirty years, may it please the Court:\nSaw meanwhile many a denizen o' the dung\nHop, skip, jump o'er my shoulder, make him wings\nAnd fly aloft,--succeed, in the usual phrase.\nEvery one soon or late comes round by Rome:\nStand still here, you'll see all in turn succeed.\nWhy, look you, so and so, the physician here,\nMy father's lacquey's son we sent to school,\nDoctored and dosed this Eminence and that,\nSalved the last Pope his certain obstinate sore,\nSoon bought land as became him, names it now:\nI grasp bell at his griffin-guarded gate,\nTraverse the half-mile avenue,--a term,\nA cypress, and a statue, three and three,--\nDeliver message from my Monsignor,\nWith varletry at lounge i' the vestibule\nI'm barred from, who bear mud upon my shoe.\nMy father's chaplain's nephew, Chamberlain,--\nNothing less, please you!--courteous all the same,\n--He does not see me though I wait an hour\nAt his staircase-landing 'twixt the brace of busts,\nA noseless Sylla, Marius maimed to match,\nMy father gave him for a hexastich\nMade on my birth-day,--but he sends me down,\nTo make amends, that relic I prize most--\nThe unburnt end o' the very candle, Sirs,\nPurfled with paint so prettily round and round,\nHe carried in such state last Peter's day,--\nIn token I, his gentleman and squire,\nHad held the bridle, walked his managed mule\nWithout a tittup the procession through.\nNay, the official,--one you know, sweet lords!--\nWho drew the warrant for my transfer late\nTo the New Prisons from Tordinona,--he\nGraciously had remembrance--\"Francesc...ha?\n\"His sire, now--how a thing shall come about!--\n\"Paid me a dozen florins above the fee,\n\"For drawing deftly up a deed of sale\n\"When troubles fell so thick on him, good heart,\n\"And I was prompt and pushing!

Brief, one day I felt\nThe tick of time inside me, turning-point\nAnd slight sense there was now enough of this:\nThat I was near my seventh climacteric,\nHard upon, if not over, the middle life,\nAnd, although fed by the east-wind, fulsome-fine\nWith foretaste of the Land of Promise, still\nMy gorge gave symptom it might play me false;\nBetter not press it further,--be content\nWith living and dying only a nobleman,\nWho merely had a father great and rich,\nWho simply had one greater and richer yet,\nAnd so on back and back till first and best\nBegan i' the night; I finish in the day.\n\"The mother must be getting old,\" I said,\n\"The sisters are well wedded away, our name\n\"Can manage to pass a sister off, at need,\n\"And do for dowry: both my brothers thrive--\n\"Regular priests they are, nor, hat-like, 'bide\n\"'Twixt flesh and fowl with neither privilege.\n\"My spare revenue must keep me and mine.\n\"I am tired: Arezzo's air is good to breathe;\n\"Vittiano,--one limes flocks of thrushes there;\n\"A leathern coat costs little and lasts long:\n\"Let me bid hope good-bye, content at home!\"\nThus, one day, I disbosomed me and bowed.\nWhereat began the little buzz and thrill\nO' the gazers round me; each face brightened up:\nAs when at your Casino, deep in dawn,\nA gamester says at last, \"I play no more,\n\"Forego gain, acquiesce in loss, withdraw\n\"Anyhow:\" and the watchers of his ways,\nA trifle struck compunctious at the word,\nYet sensible of relief, breathe free once more,\nBreak up the ring, venture polite advice--\n\"How, Sir? So scant of heart and hope indeed?\n\"Retire with neither cross nor pile from play?--\n\"So incurious, so short-casting?--give your chance\n\"To a younger, stronger, bolder spirit belike,\n\"Just when luck turns and the fine throw sweeps all?\"\nSuch was the chorus: and its good will meant--\n\"See that the loser leave door handsomely!\n\"There's an ill look,--it's sinister, spoils sport,\n\"When an old bruised and battered year-by-year\n\"Fighter with fortune, not a penny in poke,\n\"Reels down the steps of our establishment\n\"And staggers on broad daylight and the world,\n\"In shagrag beard and doleful doublet, drops\n\"And breaks his heart on the outside: people prate\n\"'Such is the profit of a trip upstairs!'\n\"Contrive he sidle forth, baulked of the blow\n\"Best dealt by way of moral, bidding down\n\"No curse but blessings rather on our heads\n\"For some poor prize he bears at tattered breast,\n\"Some palpable sort of kind of good to set\n\"Over and against the grievance: give him quick!\"\nWhereon protested Paul, \"Go hang yourselves!\n\"Leave him to me.

He proposed all, I accepted all,\nAnd we performed all. So I said and did\nSimply.

First the lighter side,\nLudicrous face of things,--how very poor\nThe Franceschini had become at last,\nThe meanness and the misery of each shift\nTo save a soldo, stretch and make ends meet.\nNext, the more hateful aspect,--how myself\nWith cruelty beyond Caligula's\nHad stripped and beaten, robbed and murdered them.\nThe good old couple, I decoyed, abused,\nPlundered and then cast out, and happily so,\nSince,--in due course the abominable comes,--\nWoe worth the poor young wife left lonely here!\nRepugnant in my person as my mind,\nI sought,--was ever heard of such revenge?\n--To lure and bind her to so cursed a couch,\nSuch co-embrace with sulphur, snake and toad,\nThat she was fain to rush forth, call the stones\nO' the common street to save her, not from hate\nOf mine merely, but...must I burn my lips\nWith the blister of the lie?...the satyr-love\nOf who but my own brother, the young priest,\nToo long enforced to lenten fare belike,\nNow tempted by the morsel tossed him full\nI' the trencher where lay bread and herbs at best.\nMark, this yourselves say!--this, none disallows,\nWas charged to me by the universal voice\nAt the instigation of my four-months' wife!--\nAnd then you ask \"Such charges so preferred,\n\"(Truly or falsely, here concerns us not)\n\"Pricked you to punish now if not before?--\n\"Did not the harshness double itself, the hate\n\"Harden?\" I answer \"Have it your way and will!\"\nSay my resentment grew apace: what then?\nDo you cry out on the marvel? When I find\nThat pure smooth egg which, laid within my nest,\nCould not but hatch a comfort to us all,\nIssues a cockatrice for me and mine,\nDo you stare to see me stamp on it? Swans are soft:\nIs it not clear that she you call my wife,\nThat any wife of any husband, caught\nWhetting a sting like this against his breast,--\nSpeckled with fragments of the fresh-broke shell,\nMarried a month and making outcry thus,--\nProves a plague-prodigy to God and man?\nShe married: what was it she married for,\nCounted upon and meant to meet thereby?\n\"Love\" suggests some one, \"love, a little word\n\"Whereof we have not heard one syllable.\"\nSo, the Pompilia, child, girl, wife, in one,\nWanted the beating pulse, the rolling eye,\nThe frantic gesture, the devotion due\nFrom Thyrsis to NeAera! Guido's love--\nWhy not proven\u00e7al roses in his shoe,\nPlume to his cap, and trio of guitars\nAt casement, with a bravo close beside?\nGood things all these are, clearly claimable\nWhen the fit price is paid the proper way.\nHad it been some friend's wife, now, threw her fan\nAt my foot, with just this pretty scrap attached,\n\"Shame, death, damnation--fall these as they may,\n\"So I find you, for a minute!

But here,\nWe talk of just a marriage, if you please--\nThe every-day conditions and no more;\nWhere do these bind me to bestow one drop\nOf blood shall dye my wife's true-love-knot pink?\nPompilia was no pigeon, Venus' pet,\nThat shuffled from between her pressing paps\nTo sit on my rough shoulder,--but a hawk,\nI bought at a hawk's price and carried home\nTo do hawk's service--at the Rotunda, say,\nWhere, six o' the callow nestlings in a row,\nYou pick and choose and pay the price for such.\nI have paid my pound, await my penny's worth,\nSo, hoodwink, starve, and properly train my bird,\nAnd, should she prove a haggard,--twist her neck!\nDid I not pay my name and style, my hope\nAnd trust, my all? Through spending these amiss\nI am here!

How of the Monk\nWho finds the claustral regimen too sharp\nAfter the first month's essay? What's the mode\nWith the Deacon who supports indifferently\nThe rod o' the Bishop when he tastes its smart\nFull four weeks? Do you straightway slacken hold\nOf the innocents, the all-unwary ones\nWho, eager to profess, mistook their mind?--\nRemit a fast-day's rigour to the Monk\nWho fancied Francis' manna meant roast quails,\nConcede the Deacon sweet society,\nHe never thought the levite-rule renounced,--\nOr rather prescribe short chain and sharp scourge\nCorrective of such peccant humours? This--\nI take to be the Church's mode, and mine,\nIf I was over-harsh,--the worse i' the wife\nWho did not win from harshness as she ought,\nWanted the patience and persuasion, lore\nOf love, should cure me and console herself.\nPut case that I mishandle, flurry, and fright\nMy hawk through clumsiness in sportsmanship,\nTwitch out five pens where plucking one would serve--\nWhat, shall she bite and claw to mend the case?\nAnd, if you find I pluck five more for that,\nShall you weep \"Now he roughs the turtle there?\"\n\nSuch was the starting; now of the further step.\nIn lieu of taking penance in good part,\nThe Monk, with hue and cry, summons a mob\nTo make a bonfire of the convent, say,--\nAnd the Deacon's pretty piece of virtue (save\nThe ears o' the Court! I try to save my head)\nInstructed by the ingenuous postulant,\nTaxes the Bishop with adultery (mud\nNeeds must pair off with mud, and filth with filth)--\nSuch being my next experience: who knows not--\nThe couple, father and mother of my wife,\nReturned to Rome, published before my lords,\nPut into print, made circulate far and wide\nThat they had cheated me who cheated them?\nPompilia, I supposed their daughter, drew\nBreath first 'mid Rome's worst rankness, through the deed\nOf a drab and a rogue, was bye-blow bastard-babe\nOf a nameless strumpet, passed off, palmed on me\nAs the daughter with the dowry. Daughter? Dirt\nO' the kennel! Dowry? Dust o' the street! Nought more,\nNought less, nought else but--oh--ah--assuredly\nA Franceschini and my very wife!\nNow take this charge as you will, for false or true,--\nThis charge, preferred before your very selves\nWho judge me now,--I pray you, adjudge again,\nClassing it with the cheats or with the lies,\nBy which category I suffer most!\nBut of their reckoning, theirs who dealt with me\nIn either fashion,--I reserve my word,\nJustify that in its place; I am now to say,\nWhichever point o' the charge might poison most,\nPompilia's duty was no doubtful one.\nYou put the protestation in her mouth\n\"Henceforward and forevermore, avaunt\n\"Ye fiends, who drop disguise and glare revealed\n\"In your own shape, no longer father mine\n\"Nor mother mine!

I started and let drop\nThe dagger. \"Where is it, His promised peace?\"\nNine days o' the Birth-Feast did I pause and pray\nTo enter into no temptation more.\nI bore the hateful house, my brother's once,\nDeserted,--let the ghost of social joy\nMock and make mouths at me from empty room\nAnd idle door that missed the master's step,--\nBore the frank wonder of incredulous eyes,\nAs my own people watched without a word,\nWaited, from where they huddled round the hearth\nBlack like all else, that nod so slow to come--\nI stopped my ears even to the inner call\nOf the dread duty, heard only the song\n\"Peace upon earth,\" saw nothing but the face\nO' the Holy Infant and the halo there\nAble to cover yet another face\nBehind it, Satan's which I else should see.\nBut, day by day, joy waned and withered off:\nThe Babe's face, premature with peak and pine,\nSank into wrinkled ruinous old age,\nSuffering and death, then mist-like disappeared,\nAnd showed only the Cross at end of all,\nLeft nothing more to interpose 'twixt me\nAnd the dread duty,--for the angel's song,\n\"Peace upon earth,\" louder and louder pealed\n\"O Lord, how long, how long be unavenged?\"\nOn the ninth day, this grew too much for man.\nI started up--\"Some end must be!\" At once,\nSilence: then, scratching like a death-watch-tick,\nSlowly within my brain was syllabled,\n\"One more concession, one decisive way\n\"And but one, to determine thee the truth,--\n\"This way, in fine, I whisper in thy ear:\n\"Now doubt, anon decide, thereupon act!\"\n\n\"That is a way, thou whisperest in my ear!\n\"I doubt, I will decide, then act,\" said I--\nThen beckoned my companions: \"Time is come!\"\n\nAnd so, all yet uncertain save the will\nTo do right, and the daring aught save leave\nRight undone, I did find myself at last\nI' the dark before the villa with my friends,\nAnd made the experiment, the final test,\nUltimate chance that ever was to be\nFor the wretchedness inside. I knocked--pronounced\nThe name, the predetermined touch for truth,\n\"What welcome for the wanderer? Open straight--\"\nTo the friend, physician, friar upon his rounds,\nTraveller belated, beggar lame and blind?--\nNo, but--\"to Caponsacchi!\" And the door\nOpened.\nAnd then,--why, even then, I think,\nI' the minute that confirmed my worst of fears,\nSurely,--I pray God that I think aright!--\nHad but Pompilia's self, the tender thing\nWho once was good and pure, was once my lamb\nAnd lay in my bosom, had the well-known shape\nFronted me in the door-way,--stood there faint\nWith the recent pang, perhaps, of giving birth\nTo what might, though by miracle, seem my child,--\nNay more, I will say, had even the aged fool\nPietro, the dotard, in whom folly and age\nWrought, more than enmity or malevolence,\nTo practise and conspire against my peace,--\nHad either of these but opened, I had paused.\nBut it was she the hag, she that brought hell\nFor a dowry with her to her husband's house,\nShe the mock-mother, she that made the match\nAnd married me to perdition, spring and source\nO' the fire inside me that boiled up from heart\nTo brain and hailed the Fury gave it birth,--\nViolante Comparini, she it was,\nWith the old grin amid the wrinkles yet,\nOpened: as if in turning from the Cross,\nWith trust to keep the sight and save my soul,\nI had stumbled, first thing, on the serpent's head\nCoiled with a leer at foot of it.\n\nThere was the end!\nThen was I rapt away by the impluse, one\nImmeasurable everlasting wave of a need\nTo abolish that detested life. 'Twas done:\nYou know the rest and how the folds o' the thing,\nTwisting for help, involved the other two\nMore or less serpent-like: how I was mad,\nBlind, stamped on all, the earth-worms with the asp,\nAnd ended so.\nYou came on me that night,\nYour officers of justice,--caught the crime\nIn the first natural frenzy of remorse?\nTwenty miles off, sound sleeping as a child\nOn a cloak i' the straw which promised shelter first,\nWith the bloody arms beside me,--was it not so?\nWherefore not? Why, how else should I be found?\nI was my own self, had my sense again,\nMy soul safe from the serpents. I could sleep:\nIndeed and, dear my lords, I shall sleep now,\nSpite of my shoulder, in five minutes' space,\nWhen you dismiss me, having truth enough!\nIt is but a few days are passed, I find,\nSince this adventure. Do you tell me, four?\nThen the dead are scarce quiet where they lie,\nOld Pietro, old Violante, side by side\nAt the church Lorenzo,--oh, they know it well!\nSo do I. But my wife is still alive,\nHas breath enough to tell her story yet,\nHer way, which is not mine, no doubt at all.\nAnd Caponsacchi, you have summoned him,--\nWas he so far to send for? Not at hand?\nI thought some few o' the stabs were in his heart,\nOr had not been so lavish,--less had served.\nWell, he too tells his story,--florid prose\nAs smooth as mine is rough. You see, my lords,\nThere will be a lying intoxicating smoke\nBorn of the blood,--confusion probably,--\nFor lies breed lies--but all that rests with you!\nThe trial is no concern of mine; with me\nThe main of the care is over: I at least\nRecognise who took that huge burthen off,\nLet me begin to live again. I did\nGod's bidding and man's duty, so, breathe free;\nLook you to the rest! I heard Himself prescribe,\nThat great Physician, and dared lance the core\nOf the bad ulcer; and the rage abates,\nI am myself and whole now: I prove cured\nBy the eyes that see, the ears that hear again,\nThe limbs that have relearned their youthful play,\nThe healthy taste of food and feel of clothes\nAnd taking to our common life once more,\nAll that now urges my defence from death.\nThe willingness to live, what means it else?\nBefore,--but let the very action speak!\nJudge for yourselves, what life seemed worth to me\nWho, not by proxy but in person, pitched\nHead-foremost into danger as a fool\nThat never cares if he can swim or no--\nSo he but find the bottom, braves the brook.\nNo man omits precaution, quite neglects\nSecrecy, safety, schemes not how retreat,\nHaving schemed he might advance. Did I so scheme?\nWhy, with a warrant which 'tis ask and have,\nWith horse thereby made mine without a word,\nI had gained the frontier and slept safe that night.\nThen, my companions,--call them what you please,\nSlave or stipendiary,--what need of one\nTo me whose right-hand did its owner's work?\nHire an assassin yet expose yourself?\nAs well buy glove and then thrust naked hand\nI' the thorn-bush. No, the wise man stays at home,\nSends only agents out, with pay to earn:\nAt home, when they come back,--he straight discards\nOr else disowns. Why use such tools at all\nWhen a man's foes are of his house, like mine,\nSit at his board, sleep in his bed? Why noise,\nWhen there's the acquetta and the silent way?\nClearly my life was valueless.\n\nBut now\nHealth is returned, and sanity of soul\nNowise indifferent to the body's harm.\nI find the instinct bids me save my life;\nMy wits, too, rally round me; I pick up\nAnd use the arms that strewed the ground before,\nUnnoticed or spurned aside: I take my stand,\nMake no defence. God shall not lose a life\nMay do Him further service, while I speak\nAnd you hear, you my judges and last hope!\nYou are the law: 'tis to the law I look.\nI began life by hanging to the law,\nTo the law it is I hang till life shall end.\nMy brother made appeal to the Pope, 'tis true,\nTo stay proceedings, judge my cause himself\nNor trouble law,--some fondness of conceit\nThat rectitude, sagacity sufficed\nThe investigator in a case like mine,\nDispensed with the machine of law. The Pope\nKnew better, set aside my brother's plea\nAnd put me back to law,--referred the cause\nAd judices meos,--doubtlessly did well.\nHere, then, I clutch my judges,--I claim law--\nCry, by the higher law whereof your law\nO' the land is humbly representative,--\nCry, on what point is it, where either accuse,\nI fail to furnish you defence? I stand\nAcquitted, actually or virtually,\nBy every intermediate kind of court\nThat takes account of right or wrong in man,\nEach unit in the series that begins\nWith God's throne, ends with the tribunal here.\nGod breathes, not speaks, his verdicts, felt not heard,\nPassed on successively to each court I call\nMan's conscience, custom, manners, all that make\nMore and more effort to promulgate, mark\nGod's verdict in determinable words,\nTill last come human jurists--solidify\nFluid result,--what's fixable lies forged,\nStatute,--the residue escapes in fume,\nYet hangs aloft, a cloud, as palpable\nTo the finer sense as word the legist welds.\nJustinian's Pandects only make precise\nWhat simply sparkled in men's eyes before,\nTwitched in their brow or quivered on their lip,\nWaited the speech they called but would not come,\nThese courts then, whose decree your own confirms,--\nTake my whole life, not this last act alone,\nLook on it by the light reflected thence!\nWhat has Society to charge me with?\nCome, unreservedly,--favour nor fear,--\nI am Guido Franceschini, am I not?\nYou know the courses I was free to take?\nI took just that which let me serve the Church,\nI gave it all my labour in body and soul\nTill these broke down i' the service. \"Specify?\"\nWell, my last patron was a Cardinal.\nI left him unconvicted of a fault--\nWas even helped, by way of gratitude,\nInto the new life that I left him for,\nThis very misery of the marriage,--he\nMade it, kind soul, so far as in him lay--\nSigned the deed where you yet may see his name.\nHe is gone to his reward,--dead, being my friend\nWho could have helped here also,--that, of course!\nSo far, there's my acquittal, I suppose.\nThen comes the marriage itself--no question, lords,\nOf the entire validity of that!\nIn the extremity of distress, 'tis true,\nFor after-reasons, furnished abundantly,\nI wished the thing invalid, went to you\nOnly some months since, set you duly forth\nMy wrong and prayed your remedy, that a cheat\nShould not have force to cheat my whole life long.\n\"Annul a marriage? 'Tis impossible!\n\"Though ring about your neck be brass not gold,\n\"Needs must it clasp, gangrene you all the same!\"\nWell, let me have the benefit, just so far,\nO' the fact announced,--my wife then is my wife,\nI have allowance for a husband's right.\nI am charged with passing right's due bound,--such acts\nAs I thought just, my wife called cruelty,\nComplained of in due form,--convoked no court\nOf common gossipry, but took her wrongs--\nAnd not once, but so long as patience served--\nTo the town's top, jurisdiction's pride of place,\nTo the Archbishop and the Governor.\nThese heard her charge with my reply, and found\nThat futile, this sufficient: they dismissed\nThe hysteric querulous rebel, and confirmed\nAuthority in its wholesome exercise,\nThey, with directest access to the facts.\n\"--Ay, for it was their friendship favoured you,\n\"Hereditary alliance against a breach\n\"I' the social order: prejudice for the name\n\"Of Franceschini!\"--So I hear it said:\nBut not here. You, lords, never will you say\n\"Such is the nullity of grace and truth,\n\"Such the corruption of the faith, such lapse\n\"Of law, such warrant have the Molinists\n\"For daring reprehend us as they do,--\n\"That we pronounce it just a common case,\n\"Two dignitaries, each in his degree\n\"First, foremost, this the spiritual head, and that\n\"The secular arm o' the body politic,\n\"Should, for mere wrongs' love and injustice' sake,\n\"Side with, aid and abet in cruelty\n\"This broken beggarly noble,--bribed perhaps\n\"By his watered wine and mouldy crust of bread--\n\"Rather than that sweet tremulous flower-like wife\n\"Who kissed their hands and curled about their feet\n\"Looking the irresistible loveliness\n\"In tears that takes man captive, turns\"...enough!\nDo you blast your predecessors? What forbids\nPosterity to trebly blast yourselves\nWho set the example and instruct their tongue?\nYou dreaded the crowd, succumbed to the popular cry,\nOr else, would nowise seem defer thereto\nAnd yield to public clamour though i'the right!\nYou riddled your eye of my unseemliness,\nThe noble whose misfortune wearied you,--\nOr, what's more probable, made common cause\nWith the cleric section, punished in myself\nMaladroit uncomplaisant laity,\nDefective in behaviour to a priest\nWho claimed the customary partnership\nI' the house and the wife. Lords, any lie will serve!\nLook to it,--or allow me freed so far!\n\nThen I proceed a step, come with clean hands\nThus far, re-tell the tale told eight months since.\nThe wife, you allow so far, I have not wronged,\nHas fled my roof, plundered me and decamped\nIn company with the priest her paramour:\nAnd I gave chase, came up with, caught the two\nAt the wayside inn where both had spent the night,\nFound them in flagrant fault, and found as well,\nBy documents with name and plan and date,\nThe fault was furtive then that's flagrant now,\nTheir intercourse a long established crime.\nI did not take the license law's self gives\nTo slay both criminals o' the spot at the time,\nBut held my hand,--preferred play prodigy\nOf patience which the world calls cowardice,\nRather than seem anticipate the law\nAnd cast discredit on its organs,--you--\nSo, to your bar I brought both criminals,\nAnd made my statement: heard their counter-charge\nNay,--their corroboration of my tale,\nNowise disputing its allegements, not\nI' the main, not more than nature's decency\nCompels men to keep silence in this kind,--\nOnly contending that the deeds avowed\nWould take another colour and bear excuse.\nYou were to judge between us; so you did.\nYou disregard the excuse, you breathe away\nThe colour of innocence and leave guilt black,\n\"Guilty\" is the decision of the court,\nAnd that I stand in consequence untouched,\nOne white intergity from head to heel.\nNot guilty? Why then did you punish them?\nTrue, punishment has been inadequate--\n'Tis not I only, not my friends that joke,\nMy foes that jeer, who echo \"inadequate\"--\nFor, by a chance that comes to help for once,\nThe same case simultaneously was judged\nAt Arezzo, in the province of the Court\nWhere the crime had beginning but not end.\nThey then, deciding on but half o' the crime,\nThe effraction, robbery,--features of the fault\nI never cared to dwell upon at Rome,--\nWhat was it they adjudged as penalty\nTo Pompilia,--the one criminal o' the pair\nAmenable to their judgment, not the priest\nWho is Rome's? Why, just imprisonment for life\nI' the Stinche. There was Tuscany's award\nTo a wife that robs her husband: you at Rome\nHaving to deal with adultery in a wife\nAnd, in a priest, breach of the priestly vow,\nGive gentle sequestration for a month\nIn a manageable Convent, then release,\nYou call imprisonment, in the very house\nO' the very couple, the sole aim and end\nOf the culprits' crime was--there to reach and rest\nAnd there take solace and defy me: well,--\nThis difference 'twixt their penalty and yours\nIs immaterial: make your penalty less--\nMerely that she should henceforth wear black gloves\nAnd white fan, she who wore the opposite--\nWhy, all the same the fact o' the thing subsists.\nReconcile to your conscience as you may,\nBe it on your own heads, you pronounced one half\nO' the penalty for heinousness like hers\nAnd his, that's for a fault at Carnival\nOf comfit-pelting past discretion's law,\nOr accident to handkerchief in Lent\nWhich falls perversely as a lady kneels\nAbruptly, and but half conceals her neck!\nI acquiesce for my part,--punished, though\nBy a pin-point scratch, means guilty: guilty means\n--What have I been but innocent hitherto?\nAnyhow, here the offence, being punished, ends.\n\nEnds?--for you deemed so, did you not, sweet lords?\nThat was throughout the veritable aim\nO' the sentence light or heavy,--to redress\nRecognised wrong? You righted me, I think?\nWell then,--what if I, at this last of all,\nDemonstrate you, as my whole pleading proves,\nNo particle of wrong received thereby\nOne atom of right?--that cure grew worse disease?\nThat in the process you call \"justice done\"\nAll along you have nipped away just inch\nBy inch the creeping climbing length of plague\nBreaking my tree of life from root to branch,\nAnd left me, after all and every act\nOf your interference,--lightened of what load?\nAt liberty wherein? Mere words and wind!\n\"Now I was saved, now I should feel no more\n\"The hot breath, find a respite from fixed eye\n\"And vibrant tongue!\" Why, scarce your back was turned,\nThere was the reptile, that feigned death at first,\nRenewing its detested spire and spire\nAround me, rising to such heights of hate\nThat, so far from mere purpose now to crush\nAnd coil itself on the remains of me,\nBody and mind, and there flesh fang content.\nIts aim is now to evoke life from death,\nMake me anew, satisfy in my son\nThe hunger I may feed but never sate,\nTormented on to perpetuity,--\nMy son, whom, dead, I shall know, understand,\nFeel, hear, see, never more escape the sight\nIn heaven that's turned to hell, or hell returned\n(So, rather, say) to this same earth again,--\nMoulded into the image and made one,\nFashioned of soul as featured like in face,\nFirst taught to laugh and lisp and stand and go\nBy that thief, poisoner, and adulteress\nI call Pompilia, he calls...sacred name,\nBe unpronounced, be unpolluted here!\nAnd last led up to the glory and prize of hate\nBy his...foster-father, Caponsacchi's self,\nThe perjured priest, pink of conspirators,\nTricksters and knaves, yet polished, superfine,\nManhood to model adolescence by...\nLords, look on me, declare,--when, what I show,\nIs nothing more nor less than what you deemed\nAnd doled me out for justice,--what did you say?\nFor reparation, restitution and more,--\nWill you not thank, praise, bid me to your breasts\nFor having done the thing you thought to do,\nAnd thoroughly trampled out sin's life at last?\nI have heightened phrase to make your soft speech serve,\nDoubled the blow you but essayed to strike,\nCarried into effect your mandate here\nThat else had fallen to ground: mere duty done,\nOversight of the master just supplied\nBy zeal i' the servant: I, being used to serve,\nHave simply...what is it they charge me with?\nBlackened again, made legible once more\nYour own decree, not permanently writ,\nRightly conceived but all too faintly traced,--\nIt reads efficient, now, comminatory,\nA terror to the wicked, answers so\nThe mood o' the magistrate, the mind of law.\nAbsolve, then, me, law's mere executant!\nProtect your own defender,--save me, Sirs!\nGive me my life, give me my liberty,\nMy good name and my civic rights again!\nIt would be too fond, too complacent play\nInto the hands o' the devil, should we lose\nThe game here, I for God: a soldier-bee\nThat yields his life, exenterate with the stroke\nO' the sting that saves the hive. I need that life,\nOh, never fear! I'll find life plenty use\nThough it should last five years more, aches and all!\nFor, first thing, there's the mother's age to help--\nLet her come break her heart upon my breast,\nNot on the blank stone of my nameless tomb!\nThe fugitive brother has to be bidden back\nTo the old routine, repugnant to the tread,\nOf daily suit and service to the Church,--\nThro' gibe and jest, those stones that Shimei flung!\nAy, and the spirit-broken youth at home,\nThe awe-struck altar-ministrant, shall make\nAmends for faith now palsied at the source,\nShall see truth yet triumphant, justice yet\nA victor in the battle of this world!\nGive me--for last, best gift, my son again,\nWhom law makes mine,--I take him at your word,\nMine be he, by miraculous mercy, lords!\nLet me lift up his youth and innocence\nTo purify my palace, room by room\nPurged of the memories, lend from his bright brow\nLight to the old proud paladin my sire\nShrunk now for shame into the darkest shade\nO' the tapestry, showed him once and shrouds him now!\nThen may we,--strong from that rekindled smile,--\nGo forward, face new times, the better day.\nAnd when, in times made better through your brave\nDecision now,--might but Utopia be!--\nRome rife with honest women and strong men,\nManners reformed, old habits back once more,\nCustoms that recognise the standard worth,--\nThe wholesome household rule in force again,\nHusbands once more God's representative,\nWives like the typical Spouse once more, and Priests\nNo longer men of Belial, with no aim\nAt leading silly women captive, but\nOf rising to such duties as yours now,--\nThen will I set my son at my right hand\nAnd tell his father's story to this point,\nAdding \"The task seemed superhuman, still\n\"I dared and did it, trusting God and law:\n\"And they approved of me: give praise to both!\"\nAnd if, for answer, he shall stoop to kiss\nMy hand, and peradventure start thereat,--\nI engage to smile \"That was an accident\n\"I' the necessary process,--just a trip\n\"O' the torture-irons in their search for truth,--\n\"Hardly misfortune, and no fault at all.\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/4937058", "artist_names": "Spotify", "full_title": "New Music Friday 10/11/19 by\u00a0Spotify", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 4937058, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 4266583, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1591733424, "path": "/Spotify-new-music-friday-10-11-19-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Spotify-new-music-friday-10-11-19-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2019, "month": 10, "day": 11}, "release_date_for_display": "October 11, 2019", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Oct. 11, 2019", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.1000x1000x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "New Music Friday 10/11/19", "title_with_featured": "New Music Friday 10/11/19", "updated_by_human_at": 1591733424, "url": "https://genius.com/Spotify-new-music-friday-10-11-19-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/69342", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/da32597113461492089ce24af5568ab7.1000x419x1.png", "id": 69342, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4d7925a03026cc6d993484d2712b75e9.709x709x1.png", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Spotify", "slug": "Spotify", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Spotify"}, "artist": "Spotify", "lyrics": "New Music Friday 10/11/19 LyricsHarry Styles - Lights Up\nCamila Cabello - Easy\nYUNGBLUD - original me (feat. dan reynolds of\u2005imagine\u2005dragons)\nFrench Montana -\u2005Twisted (feat.

lose\nYou've got the g.q. blues\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou get up every morning and you go to work each day\n(you go to work, you go to work, you go to work)\nBeen doing the same damn job for ten long years this May\n(you've got to work, you've got to work, you've got to work)\nYou've been working and saving for your Jamaican dream\nParadise is waiting across the sea\nBut when your plane lands Montego turns to monsoon\nYou've got the island blues\n[Hook]\nCause, nothing ever goes as planned\nIt's a hell of a notion\nEven pharaohs turn to sand\nLike a drop in the ocean\nYou're so together, you act so civilized\nBut every time that things go wrong you're still surprised\nYou've done your duty, you've paid a fortune in dues\nStill got them mother nature's blues\n\n[Bridge]\nI strut around the

That Move Lyrics[Intro: Jody Watley]\nMake that move right now, baby\nMake that move right now, baby\n\n[Verse 1: Howard Hewett]\nSo many times\nBy holding back I let the good things pass me by\nAnd then one day I asked myself the reason why\nAnd like an answer from above you came into my life\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Howard Hewett, Jody Watley]\nAnd showed me one thing for sure\nWith love nothing is certain\nYou got to go for it when you feel it\nEverybody, everybody needs somebody to love\nAnd I choose you, baby, so let's\n[Chorus: Jody Watley, Howard Hewett]\nMake that move right now, baby\nYou only go around once in a lifetime\nMake that move right now, baby\n\n[Verse 2: Howard Hewett]\nSo natural to\nGive in to feelings deep inside when love is due\nAnd I knew something was missing 'cause I feel brand new\nAnd motivation's in my heart whenever I'm with you\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Howard Hewett, Jody Watley]\nSo girl whatever you do\nJust remember love is in motion\nYou got to hold on tight when you know it's right\nEverybody, everybody needs somebody to love\nAnd I choose you, baby, so let's\n\n[Chorus: Jody Watley, Howard Hewett]\nMake that move right now, baby\nYou only go around once in a lifetime\nMake that move right now, baby\nThe longer you wait on love, the more you'll be without it\n\n[Instrumental Break]\nYou might also like[Bridge: Shalamar]\nWhy don't you make that move, make that move, make that move\nMake that move, make that move, make that move\nMake that move, make that move, make that move\nMake that move, make that move, make that move\nLet's make that move\nMake that move, make that move, make that move\nMake that move, make that move, make that move\nMake that move, make that move, make that move\nCome on\nLet's make that move\n\n[Verse 3: Howard

(Without You) LyricsWithout you , stood alone on the edge of time\nOut of sight,but forever mine, without you\nSometime's there's no forgetting the night\nWhen you reach for the stars ,just to be

wind\nYou were the love I was in\nHow can I try to be me\nWithout you\nWithout you, watching you take the world from me\nLeaving me with a memory about you\nSometime's there's no forgetting the place\nWhere you told me goodbye ,like a slap in the face\nWhere you tore me apart and I learned how to cry\n\nWithout you , there ain't no love at all\nAnd without you , there ain't no plans at all\nWithout you , ev'rything's lost to the wind\nYou were the love I was in\nHow can I try to be me\n\nWithout you , there ain't no love at all\nWithout you baby, there ain't no plans at all\nGirl,

whistlin' by, he was bouncin' every step\nIt seemed strange how good he felt, so I asked him while he swept\n\n[Chorus 1]\nHe said, \"It's my job to be cleaning up this mess\nAnd that's enough reason to go for me\nIt's my job to be better than the rest\nAnd that makes a day for me.\"\n[Verse 2]\nI got an uncle who owns a bank, he's a self-made millionaire\nHe never had anyone to love, never had no one to care\nHe always seemed kinda sad to me and I asked him why that was\nAnd he told me it's because in my contract there's this clause\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThat says, \"It's my job to be worried half to death\nAnd that's the thing people respect in me\nIt's my job but without it I'd be less\nThan what I expect from me.\"\n\n[Bridge]\nNow I've been lazy most all my life writin' songs and sleepin' late\nAnd any manual labor I've done was purely by mistake\nIf street sweepers can smile then I've got no right to feel upset\nBut sometimes I still forget\n'Til the lights go on and the stage is set\nAnd the song hits home and you feel that sweat\n\n[Chorus 3]\nIt's my job to be different than the rest\nAnd that's enough reason to go for me\nIt's my job to be better than the rest\nAnd that's a rough break for me\nSee Jimmy Buffett LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like[Chorus 1]\nIt's my job to be cleaning up this mess\nAnd that's enough reason to go for me\nIt's my job to be

"lyrics": "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (Chap. 5) LyricsHe drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him, staring into the dark pool of the jar. The yellow dripping had been scooped out like a boghole and the pool under it brought back to his memory the dark turf-coloured water of the bath in Clongowes. The box of pawn tickets at his elbow had just been rifled and he took up idly one after another in his greasy fingers the blue and white dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased and bearing the name of the pledger as Daly or MacEvoy.\n\n1 Pair Buskins\n1 D. Coat\n3 Articles and White\n1 Man's Pants\n\nThen he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of the box, speckled with louse marks, and asked vaguely:\n\n\u2014How much is the clock fast now?\nHis mother straightened the battered alarm clock that was lying on its side in the middle of the mantelpiece until its dial showed a quarter to twelve and then laid it once more on its side.\n\n\u2014An hour and twenty-five minutes, she said. The right time now is twenty past ten. The dear knows you might try to be in time for your lectures.\n\n\u2014Fill out the place for me to wash, said Stephen.\n\n\u2014Katey, fill out the place for Stephen to wash.\n\n\u2014Boody, fill out the place for Stephen to wash.\n\n\u2014I can't, I'm going for blue. Fill it out, you, Maggy.\n\nWhen the enamelled basin had been fitted into the well of the sink and the old washing glove flung on the side of it he allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of his ears and into the interstices at the wings of his nose.\n\n\u2014Well, it's a poor case, she said, when a university student is so dirty that his mother has to wash him.\n\n\u2014But it gives you pleasure, said Stephen calmly.\n\nAn ear-splitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his mother thrust a damp overall into his hands, saying:\n\n\u2014Dry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness.\n\nA second shrill whistle, prolonged angrily, brought one of the girls to the foot of the staircase.\n\n\u2014Yes, father?\n\u2014Is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet?\n\n\u2014Yes, father.\n\n\u2014Sure?\n\n\u2014Yes, father.\n\n\u2014Hm!\n\nThe girl came back, making signs to him to be quick and go out quietly by the back. Stephen laughed and said:\n\n\u2014He has a curious idea of genders if he thinks a bitch is masculine.\n\n\u2014Ah, it's a scandalous shame for you, Stephen, said his mother, and you'll live to rue the day you set your foot in that place. I know how it has changed you.\n\n\u2014Good morning, everybody, said Stephen, smiling and kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu.\n\nThe lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish, he heard a mad nun screeching in the nuns' madhouse beyond the wall.\n\n\u2014Jesus! O Jesus! Jesus!\n\nHe shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their echoes even out of his heart with an execration; but, as he walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange wild smell of the wet leaves and bark, his soul was loosed of her miseries.\n\nThe rain-laden trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, memories of the girls and women in the plays of Gerhart Hauptmann; and the memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy. His morning walk across the city had begun, and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would think of the cloistral silver-veined prose of Newman; that as he walked along the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the windows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour of Guido Cavalcanti and smile; that as he went by Baird's stonecutting works in Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen would blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish beauty; and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson which begins:\nI was not wearier where I lay\n\nHis mind when wearied of its search for the essence of beauty amid the spectral words of Aristotle or Aquinas turned often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the Elizabethans. His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood often in shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waist-coateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time, of chambering and false honour stung his monkish pride and drove him on from his lurking-place\n\nThe lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding upon so that it had rapt him from the companionship of youth was only a garner of slender sentences from Aristotle's poetics and psychology and a SYNOPSIS PHILOSOPHIAE SCHOLASTICAE AD MENTEM DIVI THOMAE. His thinking was a dusk of doubt and self-mistrust, lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition, but lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been fire-consumed; and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of others with unanswering eyes, for he felt that the spirit of beauty had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at least he had been acquainted with nobility. But when this brief pride of silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find himself still in the midst of common lives, passing on his way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a light heart\n\nNear the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive man with the doll's face and the brimless hat coming towards him down the slope of the bridge with little steps, tightly buttoned into his chocolate overcoat, and holding his furled umbrella a span or two from him like a divining rod. It must be eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see the time. The clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five but, as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him, but unseen, beating eleven strokes in swift precision. He laughed as he heard it for it made him think of McCann, and he saw him a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair goatee, standing in the wind at Hopkins' corner, and heard him say:\n\n\u2014Dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in yourself. I'm not. I'm a democrat and I'll work and act for social liberty and equality among all classes and sexes in the United States of the Europe of the future\n\nEleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the headline of a placard. Thursday. Ten to eleven, English; eleven to twelve, French; twelve to one, physics. He fancied to himself the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless and helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and examples or dates of birth or death, chief works, a favourable and an unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked around the little class of students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of cheerless cellar-damp and decay. Another head than his, right before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about him. Why was it that when he thought of Cranly he could never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of the head and face? Even now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head or death-mask, crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown. It was a priest-like face, priest-like in its palor, in the wide winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the jaws, priest-like in the lips that were long and bloodless and faintly smiling; and Stephen, remembering swiftly how he had told Cranly of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his soul, day after day and night by night, only to be answered by his friend's listening silence, would have told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes\n\nThrough this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it, feeling that it was not yet the hour to enter it. But the nightshade of his friend's listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him a tenuous and deadly exhalation and He found himself glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left in stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his mind like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up sighing with age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead language. His own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain and trickling into the very words themselves which set to band and disband themselves in wayward rhythms:\n\nThe ivy whines upon the wall\nAnd whines and twines upon the wall\nThe yellow ivy upon the wall\nIvy, ivy up the wall\n\nDid anyone ever hear such drivel? Lord Almighty! Who ever heard of ivy whining on a wall? Yellow ivy; that was all right. Yellow ivory also. And what about ivory ivy?\n\nThe word now shone in his brain, clearer and brighter than any ivory sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants. IVORY, IVOIRE, AVORIO, EBUR. One of the first examples that he had learnt in Latin had run: INDIA MITTIT EBUR; and he recalled the shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to construe the Metamorphoses of Ovid in a courtly English, made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and chines of bacon. He had learnt what little he knew of the laws of Latin verse from a ragged book written by a Portuguese priest\n\nContrahit orator, variant in carmine vates\n\nThe crises and victories and secessions in Roman history were handed on to him in the trite words IN TANTO DISCRIMINE and he had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities through the words IMPLERE OLLAM DENARIORUM which the rector had rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries. The pages of his time-worn Horace never felt cold to the touch even when his own fingers were cold; they were human pages and fifty years before they had been turned by the human fingers of John Duncan Inverarity and by his brother, William Malcolm Inverarity. Yes, those were noble names on the dusky flyleaf and, even for so poor a Latinist as he, the dusky verses were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in myrtle and lavender and vervain; but yet it wounded him to think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the world's culture and that the monkish learning, in terms of which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and curious jargons of heraldry and falconry\n\nThe grey block of Trinity on his left, set heavily in the city's ignorance like a dull stone set in a cumbrous ring, pulled his mind downward and while he was striving this way and that to free his feet from the fetters of the reformed conscience he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of Ireland\n\nHe looked at it without anger; for, though sloth of the body and of the soul crept over it like unseen vermin, over the shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the servile head, it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity. It was a Firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a Milesian; and he thought of his friend Davin, the peasant student. It was a jesting name between them, but the young peasant bore with it lightly:\n\n\u2014Go on, Stevie, I have a hard head, you tell me. Call me what you will\n\nThe homely version of his christian name on the lips of his friend had touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he was as formal in speech with others as they were with him. Often, as he sat in Davin's rooms in Grantham Street, wondering at his friend's well-made boots that flanked the wall pair by pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and dejection, the rude Firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill\u2014for Davin had sat at the feet of Michael Cusack, the Gael\u2014repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes, the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew was still a nightly fear\n\nSide by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his uncle Mat Davin, the athlete, the young peasant worshipped the sorrowful legend of Ireland. The gossip of his fellow-students which strove to render the flat life of the college significant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian. His nurse had taught him Irish and shaped his rude imagination by the broken lights of Irish myth. He stood towards the myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a line of beauty and to its unwieldy tales that divided against themselves as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards the Roman catholic religion, the attitude of a dull-witted loyal serf. Whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from England or by way of English culture his mind stood armed against in obedience to a password; and of the world that lay beyond England he knew only the foreign legion of France in which he spoke of serving\n\nCoupling this ambition with the young man's humour Stephen had often called him one of the tame geese and there was even a point of irritation in the name pointed against that very reluctance of speech and deed in his friend which seemed so often to stand between Stephen's mind, eager of speculation, and the hidden ways of Irish life\n\nOne night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent or luxurious language in which Stephen escaped from the cold silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before Stephen's mind a strange vision. The two were walking slowly towards Davin's rooms through the dark narrow streets of the poorer jews\n\n\u2014A thing happened to myself, Stevie, last autumn, coming on winter, and I never told it to a living soul and you are the first person now I ever told it to. I disremember if it was October or November. It was October because it was before I came up here to join the matriculation class\n\nStephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's face, flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by the speaker's simple accent\n\n\u2014I was away all that day from my own place over in Buttevant\n\n\u2014I don't know if you know where that is\u2014at a hurling match between the Croke's Own Boys and the Fearless Thurles and by God, Stevie, that was the hard fight. My first cousin, Fonsy Davin, was stripped to his buff that day minding cool for the Limericks but he was up with the forwards half the time and shouting like mad. I never will forget that day. One of the Crokes made a woeful wipe at him one time with his caman and I declare to God he was within an aim's ace of getting it at the side of his temple. Oh, honest to God, if the crook of it caught him that time he was done for\n\n\u2014I am glad he escaped, Stephen had said with a laugh, but surely that's not the strange thing that happened you?\n\n\u2014Well, I suppose that doesn't interest you, but leastways there was such noise after the match that I missed the train home and I couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out. Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was coming on night when I got into the Ballyhoura hills, that's better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twice I stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thick I'd have stretched out there and slept. At last, after a bend of the road, I spied a little cottage with a light in the window. I went up and knocked at the door. A voice asked who was there and I answered I was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and that I'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as if she was going to bed when I knocked and she had her hair hanging and I thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, and I thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me was I tired and would I like to stop the night there. She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. When I handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said: 'COME IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE. YOU'VE NO CALL TO BE FRIGHTENED. THERE'S NO ONE IN IT BUT OURSELVES...' I didn't go in, Stevie. I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the road I looked back and she was standing at the door\n\nThe last words of Davin's story sang in his memory and the figure of the woman in the story stood forth reflected in other figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in the doorways at Clane as the college cars drove by, as a type of her race and of his own, a bat-like soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and, through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without guile, calling the stranger to her bed\n\nA hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried:\n\n\u2014Ah, gentleman, your own girl, sir! The first handsel today, gentleman. Buy that lovely bunch. Will you, gentleman?\n\nThe blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her young blue eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guilelessness, and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and hoydenish face\n\n\u2014Do, gentleman! Don't forget your own girl, sir!\n\n\u2014I have no money, said Stephen\n\n\u2014Buy them lovely ones, will you, sir? Only a penny\n\n\u2014Did you hear what I said? asked Stephen, bending towards her. I told you I had no money. I tell you again now\n\n\u2014Well, sure, you will some day, sir, please God, the girl answered after an instant\n\n\u2014Possibly, said Stephen, but I don't think it likely\n\nHe left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: VIVE L'IRLANDE!\n\nBut the trees in Stephen's Green were fragrant of rain and the rain-sodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint incense rising upward through the mould from many hearts. The soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him of had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other than that of Buck Egan and Burnchapel Whaley\n\nIt was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He crossed the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to the physics theatre. The corridor was dark and silent but not unwatchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? Was it because he had heard that in Buck Whaley's time there was a secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit house extra-territorial and was he walking among aliens? The Ireland of Tone and of Parnell seemed to have receded in space\n\nHe opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey light that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fireplace\n\n\u2014Good morning, sir! Can I help you?\n\nThe priest looked up quickly and said:\n\n\u2014One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There is an art in lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have the useful arts. This is one of the useful arts\n\n\u2014I will try to learn it, said Stephen\n\n\u2014Not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his task, that is one of the secrets\n\nHe produced four candle-butts from the side-pockets of his soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candle-butts he seemed more than ever a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one whom the canonicals or the bell-bordered ephod would irk and trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the Lord\u2014in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings secretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when bidden\u2014and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity\u2014a mortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of love or combat his ageing body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a silver-pointed down\n\nThe dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks catch. Stephen, to fill the silence, said:\n\n\u2014I am sure I could not light a fire\n\n\u2014You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus? said the dean, glancing up and blinking his pale eyes. The object of the artist is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is another question\n\nHe rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty\n\n\u2014Can you solve that question now? he asked\n\n\u2014Aquinas, answered Stephen, says PULCRA SUNT QUAE VISA PLACENT\n\n\u2014This fire before us, said the dean, will be pleasing to the eye. Will it therefore be beautiful?\n\n\u2014In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which I suppose means here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But Aquinas also says BONUM EST IN QUOD TENDIT APPETITUS. In so far as it satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a good. In hell, however, it is an evil\n\n\u2014Quite so, said the dean, you have certainly hit the nail on the head\n\nHe rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and said:\n\n\u2014A draught is said to be a help in these matters\n\nAs he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a brisk step, Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at him from the pale loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but in his eyes burned no spark of Ignatius's enthusiasm. Even the legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more secret than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not fired his soul with the energy of apostleship. It seemed as if he used the shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden to do, for the greater glory of God, without joy in their handling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning them, with a firm gesture of obedience back upon themselves and for all this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master and little, if at all, the ends he served. SIMILITER ATQUE SENIS BACULUS, he was, as the founder would have had him, like a staff in an old man's hand, to be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather, to lie with a lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace\n\nThe dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his chin\n\n\u2014When may we expect to have something from you on the esthetic question? he asked\n\n\u2014From me! said Stephen in astonishment. I stumble on an idea once a fortnight if I am lucky\n\n\u2014These questions are very profound, Mr Dedalus, said the dean. It is like looking down from the cliffs of Moher into the depths. Many go down into the depths and never come up. Only the trained diver can go down into those depths and explore them and come to the surface again\n\n\u2014If you mean speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also am sure that there is no such thing as free thinking inasmuch as all thinking must be bound by its own laws\n\n\u2014Ha!\n\n\u2014For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of one or two ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas\n\n\u2014I see. I quite see your point\n\n\u2014I need them only for my own use and guidance until I have done something for myself by their light. If the lamp smokes or smells I shall try to trim it. If it does not give light enough I shall sell it and buy another\n\n\u2014Epictetus also had a lamp, said the dean, which was sold for a fancy price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his philosophical dissertations by. You know Epictetus?\n\n\u2014An old gentleman, said Stephen coarsely, who said that the soul is very like a bucketful of water\n\n\u2014He tells us in his homely way, the dean went on, that he put an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that a thief stole the lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected that it was in the character of a thief to steal and determined to buy an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp\n\nA smell of molten tallow came up from the dean's candle butts and fused itself in Stephen's consciousness with the jingle of the words, bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket. The priest's voice, too, had a hard jingling tone. Stephen's mind halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and the imagery and by the priest's face which seemed like an unlit lamp or a reflector hung in a false focus. What lay behind it or within it? A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud, charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of God?\n\n\u2014I meant a different kind of lamp, sir, said Stephen\n\n\u2014Undoubtedly, said the dean\n\n\u2014One difficulty, said Stephen, in esthetic discussion is to know whether words are being used according to the literary tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace. I remember a sentence of Newman's in which he says of the Blessed Virgin that she was detained in the full company of the saints. The use of the word in the marketplace is quite different. I HOPE I AM NOT DETAINING YOU\n\n\u2014Not in the least, said the dean politely\n\n\u2014No, no, said Stephen, smiling, I mean\u2014\n\n\u2014Yes, yes; I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the point: DETAIN\n\nHe thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short cough\n\n\u2014To return to the lamp, he said, the feeding of it is also a nice problem. You must choose the pure oil and you must be careful when you pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in more than the funnel can hold\n\n\u2014What funnel? asked Stephen\n\n\u2014The funnel through which you pour the oil into your lamp\n\n\u2014That? said Stephen. Is that called a funnel? Is it not a tundish?\n\n\u2014What is a tundish?\n\n\u2014That. The... funnel\n\n\u2014Is that called a tundish in Ireland? asked the dean. I never heard the word in my life\n\n\u2014It is called a tundish in Lower Drumcondra, said Stephen, laughing, where they speak the best English\n\n\u2014A tundish, said the dean reflectively. That is a most interesting word. I must look that word up. Upon my word I must\n\nHis courtesy of manner rang a little false and Stephen looked at the English convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in the parable may have turned on the prodigal. A humble follower in the wake of clamorous conversions, a poor Englishman in Ireland, he seemed to have entered on the stage of jesuit history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and envy and struggle and indignity had been all but given through\u2014a late-comer, a tardy spirit. From what had he set out? Perhaps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters, seeing salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of the establishment. Had he felt the need of an implicit faith amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent schisms, six principle men, peculiar people, seed and snake baptists, supralapsarian dogmatists? Had he found the true church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like a reel of cotton some fine-spun line of reasoning upon insufflation on the imposition of hands or the procession of the Holy Ghost? Or had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him follow, like that disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, as he sat by the door of some zinc-roofed chapel, yawning and telling over his church pence?\n\nThe dean repeated the word yet again\n\n\u2014Tundish! Well now, that is interesting!\n\n\u2014The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more interesting. What is that beauty which the artist struggles to express from lumps of earth, said Stephen coldly\n\nThe little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speaking was a countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought:\n\n\u2014The language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine. How different are the words HOME, CHRIST, ALE, MASTER, on his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words without unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so foreign, will always be for me an acquired speech. I have not made or accepted its words. My voice holds them at bay. My soul frets in the shadow of his language\n\n\u2014And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime, the dean added, to distinguish between moral beauty and material beauty. And to inquire what kind of beauty is proper to each of the various arts. These are some interesting points we might take up\n\nStephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm, dry tone, was silent; and through the silence a distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the staircase\n\n\u2014In pursuing these speculations, said the dean conclusively, there is, however, the danger of perishing of inanition. First you must take your degree. Set that before you as your first aim. Then, little by little, you will see your way. I mean in every sense, your way in life and in thinking. It may be uphill pedalling at first. Take Mr Moonan. He was a long time before he got to the top. But he got there\n\n\u2014I may not have his talent, said Stephen quietly\n\n\u2014You never know, said the dean brightly. We never can say what is in us. I most certainly should not be despondent. PER ASPERA AD ASTRA\n\nHe left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to oversee the arrival of the first arts' class\n\nLeaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet briskly and impartially every Student of the class and could almost see the frank smiles of the coarser students. A desolating pity began to fall like dew upon his easily embittered heart for this faithful serving-man of the knightly Loyola, for this half-brother of the clergy, more venal than they in speech, more steadfast of soul than they, one whom he would never call his ghostly father; and he thought how this man and his companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands not of the unworldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded, during all their history, at the bar of God's justice for the souls of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent\n\nThe entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of Kentish fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on the highest tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbed windows. The calling of the roll began and the responses to the names were given out in all tones until the name of Peter Byrne was reached\n\n\u2014Here!\n\nA deep bass note in response came from the upper tier, followed by coughs of protest along the other benches\n\nThe professor paused in his reading and called the next name:\n\n\u2014Cranly!\n\nNo answer\n\n\u2014Mr Cranly!\n\nA smile flew across Stephen's face as he thought of his friend's studies\n\n\u2014Try Leopardstown! Said a voice from the bench behind\n\nStephen glanced up quickly but Moynihan's snoutish face, outlined on the grey light, was impassive. A formula was given out. Amid the rustling of the notebooks Stephen turned back again and said:\n\n\u2014Give me some paper for God's sake\n\n\u2014Are you as bad as that? asked Moynihan with a broad grin\n\nHe tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down, whispering:\n\n\u2014In case of necessity any layman or woman can do it\n\nThe formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of paper, the coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor, the spectre-like symbols of force and velocity fascinated and jaded Stephen's mind. He had heard some say that the old professor was an atheist freemason. O the grey dull day! It seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler twilight, radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe ever vaster, farther and more impalpable\n\n\u2014So we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal. Perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works of Mr W. S. Gilbert. In one of his songs he speaks of the billiard sharp who is condemned to play:\n\nOn a cloth untrue\nWith a twisted cue\nAnd elliptical billiard balls\n\n\u2014He means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the principal axes of which I spoke a moment ago\n\nMoynihan leaned down towards Stephen's ear and murmured:\n\n\u2014What price ellipsoidal balls! chase me, ladies, I'm in the cavalry!\n\nHis fellow student's rude humour ran like a gust through the cloister of Stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and caper in a sabbath of misrule. The forms of the community emerged from the gust-blown vestments, the dean of studies, the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair, the president, the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses, the squat peasant form of the professor of economics, the tall form of the young professor of mental science discussing on the landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe cropping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave troubled prefect of the sodality, the plump round-headed professor of Italian with his rogue's eyes. They came ambling and stumbling, tumbling and capering, kilting their gowns for leap frog, holding one another back, shaken with deep false laughter, smacking one another behind and laughing at their rude malice, calling to one another by familiar nicknames, protesting with sudden dignity at some rough usage, whispering two and two behind their hands\n\nThe professor had gone to the glass cases on the side wall, from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils, blew away the dust from many points and, bearing it carefully to the table, held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture. He explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound called platinoid lately discovered by F. W. Martino\n\nHe spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer. Moynihan whispered from behind:\n\n\u2014Good old Fresh Water Martin!\n\n\u2014Ask him, Stephen whispered back with weary humour, if he wants a subject for electrocution. He can have me\n\nMoynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in his bench and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand, began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin\n\n\u2014Please teacher! This boy is after saying a bad word, teacher\n\n\u2014Platinoid, the professor said solemnly, is preferred to German silver because it has a lower coefficient of resistance by changes of temperature. The platinoid wire is insulated and the covering of silk that insulates it is wound on the ebonite bobbins just where my finger is. If it were wound single an extra current would be induced in the coils. The bobbins are saturated in hot paraffin wax...\n\nA sharp Ulster voice said from the bench below Stephen:\n\n\u2014Are we likely to be asked questions on applied science?\n\nThe professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure science and applied science. A heavy-built student, wearing gold spectacles, stared with some wonder at the questioner. Moynihan murmured from behind in his natural voice:\n\n\u2014Isn't MacAlister a devil for his pound of flesh?\n\nStephen looked coldly on the oblong skull beneath him overgrown with tangled twine-coloured hair. The voice, the accent, the mind of the questioner offended him and he allowed the offence to carry him towards wilful unkindness, bidding his mind think that the student's father would have done better had he sent his son to Belfast to study and have saved something on the train fare by so doing\n\nThe oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring; for he saw in a moment the student's whey-pale face\n\n\u2014That thought is not mine, he said to himself quickly. It came from the comic Irishman in the bench behind. Patience. Can you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race was bartered and its elect betrayed\u2014by the questioner or by the mocker? Patience. Remember Epictetus. It is probably in his character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a tone and to pronounce the word SCIENCE as a monosyllable\n\nThe droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself slowly round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling, trebling, quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multiplied its ohms of resistance\n\nMoynihan's voice called from behind in echo to a distant bell:\n\n\u2014Closing time, gents!\n\nThe entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a table near the door were two photographs in frames and between them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the students, talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after another to the table. In the inner hall the dean of studies stood talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely and nodding his head\n\nStephen, checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresolutely. From under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly's dark eyes were watching him\n\n\u2014Have you signed? Stephen asked\n\nCranly closed his long thin-lipped mouth, communed with himself an instant and answered:\n\n\u2014EGO HABEO\n\n\u2014What is it for?\n\n\u2014QUOD?\n\n\u2014What is it for?\n\nCranly turned his pale face to Stephen and said blandly and bitterly:\n\n\u2014PER PAX UNIVERSALIS\n\nStephen pointed to the Tsar's photograph and said:\n\n\u2014He has the face of a besotted Christ\n\nThe scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranly's eyes back from a calm survey of the walls of the hall\n\n\u2014Are you annoyed? he asked\n\n\u2014No, answered Stephen\n\n\u2014Are you in bad humour?\n\n\u2014No\n\n\u2014CREDO UT VOS SANGUINARIUS MENDAX ESTIS, said Cranly, QUIA FACIES VOSTRA MONSTRAT UT VOS IN DAMNO MALO HUMORE ESTIS\n\nMoynihan, on his way to the table, said in Stephen's ear:\n\n\u2014MacCann is in tiptop form. Ready to shed the last drop. Brand new world. No stimulants and votes for the bitches\n\nStephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when Moynihan had passed, turned again to meet Cranly's eyes\n\n\u2014Perhaps you can tell me, he said, why he pours his soul so freely into my ear. Can you?\n\nA dull scowl appeared on Cranly's forehead. He stared at the table where Moynihan had bent to write his name on the roll, and then said flatly:\n\n\u2014A sugar!\n\n\u2014QUIS EST IN MALO HUMORE, said Stephen, EGO AUT VOS?\n\nCranly did not take up the taunt. He brooded sourly on his judgement and repeated with the same flat force:\n\n\u2014A flaming bloody sugar, that's what he is!\n\nIt was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen wondered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over his memory. The heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of hearing like a stone through a quagmire. Stephen saw it sink as he had seen many another, feeling its heaviness depress his heart. Cranly's speech, unlike that of Davin, had neither rare phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turned versions of Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays of Dublin given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an echo of the sacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by a Wicklow pulpit\n\nThe heavy scowl faded from Cranly's face as MacCann marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall\n\n\u2014Here you are! said MacCann cheerily\n\n\u2014Here I am! said Stephen\n\n\u2014Late as usual. Can you not combine the progressive tendency with a respect for punctuality?\n\n\u2014That question is out of order, said Stephen. Next business\n\nHis smiling eyes were fixed on a silver-wrapped tablet of milk chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breast-pocket. A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits. A lean student with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face between the two, glancing from one to the other at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open moist mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and began to examine it closely, turning it over and over\n\n\u2014Next business? said MacCann. Hom!\n\nHe gave a loud cough of laughter, smiled broadly and tugged twice at the straw-coloured goatee which hung from his blunt chin\n\n\u2014The next business is to sign the testimonial\n\n\u2014Will you pay me anything if I sign? asked Stephen\n\n\u2014I thought you were an idealist, said MacCann\n\nThe gipsy-like student looked about him and addressed the onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice\n\n\u2014By hell, that's a queer notion. I consider that notion to be a mercenary notion\n\nHis voice faded into silence. No heed was paid to his words. He turned his olive face, equine in expression, towards Stephen, inviting him to speak again\n\nMacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Tsar's rescript, of Stead, of general disarmament arbitration in cases of international disputes, of the signs of the times, of the new humanity and the new gospel of life which would make it the business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible the greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number\n\nThe gipsy student responded to the close of the period by crying:\n\n\u2014Three cheers for universal brotherhood!\n\n\u2014Go on, Temple, said a stout ruddy student near him. I'll stand you a pint after\n\n\u2014I'm a believer in universal brotherhood, said Temple, glancing about him out of his dark oval eyes. Marx is only a bloody cod\n\nCranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue, smiling uneasily, and repeated:\n\n\u2014Easy, easy, easy!\n\nTemple struggled to free his arm but continued, his mouth flecked by a thin foam:\n\n\u2014Socialism was founded by an Irishman and the first man in Europe who preached the freedom of thought was Collins. Two hundred years ago. He denounced priestcraft, the philosopher of Middlesex. Three cheers for John Anthony Collins!\n\nA thin voice from the verge of the ring replied:\n\n\u2014Pip! pip!\n\nMoynihan murmured beside Stephen's ear:\n\n\u2014And what about John Anthony's poor little sister:\n\nLottie Collins lost her drawers;\nWon't you kindly lend her yours?\n\nStephen laughed and Moynihan, pleased with the result, murmured again:\n\n\u2014We'll have five bob each way on John Anthony Collins\n\n\u2014I am waiting for your answer, said MacCann briefly\n\n\u2014The affair doesn't interest me in the least, said Stephen wearily. You know that well. Why do you make a scene about it?\n\n\u2014Good! said MacCann, smacking his lips. You are a reactionary, then?\n\n\u2014Do you think you impress me, Stephen asked, when you flourish your wooden sword?\n\n\u2014Metaphors! said MacCann bluntly. Come to facts\n\nStephen blushed and turned aside. MacCann stood his ground and said with hostile humour:\n\n\u2014Minor poets, I suppose, are above such trivial questions as the question of universal peace\n\nCranly raised his head and held the handball between the two students by way of a peace-offering, saying:\n\n\u2014PAX SUPER TOTUM SANGUINARIUM GLOBUM\n\nStephen, moving away the bystanders, jerked his shoulder angrily in the direction of the Tsar's image, saying:\n\n\u2014Keep your icon. If we must have a Jesus let us have a legitimate Jesus\n\n\u2014By hell, that's a good one! said the gipsy student to those about him, that's a fine expression. I like that expression immensely\n\nHe gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulping down the phrase and, fumbling at the peak of his tweed cap, turned to Stephen, saying:\n\n\u2014Excuse me, sir, what do you mean by that expression you uttered just now?\n\nFeeling himself jostled by the students near him, he said to them:\n\n\u2014I am curious to know now what he meant by that expression\n\nHe turned again to Stephen and said in a whisper:\n\n\u2014Do you believe in Jesus? I believe in man. Of course, I don't know if you believe in man. I admire you, sir. I admire the mind of man independent of all religions. Is that your opinion about the mind of Jesus?\n\n\u2014Go on, Temple, said the stout ruddy student, returning, as was his won't, to his first idea, that pint is waiting for you\n\n\u2014He thinks I'm an imbecile, Temple explained to Stephen, because I'm a believer in the power of mind\n\nCranly linked his arms into those of Stephen and his admirer and said:\n\n\u2014NOS AD MANUM BALLUM JOCABIMUS\n\nStephen, in the act of being led away, caught sight of MacCann's flushed blunt-featured face\n\n\u2014My signature is of no account, he said politely. You are right to go your way. Leave me to go mine\n\n\u2014Dedalus, said MacCann crisply, I believe you're a good fellow but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the responsibility of the human individual\n\nA voice said:\n\n\u2014Intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than in it\n\nStephen, recognizing the harsh tone of MacAlister's voice did not turn in the direction of the voice. Cranly pushed solemnly through the throng of students, linking Stephen and Temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way to the altar\n\nTemple bent eagerly across Cranly's breast and said:\n\n\u2014Did you hear MacAlister what he said? That youth is jealous of you. Did you see that? I bet Cranly didn't see that. By hell, I saw that at once\n\nAs they crossed the inner hall, the dean of studies was in the act of escaping from the student with whom he had been conversing. He stood at the foot of the staircase, a foot on the lowest step, his threadbare soutane gathered about him for the ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and repeating:\n\n\u2014Not a doubt of it, Mr Hackett! Very fine! Not a doubt of it!\n\nIn the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality was speaking earnestly, in a soft querulous voice, with a boarder. As he spoke he wrinkled a little his freckled brow and bit, between his phrases, at a tiny bone pencil\n\n\u2014I hope the matric men will all come. The first arts' men are pretty sure. Second arts, too. We must make sure of the newcomers\n\nTemple bent again across Cranly, as they were passing through the doorway, and said in a swift whisper:\n\n\u2014Do you know that he is a married man? he was a married man before they converted him. He has a wife and children somewhere. By hell, I think that's the queerest notion I ever heard! Eh?\n\nHis whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter. The moment they were through the doorway Cranly seized him rudely by the neck and shook him, saying:\n\n\u2014You flaming floundering fool! I'll take my dying bible there isn't a bigger bloody ape, do you know, than you in the whole flaming bloody world!\n\nTemple wriggled in his grip, laughing still with sly content, while Cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake:\n\n\u2014A flaming flaring bloody idiot!\n\nThey crossed the weedy garden together. The president, wrapped in a heavy loose cloak, was coming towards them along one of the walks, reading his office. At the end of the walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The students saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap. They walked forward in silence. As they neared the alley Stephen could hear the thuds of the players' hands and the wet smacks of the ball and Davin's voice crying out excitedly at each stroke\n\nThe three students halted round the box on which Davin sat to follow the game. Temple, after a few moments, sidled across to Stephen and said:\n\n\u2014Excuse me, I wanted to ask you, do you believe that Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a sincere man?\n\nStephen laughed outright. Cranly, picking up the broken stave of a cask from the grass at his feet, turned swiftly and said sternly:\n\n\u2014Temple, I declare to the living God if you say another word, do you know, to anybody on any subject, I'll kill you SUPER SPOTTUM\n\n\u2014He was like you, I fancy, said Stephen, an emotional man\n\n\u2014Blast him, curse him! said Cranly broadly. Don't talk to him at all. Sure, you might as well be talking, do you know, to a flaming chamber-pot as talking to Temple. Go home, Temple. For God's sake, go home\n\n\u2014I don't care a damn about you, Cranly, answered Temple, moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at Stephen. He's the only man I see in this institution that has an individual mind\n\n\u2014Institution! Individual! cried Cranly. Go home, blast you, for you're a hopeless bloody man\n\n\u2014I'm an emotional man, said Temple. That's quite rightly expressed. And I'm proud that I'm an emotionalist\n\nHe sidled out of the alley, smiling slyly. Cranly watched him with a blank expressionless face\n\n\u2014Look at him! he said. Did you ever see such a go-by-the-wall?\n\nHis phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student who lounged against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes. The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscular frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed both his hands delightedly over his groins\n\n\u2014Lynch is awake, said Cranly\n\nLynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward his chest\n\n\u2014Lynch puts out his chest, said Stephen, as a criticism of life\n\nLynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said:\n\n\u2014Who has anything to say about my girth?\n\nCranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle. When their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew apart, panting. Stephen bent down towards Davin who, intent on the game, had paid no heed to the talk of the others\n\n\u2014And how is my little tame goose? he asked. Did he sign, too?\n\nDavid nodded and said:\n\n\u2014And you, Stevie?\n\nStephen shook his head\n\n\u2014You're a terrible man, Stevie, said Davin, taking the short pipe from his mouth, always alone\n\n\u2014Now that you have signed the petition for universal peace, said Stephen, I suppose you will burn that little copybook I saw in your room\n\nAs Davin did not answer, Stephen began to quote:\n\n\u2014Long pace, fianna! Right incline, fianna! Fianna, by numbers, salute, one, two!\n\n\u2014That's a different question, said Davin. I'm an Irish nationalist, first and foremost. But that's you all out. You're a born sneerer, Stevie\n\n\u2014When you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks, said Stephen, and want the indispensable informer, tell me. I can find you a few in this college\n\n\u2014I can't understand you, said Davin. One time I hear you talk against English literature. Now you talk against the Irish informers. What with your name and your ideas\u2014Are you Irish at all?\n\n\u2014Come with me now to the office of arms and I will show you the tree of my family, said Stephen\n\n\u2014Then be one of us, said Davin. Why don't you learn Irish? Why did you drop out of the league class after the first lesson?\n\n\u2014You know one reason why, answered Stephen\n\nDavin tossed his head and laughed\n\n\u2014Oh, come now, he said. Is it on account of that certain young lady and Father Moran? But that's all in your own mind, Stevie. They were only talking and laughing\n\nStephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon Davin's shoulder\n\n\u2014Do you remember, he said, when we knew each other first? The first morning we met you asked me to show you the way to the matriculation class, putting a very strong stress on the first syllable. You remember? Then you used to address the jesuits as father, you remember? I ask myself about you: IS HE AS INNOCENT AS HIS SPEECH?\n\n\u2014I'm a simple person, said Davin. You know that. When you told me that night in Harcourt Street those things about your private life, honest to God, Stevie, I was not able to eat my dinner. I was quite bad. I was awake a long time that night. Why did you tell me those things?\n\n\u2014Thanks, said Stephen. You mean I am a monster\n\n\u2014No, said Davin. But I wish you had not told me\n\nA tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of Stephen's friendliness\n\n\u2014This race and this country and this life produced me, he said I shall express myself as I am\n\n\u2014Try to be one of us, repeated Davin. In heart you are an Irish man but your pride is too powerful\n\n\u2014My ancestors threw off their language and took another Stephen said. They allowed a handful of foreigners to subject them. Do you fancy I am going to pay in my own life and person debts they made? What for?\n\n\u2014For our freedom, said Davin\n\n\u2014No honourable and sincere man, said Stephen, has given up to you his life and his youth and his affections from the days of Tone to those of Parnell, but you sold him to the enemy or failed him in need or reviled him and left him for another. And you invite me to be one of you. I'd see you damned first\n\n\u2014They died for their ideals, Stevie, said Davin. Our day will come yet, believe me\n\nStephen, following his own thought, was silent for an instant\n\n\u2014The soul is born, he said vaguely, first in those moments I told you of. It has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious than the birth of the body. When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets\n\nDavin knocked the ashes from his pipe\n\n\u2014Too deep for me, Stevie, he said. But a man's country comes first. Ireland first, Stevie. You can be a poet or a mystic after\n\n\u2014Do you know what Ireland is? asked Stephen with cold violence. Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow\n\nDavin rose from his box and went towards the players, shaking his head sadly. But in a moment his sadness left him and he was hotly disputing with Cranly and the two players who had finished their game. A match of four was arranged, Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck it strongly and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer to its thud:\n\n\u2014Your soul!\n\nStephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise. Then he plucked him by the sleeve to come away. Lynch obeyed, saying:\n\n\u2014Let us eke go, as Cranly has it\n\nStephen smiled at this side-thrust\n\nThey passed back through the garden and out through the hall where the doddering porter was pinning up a hall notice in the frame. At the foot of the steps they halted and Stephen took a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and offered it to his companion\n\n\u2014I know you are poor, he said\n\n\u2014Damn your yellow insolence, answered Lynch\n\nThis second proof of Lynch's culture made Stephen smile again\n\n\u2014It was a great day for European culture, he said, when you made up your mind to swear in yellow\n\nThey lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a pause Stephen began:\n\n\u2014Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have. I say\u2014\n\nLynch halted and said bluntly:\n\n\u2014Stop! I won't listen! I am sick. I was out last night on a yellow drunk with Horan and Goggins\n\nStephen went on:\n\n\u2014Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the human sufferer. Terror is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret cause\n\n\u2014Repeat, said Lynch\n\nStephen repeated the definitions slowly\n\n\u2014A girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in London. She was on her way to meet her mother whom she had not seen for many years. At the corner of a street the shaft of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a star. A long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart. She died on the instant. The reporter called it a tragic death. It is not. It is remote from terror and pity according to the terms of my definitions\n\n\u2014The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, towards terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of it. You see I use the word ARREST. I mean that the tragic emotion is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I used the general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing\n\n\u2014You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I told you that one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside of the Venus of Praxiteles in the Museum. Was that not desire?\n\n\u2014I speak of normal natures, said Stephen. You also told me that when you were a boy in that charming carmelite school you ate pieces of dried cowdung\n\nLynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them from his pockets\n\n\u2014O, I did! I did! he cried\n\nStephen turned towards his companion and looked at him for a moment boldly in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his laughter, answered his look from his humbled eyes. The long slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought before Stephen's mind the image of a hooded reptile. The eyes, too, were reptile-like in glint and gaze. Yet at that instant, humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one tiny human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and self-embittered\n\n\u2014As for that, Stephen said in polite parenthesis, we are all animals. I also am an animal\n\n\u2014You are, said Lynch\n\n\u2014But we are just now in a mental world, Stephen continued. The desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are really not esthetic emotions not only because they are kinetic in character but also because they are not more than physical. Our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and responds to the stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex action of the nervous system. Our eyelid closes before we are aware that the fly is about to enter our eye\n\n\u2014Not always, said Lynch critically\n\n\u2014In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to the stimulus of a naked statue, but it was, I say, simply a reflex action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces, or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged, and at last dissolved by what I call the rhythm of beauty\n\n\u2014What is that exactly? asked Lynch\n\n\u2014Rhythm, said Stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a part\n\n\u2014If that is rhythm, said Lynch, let me hear what you call beauty; and, please remember, though I did eat a cake of cowdung once, that I admire only beauty\n\nStephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then, blushing slightly, he laid his hand on Lynch's thick tweed sleeve\n\n\u2014We are right, he said, and the others are wrong. To speak of these things and to try to understand their nature and, having understood it, to try slowly and humbly and constantly to express, to press out again, from the gross earth or what it brings forth, from sound and shape and colour which are the prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty we have come to understand\u2014that is art\n\nThey had reached the canal bridge and, turning from their course, went on by the trees. A crude grey light, mirrored in the sluggish water and a smell of wet branches over their heads seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought\n\n\u2014But you have not answered my question, said Lynch. What is art? What is the beauty it expresses?\n\n\u2014That was the first definition I gave you, you sleepy-headed wretch, said Stephen, when I began to try to think out the matter for myself. Do you remember the night? Cranly lost his temper and began to talk about Wicklow bacon\n\n\u2014I remember, said Lynch. He told us about them flaming fat devils of pigs\n\n\u2014Art, said Stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs and forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly\n\nLynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said:\n\n\u2014If I am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least another cigarette. I don't care about it. I don't even care about women. Damn you and damn everything. I want a job of five hundred a year. You can't get me one\n\nStephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the last one that remained, saying simply:\n\n\u2014Proceed!\n\n\u2014Aquinas, said Stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehension of which pleases\n\nLynch nodded\n\n\u2014I remember that, he said, PULCRA SUNT QUAE VISA PLACENT\n\n\u2014He uses the word VISA, said Stephen, to cover esthetic apprehensions of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing or through any other avenue of apprehension. This word, though it is vague, is clear enough to keep away good and evil which excite desire and loathing. It means certainly a stasis and not a kinesis. How about the true? It produces also a stasis of the mind. You would not write your name in pencil across the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle\n\n\u2014No, said Lynch, give me the hypotenuse of the Venus of Praxiteles\n\n\u2014Static therefore, said Stephen. Plato, I believe, said that beauty is the splendour of truth. I don't think that it has a meaning, but the true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is beheld by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the intelligible; beauty is beheld by the imagination which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sensible. The first step in the direction of truth is to understand the frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend the act itself of intellection. Aristotle's entire system of philosophy rests upon his book of psychology and that, I think, rests on his statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time and in the same connexion belong to and not belong to the same subject. The first step in the direction of beauty is to understand the frame and scope of the imagination, to comprehend the act itself of esthetic apprehension. Is that clear?\n\n\u2014But what is beauty? asked Lynch impatiently. Out with another definition. Something we see and like! Is that the best you and Aquinas can do?\n\n\u2014Let us take woman, said Stephen\n\n\u2014Let us take her! said Lynch fervently\n\n\u2014The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot, said Stephen, all admire a different type of female beauty. That seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see, however, two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every physical quality admired by men in women is in direct connexion with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier than even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that way out. It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of the maze into a new gaudy lecture-room where MacCann, with one hand on THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES and the other hand on the new testament, tells you that you admired the great flanks of Venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would give good milk to her children and yours\n\n\u2014Then MacCann is a sulphur-yellow liar, said Lynch energetically\n\n\u2014There remains another way out, said Stephen, laughing\n\n\u2014To wit? said Lynch\n\n\u2014This hypothesis, Stephen began\n\nA long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of Sir Patrick Dun's hospital covering the end of Stephen's speech with the harsh roar of jangled and rattling metal. Lynch closed his ears and gave out oath after oath till the dray had passed. Then he turned on his heel rudely. Stephen turned also and waited for a few moments till his companion's ill-humour had had its vent\n\n\u2014This hypothesis, Stephen repeated, is the other way out: that, though the same object may not seem beautiful to all people, all people who admire a beautiful object find in it certain relations which satisfy and coincide with the stages themselves of all esthetic apprehension. These relations of the sensible, visible to you through one form and to me through another, must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty. Now, we can return to our old friend saint Thomas for another pennyworth of wisdom\n\nLynch laughed\n\n\u2014It amuses me vastly, he said, to hear you quoting him time after time like a jolly round friar. Are you laughing in your sleeve?\n\n\u2014MacAlister, answered Stephen, would call my esthetic theory applied Aquinas. So far as this side of esthetic philosophy extends, Aquinas will carry me all along the line. When we come to the phenomena of artistic conception, artistic gestation, and artistic reproduction I require a new terminology and a new personal experience\n\n\u2014Of course, said Lynch. After all Aquinas, in spite of his intellect, was exactly a good round friar. But you will tell me about the new personal experience and new terminology some other day. Hurry up and finish the first part\n\n\u2014Who knows? said Stephen, smiling. Perhaps Aquinas would understand me better than you. He was a poet himself. He wrote a hymn for Maundy Thursday. It begins with the words PANGE LINGUA GLORIOSI. They say it is the highest glory of the hymnal. It is an intricate and soothing hymn. I like it; but there is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and majestic processional song, the VEXILLA REGIS of Venantius Fortunatus\n\nLynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass voice:\n\nIMPLETA SUNT QUAE CONCINIT\nDAVID FIDELI CARMINE\nDICENDO NATIONIBUS\nREGNAVIT A LIGNO DEUS\n\n\u2014That's great! he said, well pleased. Great music!\n\nThey turned into Lower Mount Street. A few steps from the corner a fat young man, wearing a silk neckcloth, saluted them and stopped\n\n\u2014Did you hear the results of the exams? he asked. Griffin was plucked. Halpin and O'Flynn are through the home civil. Moonan got fifth place in the Indian. O'Shaughnessy got fourteenth. The Irish fellows in Clark's gave them a feed last night. They all ate curry\n\nHis pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and, as he had advanced through his tidings of success, his small fat-encircled eyes vanished out of sight and his weak wheezing voice out of hearing\n\nIn reply to a question of Stephen's his eyes and his voice came forth again from their lurking-places\n\n\u2014Yes, MacCullagh and I, he said. He's taking pure mathematics and I'm taking constitutional history. There are twenty subjects. I'm taking botany too. You know I'm a member of the field club\n\nHe drew back from the other two in a stately fashion and placed a plump woollen-gloved hand on his breast from which muttered wheezing laughter at once broke forth\n\n\u2014Bring us a few turnips and onions the next time you go out, said Stephen drily, to make a stew\n\nThe fat student laughed indulgently and said:\n\n\u2014We are all highly respectable people in the field club. Last Saturday we went out to Glenmalure, seven of us\n\n\u2014With women, Donovan? said Lynch\n\nDonovan again laid his hand on his chest and said:\n\n\u2014Our end is the acquisition of knowledge. Then he said quickly:\n\n\u2014I hear you are writing some essays about esthetics\n\nStephen made a vague gesture of denial\n\n\u2014Goethe and Lessing, said Donovan, have written a lot on that subject, the classical school and the romantic school and all that. The Laocoon interested me very much when I read it. Of course it is idealistic, German, ultra-profound\n\nNeither of the others spoke. Donovan took leave of them urbanely\n\n\u2014I must go, he said softly and benevolently, I have a strong suspicion, amounting almost to a conviction, that my sister intended to make pancakes today for the dinner of the Donovan family\n\n\u2014Goodbye, Stephen said in his wake. Don't forget the turnips for me and my mate\n\nLynch gazed after him, his lip curling in slow scorn till his face resembled a devil's mask:\n\n\u2014To think that that yellow pancake-eating excrement can get a good job, he said at length, and I have to smoke cheap cigarettes!\n\nThey turned their faces towards Merrion Square and went for a little in silence\n\n\u2014To finish what I was saying about beauty, said Stephen, the most satisfying relations of the sensible must therefore correspond to the necessary phases of artistic apprehension. Find these and you find the qualities of universal beauty. Aquinas says: AD PULCRITUDINEM TRIA REQUIRUNTUR INTEGRITAS, CONSONANTIA, CLARITAS. I translate it so: THREE THINGS ARE NEEDED FOR BEAUTY, WHOLENESS, HARMONY, AND RADIANCE. Do these correspond to the phases of apprehension? Are you following?\n\n\u2014Of course, I am, said Lynch. If you think I have an excrementitious intelligence run after Donovan and ask him to listen to you\n\nStephen pointed to a basket which a butcher's boy had slung inverted on his head\n\n\u2014Look at that basket, he said\n\n\u2014I see it, said Lynch\n\n\u2014In order to see that basket, said Stephen, your mind first of all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe which is not the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended. An esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time\n\nWhat is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented in space. But, temporal or spatial, the esthetic image is first luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained upon the immeasurable background of space or time which is not it. You apprehended it as ONE thing. You see it as one whole. You apprehend its wholeness. That is INTEGRITAS\n\n\u2014Bull's eye! said Lynch, laughing. Go on\n\n\u2014Then, said Stephen, you pass from point to point, led by its formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other words, the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the analysis of apprehension. Having first felt that it is ONE thing you feel now that it is a THING. You apprehend it as complex, multiple, divisible, separable, made up of its parts, the result of its parts and their sum, harmonious. That is CONSONANTIA\n\n\u2014Bull's eye again! said Lynch wittily. Tell me now what is CLARITAS and you win the cigar\n\n\u2014The connotation of the word, Stephen said, is rather vague. Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It baffled me for a long time. It would lead you to believe that he had in mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of beauty being a light from some other world, the idea of which the matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the symbol. I thought he might mean that CLARITAS is the artistic discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a force of generalization which would make the esthetic image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. But that is literary talk. I understand it so. When you have apprehended that basket as one thing and have then analysed it according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you make the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically permissible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing. The radiance of which he speaks in the scholastic QUIDDITAS, the WHATNESS of a thing. This supreme quality is felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination. The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully to a fading coal. The instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very like to that cardiac condition which the Italian physiologist Luigi Galvani, using a phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley's, called the enchantment of the heart\n\nStephen paused and, though his companion did not speak, felt that his words had called up around them a thought-enchanted silence\n\n\u2014What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the wider sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in the literary tradition. In the marketplace it has another sense. When we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our judgement is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by the form of that art. The image, it is clear, must be set between the mind or senses of the artist himself and the mind or senses of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that art necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one to the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form wherein the artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself; the epical form, the form wherein he presents his image in mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic form, the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to others\n\n\u2014That you told me a few nights ago, said Lynch, and we began the famous discussion\n\n\u2014I have a book at home, said Stephen, in which I have written down questions which are more amusing than yours were. In finding the answers to them I found the theory of esthetic which I am trying to explain. Here are some questions I set myself: IS A CHAIR FINELY MADE TRAGIC OR COMIC? IS THE PORTRAIT OF MONA LISA GOOD IF I DESIRE TO SEE IT? IF NOT, WHY NOT?\n\n\u2014Why not, indeed? said Lynch, laughing\n\n\u2014IF A MAN HACKING IN FURY AT A BLOCK OF WOOD, Stephen continued, MAKE THERE AN IMAGE OF A COW, IS THAT IMAGE A WORK OF ART? IF NOT, WHY NOT?\n\n\u2014That's a lovely one, said Lynch, laughing again. That has the true scholastic stink\n\n\u2014Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the forms I spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are often confused. The lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and from others. The narrative is no longer purely personal. The personality of the artist passes into the narration itself, flowing round and round the persons and the action like a vital sea. This progress you will see easily in that old English ballad TURPIN HERO which begins in the first person and ends in the third person. The dramatic form is reached when the vitality which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper and intangible esthetic life. The personality of the artist, at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent narrative, finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalizes itself, so to speak. The esthetic image in the dramatic form is life purified in and reprojected from the human imagination. The mystery of esthetic, like that of material creation, is accomplished. The artist, like the God of creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails\n\n\u2014Trying to refine them also out of existence, said Lynch\n\nA fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they turned into the duke's lawn to reach the national library before the shower came\n\n\u2014What do you mean, Lynch asked surlily, by prating about beauty and the imagination in this miserable Godforsaken island? No wonder the artist retired within or behind his handiwork after having perpetrated this country\n\nThe rain fell faster. When they passed through the passage beside Kildare house they found many students sheltering under the arcade of the library. Cranly, leaning against a pillar, was picking his teeth with a sharpened match, listening to some companions. Some girls stood near the entrance door. Lynch whispered to Stephen:\n\n\u2014Your beloved is here\n\nStephen took his place silently on the step below the group of students, heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his eyes towards her from time to time. She too stood silently among her companions. She has no priest to flirt with, he thought with conscious bitterness, remembering how he had seen her last. Lynch was right. His mind emptied of theory and courage, lapsed back into a listless peace\n\nHe heard the students talking among themselves. They spoke of two friends who had passed the final medical examination, of the chances of getting places on ocean liners, of poor and rich practices\n\n\u2014That's all a bubble. An Irish country practice is better\n\n\u2014Hynes was two years in Liverpool and he says the same. A frightful hole he said it was. Nothing but midwifery cases\n\n\u2014Do you mean to say it is better to have a job here in the country than in a rich city like that? I know a fellow...\n\n\u2014Hynes has no brains. He got through by stewing, pure stewing\n\n\u2014Don't mind him. There's plenty of money to be made in a big commercial city\n\n\u2014Depends on the practice\n\n\u2014EGO CREDO UT VITA PAUPERUM EST SIMPLICITER ATROX, SIMPLICITER SANGUINARIUS ATROX, IN LIVERPOOLIO\n\nTheir voices reached his ears as if from a distance in interrupted pulsation. She was preparing to go away with her companions\n\nThe quick light shower had drawn off, tarrying in clusters of diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an exhalation was breathed forth by the blackened earth. Their trim boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade, talking quietly and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding their umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops, closing them again, holding their skirts demurely\n\nAnd if he had judged her harshly? If her life were a simple rosary of hours, her life simple and strange as a bird's life, gay in the morning, restless all day, tired at sundown? Her heart simple and wilful as a bird's heart?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTowards dawn he awoke. O what sweet music! His soul was all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration. A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how passionlessly, as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. It was that windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants open to the light and the moth flies forth silently\n\nAn enchantment of the heart! The night had been enchanted. In a dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of seraphic life. Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?\n\nThe instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstances of what had happened or of what might have happened. The instant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on cloud of vague circumstance confused form was veiling softly its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made flesh. Gabriel the seraph had come to the virgin's chamber. An afterglow deepened within his spirit, whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and ardent light. That rose and ardent light was her strange wilful heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful from before the beginning of the world; and lured by that ardent rose-like glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling from heaven\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are you not weary of ardent ways\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lure of the fallen seraphim?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tell no more of enchanted days\n\nThe verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring them over, he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass through them. The rose-like glow sent forth its rays of rhyme; ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. Its rays burned up the world, consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the rose that was her wilful heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And you have had your will of him\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are you not weary of ardent ways?\n\nAnd then? The rhythm died away, ceased, began again to move and beat. And then? Smoke, incense ascending from the altar of the world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Above the flame the smoke of praise\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goes up from ocean rim to rim\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tell no more of enchanted days\n\nSmoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury oceans, smoke of her praise. The earth was like a swinging swaying censer, a ball of incense, an ellipsoidal fall. The rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart was broken. His lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then went on stumbling through half verses, stammering and baffled; then stopped. The heart's cry was broken\n\nThe veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes of the naked window the morning light was gathering. A bell beat faintly very far away. A bird twittered; two birds, three. The bell and the bird ceased; and the dull white light spread itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight in his heart\n\nFearing to lose all, he raised himself suddenly on his elbow to look for paper and pencil. There was neither on the table; only the soup plate he had eaten the rice from for supper and the candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket, singed by the last flame. He stretched his arm wearily towards the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the coat that hung there. His fingers found a pencil and then a cigarette packet. He lay back and, tearing open the packet, placed the last cigarette on the window ledge and began to write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on the rough cardboard surface\n\nHaving written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow, murmuring them again. The lumps of knotted flock under his head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling or serious, asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with himself, confounded by the print of the Sacred Heart above the untenanted sideboard. He saw her approach him in a lull of the talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs. Then he saw himself sitting at the old piano, striking chords softly from its speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had risen again in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece a dainty song of the Elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth to depart, the victory chant of Agincourt, the happy air of Greensleeves. While he sang and she listened, or feigned to listen, his heart was at rest but when the quaint old songs had ended and he heard again the voices in the room he remembered his own sarcasm: the house where young men are called by their christian names a little too soon\n\nAt certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he had waited in vain. She passed now dancing lightly across his memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball, her white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. She danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him and, as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her hand had lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise\n\n\u2014You are a great stranger now\n\n\u2014Yes. I was born to be a monk\n\n\u2014I am afraid you are a heretic\n\n\u2014Are you much afraid?\n\nFor answer she had danced away from him along the chain of hands, dancing lightly and discreetly, giving herself to none. The white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek\n\nA monk! His own image started forth a profaner of the cloister, a heretic franciscan, willing and willing not to serve, spinning like Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino, a lithe web of sophistry and whispering in her ear\n\nNo, it was not his image. It was like the image of the young priest in whose company he had seen her last, looking at him out of dove's eyes, toying with the pages of her Irish phrase-book\n\n\u2014Yes, yes, the ladies are coming round to us. I can see it every day. The ladies are with us. The best helpers the language has\n\n\u2014And the church, Father Moran?\n\n\u2014The church too. Coming round too. The work is going ahead there too. Don't fret about the church\n\nBah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. He had done well not to salute her on the steps of the library! He had done well to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a church which was the scullery-maid of christendom\n\nRude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy from his soul. It broke up violently her fair image and flung the fragments on all sides. On all sides distorted reflections of her image started from his memory: the flower girl in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's face who had called herself his own girl and begged his handsel, the kitchen-girl in the next house who sang over the clatter of her plates, with the drawl of a country singer, the first bars of BY KILLARNEY'S LAKES AND FELLS, a girl who had laughed gaily to see him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near Cork Hill had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth, as she passed out of Jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her shoulder:\n\n\u2014Do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly eyebrows?\n\nAnd yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her image, his anger was also a form of homage. He had left the classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere, feeling that perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. He had told himself bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a figure of the womanhood of her country, a bat-like soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness, tarrying awhile, loveless and sinless, with her mild lover and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in the latticed ear of a priest. His anger against her found vent in coarse railing at her paramour, whose name and voice and features offended his baffled pride: a priested peasant, with a brother a policeman in Dublin and a brother a potboy in Moycullen. To him she would unveil her soul's shy nakedness, to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal rite rather than to him, a priest of the eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life\n\nThe radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant his bitter and despairing thoughts, their cries arising unbroken in a hymn of thanksgiving\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our broken cries and mournful lays\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rise in one eucharistic hymn\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are you not weary of ardent ways?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While sacrificing hands upraise\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The chalice flowing to the brim\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tell no more of enchanted days\n\nHe spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music and rhythm suffused his mind, turning it to quiet indulgence; then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing them; then lay back on his bolster\n\nThe full morning light had come. No sound was to be heard; but he knew that all around him life was about to awaken in common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers. Shrinking from that life he turned towards the wall, making a cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing joy in their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where he lay upwards to heaven all strewn with scarlet flowers. Weary! Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways\n\nA gradual warmth, a languorous weariness passed over him descending along his spine from his closely cowled head. He felt it descend and, seeing himself as he lay, smiled. Soon he would sleep\n\nHe had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten years before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, sending sprays of her warm breath into the night air, tapping her foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram; the lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green light of the lamp. They stood on the steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. She came up to his step many times between their phrases and went down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be!\n\nTen years from that wisdom of children to his folly. If he sent her the verses? They would be read out at breakfast amid the tapping of egg-shells. Folly indeed! Her brothers would laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with their strong hard fingers. The suave priest, her uncle, seated in his arm-chair, would hold the page at arm's length, read it smiling and approve of the literary form\n\nNo, no; that was folly. Even if he sent her the verses she would not show them to others. No, no; she could not\n\nHe began to feel that he had wronged her. A sense of her innocence moved him almost to pity her, an innocence he had never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it through sin, an innocence which she too had not understood while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of her nature had first come upon her. Then first her soul had begun to live as his soul had when he had first sinned, and a tender compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail pallor and her eyes, humbled and saddened by the dark shame of womanhood\n\nWhile his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had she been? Might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual life, that her soul at those same moments had been conscious of his homage? It might be\n\nA glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and fulfilled all his body. Conscious of his desire she was waking from odorous sleep, the temptress of his villanelle. Her eyes, dark and with a look of languor, were opening to his eyes. Her nakedness yielded to him, radiant, warm, odorous and lavish-limbed, enfolded him like a shining cloud, enfolded him like water with a liquid life; and like a cloud of vapour or like waters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech, symbols of the element of mystery, flowed forth over his brain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are you not weary of ardent ways\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lure of the fallen seraphim?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tell no more of enchanted days\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And you have had your will of him\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are you not weary of ardent ways?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Above the flame the smoke of praise\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goes up from ocean rim to rim\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tell no more of enchanted days\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our broken cries and mournful lays\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rise in one eucharistic hymn\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are you not weary of ardent ways?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While sacrificing hands upraise\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The chalice flowing to the brim\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tell no more of enchanted days\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And still you hold our longing gaze\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With languorous look and lavish limb!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are you not weary of ardent ways?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tell no more of enchanted days\n\nWhat birds were they? He stood on the steps of the library to look at them, leaning wearily on his ashplant. They flew round and round the jutting shoulder of a house in Molesworth Street. The air of the late March evening made clear their flight, their dark quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a limp-hung cloth of smoky tenuous blue\n\nHe watched their flight; bird after bird: a dark flash, a swerve, a flutter of wings. He tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd or even in number. Twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling down from the upper sky. They were flying high and low but ever round and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left to right, circling about a temple of air\n\nHe listened to the cries: like the squeak of mice behind the wainscot: a shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, falling a third or a fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. Their cry was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken light unwound from whirring spools\n\nThe inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerving round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes which still saw the image of his mother's face\n\nWhy was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an augury of good or evil? A phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shapeless thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of birds to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the air have their knowledge and know their times and seasons because they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and have not perverted that order by reason\n\nAnd for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at birds in flight. The colonnade above him made him think vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. A sense of fear of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of symbols and portents, of the hawk-like man whose name he bore soaring out of his captivity on osier-woven wings, of Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon\n\nHe smiled as he thought of the god's image for it made him think of a bottle-nosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a document which he held at arm's length, and he knew that he would not have remembered the god's name but that it was like an Irish oath. It was folly. But was it for this folly that he was about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence into which he had been born and the order of life out of which he had come?\n\nThey came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of the house, flying darkly against the fading air. What birds were they? He thought that they must be swallows who had come back from the south. Then he was to go away for they were birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes they had built to wander\n\nBend down your faces, Oona and Aleel\nI gaze upon them as the swallow gazes\nUpon the nest under the eave before\nHe wander the loud waters\n\nA soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters, of oceanic silence, of swallows flying through the sea-dusk over the flowing waters\n\nA soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft long vowels hurtled noiselessly and fell away, lapping and flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in mute chime and mute peal, and soft low swooning cry; and he felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting birds and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth from his heart like a bird from a turret, quietly and swiftly\n\nSymbol of departure or of loneliness? The verses crooned in the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remembering eyes the scene of the hall on the night of the opening of the national theatre. He was alone at the side of the balcony, looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls and at the tawdry scene-cloths and human dolls framed by the garish lamps of the stage. A burly policeman sweated behind him and seemed at every moment about to act. The catcalls and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall from his scattered fellow students\n\n\u2014A libel on Ireland!\n\n\u2014Made in Germany\n\n\u2014Blasphemy!\n\n\u2014We never sold our faith!\n\n\u2014No Irish woman ever did it!\n\n\u2014We want no amateur atheists\n\n\u2014We want no budding buddhists\n\nA sudden swift hiss fell from the windows above him and he knew that the electric lamps had been switched on in the reader's room. He turned into the pillared hall, now calmly lit, went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turnstile\n\nCranly was sitting over near the dictionaries. A thick book, opened at the frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest. He leaned back in his chair, inclining his ear like that of a confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading to him a problem from the chess page of a journal. Stephen sat down at his right and the priest at the other side of the table closed his copy of THE TABLET with an angry snap and stood up\n\nCranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely. The medical student went on in a softer voice:\n\n\u2014Pawn to king's fourth\n\n\u2014We had better go, Dixon, said Stephen in warning. He has gone to complain\n\nDixon folded the journal and rose with dignity, saying:\n\n\u2014Our men retired in good order\n\n\u2014With guns and cattle, added Stephen, pointing to the titlepage of Cranly's book on which was printed DISEASES OF THE OX\n\nAs they passed through a lane of the tables Stephen said:\n\n\u2014Cranly, I want to speak to you\n\nCranly did not answer or turn. He laid his book on the counter and passed out, his well-shod feet sounding flatly on the floor. On the staircase he paused and gazing absently at Dixon repeated:\n\n\u2014Pawn to king's bloody fourth\n\n\u2014Put it that way if you like, Dixon said\n\nHe had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a signet ring\n\nAs they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came towards them. Under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven face began to smile with pleasure and he was heard to murmur. The eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey\n\n\u2014Good evening, gentlemen, said the stubble-grown monkeyish face\n\n\u2014Warm weather for March, said Cranly. They have the windows open upstairs\n\nDixon smiled and turned his ring. The blackish, monkey-puckered face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure and its voice purred:\n\n\u2014Delightful weather for March. Simply delightful\n\n\u2014There are two nice young ladies upstairs, captain, tired of waiting, Dixon said\n\nCranly smiled and said kindly:\n\n\u2014The captain has only one love: sir Walter Scott. Isn't that so, captain?\n\n\u2014What are you reading now, captain? Dixon asked. THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR?\n\n\u2014I love old Scott, the flexible lips said, I think he writes something lovely. There is no writer can touch sir Walter Scott\n\nHe moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his sad eyes\n\nSadder to Stephen's ear was his speech: a genteel accent, low and moist, marred by errors, and, listening to it, he wondered was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in his shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous love?\n\nThe park trees were heavy with rain; and rain fell still and ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield. A game of swans flew there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with their green-white slime. They embraced softly, impelled by the grey rainy light, the wet silent trees, the shield-like witnessing lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his arm about his sister's neck. A grey woollen cloak was wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist and her fair head was bent in willing shame. He had loose red-brown hair and tender shapely strong freckled hands. Face? There was no face seen. The brother's face was bent upon her fair rain-fragrant hair. The hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was Davin's hand\n\nHe frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled mannikin who had called it forth. His father's jibes at the Bantry gang leaped out of his memory. He held them at a distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again. Why were they not Cranly's hands? Had Davin's simplicity and innocence stung him more secretly?\n\nHe walked on across the hall with Dixon, leaving Cranly to take leave elaborately of the dwarf\n\nUnder the colonnade Temple was standing in the midst of a little group of students. One of them cried:\n\n\u2014Dixon, come over till you hear. Temple is in grand form\n\nTemple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes\n\n\u2014You're a hypocrite, O'Keeffe, he said. And Dixon is a smiler. By hell, I think that's a good literary expression\n\nHe laughed slyly, looking in Stephen's face, repeating:\n\n\u2014By hell, I'm delighted with that name. A smiler\n\nA stout student who stood below them on the steps said:\n\n\u2014Come back to the mistress, Temple. We want to hear about that\n\n\u2014He had, faith, Temple said. And he was a married man too. And all the priests used to be dining there. By hell, I think they all had a touch\n\n\u2014We shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter, said Dixon\n\n\u2014Tell us, Temple, O'Keeffe said, how many quarts of porter have you in you?\n\n\u2014All your intellectual soul is in that phrase, O'Keeffe, said Temple with open scorn\n\nHe moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke to Stephen\n\n\u2014Did you know that the Forsters are the kings of Belgium? he asked\n\nCranly came out through the door of the entrance hall, his hat thrust back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth with care\n\n\u2014And here's the wiseacre, said Temple. Do you know that about the Forsters?\n\nHe paused for an answer. Cranly dislodged a figseed from his teeth on the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it intently\n\n\u2014The Forster family, Temple said, is descended from Baldwin the First, king of Flanders. He was called the Forester. Forester and Forster are the same name. A descendant of Baldwin the First, captain Francis Forster, settled in Ireland and married the daughter of the last chieftain of Clanbrassil. Then there are the Blake Forsters. That's a different branch\n\n\u2014From Baldhead, king of Flanders, Cranly repeated, rooting again deliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth\n\n\u2014Where did you pick up all that history? O'Keeffe asked\n\n\u2014I know all the history of your family, too, Temple said, turning to Stephen. Do you know what Giraldus Cambrensis says about your family?\n\n\u2014Is he descended from Baldwin too? asked a tall consumptive student with dark eyes\n\n\u2014Baldhead, Cranly repeated, sucking at a crevice in his teeth\n\n\u2014PERNOBILIS ET PERVETUSTA FAMILIA, Temple said to Stephen\n\nThe stout student who stood below them on the steps farted briefly. Dixon turned towards him, saying in a soft voice:\n\n\u2014Did an angel speak?\n\nCranly turned also and said vehemently but without anger:\n\n\u2014Goggins, you're the flamingest dirty devil I ever met, do you know\n\n\u2014I had it on my mind to say that, Goggins answered firmly. It did no one any harm, did it?\n\n\u2014We hope, Dixon said suavely, that it was not of the kind known to science as a PAULO POST FUTURUM\n\n\u2014Didn't I tell you he was a smiler? said Temple, turning right and left. Didn't I give him that name?\n\n\u2014You did. We're not deaf, said the tall consumptive\n\nCranly still frowned at the stout student below him. Then, with a snort of disgust, he shoved him violently down the steps\n\n\u2014Go away from here, he said rudely. Go away, you stinkpot. And you are a stinkpot\n\nGoggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned to his place with good humour. Temple turned back to Stephen and asked:\n\n\u2014Do you believe in the law of heredity?\n\n\u2014Are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to say? asked Cranly, facing round on him with an expression of wonder\n\n\u2014The most profound sentence ever written, Temple said with enthusiasm, is the sentence at the end of the zoology. Reproduction is the beginning of death\n\nHe touched Stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly:\n\n\u2014Do you feel how profound that is because you are a poet?\n\nCranly pointed his long forefinger\n\n\u2014Look at him! he said with scorn to the others. Look at Ireland's hope!\n\nThey laughed at his words and gesture. Temple turned on him bravely, saying:\n\n\u2014Cranly, you're always sneering at me. I can see that. But I am as good as you any day. Do you know what I think about you now as compared with myself?\n\n\u2014My dear man, said Cranly urbanely, you are incapable, do you know, absolutely incapable of thinking\n\n\u2014But do you know, Temple went on, what I think of you and of myself compared together?\n\n\u2014Out with it, Temple! the stout student cried from the steps. Get it out in bits!\n\nTemple turned right and left, making sudden feeble gestures as he spoke\n\n\u2014I'm a ballocks, he said, shaking his head in despair. I am and I know I am. And I admit it that I am\n\nDixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly:\n\n\u2014And it does you every credit, Temple\n\n\u2014But he, Temple said, pointing to Cranly, he is a ballocks, too, like me. Only he doesn't know it. And that's the only difference I see\n\nA burst of laughter covered his words. But he turned again to Stephen and said with a sudden eagerness:\n\n\u2014That word is a most interesting word. That's the only English dual number. Did you know?\n\n\u2014Is it? Stephen said vaguely\n\nHe was watching Cranly's firm-featured suffering face, lit up now by a smile of false patience. The gross name had passed over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient of injuries; and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in salute and uncover the black hair that stood stiffly from his forehead like an iron crown\n\nShe passed out from the porch of the library and bowed across Stephen in reply to Cranly's greeting. He also? Was there not a slight flush on Cranly's cheek? Or had it come forth at Temple's words? The light had waned. He could not see\n\nDid that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh comments, the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had shattered so often Stephen's ardent wayward confessions? Stephen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness also in himself. And he remembered an evening when he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking bicycle to pray to God in a wood near Malahide. He had lifted up his arms and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees, knowing that he stood on holy ground and in a holy hour. And when two constabulary men had come into sight round a bend in the gloomy road he had broken off his prayer to whistle loudly an air from the last pantomime\n\nHe began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the base of a pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait. The talk about him ceased for a moment and a soft hiss fell again from a window above. But no other sound was in the air and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes were sleeping\n\nShe had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues about him had ceased their babble. Darkness was falling\n\nDarkness falls from the air\n\nA trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy host around him. But why? Her passage through the darkening air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening sound, rich and lutelike?\n\nHe walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the end of the colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to hide his revery from the students whom he had left: and allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of Dowland and Byrd and Nash\n\nEyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that dimmed the breaking east. What was their languid grace but the softness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but the shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of memory ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud pavan, and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in Covent Garden wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and the pox-fouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that, gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again\n\nThe images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They were secret and inflaming but her image was not entangled by them. That was not the way to think of her. It was not even the way in which he thought of her. Could his mind then not trust itself? Old phrases, sweet only with a disinterred sweetness like the figseeds Cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth\n\nIt was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that her figure was passing homeward through the city. Vaguely first and then more sharply he smelt her body. A conscious unrest seethed in his blood. Yes, it was her body he smelt, a wild and languid smell, the tepid limbs over which his music had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her flesh distilled odour and a dew\n\nA louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his mind a curious phrase from CORNELIUS A LAPIDE which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by God with the other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body, ill clad, ill fed, louse-eaten, made him close his eyelids in a sudden spasm of despair and in the darkness he saw the brittle bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as they fell. Yes, and it was not darkness that fell from the air. It was brightness\n\nBrightness falls from the air\n\nHe had not even remembered rightly Nash's line. All the images it had awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth\n\nHe came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students. Well then, let her go and be damned to her! She could love some clean athlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her\n\nCranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his pocket and was eating it slowly and noisily. Temple sat on the pediment of a pillar, leaning back, his cap pulled down on his sleepy eyes. A squat young man came out of the porch, a leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. He marched towards the group, striking the flags with the heels of his boots and with the ferrule of his heavy umbrella. Then, raising the umbrella in salute, he said to all:\n\n\u2014Good evening, sirs\n\nHe struck the flags again and tittered while his head trembled with a slight nervous movement. The tall consumptive student and Dixon and O'Keeffe were speaking in Irish and did not answer him. Then, turning to Cranly, he said:\n\n\u2014Good evening, particularly to you\n\nHe moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again. Cranly, who was still chewing the fig, answered with loud movements of his jaws\n\n\u2014Good? Yes. It is a good evening\n\nThe squat student looked at him seriously and shook his umbrella gently and reprovingly\n\n\u2014I can see, he said, that you are about to make obvious remarks\n\n\u2014Um, Cranly answered, holding out what remained of the half chewed fig and jerking it towards the squat student's mouth in sign that he should eat\n\nThe squat student did not eat it but, indulging his special humour, said gravely, still tittering and prodding his phrase with his umbrella:\n\n\u2014Do you intend that...?\n\nHe broke off, pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig, and said loudly:\n\n\u2014I allude to that\n\n\u2014Um, Cranly said as before\n\n\u2014Do you intend that now, the squat student said, as IPSO FACTO or, let us say, as so to speak?\n\nDixon turned aside from his group, saying:\n\n\u2014Goggins was waiting for you, Glynn. He has gone round to the Adelphi to look for you and Moynihan. What have you there? he asked, tapping the portfolio under Glynn's arm\n\n\u2014Examination papers, Glynn answered. I give them monthly examinations to see that they are profiting by my tuition\n\nHe also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled\n\n\u2014Tuition! said Cranly rudely. I suppose you mean the barefooted children that are taught by a bloody ape like you. God help them!\n\nHe bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt\n\n\u2014I suffer little children to come unto me, Glynn said amiably\n\n\u2014A bloody ape, Cranly repeated with emphasis, and a blasphemous bloody ape!\n\nTemple stood up and, pushing past Cranly, addressed Glynn:\n\n\u2014That phrase you said now, he said, is from the new testament about suffer the children to come to me\n\n\u2014Go to sleep again, Temple, said O'Keeffe\n\n\u2014Very well, then, Temple continued, still addressing Glynn, and if Jesus suffered the children to come why does the church send them all to hell if they die unbaptized? Why is that?\n\n\u2014Were you baptized yourself, Temple? the consumptive student asked\n\n\u2014But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all to come? Temple said, his eyes searching Glynn's eyes\n\nGlynn coughed and said gently, holding back with difficulty the nervous titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every word:\n\n\u2014And, as you remark, if it is thus, I ask emphatically whence comes this thusness\n\n\u2014Because the church is cruel like all old sinners, Temple said\n\n\u2014Are you quite orthodox on that point, Temple? Dixon said suavely\n\n\u2014Saint Augustine says that about unbaptized children going to hell, Temple answered, because he was a cruel old sinner too\n\n\u2014I bow to you, Dixon said, but I had the impression that limbo existed for such cases\n\n\u2014Don't argue with him, Dixon, Cranly said brutally. Don't talk to him or look at him. Lead him home with a sugan the way you'd lead a bleating goat\n\n\u2014Limbo! Temple cried. That's a fine invention too. Like hell\n\n\u2014But with the unpleasantness left out, Dixon said\n\nHe turned smiling to the others and said:\n\n\u2014I think I am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so much\n\n\u2014You are, Glynn said in a firm tone. On that point Ireland is united\n\nHe struck the ferrule of his umbrella on the stone floor of the colonnade\n\n\u2014Hell, Temple said. I can respect that invention of the grey spouse of Satan. Hell is Roman, like the walls of the Romans, strong and ugly. But what is limbo?\n\n\u2014Put him back into the perambulator, Cranly, O'Keeffe called out\n\nCranly made a swift step towards Temple, halted, stamping his foot, crying as if to a fowl:\n\n\u2014Hoosh!\n\nTemple moved away nimbly\n\n\u2014Do you know what limbo is? he cried. Do you know what we call a notion like that in Roscommon?\n\n\u2014Hoosh! Blast you! Cranly cried, clapping his hands\n\n\u2014Neither my arse nor my elbow! Temple cried out scornfully. And that's what I call limbo\n\n\u2014Give us that stick here, Cranly said\n\nHe snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen's hand and sprang down the steps: but Temple, hearing him move in pursuit, fled through the dusk like a wild creature, nimble and fleet-footed. Cranly's heavy boots were heard loudly charging across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and spurning the gravel at each step\n\nHis step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he thrust the stick back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his arm slightly and said quietly:\n\n\u2014Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away\n\nCranly looked at him for a few moments and asked:\n\n\u2014Now?\n\n\u2014Yes, now, Stephen said. We can't speak here. Come away\n\nThey crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. The bird call from SIEGFRIED whistled softly followed them from the steps of the porch. Cranly turned, and Dixon, who had whistled, called out:\n\n\u2014Where are you fellows off to? What about that game, Cranly?\n\nThey parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of billiards to be played in the Adelphi hotel. Stephen walked on alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street opposite Maple's hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless front stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared angrily back at the softly lit drawing-room of the hotel in which he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed in calm. They thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants greeted them along the roads in the country; they knew the names of certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in high-pitched provincial voices which pierced through their skin-tight accents\n\nHow could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow over the imaginations of their daughters, before their squires begat upon them, that they might breed a race less ignoble than their own? And under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats across the dark country lanes, under trees by the edges of streams and near the pool-mottled bogs. A woman had waited in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and, offering him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed; for Davin had the mild eyes of one who could be secret. But him no woman's eyes had wooed\n\nHis arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly's voice said:\n\n\u2014Let us eke go\n\nThey walked southward in silence. Then Cranly said:\n\n\u2014That blithering idiot, Temple! I swear to Moses, do you know, that I'll be the death of that fellow one time\n\nBut his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch\n\nThey turned to the left and walked on as before. When they had gone on so for some time Stephen said:\n\n\u2014Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening\n\n\u2014With your people? Cranly asked\n\n\u2014With my mother\n\n\u2014About religion?\n\n\u2014Yes, Stephen answered\n\nAfter a pause Cranly asked:\n\n\u2014What age is your mother?\n\n\u2014Not old, Stephen said. She wishes me to make my easter duty\n\n\u2014And will you?\n\n\u2014I will not, Stephen said\n\n\u2014Why not? Cranly said\n\n\u2014I will not serve, answered Stephen\n\n\u2014That remark was made before, Cranly said calmly\n\n\u2014It is made behind now, said Stephen hotly\n\nCranly pressed Stephen's arm, saying:\n\n\u2014Go easy, my dear man. You're an excitable bloody man, do you know\n\nHe laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into Stephen's face with moved and friendly eyes, said:\n\n\u2014Do you know that you are an excitable man?\n\n\u2014I daresay I am, said Stephen, laughing also\n\nTheir minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have been drawn closer, one to the other\n\n\u2014Do you believe in the eucharist? Cranly asked\n\n\u2014I do not, Stephen said\n\n\u2014Do you disbelieve then?\n\n\u2014I neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it, Stephen answered\n\n\u2014Many persons have doubts, even religious persons, yet they overcome them or put them aside, Cranly said. Are your doubts on that point too strong?\n\n\u2014I do not wish to overcome them, Stephen answered\n\nCranly, embarrassed for a moment, took another fig from his pocket and was about to eat it when Stephen said:\n\n\u2014Don't, please. You cannot discuss this question with your mouth full of chewed fig\n\nCranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which he halted. Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter\n\nAddressing it as it lay, he said:\n\n\u2014Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire!\n\nTaking Stephen's arms, he went on again and said:\n\n\u2014Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on the day of Judgement?\n\n\u2014What is offered me on the other hand? Stephen asked. An eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies?\n\n\u2014Remember, Cranly said, that he would be glorified\n\n\u2014Ay, Stephen said somewhat bitterly, bright, agile, impassible and, above all, subtle\n\n\u2014It is a curious thing, do you know, Cranly said dispassionately, how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelieve. Did you believe in it when you were at school? I bet you did\n\n\u2014I did, Stephen answered\n\n\u2014And were you happier then? Cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?\n\n\u2014Often happy, Stephen said, and often unhappy. I was someone else then\n\n\u2014How someone else? What do you mean by that statement?\n\n\u2014I mean, said Stephen, that I was not myself as I am now, as I had to become\n\n\u2014Not as you are now, not as you had to become, Cranly repeated. Let me ask you a question. Do you love your mother?\n\nStephen shook his head slowly\n\n\u2014I don't know what your words mean, he said simply\n\n\u2014Have you never loved anyone? Cranly asked\n\n\u2014Do you mean women?\n\n\u2014I am not speaking of that, Cranly said in a colder tone. I ask you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything?\n\nStephen walked on beside his friend, staring gloomily at the footpath\n\n\u2014I tried to love God, he said at length. It seems now I failed. It is very difficult. I tried to unite my will with the will of God instant by instant. In that I did not always fail. I could perhaps do that still\u2014\n\nCranly cut him short by asking:\n\n\u2014Has your mother had a happy life?\n\n\u2014How do I know? Stephen said\n\n\u2014How many children had she?\n\n\u2014Nine or ten, Stephen answered. Some died\n\n\u2014Was your father... Cranly interrupted himself for an instant, and then said: I don't want to pry into your family affairs. But was your father what is called well-to-do? I mean, when you were growing up?\n\n\u2014Yes, Stephen said\n\n\u2014What was he? Cranly asked after a pause\n\nStephen began to enumerate glibly his father's attributes\n\n\u2014A medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur actor, a shouting politician, a small landlord, a small investor, a drinker, a good fellow, a story-teller, somebody's secretary, something in a distillery, a tax-gatherer, a bankrupt and at present a praiser of his own past\n\nCranly laughed, tightening his grip on Stephen's arm, and said:\n\n\u2014The distillery is damn good\n\n\u2014Is there anything else you want to know? Stephen asked\n\n\u2014Are you in good circumstances at present?\n\n\u2014Do I look it? Stephen asked bluntly\n\n\u2014So then, Cranly went on musingly, you were born in the lap of luxury\n\nHe used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used technical expressions, as if he wished his hearer to understand that they were used by him without conviction\n\n\u2014Your mother must have gone through a good deal of suffering, he said then. Would you not try to save her from suffering more even if... or would you?\n\n\u2014If I could, Stephen said, that would cost me very little\n\n\u2014Then do so, Cranly said. Do as she wishes you to do. What is it for you? You disbelieve in it. It is a form: nothing else. And you will set her mind at rest\n\nHe ceased and, as Stephen did not reply, remained silent. Then, as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought, he said:\n\n\u2014Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mother's love is not. Your mother brings you into the world, carries you first in her body. What do we know about what she feels? But whatever she feels, it, at least, must be real. It must be. What are our ideas or ambitions? Play. Ideas! Why, that bloody bleating goat Temple has ideas. MacCann has ideas too. Every jackass going the roads thinks he has ideas\n\nStephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech behind the words, said with assumed carelessness:\n\n\u2014Pascal, if I remember rightly, would not suffer his mother to kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex\n\n\u2014Pascal was a pig, said Cranly\n\n\u2014Aloysius Gonzaga, I think, was of the same mind, Stephen said\n\n\u2014And he was another pig then, said Cranly\n\n\u2014The church calls him a saint, Stephen objected\n\n\u2014I don't care a flaming damn what anyone calls him, Cranly said rudely and flatly. I call him a pig\n\nStephen, preparing the words neatly in his mind, continued:\n\n\u2014Jesus, too, seems to have treated his mother with scant courtesy in public but Suarez, a jesuit theologian and Spanish gentleman, has apologized for him\n\n\u2014Did the idea ever occur to you, Cranly asked, that Jesus was not what he pretended to be?\n\n\u2014The first person to whom that idea occurred, Stephen answered, was Jesus himself\n\n\u2014I mean, Cranly said, hardening in his speech, did the idea ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite, what he called the jews of his time, a whited sepulchre? Or, to put it more plainly, that he was a blackguard?\n\n\u2014That idea never occurred to me, Stephen answered. But I am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a pervert of yourself?\n\nHe turned towards his friend's face and saw there a raw smile which some force of will strove to make finely significant\n\nCranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone:\n\n\u2014Tell me the truth. Were you at all shocked by what I said?\n\n\u2014Somewhat, Stephen said\n\n\u2014And why were you shocked, Cranly pressed on in the same tone, if you feel sure that our religion is false and that Jesus was not the son of God?\n\n\u2014I am not at all sure of it, Stephen said. He is more like a son of God than a son of Mary\n\n\u2014And is that why you will not communicate, Cranly asked, because you are not sure of that too, because you feel that the host, too, may be the body and blood of the son of God and not a wafer of bread? And because you fear that it may be?\n\n\u2014Yes, Stephen said quietly, I feel that and I also fear it\n\n\u2014I see, Cranly said\n\nStephen, struck by his tone of closure, reopened the discussion at once by saying:\n\n\u2014I fear many things: dogs, horses, fire-arms, the sea, thunder-storms, machinery, the country roads at night\n\n\u2014But why do you fear a bit of bread?\n\n\u2014I imagine, Stephen said, that there is a malevolent reality behind those things I say I fear\n\n\u2014Do you fear then, Cranly asked, that the God of the Roman catholics would strike you dead and damn you if you made a sacrilegious communion?\n\n\u2014The God of the Roman catholics could do that now, Stephen said. I fear more than that the chemical action which would be set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration\n\n\u2014Would you, Cranly asked, in extreme danger, commit that particular sacrilege? For instance, if you lived in the penal days?\n\n\u2014I cannot answer for the past, Stephen replied. Possibly not\n\n\u2014Then, said Cranly, you do not intend to become a protestant?\n\n\u2014I said that I had lost the faith, Stephen answered, but not that I had lost self-respect. What kind of liberation would that be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to embrace one which is illogical and incoherent?\n\nThey had walked on towards the township of Pembroke and now, as they went on slowly along the avenues, the trees and the scattered lights in the villas soothed their minds. The air of wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort their neediness. Behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant was heard singing as she sharpened knives. She sang, in short broken bars:\n\nRosie O'Grady\n\nCranly stopped to listen, saying:\n\n\u2014MULIER CANTAT\n\nThe soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchanting touch the dark of the evening, with a touch fainter and more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of a woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed silently through the darkness: a white-robed figure, small and slender as a boy, and with a falling girdle. Her voice, frail and high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the first chanting of the passion:\n\n\u2014ET TU CUM JESU GALILAEO ERAS\n\nAnd all hearts were touched and turned to her voice, shining like a young star, shining clearer as the voice intoned the proparoxytone and more faintly as the cadence died\n\nThe singing ceased. They went on together, Cranly repeating in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain:\n\nAnd when we are married\nO, how happy we'll be\nFor I love sweet Rosie O'Grady\nAnd Rosie O'Grady loves me\n\n\u2014There's real poetry for you, he said. There's real love\n\nHe glanced sideways at Stephen with a strange smile and said:\n\n\u2014Do you consider that poetry? Or do you know what the words mean?\n\n\u2014I want to see Rosie first, said Stephen\n\n\u2014She's easy to find, Cranly said\n\nHis hat had come down on his forehead. He shoved it back and in the shadow of the trees Stephen saw his pale face, framed by the dark, and his large dark eyes. Yes. His face was handsome and his body was strong and hard. He had spoken of a mother's love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the weaknesses of their bodies and souls; and would shield them with a strong and resolute arm and bow his mind to them\n\nAway then: it is time to go. A voice spoke softly to Stephen's lonely heart, bidding him go and telling him that his friendship was coming to an end. Yes; he would go. He could not strive against another. He knew his part\n\n\u2014Probably I shall go away, he said\n\n\u2014Where? Cranly asked\n\n\u2014Where I can, Stephen said\n\n\u2014Yes, Cranly said. It might be difficult for you to live here now. But is it that makes you go?\n\n\u2014I have to go, Stephen answered\n\n\u2014Because, Cranly continued, you need not look upon yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an outlaw. There are many good believers who think as you do. Would that surprise you? The church is not the stone building nor even the clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole mass of those born into it. I don't know what you wish to do in life. Is it what you told me the night we were standing outside Harcourt Street station?\n\n\u2014Yes, Stephen said, smiling in spite of himself at Cranly's way of remembering thoughts in connexion with places. The night you spent half an hour wrangling with Doherty about the shortest way from Sallygap to Larras\n\n\u2014Pothead! Cranly said with calm contempt. What does he know about the way from Sallygap to Larras? Or what does he know about anything for that matter? And the big slobbering washing-pot head of him!\n\nHe broke into a loud long laugh\n\n\u2014Well? Stephen said. Do you remember the rest?\n\n\u2014What you said, is it? Cranly asked. Yes, I remember it. To discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit could express itself in unfettered freedom\n\nStephen raised his hat in acknowledgement\n\n\u2014Freedom! Cranly repeated. But you are not free enough yet to commit a sacrilege. Tell me would you rob?\n\n\u2014I would beg first, Stephen said\n\n\u2014And if you got nothing, would you rob?\n\n\u2014You wish me to say, Stephen answered, that the rights of property are provisional, and that in certain circumstances it is not unlawful to rob. Everyone would act in that belief. So I will not make you that answer. Apply to the jesuit theologian, Juan Mariana de Talavera, who will also explain to you in what circumstances you may lawfully Kill your king and whether you had better hand him his poison in a goblet or smear it for him upon his robe or his saddlebow. Ask me rather would I suffer others to rob me, or if they did, would I call down upon them what I believe is called the chastisement of the secular arm?\n\n\u2014And would you?\n\n\u2014I think, Stephen said, it would pain me as much to do so as to be robbed\n\n\u2014I see, Cranly said\n\nHe produced his match and began to clean the crevice between two teeth. Then he said carelessly:\n\n\u2014Tell me, for example, would you deflower a virgin?\n\n\u2014Excuse me, Stephen said politely, is that not the ambition of most young gentlemen?\n\n\u2014What then is your point of view? Cranly asked\n\nHis last phrase, sour smelling as the smoke of charcoal and disheartening, excited Stephen's brain, over which its fumes seemed to brood\n\n\u2014Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I would do and what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do and what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it call itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use\u2014silence, exile, and cunning\n\nCranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to lead him back towards Leeson Park. He laughed almost slyly and pressed Stephen's arm with an elder's affection\n\n\u2014Cunning indeed! he said. Is it you? You poor poet, you!\n\n\u2014And you made me confess to you, Stephen said, thrilled by his touch, as I have confessed to you so many other things, have I not?\n\n\u2014Yes, my child, Cranly said, still gaily\n\n\u2014You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity too\n\nCranly, now grave again, slowed his pace and said:\n\n\u2014Alone, quite alone. You have no fear of that. And you know what that word means? Not only to be separate from all others but to have not even one friend\n\n\u2014I will take the risk, said Stephen\n\n\u2014And not to have any one person, Cranly said, who would be more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest friend a man ever had\n\nHis words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature. Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some moments in silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of his own loneliness which he feared\n\n\u2014Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length\n\nCranly did not answer\n\nMARCH 20. Long talk with Cranly on the subject of my revolt\n\nHe had his grand manner on. I supple and suave. Attacked me on the score of love for one's mother. Tried to imagine his mother: cannot. Told me once, in a moment of thoughtlessness, his father was sixty-one when he was born. Can see him. Strong farmer type. Pepper and salt suit. Square feet. Unkempt, grizzled beard. Probably attends coursing matches. Pays his dues regularly but not plentifully to Father Dwyer of Larras. Sometimes talks to girls after nightfall. But his mother? Very young or very old? Hardly the first. If so, Cranly would not have spoken as he did. Old then. Probably, and neglected. Hence Cranly's despair of soul: the child of exhausted loins\n\nMARCH 21, MORNING. Thought this in bed last night but was too lazy and free to add to it. Free, yes. The exhausted loins are those of Elizabeth and Zacchary. Then he is the precursor. Item: he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs. Read locusts and wild honey. Also, when thinking of him, saw always a stern severed head or death mask as if outlined on a grey curtain or veronica. Decollation they call it in the gold. Puzzled for the moment by saint John at the Latin gate. What do I see? A decollated percursor trying to pick the lock\n\nMARCH 21, NIGHT. Free. Soul free and fancy free. Let the dead bury the dead. Ay. And let the dead marry the dead\n\nMARCH 22. In company with Lynch followed a sizeable hospital nurse. Lynch's idea. Dislike it. Two lean hungry greyhounds walking after a heifer\n\nMARCH 23. Have not seen her since that night. Unwell? Sits at the fire perhaps with mamma's shawl on her shoulders. But not peevish. A nice bowl of gruel? Won't you now?\n\nMARCH 24. Began with a discussion with my mother. Subject: B.V.M. Handicapped by my sex and youth. To escape held up relations between Jesus and Papa against those between Mary and her son. Said religion was not a lying-in hospital. Mother indulgent. Said I have a queer mind and have read too much. Not true. Have read little and understood less. Then she said I would come back to faith because I had a restless mind. This means to leave church by back door of sin and re-enter through the skylight of repentance. Cannot repent. Told her so and asked for sixpence. Got threepence\n\nThen went to college. Other wrangle with little round head rogue's eye Ghezzi. This time about Bruno the Nolan. Began in Italian and ended in pidgin English. He said Bruno was a terrible heretic. I said he was terribly burned. He agreed to this with some sorrow. Then gave me recipe for what he calls RISOTTO ALLA BERGAMASCA. When he pronounces a soft O he protrudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel. Has he? And could he repent? Yes, he could: and cry two round rogue's tears, one from each eye\n\nCrossing Stephen's, that is, my green, remembered that his countrymen and not mine had invented what Cranly the other night called our religion. A quartet of them, soldiers of the ninety-seventh infantry regiment, sat at the foot of the cross and tossed up dice for the overcoat of the crucified\n\nWent to library. Tried to read three reviews. Useless. She is not out yet. Am I alarmed? About what? That she will never be out again\n\nBlake wrote:\n\nI wonder if William Bond will die\nFor assuredly he is very ill\n\nAlas, poor William!\n\nI was once at a diorama in Rotunda. At the end were pictures of big nobs. Among them William Ewart Gladstone, just then dead. Orchestra played O WILLIE, WE HAVE MISSED YOU\n\nA race of clodhoppers!\n\nMARCH 25, MORNING. A troubled night of dreams. Want to get them off my chest\n\nA long curving gallery. From the floor ascend pillars of dark vapours. It is peopled by the images of fabulous kings, set in stone. Their hands are folded upon their knees in token of weariness and their eyes are darkened for the errors of men go up before them for ever as dark vapours\n\nStrange figures advance as from a cave. They are not as tall as men. One does not seem to stand quite apart from another. Their faces are phosphorescent, with darker streaks. They peer at me and their eyes seem to ask me something. They do not speak\n\nMARCH 30. This evening Cranly was in the porch of the library, proposing a problem to Dixon and her brother. A mother let her child fall into the Nile. Still harping on the mother. A crocodile seized the child. Mother asked it back. Crocodile said all right if she told him what he was going to do with the child, eat it or not eat It\n\nThis mentality, Lepidus would say, is indeed bred out of your mud by the operation of your sun\n\nAnd mine? Is it not too? Then into Nile mud with it!\n\nAPRIL 1. Disapprove of this last phrase\n\nAPRIL 2. Saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in Johnston's, Mooney and O'Brien's. Rather, lynx-eyed Lynch saw her as we passed. He tells me Cranly was invited there by brother. Did he bring his crocodile? Is he the shining light now? Well, I discovered him. I protest I did. Shining quietly behind a bushel of Wicklow bran\n\nAPRIL 3. Met Davin at the cigar shop opposite Findlater's church. He was in a black sweater and had a hurley stick. Asked me was it true I was going away and why. Told him the shortest way to Tara was VIA Holyhead. Just then my father came up. Introduction. Father polite and observant. Asked Davin if he might offer him some refreshment. Davin could not, was going to a meeting. When we came away father told me he had a good honest eye. Asked me why I did not join a rowing club. I pretended to think it over. Told me then how he broke Pennyfeather's heart. Wants me to read law. Says I was cut out for that. More mud, more crocodiles\n\nAPRIL 5. Wild spring. Scudding clouds. O life! Dark stream of swirling bogwater on which apple-trees have cast down their delicate flowers. Eyes of girls among the leaves. Girls demure and romping. All fair or auburn: no dark ones. They blush better. Houpla!\n\nAPRIL 6. Certainly she remembers the past. Lynch says all women do. Then she remembers the time of her childhood\u2014and mine, if I was ever a child. The past is consumed in the present and the present is living only because it brings forth the future. Statues of women, if Lynch be right, should always be fully draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her own hinder parts\n\nAPRIL 6, LATER. Michael Robartes remembers forgotten beauty and, when his arms wrap her round, he presses in his arms the loveliness which has long faded from the world. Not this. Not at all. I desire to press in my arms the loveliness which has not yet come into the world\n\nAPRIL 10. Faintly, under the heavy night, through the silence of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as a weary lover whom no caresses move, the sound of hoofs upon the road. Not so faintly now as they come near the bridge; and in a moment, as they pass the darkened windows, the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow. They are heard now far away, hoofs that shine amid the heavy night as gems, hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journey's end\u2014what heart? \u2014bearing what tidings?\n\nAPRIL 11. Read what I wrote last night. Vague words for a vague emotion. Would she like it? I think so. Then I should have to like it also\n\nAPRIL 13. That tundish has been on my mind for a long time. I looked it up and find it English and good old blunt English too. Damn the dean of studies and his funnel! What did he come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from us. Damn him one way or the other!\n\nAPRIL 14. John Alphonsus Mulrennan has just returned from the west of Ireland. European and Asiatic papers please copy. He told us he met an old man there in a mountain cabin. Old man had red eyes and short pipe. Old man spoke Irish. Mulrennan spoke Irish. Then old man and Mulrennan spoke English. Mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars. Old man sat, listened, smoked, spat. Then said:\n\n\u2014Ah, there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter end of the world\n\nI fear him. I fear his red-rimmed horny eyes. It is with him I must struggle all through this night till day come, till he or I lie dead, gripping him by the sinewy throat till... Till what? Till he yield to me? No. I mean no harm\n\nAPRIL 15. Met her today point blank in Grafton Street. The crowd brought us together. We both stopped. She asked me why I never came, said she had heard all sorts of stories about me. This was only to gain time. Asked me was I writing poems? About whom? I asked her. This confused her more and I felt sorry and mean. Turned off that valve at once and opened the spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented in all countries by Dante Alighieri. Talked rapidly of myself and my plans. In the midst of it unluckily I made a sudden gesture of a revolutionary nature. I must have looked like a fellow throwing a handful of peas into the air. People began to look at us. She shook hands a moment after and, in going away, said she hoped I would do what I said\n\nNow I call that friendly, don't you?\n\nYes, I liked her today. A little or much? Don't know. I liked her and it seems a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, all the rest before now, in fact... O, give it up, old chap! Sleep it off!\n\nAPRIL 16. Away! Away!\n\nThe spell of arms and voices: the white arms of roads, their promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that stand against the moon, their tale of distant nations. They are held out to say: We are alone\u2014come. And the voices say with them: We are your kinsmen. And the air is thick with their company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to go, shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth\n\nAPRIL 26. Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in order. She prays now, she says, that I may learn in my own life and away from home and friends what the heart is and what it feels. Amen. So be it.

at the end of the day, another battle won\nI sit down, take a look at my life, and all the things that I have done\nEven if I had the chance, I wouldn't change a thing\n\nIt's for you\nIt's for you\n\nThe world has gone crazy trying to compete\nGot my eyes on a better life, but I'm still trying to make ends meet\nIf I make some head way, just one small step at a time\nIt's for you\nIt's for you\nNobody but you\n\nI can hear the rain outside as you turn and touch my face\nAll the worries of the day are gone without a trace\nWhen I feel my love inside you, everything's allright\nAnd I wish that I could always feel, the way I feel tonight\n\nWhen I look in the mirror babe, I see these lines of doubt\nI can't help wondering what could have been\nBut I know what's truly, truly mine\nAnd everything I did today, I did with all my heart\n\nFor you\nNobody but you\n\n2 o'clock in the morning, you turn and touch my face\nAll the worries of the day, gone without a trace\nWhen I feel my arms around you, everything's allright\nBecause only you can make me feel, the way I feel tonight\n\n2 o'clock in the morning babe, you turn and touch my face\nAll the worries of the day, gone without a trace\nWhen I feel my love inside you, everything's allright\nBecause only you can make me feel, the way I feel tonight\nYou might also likeIt's for you\nIt's for youEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

mode as to not spawn any creepers\nBut I've got to make this video\nSomething's different, I can feel it\nJust a feeling I've got, like something is about to get made fun of, but I don't know what\nIf that means what I think it means, this is gonna be hilarious\nAnd if he's as carrots as you say, I'm not taking any chances\n(You're just one of a kind)\n\n{Chorus}\nI'm beginning to feel like a craft god, craft god\nAll my people mine down to the bedrock, bedrock\nNow who thinks they're cool enough for this sandbox, sandbox\nThey call me the god of Minecraft but I tell them that's Notch\n\n{Verse 1}\n\nBut if Notch is a God does that make Jeb Jesus?\nI'm an all star with a hotbar\nBombin' B-52s like a Rock Lobster\nGet my back popped from that block posture\nMakin' videos of how to make a minecart\nEver since Minecraft was not a culture\nAll the little children gettin' capes at MineCon\nI'm a teacher, like your father\nTutorials like a field trip, and I'm your chauffer\nMonsiuer, YouTube wallet, makin' profit\n\nThis parody, dare I say, isn't that hot\nYou don't really know how to make a piston stack\nWith this redstone-y track\nCraftin' a path to the back\nSo the black rack smacks Jack crack in the sack\nThat's if he had nads\nBut I don't know, never asked about it\nMy dad slapped my bad habits like rabbits eat cabbage\nBut travesties savagely, they have to be happening\nRapidly, tragically can it be possibly magic, can it be?\nYou might also likeGotta realize I'm not iconic\nLeave that to SethBling, he's better than me\nBut look at his icon, all he does is make redstone\nThat's beside the fact\nMinecrafters makin' YouTube revenue\nHere's a partnership\nWhat's left but the ego trip\nWhile new channels dismantled 'cause you can't hold a candle to StampyLongHead\n\n{Chorus}\n\n'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a craft god, craft god\nAll my people minin' to the bedrock, bedrock\nNow who thinks they're cool enough for this sandbox, sandbox\nLet me show you a time-lapse of a ship from Star Wars, Star Wars\nEverybody wants to see their favorite Pok\u00e9mon remade in this game as pixel art\n\n{Verse 2}\n\nTo be truthful it's stupid\nYouTube don't know where the views went\nHaven't made you a new video since\nSince you got schooled how to survive your first night by Paul Saures (Jr.)\nTry to start a new channel now, it'd be useless, fruitless\nNow that you've got Markiplier\nFollowed by a giant list of douches\nSee you got Sky and Lewis\nSSundee, Bajan and Captain\nSparkles, Jerome, Ballistic, Syndicate, Slamacow, Ethos and DocM\nBut if they can then so can you\nBe strong and use some persistence\nYou'll rule the MC and get invited to MineCon\nAnd win a free ride on a pig\nAnd ride it into the Nether and burst in a ball of flames\nOr play with mods or build some stuff with friends\nIt's all the same when it comes to fame\nThey think it's just a game\n'Till you ride a Diamond Minecart up the charts\nWhere people stand in line with swords to smell your farts\n\n{Bridge}\n\nSo play little boy\nGo play and create and create from June to May little boy\nConsistency is everything, more than anything\nFrom YouTube don't stray little boy\nOne day, \"that boy's great\" is what they say, little boy\nYou'll get a thumbs up, subscribers, revenue from your channel every day little boy\nHey little boy, what you make little boy?\nYouTube doesn't let me say little boy\nIf you work hard, then you'll be rewarded, movin' forward\nPut haters in their place little boy\nBasically, boy, put yourself to the test\nThe rest falls in place as success little boy 'cause\n\n{Chorus}\n\nI'm beginning to feel like a craft god, craft god\nAll my people mine down to the bedrock, bedrock\nThe way I got my hair in my face, you can call me Deadlox, Deadlox\nMake other channels sniff my crusty gym socks\nNow sit back and let me show you some command blocks- ham hocks\nHam hocks?\n\n{Verse 3}\n\nCreepers out on you, they're homing\nYou bonehead, you just exploded\nYour doom was pre-encoded\nTweet about it like Dinnerbone and\nSip on my lyric potion\nI'm super rich with all these picks and all my gold is molten\nJacked up like Michael Bolton\n\nI'm like a rapping Google, just rhyming out what parts are crucial\nWhen it updates and you snapshot yourself in the foot\nI get your views you tuna\nYou stink, my aroma is beautiful\nGot you feelin' rueful, but I'm bein' useful, a nuisance\nProducin' vids that get watched by kids so young\nThey don't get the message within\nI got dumb lines to illustrate, entertain while I'm showin' off my designs\nGot people linin' up in long lines\nLoyal to me like I'm Ralph Fiennes\nCraftin' fast to have the vid done and up by that deadline\nDo it every time, 'cept that one time\nBut I'm king of the Overworld\nWhere I make things in a field of sunshine\nGive you insight\nTake you on a knowledge-building joyride\nDesert dry you out like white wine\nNow you can't walk in a straight line\nDrink some milk, and just wait some time\nThe effect wears off, you'll be just fine\nAnd primed to take flight in the sky\nAboard my flying rig, made of slime\nSome of you whine the design's not mine but I add 1 and 2 like a plus sign\nWatch me get away with it though 'cause Eminem got you on cloud nine\n\nAnd fall down in a portal\nGet Nether wart or knock a blaze down with a sword\nAnd explore the pigman hordes\nWith a couple 'a torches, movin' forward\nYou see the lava to... fjord it\nWanna see my house, you can't afford it\nSo there's the door, go toward it\n\nBut now you see this is fantasy\n'Cause my whole fanbase is make-believe\nGot a lot of thoughts, I'm distraught\nMy plots are not hot enough to even make the shot\nMan oh man, I need to be pumpin' out videos every day on my channel\nSo that is the plan, take it straight to the bank\nHope my future is great on YouTube now, I'll be a legend\nNow I'm gonna show you how to really play Minecraft (here we go)\n\n{Hook}\n\nImma show you how to be a builder of the kind of things that take creative player's names and put them all to shame\nWhat they don't know is how to make a calculator or a mansion prob'ly couldn't even work their little head around a sandwich\nCanvas blank, I see the future, watch your channel getting neutered, all my wolves are gonna make a meal of all your old YouTubers\nAll your animated skits and all your multi-million hits, you won't be missed\nIt's time to pull your weight, survival of the fittest, 'cause the gauntlet has been thrown\nYou let me get into my zone, I am the leader of the stone, now appoint me to my throne\n\n\"Oh he's too underground\"\nWell what do you expect?\nHe's startin' out and no one knows him\nThat was a pun, those are dumb\nAnd no I don't condone them\nBreak rocks, redstone-o-clock\nPut on dubstep and make a time-lapse\n\"I don't know how to make stuff like that\"\n\"I don't know what blocks to use\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you that I've got a couple of video tutorials too\nThat will show you the way to make a mutton chop stew\nWhile you wade through a river of crap with no canoe\nDo that, an' report back, 'till then I'm just gonna have to bid you adieu\n\n{Verse 4}\n\nHnng, ride donkeys, kill zombies\nLook at the offspring of these two bunnies\nBreedin' my horse for max jumping\nI'm a villager salesmen, I sell coal for that emerald money\nIn summary, in case you were wondering\nI speak to all and sundry\nKing inside the mountain\nThe towns are now bowin' down\nI've run aground of stranger tides\nFrom the desert to the ice, I'm your guide\nYou're on a ride that's designed to give entertaining advice\nLike I'm the kind of guy you'd invite inside your mind\nI'm tryna find the right rhyme time to mine, your diamonds worldwide\n\nBut if I could ever be anything, you see\nAll I'd ask is that I could still at least be me\nBut I need a release from the stress, tee hee\nI don't really need to be an MC Emcee\nBut it's fun, like I'm stunned\nLike a new life's begun\nTake a deep breath in, and I'm ready to run\nI'll build it all night, make a minecart ride\nShow you how to build a house to take refuge inside\nWith the redstone tech shown, how to make a great bow\nSure to let your friends know that we got a great show\nPumpin' with adrenaline, throw out all the Ritalin\nTell boring YouTube channels that you're sick of them\nJust do what I say, it's not that hard\nHere's my favorite part\nStand up from your chair, put out your hands... and now you applaudEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

\u2019twere not so, of some deretane denudation with intent to excitation, caused by his retrogradation, among firearmed forces proper to this nation but apart from all titillation which, he said, was under heat pressure and a good mitigation without which in any case he insists upon being worthy of continued alimentation for him having displayed, he says, such grand toleration, reprobate so noted and all, as he was, with his washleather sweeds and his smokingstump, for denying transubstantiation nevertheless in respect of his highpowered station, whereof more especially as probably he was meantime suffering genteel tortures from the best medical attestation, as he oftentimes did, having only strength enough, by way of festination, to implore (or I believe you have might have said better) to complore, with complete obsecration, on everybody connected with him the curse of co-agulation for, he tells me outside Sammon\u2019s in King Street, after two or three hours of close confabulation, by this pewterpint of Gilbey\u2019s goatswhey which is his prime consolation, albeit involving upon the same no uncertain amount of esophagous re \u2014 gurgitation, he being personally unpreoccupied to the extent of a flea\u2019s gizzard anent eructation, if he was still extremely offen-sive to a score and four nostrils\u2019 dilatation, still he was likewise, on the other side of

Findlater, a man of estimation, summing him up to be done, be what will of excess his exaltation, still we think with Sully there can be no right extinuation for contravention of common and statute

The Porters, so to speak, after their shadowstealers in the newsbaggers, are very nice people, are they not? Very, all fourlike tellt. And on this wise, Mr, Porter (Bar-tholomew, heavy man, astern, mackerel shirt, hayamatt peruke) is an excellent forefather and Mrs Porter (leading lady, a poopahead, gaffneysaffron nightdress, iszoppy chepelure) is a most kindhearted messmother. A so united family pateramater is not more existing on papel or off of it. As keymaster fits the lock it weds so this bally builder to his streamline secret. They care for nothing except everything that is allporterous. Porto da Brozzo! Isn\u2019t that terribly nice of them? You can ken that they come of a rarely old family by their costumance and one must togive that one supped of it in all tonearts from awe to zest. I think I begin to divine so much. Only snakkest me truesome! I stone us I\u2019m hable. To reachy a skeer do! Still hoyhra, till venstra! Here are two rooms on the upstairs, at forkflank and at knifekanter. Whom in the wood are they for? Why, for little Porter babes, to be saved! The coeds, boytom thwackers and timbuy teaser. Here is one. thing you owed two noe. This one once upon awhile was the other but this is the other one nighadays. Ah so? The Corsicos? They are numerable. Guest them. Major bed, minor bickhive. Halosobuth, sov us! Who sleeps in now number one, for ex-ample? A pussy, purr esimple. Cunina, Statulina and Edulia, but how sweet of her! Has your pussy a pessname? Yes, indeed, you will hear it passim in all the noveletta and she is named Buttercup. Her bare name will tellt it, a monitress. How very sweet of her and what an excessively lovecharming missyname to forsake, now that I come to drink of it filtred, a gracecup fulled of bitterness. She is dadad\u2019s lottiest daughterpearl and brooder\u2019s cissiest auntybride. Her shellback thimblecasket mirror only can show her dearest friendeen. To speak well her grace it would ask of Grecian language, of her goodness, that legend golden. Biryina Saindua! Loreas with lillias flocaflake arrosas! Here\u2019s newyearspray, the posquiflor, a windaborne and helio-trope; there miriamsweet and amaranth and marygold to crown. Add lightest knot unto tiptition. O Charis! O Charissima! A more intriguant bambolina could one not colour up out of Boccuccia\u2019s Enameron. Would one but to do apart a lilybit her virginelles and, so, to breath, so, therebetween, behold, she had instantt with her handmade as to graps the myth inmid the air. Mother of moth! I will to show herword in flesh. Approach not for ghost sake! Itis dormition! She may think, what though little doth she realise, as morning fresheth, it hath happened her, you know what, as they too what two dare not utter. Silvoo plush, if scolded she draws a face. Petticoat\u2019s asleep but in the gentlenest of her thoughts apoo is a nursepin. To be presented, Babs for Bim-bushi? Of courts and with enticers. Up, girls, and at him! Alone? Alone what? I mean, our strifestirrer, does she do fleurty winkies with herself Pussy is never alone, as records her chambrette, for she can always look at Biddles and talk petnames with her little playfilly when she is sitting downy on the ploshmat. O, she talks, does she? Marry, how? Rosepetalletted sounds. Ah Biddles es ma plikplak. Ah plikplak wed ma Biddles. A nice jezebel bary-tinette she will gift but I much prefer her missnomer in maidenly golden lasslike gladsome wenchful flowery girlish beautycapes. So do I, much. Dulce delicatissima! Doth Dolly weeps she is hastings. Will Dally bumpsetty it is tubtime. Allaliefest, she who pities very pebbles, dare we not wish on her our thrice onsk? A lovely fear! That she seventip toe her chrysming, that she spin blue to scarlad till her temple\u2019s veil, that the Mount of Whoam it open it her to shelterer! She will blow ever so much more pro-misefuller, blee me, than all the other common marygales that romp round brigidschool, charming Carry Whambers or saucy Susy Maucepan of Merry Anna Patchbox or silly Polly Flinders. Platsch! A plikaplak.\n\nAnd since we are talking amnessly of brukasloop crazedledaze, who doez in sleeproom number twobis? The twobirds. Holy policeman, O, I see! Of what age are your birdies? They are to come of twinning age so soon as they may be born to be eldering like those olders while they are living under chairs. They are and they seem to be so tightly tattached as two maggots to touch other, I think I notice, do I not? You do. Our bright bull babe Frank Kevin is on heartsleeveside. Do not you waken him! Our farheard bode. He is happily to sleep, limb of the Lord, with his lifted in blessing, his buchel Iosa, like the blissed angel he looks so like and his mou is semiope as though he were blowdelling on a bugigle. Whene\u2019er I see those smiles in eyes \u2019tis Father Quinn again. Very shortly he will smell sweetly when he will hear a weird to wean. By gorgeous, that boy will blare some knight when he will take his dane\u2019s pledges and quit our ingletears, spite of undesirable parents, to wend him to Amorica to quest a cashy job. That keen dean with his veen nonsolance! O, I adore the profeen music! Dollarmighty! He is too audorable really, eunique! I guess to have seen somekid like him in the story book, guess I met some-where somelam to whom he will be becoming liker. But hush! How unpardonable of me! I beg for your venials, sincerely I do.\n\nHush! The other, twined on codliverside, has been crying in his sleep, making sharpshape his inscissors on some first choice sweets fished out of the muck. A stake in our mead. What a teething wretch! How his book of craven images! Here are post-humious tears on his intimelle. And he has pipettishly bespilled himself from his foundingpen as illspent from inkinghorn. He is jem job joy pip poo pat (jot um for a sobrat!) Jerry Jehu. You will know him by name in the capers but you cannot see whose heel he sheepfolds in his wrought hand because I have not told it to you. O, foetal sleep! Ah, fatal slip! the one loved, the other left, the bride of pride leased to the stranger!He will be quite within the pale when with lordbeeron brow he vows him so tosset to be of the sir Blake tribes bleak while through life\u2019s unblest he rodes backs of bannars. Are you not somewhat bulgar with your bowels? Whatever do you mean with bleak? With pale blake I write tint-ingface. O, you do? And with steelwhite and blackmail I ha\u2019scint for my sweet an anemone\u2019s letter with a gold of my bridest hair betied. Donatus his mark, address as follows. So you did? From the Cat and Cage. O, I see and see! In the ink of his sweat he will find it yet. What Gipsy Devereux vowed to Lylian and why the elm and how the stone. You never may know in the preterite all perhaps that you would not believe that you ever even saw to be about to. Perhaps. But they are two very blizky little portereens after their bredscrums, Jerkoff and Eatsup, as for my part opinion indeed. They would be born so, costarred, puck and prig, the maryboy at Donnybrook Fair, the godolphing-lad in the Hoy\u2019s Court. How frilled one shall be as at taledold of Formio and Cigalette! What folly innocents! Theirs whet pep of puppyhood! Both barmhearts shall become yeastcake by their brackfest. I will to leave a my copperwise blessing between the pair of them, for rosengorge, for greenafang. Blech and tin soldies, weals in a sniffbox. Som\u2019s wholed, all\u2019s parted. Weeping shouldst not thou be when man falls but that divine scheming ever adoring be. So you be either man or mouse and you be neither fish nor flesh. Take. And take. Vellicate nyche! Be ones as wes for gives for gives now the hour of passings sembles quick with quelled. Adieu, soft adieu, for these nice presents, kerryjevin. Still tosorrow!\n\nJeminy, what is the view which now takes up a second position of discordance, tell it please? Mark! You notice it in that rereway because the male entail partially eclipses the femecovert. It is so called for its discord the meseedo. Do you ever heard the story about Helius Croesus, that white and gold elephant in our zoopark? You astonish me by it. Is it not that we are commanding from fullback, woman permitting, a profusely fine birdseye view from beauhind this park? Finn his park has been much the admiration of all the stranger ones, grekish and romanos, who arrive to here. The straight road down the centre (see relief map) bisexes the park which is said to be the largest of his kind in the world. On the right prominence confronts you the handsome vinesregent\u2019s lodge while, turning to the other supreme piece of cheeks, exactly opposite, you are confounded by the equally hand-some chief sacristary\u2019s residence. Around is a little amiably tufted and man is cheered when he bewonders through the boskage how the nature in all frisko is enlivened by gentlemen\u2019s seats. Here are heavysuppers \u2014 \u2019tis for daddies housings for hun-dredaires of our super thin thousand. By gum, but you have resin! Of these tallworts are yielded out juices for jointoils and pappasses for paynims. Listeneth! \u2019Tis a tree story. How olave, that firile, was aplantad in her liveside. How tannoboom held tonobloom. How rood in norlandes. The black and blue marks athwart the weald, which now barely is so stripped, indicate the presence of sylvious beltings. Therewithal shady rides lend themselves out to rustic cavalries. In yonder valley, too, stays mountain sprite. Any pretty dears are to be caught inside but it is a bad pities of the plain. A scarlet pimparnell now mules the mound where anciently first murders were wanted to take root. By feud fionghalian. Talkingtree and sinningstone stay on either hand. Hystorical leavesdroppings may also be gar-nered up with sir Shamus Swiftpatrick, Archfieldchaplain of Saint Lucan\u2019s. How familiar it is to see all these interesting advenements with one snaked\u2019s eyes! Is all? Yet not. Hear one\u2019s. At the bodom fundus of this royal park, which, with tvigate shyasian gardeenen, is open to the public till night at late, so well the sissastrides so will the pederestians, do not fail to point to yourself a depression called Holl Hollow. It is often quite guttergloomering in our duol and gives wankyrious thoughts to the head but the banders of the pentapolitan poleetsfurcers bassoons into it on windy woodensdays their wellbooming wolvertones. Ulvos! Ulvos!\n\nWhervolk dorst ttou begin to tremble by our moving pictures at this moment when I am to place my hand of our true friend-shapes upon thee knee to mark well what I say?

The hammers are telling the cobbles, the pickts are hacking the saxums, it\u2019s snugger to burrow abed than ballet on broadway. Tuck in your blank! For it\u2019s race pound race the hosties rear all roads to ruin and layers by lifetimes laid down riches from poormen. Cried unions to chip, saltpetre to strew, gallpitch to drink, stonebread to break but it\u2019s bully to gulp good blueberry pudding. Doze in your warmth! While the elves in the moonbeams, feeling why, will keep my lilygem gently gleaming.\nIn the sleepingchambers. The court to go into half morning.

Those twelve chief barons to stand by duedesmally with their folded arums and put down all excursions and false alarums and after that to go back now to their runameat farums and re-compile their magnum chartarums with the width of the road between them and all harrums. The maidbrides all, in favours gay, to strew sleety cinders on their falling hair and for wouldbe joybells to ring sadly ringless hands. The dame dowager to stay kneeled how she is, as first mutherer with cord in coil. The two princes of the tower royal, daulphin and deevlin, to lie how they are without to see. The dame dowager\u2019s duffgerent to present wappon, blade drawn to the full and about wheel without to be seen of them. The infant Isabella from her coign to do obeisance toward the duffgerent, as first futherer with drawn brand. Then the court to come in to full morning.

He, he, he! At that do you leer, a setting up? With a such unfettered belly? Two cascades? I leer (O my big, O my bog, O my bigbagbone!) because I must see a buntingcap of so a pinky on the point. It is for a true glover\u2019s greetings and many burgesses by us, greats and grosses, uses to pink it in this way at tet-at-tet.

He is considered to have committed, invoking droit d\u2019oreiller, simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin, and to be practising for unnatural coits with Eugenius and Jere-mias, two or three philadelphians. Honophrius, Felicia, Eugenius and Jeremias are consanguineous to the lowest degree. Anita the wife of Honophrius, has been told by her tirewoman, For-tissa, that Honuphrius has blasphemously confessed under volun \u2014 tary chastisement that he has instructed his slave, Mauritius, to ur;, e Magravius, a commercial, emulous of Honuphrius, to solicit the chastity of Anita. Anita is informed by some illegitimate children of Fortissa with Mauritius (the supposition is Ware\u2019s) that Gillia, the schismatical wife of Magravius, is visited clandes-tinely by Barnabas, the advocate of Honuphrius, an immoral person who has been corrupted by Jeremias. Gillia, (a cooler blend, D\u2019Alton insists) ex equo with Poppea, Arancita, Clara, Marinuzza, Indra and Iodina, has been tenderly debauched (in Halliday\u2019s view), by Honuphrius, and Magravius knows from spies that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege with Michael, vulgo Cerularius, a perpetual curate, who wishes to seduce Eugenius. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested by Sulla, an orthodox savage (and leader of a band of twelve mercenaries, the Sullivani), who desires to procure Felicia for Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Macdugalius, four excavators, if she will not yield to him and also deceive Honuphrius by ren-dering conjugal duty when demanded. Anita who claims to have discovered incestuous temptations from Jeremias and Eugenius would yield to the lewdness of Honuphrius to appease the savagery of Sulla and the mercernariness of the twelve Sullivani, and (as Gilbert at first suggested), to save the virginity of Felicia for Magravius when converted by Michael after the death of Gillia, but she fears that, by allowing his marital rights she may cause reprehensible conduct between Eugenius and Jeremias. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispen-ses her from yielding to Honuphrius who pretends publicly to possess his conjunct in thirtynine several manners (turpiter! affirm ex cathedris Gerontes Cambronses) for camal hygiene whenever he has rendered himself impotent to consummate by subdolence. Anita is disturbed but Michael comminates that he will reserve her case tomorrow for the ordinary Guglielmus even if she should practise a pious fraud during affrication which, from experience, she knows (according to Wadding), to be leading to nullity. Fortissa, however, is encouraged by Gregorius, Leo, Viteilius, and Magdugalius, reunitedly, to warn Anita by describing the strong chastisements of Honuphrius and the depravities (turpissimas!) of Canicula, the deceased wife of Mauritius, with Sulla, the simoniac, who is abnegand and repents. Has he hegemony and shall she submit?\n\nTranslate a lax, you breed a bradaun. In the goods of Cape and Chattertone, deceased.\n\nThis, lay readers and gentilemen, is perhaps the commonest of all cases arising out of umbrella history in connection with the wood industries in our courts of litigation. D\u2019Oyly Owens holds (though Finn Magnusson of himself holds also) that so long as there is a joint deposit account in the two names a mutual obligation is posited. Owens cites Brerfuchs and Warren, a foreign firm, since disseized, registered as Tangos, Limited, for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The action which was at the instance of the trustee of the heathen church emergency fund, suing by its trustee, a resigned civil servant, for the pay-ment of tithes due was heard by Judge Doyle and also by a com \u2014 mon jury. No question arose as to the debt for which vouchers spoke volumes. The defence alleged that payment had been made effective. The fund trustee, one Jucundus Fecundus Xero Pecun-dus Coppercheap, counterclaimed that payment was invalid having been tendered to creditor under cover of a crossed cheque, signed in the ordinary course, in the name of Wieldhelm, Hurls Cross, voucher copy provided, and drawn by the senior partner only by whom the lodgment of the species had been effected but in their joint names. The bank particularised, the national misery (now almost entirely in the hands of the four chief bondholders for value in Tangos), declined to pay the draft, though there were ample reserves to meet the liability, whereupon the trusty Coppercheap negociated it for and on behalf of the fund of the thing to a client of his, a notary, from whom, on consideration, he received in exchange legal relief as between trusthee and bethrust, with thanks. Since then the cheque, a good washable pink, em-bossed D you D No 11 hundred and thirty 2, good for the figure and face, had been circulating in the country for over thirtynine years among holders of Pango stock, a rival concern, though not one demonetised farthing had ever spun or fluctuated across the counter in the semblance of hard coin or liquid cash. The jury (a sour dozen of stout fellows all of whom were curiously named after doyles) naturally disagreed jointly and severally, and the belligerent judge, disagreeing with the allied jurors\u2019 disagree-ment, went outside his jurisfiction altogether and ordered a gar \u2014 nishee attachment to the neutral firm. No mandamus could lo \u2014 cate the depleted whilom Breyfawkes as he had entered into an ancient moratorium, dating back to the times of the early barters, and only the junior partner Barren could be found, who entered an appearance and turned up, upon a notice of motion and after service of the motion by interlocutory injunction, among the male jurors to be an absolete turfwoman, originally from the proletarian class, with still a good title to her sexname of Ann Doyle, 2 Coppinger\u2019s Cottages, the Doyle\u2019s country. Doyle (Ann), add woman in, having regretfully left the juryboxers, protested cheerfully on the stand in a long jurymiad in re corset checks, delivered in doy-lish, that she had often, in supply to brusk demands rising almost to bollion point, discounted Mr Brakeforth\u2019s first of all in ex-change at nine months from date without issue and, to be strictly literal, unbottled in corrubberation a current account of how she had been made at sight for services rendered the payee-drawee of unwashable blank assignations, sometimes pinkwilliams (laughter) but more often of the cr\u0160me-de-citron, vair \u201amail paon-coque or marshmallow series, which she, as bearer, used to en \u2014 dorse, adhesively, to her various payers-drawers who in most cases were identified by the timber papers as wellknown tetigists of the city and suburban. The witness, at her own request, asked if she might and wrought something between the sheets of music paper which she had accompanied herself with for the occasion and this having been handed up for the bench to look at in camera, Coppinger\u2019s doll, as she was called, (annias, Mack Erse\u2019s Dar, the adopted child) then proposed to jerrykin and jureens and every jim, jock and jarry in that little green courtinghousie for her satis-faction and as a whole act of settlement to reamalgamate herself, tomorrow perforce, in pardonership with the permanent suing fond trustee, Monsignore Pepigi, under the new style of Will Break-fast and Sparrem, as, when all his cognisances had been estreated, he seemed to proffer the steadiest interest towards her, but this prepoposal was ruled out on appeal by Judge Jeremy Doyler, who, reserving judgment in a matter of courts and reversing the find-ings of the lower correctional, found, beyond doubt of treuson, fending the dissassents of the pickpackpanel, twelve as upright judaces as ever let down their thoms, and, occupante extremum scabie, handed down to the jury of the Liffey that, as a matter of tact, the woman they gave as free was born into contractual incapacity (the Calif of Man v the Eaudelusk Company) when, how and where mamy\u2019s mancipium act did not apply and therefore held supremely that, as no property in law can exist in a corpse, (Hal Kilbride v Una Bellina) Pepigi\u2019s pact was pure piffle (loud laughter) and Wharrem would whistle for the rhino.

Gaze at him now in momentum! As his bridges are blown to babbyrags, by the lee of his hulk upright on her orbits, and the heave of his juniper arx in action, he\u2019s naval I see. Poor little tartanelle, her dinties are chattering, the strait\u2019s she\u2019s in, the bulloge she bears! Her smirk is smeeching behind for her hills. By the queer quick twist of her mobcap and the lift of her shift at random and the rate of her gate of going the pace, two thinks at a time, her country I\u2019m proud of. The field is down, the race is their own. The galleonman jovial on his bucky brown nightmare. Bigrob dignagging his lylyputtana. One to one bore one! The datter, io, io, sleeps in peace, in peace. And the twillingsons, ganymede, garrymore, turn in trot and trot. But old pairamere goes it a gallop, a gallop. Bossford and phospherine. One to one on!\n\nO, O, her fairy setalite!

But the tarrant\u2019s brand on his hottoweyt brow. At half past quick in the morning. And her lamp was all askew and a trumbly wick-inher, ringeysingey. She had to spofforth, she had to kicker, too thick of the wick of her pixy\u2019s loomph, wide lickering jessup the smooky shiminey.

Others are as tired of themselves as you are. Let each one learn to bore himself. It is strictly re- quested that no cobsmoking, spitting, pubchat, wrastle rounds, coarse courting, smut, etc, will take place amongst those hours so devoted to repose. Look before behind before you strip you. Disrobe clothed in the strictest secrecy which privacy can afford. Water non to be discharged coram grate or ex window.

Since Allan Rogue loved Arrah Pogue it\u2019s all Killdoughall fair. Triss! Only trees such as these such were those, waving there, the barketree, the o\u2019briertree, the rowantree, the o\u2019corneltree, the behanshrub near windy arbour, the magill o\u2019dendron more.

Two pretty mistletots ribboned to a tree, up rose libe-rator and, fancy, they were free! Four witty missywives, wink \u2014 ing under hoods, made lasses like lads love maypoleriding and dotted our green with tricksome couples, fiftyfifty, their chil-tren\u2019s hundred. So childish pence took care of parents\u2019 pounds and many made money the way in the world where rushroads to riches crossed slums of lice and, the cause of it all, he forged himself ahead like a blazing urbanorb, brewing treble to drown grief, giving and taking mayom and tuam, playing milliards with his three golden balls, making party capital out of landed self-interest, light on a slavey but weighty on the bourse, our hugest commercial emporialist, with his sons booing home from afar and his daughters bridling up at his side. Finner!\n\nHow did he bank it up, swank it up, the whaler in the punt, a guinea by a groat, his index on the balance and such wealth into the bargain, with the boguey which he snatched in the baggage coach ahead? Going forth on the prowl, master jackill, under night and creeping back, dog to hide, over morning. Humbly to fall and cheaply to rise, exposition of failures. Through Duffy\u2019s blunders and MacKenna\u2019s insurance for upper ten and lower five the band played on. As one generation tells another. Ofter the fall. First for a change of a seven days license he wandered out of his farmer\u2019s health and so lost his early parishlife. Then (\u2019twas in fenland) occidentally of a sudden, six junelooking flamefaces straggled wild out of their turns through his parsonfired wicket, showing all shapes of striplings in sleepless tights. Promptly whomafter in undated times, very properly a dozen generations anterior to themselves, a main chanced to burst and misflooded his fortunes, wrothing foulplay over his fives\u2019 court and his fine poultryyard wherein were spared a just two of a feather in wading room only. Next, upon due reflotation, up started four hurrigan gales to smithereen his plateglass house-walls and the slate for accounts his keeper was cooking. Then came three boy buglehorners who counterbezzled and cross-bugled him. Later on in the same evening two hussites ab \u2014 sconded through a breach in his bylaws and left him, the infidels, to pay himself off in kind remembrances. Till, ultimatehim, fell the crowning barleystraw, when an explosium of his distilleries deafadumped all his dry goods to his most favoured sinflute and dropped him, what remains of a heptark, leareyed and letterish, weeping worrybound on his bankrump.\n\nPepep. Pay bearer, sure and sorry, at foot of ohoho honest policist. On never again, by Phoenis, swore on him Lloyd\u2019s, not for beaten wheat, not after Sir Joe Meade\u2019s father, thanks! They know him, the covenanter, by rote at least, for a chameleon at last, in his true falseheaven colours from ultraviolent to subred tissues. That\u2019s his last tryon to march through the grand tryomphal arch. His reignbolt\u2019s shot. Never again! How you do that like, Mista Chimepiece? You got nice yum plemyums. Pray-paid my promishles!\n\nAgreed, Wu Welsher, he was chogfulled to beacsate on earn as in hiving, of foxold conningnesses but who, hey honey, for all values of his latters, integer integerrimost, was the formast of the firm?

joint\nA guy from Nebraska against a guy from Namibia\nA woman was outside on the curb crying\nTwo men were consoling her by her side\nTwo men were consoling her by her side\nI walked out and asked if everyone was alright\nThey said, \"We're okay, thank you for asking\"\n\"You too, have a good night\"\nI went and sang some songs at the chapel\nWith some interesting other singers\nLike Blag Dahlia from the Dwarves and the classy Bob Davenport\nWhen I finished singing my songs\nA girl approached me and said, \"Hey\"\nI said, \"You look familiar, how do I know you?\"\nShe said, \"You don't know me, my name is Vivian\nAnd I really enjoyed your singing\"\nI said, \"Thank you\" and I shook her hand\nShe said, \"I listened to your music more than I ever slept\"\nI had no reply to that, then she nodded to her friend\nThen I reached for your hand, then she smiled then she left\n\nThough my hardwood floors are getting creaky\nThough an unexpected cat's meow can get me shaking\nThough I dehydrate quickly when I'm leaf raking\nThough I fall asleep less than I'm waking\nThough my guitar tubes are oxidizing\nThough with age I'm prioritizing my workload and my socializing\nThough it used to be nothing\nI'm realizing it's now all getting more tiring\nThough Mayweather is retiring\nThough my old lamps need rewiring\nThough my testosterone is expiring\nThough movie directors are no longer calling\nMy ears were ringing so I went and met you\nFor a dinner at the Big Four\nAs we got to walk out the door\nA woman said, \"Hey mister, you dropped your wallet on the floor\"\nMy jacket hit a glass, it fell to the floor and it crashed\nEverybody looked startled as if our names were Jaymes and Bartles\nI said, \"Hey, it's a tight space, spare me your pity\nComing from your facelifted faces\nThis could have happened to each and every one of you too\"\nThe waiter hurried over, said \"We're gonna have to ask you to leave, sir\"\nI said \"Hey, I was leaving anyhow\nThat's the last time you're going to see a bad guy like this, that's for sure\"\nThank you Antonio Montana, from a prison in Havana\nFrom a boat across the Atlantic to a mansion in Miami\nThough these words may need

summer staycation\nWe attended a relative's cremation\nHer bereaved husband sat there trembling with his cane\nOur hearts were broken\nHer picture was so beautiful and so youthful\nEveryone was mournful and tearful\nThen his grandchildren walked him to the car at the end of the lawn\nFlowers were waiting\nThough so many there were grieving\nThere was no doubt and no denying\nOf a love undying, of an undying love\n\nThough some may find my specifying agonizing and trying\nLong-winded and unsatisfying\nOthers may find it hypnotizing, comforting, and inspiring\nRelatable and consoling\nI went to the bookstore the other day\nThe counter girl was scratching at her hand\nShe said she thought that it was itching because of all the cash that she'd been handling\nI said, \"It could be that, or depending on where you've been\nIt might also be bedbugs\"\nAnd she looked at me with surprised and starstruck eyes\nShe asked, \"Are you like the real, like the actual, Mark Kozelek?\"\nI said, \"Yes, I am that man\"\nShe said, \"Oh my god, I'm like a really, really big fan\"\nThen she said, \"We should totally go to Panera\"\nI replied, \"There's a Panera Bread in San Francisco?\"\nShe said, \"No, there's not a Panera Bread in San Francisco\nEven if there was, I'd never meet you there anyhow\"\nAnd someone said, \"Actually there is a Panera Bread in San Francisco\nOn Geary and Masonic\"\nAnd she said, \"Well, I was just kidding anyhow\"\nAnd then suddenly there was an awkward silence\nAt first, I thought she was the nicest\nThen suddenly she seemed cold as ISIS\nAnd this didn't sit well on my midlife crisis\nThen her boss came over and threw a wet blanket on the good vibes\nHe said, \"Sir, can I ask you, are you even planning to buy a book?\"\nI said, \"Well I was, but this store smells like an old barn full of old Amish musty quilts\"\nHe said, \"That will be enough of that language, sir\"\nI said, \"Okay, but I came in here well-intentioned\nAnd that mean-spirited counter girl of yours totally hurt my feelings\"\nHe asked what had she done that I found so demeaning\nI said, \"She engaged me and then for no reason at all, venomously stung me\"\nHe said, \"You might be overanalyzing\nThat you're exaggerating or bold-faced lying\"\nI said, \"No, I'm not dramatizing, fictionalizing, or even slightly modifying\"\nHe said, \"I think your brain may need rewiring\"\nI said, \"I think the two of you are co-conspiring\"\nThen they laughed and they looked down at their phones\nThen I walked out the door and was on my way home\nThen as I walked along the road, my mind hypothesizing\nWhat could have went so wrong in this liberal vegan bookstore\nSpecializing in Charles Bukowski but doesn't carry the new Mike Tyson biography?\nThen a sort of happiness overcame me as I began realizing\nThat for a connection I'll never stop trying\nEven if it results in my eyes crying\nWhen I stop caring is when I'm dead inside\nMy heart was now reviving\nMy lips were now a-smiling\nThen these words I began compiling\nAnd a melody started forming3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

say\n\nIf I only had some time\nIt would be all right\nBut I have to be this\nStargazer every night\nWhile I'm dancing in the beam of a laser light\nI'm dying, I'm trying\nShe said that she'd find somebody new\nTo understand this crazy man\nIs more than she can do\n\nShe's sorry it had to be this way\nBut then again, it's just another\nPrice to pay\n\nIf I only had some time\nIt would be all right\nBut I have to be this\nStargazer every night\nWhile I'm dancing in the beam of a laser light\nI'm dying, I'm trying\n\nOh, you gotta believe in something\nYou gotta love her true\nOh, you gotta believe in someone\nAnd crazy as it seems\nOh, you always believed in me\n\nIf I only had some time, it would be all right\nBut I have to be this stargazer every night\nWhile I'm dancing in the beam
