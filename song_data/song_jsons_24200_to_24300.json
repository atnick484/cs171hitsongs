were missing\nShe'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing\nScreamin'\n[Chorus]\nNo, we're never gonna quit\nAin't nothing wrong with it\nJust acting like we're animals

in\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're beside me on the seat\nGot your hand between my knees\nAnd you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze\nIt's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear\nBut I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears\nBy now, no doubt that we were heading south\nI guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth\n'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch\nIt felt so good I almost drove into the ditch\nI'm screamin'\n\n[Chorus]\nNo, we're never gonna quit\nAin't nothing wrong with it\nJust acting like we're animals

else knows where we are\"\nAnd that was when she started screamin'\n\"That's my dad outside the car!\"\nOh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition\nMust have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions\nI guess they knew that she was missing\nAs I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing\nScreamin'\n\n[Chorus]\nNo, we're never gonna quit\nAin't nothing wrong

football guys twice their size\nCheerleaders hiding the grey in their hair\nThe names were the same but the faces had changed\nI didn't recognize anyone there\n[Chorus]\nThat used to be us, we used to be cool\nWith the music cranked up, hanging out after school\nThat used to be Jill, that used to be Joe\nTell me where in the world did we all go\nThat used to be us\nOh, that used to be us\n\n[Verse 2]\nI had a drink with some buds\nPlayed a lot of catch up\nDanced with my date from the prom\nBut as hard as I tried until I closed my eyes\nEverybody I knew was gone\nThere was Mr. Finch, he taught English and French\nHe was dancing with a couple of canes\nAnd that homecoming queen, yeah the girl of my dreams\nShe didn't even remember my name\n\n[Chorus]\nThat used to be us, we used to be cool\nWith the music cranked up, hanging out after school\nThat used to be Jill, that used to be Joe\nTell me where in the world did we all go\nThat used to be us\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nAs I

Dickens", "lyrics": "A New Lodger LyricsThe long vacation saunters on towards term-time like an idle river very leisurely strolling down a flat country to the sea. Mr. Guppy saunters along with it congenially. He has blunted the blade of his penknife and broken the point off by sticking that instrument into his desk in every direction. Not that he bears the desk any ill will, but he must do something, and it must be something of an unexciting nature, which will lay neither his physical nor his intellectual energies under too heavy contribution. He finds that nothing agrees with him so well as to make little gyrations on one leg of his stool, and stab his desk, and gape.\n\nKenge and Carboy are out of town, and the articled clerk has taken out a shooting license and gone down to his father's, and Mr. Guppy's two fellow-stipendiaries are away on leave. Mr. Guppy and Mr. Richard Carstone divide the dignity of the office. But Mr. Carstone is for the time being established in Kenge's room, whereat Mr. Guppy chafes. So exceedingly that he with biting sarcasm informs his mother, in the confidential moments when he sups with her off a lobster and lettuce in the Old Street Road, that he is afraid the office is hardly good enough for swells, and that if he had known there was a swell coming, he would have got it painted.\n\nMr. Guppy suspects everybody who enters on the occupation of a stool in Kenge and Carboy's office of entertaining, as a matter of course, sinister designs upon him. He is clear that every such person wants to depose him. If he be ever asked how, why, when, or wherefore, he shuts up one eye and shakes his head. On the strength of these profound views, he in the most ingenious manner takes infinite pains to counterplot when there is no plot, and plays the deepest games of chess without any adversary.\n\nIt is a source of much gratification to Mr. Guppy, therefore, to find the new-comer constantly poring over the papers in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, for he well knows that nothing but confusion and failure can come of that. His satisfaction communicates itself to a third saunterer through the long vacation in Kenge and Carboy's office, to wit, Young Smallweed.\n\nWhether Young Smallweed (metaphorically called Small and eke Chick Weed, as it were jocularly to express a fledgling) was ever a boy is much doubted in Lincoln's Inn. He is now something under fifteen and an old limb of the law. He is facetiously understood to entertain a passion for a lady at a cigar-shop in the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane and for her sake to have broken off a contract with another lady, to whom he had been engaged some years. He is a town-made article, of small stature and weazen features, but may be perceived from a considerable distance by means of his very tall hat. To become a Guppy is the object of his ambition. He dresses at that gentleman (by whom he is patronized), talks at him, walks at him, founds himself entirely on him. He is honoured with Mr. Guppy's particular confidence and occasionally advises him, from the deep wells of his experience, on difficult points in private life.\n\nMr. Guppy has been lolling out of window all the morning after trying all the stools in succession and finding none of them easy, and after several times putting his head into the iron safe with a notion of cooling it. Mr. Smallweed has been twice dispatched for effervescent drinks, and has twice mixed them in the two official tumblers and stirred them up with the ruler. Mr. Guppy propounds for Mr. Smallweed's consideration the paradox that the more you drink the thirstier you are and reclines his head upon the window-sill in a state of hopeless languor.\nWhile thus looking out into the shade of Old Square, Lincoln's Inn, surveying the intolerable bricks and mortar, Mr. Guppy becomes conscious of a manly whisker emerging from the cloistered walk below and turning itself up in the direction of his face. At the same time, a low whistle is wafted through the Inn and a suppressed voice cries, \"Hip! Gup-py!\"\n\n\"Why, you don't mean it!\" says Mr. Guppy, aroused. \"Small! Here's Jobling!\" Small's head looks out of window too and nods to Jobling.\n\n\"Where have you sprung up from?\" inquires Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"From the market-gardens down by Deptford. I can't stand it any longer. I must enlist. I say! I wish you'd lend me half a crown. Upon my soul, I'm hungry.\"\n\nJobling looks hungry and also has the appearance of having run to seed in the market-gardens down by Deptford.\n\n\"I say! Just throw out half a crown if you have got one to spare. I want to get some dinner.\"\n\n\"Will you come and dine with me?\" says Mr. Guppy, throwing out the coin, which Mr. Jobling catches neatly.\n\n\"How long should I have to hold out?\" says Jobling.\n\n\"Not half an hour. I am only waiting here till the enemy goes, returns Mr. Guppy, butting inward with his head.\n\n\"What enemy?\"\n\n\"A new one. Going to be articled. Will you wait?\"\n\n\"Can you give a fellow anything to read in the meantime?\" says Mr. Jobling.\n\nSmallweed suggests the law list. But Mr. Jobling declares with much earnestness that he \"can't stand it.\"\n\"You shall have the paper,\" says Mr. Guppy. \"He shall bring it down. But you had better not be seen about here. Sit on our staircase and read. It's a quiet place.\"\n\nJobling nods intelligence and acquiescence. The sagacious Smallweed supplies him with the newspaper and occasionally drops his eye upon him from the landing as a precaution against his becoming disgusted with waiting and making an untimely departure. At last the enemy retreats, and then Smallweed fetches Mr. Jobling up.\n\n\"Well, and how are you?\" says Mr. Guppy, shaking hands with him.\n\n\"So, so. How are you?\"\n\nMr. Guppy replying that he is not much to boast of, Mr. Jobling ventures on the question, \"How is SHE?\" This Mr. Guppy resents as a liberty, retorting, \"Jobling, there ARE chords in the human mind\u2014\" Jobling begs pardon.\n\n\"Any subject but that!\" says Mr. Guppy with a gloomy enjoyment of his injury. \"For there ARE chords, Jobling\u2014\"\n\nMr. Jobling begs pardon again.\n\nDuring this short colloquy, the active Smallweed, who is of the dinner party, has written in legal characters on a slip of paper, \"Return immediately.\" This notification to all whom it may concern, he inserts in the letter-box, and then putting on the tall hat at the angle of inclination at which Mr. Guppy wears his, informs his patron that they may now make themselves scarce.\n\nAccordingly they betake themselves to a neighbouring dining-house, of the class known among its frequenters by the denomination slap-bang, where the waitress, a bouncing young female of forty, is supposed to have made some impression on the susceptible Smallweed, of whom it may be remarked that he is a weird changeling to whom years are nothing. He stands precociously possessed of centuries of owlish wisdom. If he ever lay in a cradle, it seems as if he must have lain there in a tail-coat. He has an old, old eye, has Smallweed; and he drinks and smokes in a monkeyish way; and his neck is stiff in his collar; and he is never to be taken in; and he knows all about it, whatever it is. In short, in his bringing up he has been so nursed by Law and Equity that he has become a kind of fossil imp, to account for whose terrestrial existence it is reported at the public offices that his father was John Doe and his mother the only female member of the Roe family, also that his first long-clothes were made from a blue bag.\n\nInto the dining-house, unaffected by the seductive show in the window of artificially whitened cauliflowers and poultry, verdant baskets of peas, coolly blooming cucumbers, and joints ready for the spit, Mr. Smallweed leads the way. They know him there and defer to him. He has his favourite box, he bespeaks all the papers, he is down upon bald patriarchs, who keep them more than ten minutes afterwards. It is of no use trying him with anything less than a full-sized \"bread\" or proposing to him any joint in cut unless it is in the very best cut. In the matter of gravy he is adamant.\n\nConscious of his elfin power and submitting to his dread experience, Mr. Guppy consults him in the choice of that day's banquet, turning an appealing look towards him as the waitress repeats the catalogue of viands and saying \"What do YOU take, Chick?\" Chick, out of the profundity of his artfulness, preferring \"veal and ham and French beans\u2014and don't you forget the stuffing, Polly\" (with an unearthly cock of his venerable eye), Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling give the like order. Three pint pots of half-and-half are superadded. Quickly the waitress returns bearing what is apparently a model of the Tower of Babel but what is really a pile of plates and flat tin dish-covers. Mr. Smallweed, approving of what is set before him, conveys intelligent benignity into his ancient eye and winks upon her. Then, amid a constant coming in, and going out, and running about, and a clatter of crockery, and a rumbling up and down of the machine which brings the nice cuts from the kitchen, and a shrill crying for more nice cuts down the speaking-pipe, and a shrill reckoning of the cost of nice cuts that have been disposed of, and a general flush and steam of hot joints, cut and uncut, and a considerably heated atmosphere in which the soiled knives and tablecloths seem to break out spontaneously into eruptions of grease and blotches of beer, the legal triumvirate appease their appetites.\n\nMr. Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere adornment might require. His hat presents at the rims a peculiar appearance of a glistening nature, as if it had been a favourite snail-promenade. The same phenomenon is visible on some parts of his coat, and particularly at the seams. He has the faded appearance of a gentleman in embarrassed circumstances; even his light whiskers droop with something of a shabby air.\n\nHis appetite is so vigorous that it suggests spare living for some little time back. He makes such a speedy end of his plate of veal and ham, bringing it to a close while his companions are yet midway in theirs, that Mr. Guppy proposes another. \"Thank you, Guppy,\" says Mr. Jobling, \"I really don't know but what I WILL take another.\"\nAnother being brought, he falls to with great goodwill.\n\nMr. Guppy takes silent notice of him at intervals until he is half way through this second plate and stops to take an enjoying pull at his pint pot of half-and-half (also renewed) and stretches out his legs and rubs his hands. Beholding him in which glow of contentment, Mr. Guppy says, \"You are a man again, Tony!\"\n\n\"Well, not quite yet,\" says Mr. Jobling. \"Say, just born.\"\n\n\"Will you take any other vegetables? Grass? Peas? Summer cabbage?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Guppy,\" says Mr. Jobling. \"I really don't know but what I WILL take summer cabbage.\"\n\nOrder given; with the sarcastic addition (from Mr. Smallweed) of \"Without slugs, Polly!\" And cabbage produced.\n\n\"I am growing up, Guppy,\" says Mr. Jobling, plying his knife and fork with a relishing steadiness.\n\n\"Glad to hear it.\"\n\n\"In fact, I have just turned into my teens,\" says Mr. Jobling.\n\nHe says no more until he has performed his task, which he achieves as Messrs. Guppy and Smallweed finish theirs, thus getting over the ground in excellent style and beating those two gentlemen easily by a veal and ham and a cabbage.\n\n\"Now, Small,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"what would you recommend about pastry?\"\n\n\"Marrow puddings,\" says Mr. Smallweed instantly.\n\n\"Aye, aye!\" cries Mr. Jobling with an arch look. \"You're there, are you? Thank you, Mr. Guppy, I don't know but what I WILL take a marrow pudding.\"\n\nThree marrow puddings being produced, Mr. Jobling adds in a pleasant humour that he is coming of age fast. To these succeed, by command of Mr. Smallweed, \"three Cheshires,\" and to those \"three small rums.\" This apex of the entertainment happily reached, Mr. Jobling puts up his legs on the carpeted seat (having his own side of the box to himself), leans against the wall, and says, \"I am grown up now, Guppy. I have arrived at maturity.\"\n\n\"What do you think, now,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"about\u2014you don't mind Smallweed?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world. I have the pleasure of drinking his good health.\"\n\n\"Sir, to you!\" says Mr. Smallweed.\n\n\"I was saying, what do you think NOW,\" pursues Mr. Guppy, \"of enlisting?\"\n\n\"Why, what I may think after dinner,\" returns Mr. Jobling, \"is one thing, my dear Guppy, and what I may think before dinner is another thing. Still, even after dinner, I ask myself the question, What am I to do? How am I to live? Ill fo manger, you know,\" says Mr. Jobling, pronouncing that word as if he meant a necessary fixture in an English stable. \"Ill fo manger. That's the French saying, and mangering is as necessary to me as it is to a Frenchman. Or more so.\"\n\nMr. Smallweed is decidedly of opinion \"much more so.\"\n\n\"If any man had told me,\" pursues Jobling, \"even so lately as when you and I had the frisk down in Lincolnshire, Guppy, and drove over to see that house at Castle Wold\u2014\"\n\nMr. Smallweed corrects him\u2014Chesney Wold.\n\n\"Chesney Wold. (I thank my honourable friend for that cheer.) If any man had told me then that I should be as hard up at the present time as I literally find myself, I should have\u2014well, I should have pitched into him,\" says Mr. Jobling, taking a little rum-and-water with an air of desperate resignation; \"I should have let fly at his head.\"\n\n\"Still, Tony, you were on the wrong side of the post then,\" remonstrates Mr. Guppy. \"You were talking about nothing else in the gig.\"\n\n\"Guppy,\" says Mr. Jobling, \"I will not deny it. I was on the wrong side of the post. But I trusted to things coming round.\"\n\nThat very popular trust in flat things coming round! Not in their being beaten round, or worked round, but in their \"coming\" round! As though a lunatic should trust in the world's \"coming\" triangular!\n\n\"I had confident expectations that things would come round and be all square,\" says Mr. Jobling with some vagueness of expression and perhaps of meaning too. \"But I was disappointed. They never did. And when it came to creditors making rows at the office and to people that the office dealt with making complaints about dirty trifles of borrowed money, why there was an end of that connexion. And of any new professional connexion too, for if I was to give a reference to-morrow, it would be mentioned and would sew me up. Then what's a fellow to do? I have been keeping out of the way and living cheap down about the market-gardens, but what's the use of living cheap when you have got no money? You might as well live dear.\"\n\n\"Better,\" Mr. Smallweed thinks.\n\n\"Certainly. It's the fashionable way; and fashion and whiskers have been my weaknesses, and I don't care who knows it,\" says Mr. Jobling. \"They are great weaknesses\u2014Damme, sir, they are great. Well,\" proceeds Mr. Jobling after a defiant visit to his rum-and-water, \"what can a fellow do, I ask you, BUT enlist?\"\n\nMr. Guppy comes more fully into the conversation to state what, in his opinion, a fellow can do. His manner is the gravely impressive manner of a man who has not committed himself in life otherwise than as he has become the victim of a tender sorrow of the heart.\n\n\"Jobling,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"myself and our mutual friend Smallweed\u2014\"\n\nMr. Smallweed modestly observes, \"Gentlemen both!\" and drinks.\n\n\"\u2014Have had a little conversation on this matter more than once since you\u2014\"\n\n\"Say, got the sack!\" cries Mr. Jobling bitterly. \"Say it, Guppy. You mean it.\"\n\n\"No-o-o! Left the Inn,\" Mr. Smallweed delicately suggests.\n\n\"Since you left the Inn, Jobling,\" says Mr. Guppy; \"and I have mentioned to our mutual friend Smallweed a plan I have lately thought of proposing. You know Snagsby the stationer?\"\n\n\"I know there is such a stationer,\" returns Mr. Jobling. \"He was not ours, and I am not acquainted with him.\"\n\n\"He IS ours, Jobling, and I AM acquainted with him,\" Mr. Guppy retorts. \"Well, sir! I have lately become better acquainted with him through some accidental circumstances that have made me a visitor of his in private life. Those circumstances it is not necessary to offer in argument. They may\u2014or they may not\u2014have some reference to a subject which may\u2014or may not\u2014have cast its shadow on my existence.\"\n\nAs it is Mr. Guppy's perplexing way with boastful misery to tempt his particular friends into this subject, and the moment they touch it, to turn on them with that trenchant severity about the chords in the human mind, both Mr. Jobling and Mr. Smallweed decline the pitfall by remaining silent.\n\n\"Such things may be,\" repeats Mr. Guppy, \"or they may not be. They are no part of the case. It is enough to mention that both Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are very willing to oblige me and that Snagsby has, in busy times, a good deal of copying work to give out. He has all Tulkinghorn's, and an excellent business besides. I believe if our mutual friend Smallweed were put into the box, he could prove this?\"\n\nMr. Smallweed nods and appears greedy to be sworn.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen of the jury,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"\u2014I mean, now, Jobling\u2014you may say this is a poor prospect of a living. Granted. But it's better than nothing, and better than enlistment. You want time. There must be time for these late affairs to blow over. You might live through it on much worse terms than by writing for Snagsby.\"\n\nMr. Jobling is about to interrupt when the sagacious Smallweed checks him with a dry cough and the words, \"Hem! Shakspeare!\"\n\n\"There are two branches to this subject, Jobling,\" says Mr. Guppy. \"That is the first. I come to the second. You know Krook, the Chancellor, across the lane. Come, Jobling,\" says Mr. Guppy in his encouraging cross-examination-tone, \"I think you know Krook, the Chancellor, across the lane?\"\n\n\"I know him by sight,\" says Mr. Jobling.\n\n\"You know him by sight. Very well. And you know little Flite?\"\n\n\"Everybody knows her,\" says Mr. Jobling.\n\n\"Everybody knows her. VERY well. Now it has been one of my duties of late to pay Flite a certain weekly allowance, deducting from it the amount of her weekly rent, which I have paid (in consequence of instructions I have received) to Krook himself, regularly in her presence. This has brought me into communication with Krook and into a knowledge of his house and his habits. I know he has a room to let. You may live there at a very low charge under any name you like, as quietly as if you were a hundred miles off. He'll ask no questions and would accept you as a tenant at a word from me\u2014before the clock strikes, if you chose. And I tell you another thing, Jobling,\" says Mr. Guppy, who has suddenly lowered his voice and become familiar again, \"he's an extraordinary old chap\u2014always rummaging among a litter of papers and grubbing away at teaching himself to read and write, without getting on a bit, as it seems to me. He is a most extraordinary old chap, sir. I don't know but what it might be worth a fellow's while to look him up a bit.\"\n\n\"You don't mean\u2014\" Mr. Jobling begins.\n\n\"I mean,\" returns Mr. Guppy, shrugging his shoulders with becoming modesty, \"that I can't make him out. I appeal to our mutual friend Smallweed whether he has or has not heard me remark that I can't make him out.\"\n\nMr. Smallweed bears the concise testimony, \"A few!\"\n\n\"I have seen something of the profession and something of life, Tony,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"and it's seldom I can't make a man out, more or less. But such an old card as this, so deep, so sly, and secret (though I don't believe he is ever sober), I never came across. Now, he must be precious old, you know, and he has not a soul about him, and he is reported to be immensely rich; and whether he is a smuggler, or a receiver, or an unlicensed pawnbroker, or a money-lender\u2014all of which I have thought likely at different times\u2014it might pay you to knock up a sort of knowledge of him. I don't see why you shouldn't go in for it, when everything else suits.\"\n\nMr. Jobling, Mr. Guppy, and Mr. Smallweed all lean their elbows on the table and their chins upon their hands, and look at the ceiling. After a time, they all drink, slowly lean back, put their hands in their pockets, and look at one another.\n\n\"If I had the energy I once possessed, Tony!\" says Mr. Guppy with a sigh. \"But there are chords in the human mind\u2014\"\n\nExpressing the remainder of the desolate sentiment in rum-and-water, Mr. Guppy concludes by resigning the adventure to Tony Jobling and informing him that during the vacation and while things are slack, his purse, \"as far as three or four or even five pound goes,\" will be at his disposal. \"For never shall it be said,\" Mr. Guppy adds with emphasis, \"that William Guppy turned his back upon his friend!\"\n\nThe latter part of the proposal is so directly to the purpose that Mr. Jobling says with emotion, \"Guppy, my trump, your fist!\" Mr. Guppy presents it, saying, \"Jobling, my boy, there it is!\" Mr. Jobling returns, \"Guppy, we have been pals now for some years!\" Mr. Guppy replies, \"Jobling, we have.\"\n\nThey then shake hands, and Mr. Jobling adds in a feeling manner, \"Thank you, Guppy, I don't know but what I WILL take another glass for old acquaintance sake.\"\n\n\"Krook's last lodger died there,\" observes Mr. Guppy in an incidental way.\n\n\"Did he though!\" says Mr. Jobling.\n\n\"There was a verdict. Accidental death. You don't mind that?\"\n\n\"No,\" says Mr. Jobling, \"I don't mind it; but he might as well have died somewhere else. It's devilish odd that he need go and die at MY place!\" Mr. Jobling quite resents this liberty, several times returning to it with such remarks as, \"There are places enough to die in, I should think!\" or, \"He wouldn't have liked my dying at HIS place, I dare say!\"\n\nHowever, the compact being virtually made, Mr. Guppy proposes to dispatch the trusty Smallweed to ascertain if Mr. Krook is at home, as in that case they may complete the negotiation without delay. Mr. Jobling approving, Smallweed puts himself under the tall hat and conveys it out of the dining-rooms in the Guppy manner. He soon returns with the intelligence that Mr. Krook is at home and that he has seen him through the shop-door, sitting in the back premises, sleeping \"like one o'clock.\"\n\n\"Then I'll pay,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"and we'll go and see him. Small, what will it be?\"\n\nMr. Smallweed, compelling the attendance of the waitress with one hitch of his eyelash, instantly replies as follows: \"Four veals and hams is three, and four potatoes is three and four, and one summer cabbage is three and six, and three marrows is four and six, and six breads is five, and three Cheshires is five and three, and four half-pints of half-and-half is six and three, and four small rums is eight and three, and three Pollys is eight and six. Eight and six in half a sovereign, Polly, and eighteenpence out!\"\n\nNot at all excited by these stupendous calculations, Smallweed dismisses his friends with a cool nod and remains behind to take a little admiring notice of Polly, as opportunity may serve, and to read the daily papers, which are so very large in proportion to himself, shorn of his hat, that when he holds up the Times to run his eye over the columns, he seems to have retired for the night and to have disappeared under the bedclothes.\n\nMr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling repair to the rag and bottle shop, where they find Krook still sleeping like one o'clock, that is to say, breathing stertorously with his chin upon his breast and quite insensible to any external sounds or even to gentle shaking. On the table beside him, among the usual lumber, stand an empty gin-bottle and a glass. The unwholesome air is so stained with this liquor that even the green eyes of the cat upon her shelf, as they open and shut and glimmer on the visitors, look drunk.\n\n\"Hold up here!\" says Mr. Guppy, giving the relaxed figure of the old man another shake. \"Mr. Krook! Halloa, sir!\"\n\nBut it would seem as easy to wake a bundle of old clothes with a spirituous heat smouldering in it. \"Did you ever see such a stupor as he falls into, between drink and sleep?\" says Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"If this is his regular sleep,\" returns Jobling, rather alarmed, \"it'll last a long time one of these days, I am thinking.\"\n\n\"It's always more like a fit than a nap,\" says Mr. Guppy, shaking him again. \"Halloa, your lordship! Why, he might be robbed fifty times over! Open your eyes!\"\n\nAfter much ado, he opens them, but without appearing to see his visitors or any other objects. Though he crosses one leg on another, and folds his hands, and several times closes and opens his parched lips, he seems to all intents and purposes as insensible as before.\n\n\"He is alive, at any rate,\" says Mr. Guppy. \"How are you, my Lord Chancellor. I have brought a friend of mine, sir, on a little matter of business.\"\n\nThe old man still sits, often smacking his dry lips without the least consciousness. After some minutes he makes an attempt to rise. They help him up, and he staggers against the wall and stares at them.\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Krook?\" says Mr. Guppy in some discomfiture. \"How do you do, sir? You are looking charming, Mr. Krook. I hope you are pretty well?\"\n\nThe old man, in aiming a purposeless blow at Mr. Guppy, or at nothing, feebly swings himself round and comes with his face against the wall. So he remains for a minute or two, heaped up against it, and then staggers down the shop to the front door. The air, the movement in the court, the lapse of time, or the combination of these things recovers him. He comes back pretty steadily, adjusting his fur cap on his head and looking keenly at them.\n\n\"Your servant, gentlemen; I've been dozing. Hi! I am hard to wake, odd times.\"\n\n\"Rather so, indeed, sir,\" responds Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"What? You've been a-trying to do it, have you?\" says the suspicious Krook.\n\n\"Only a little,\" Mr. Guppy explains.\n\nThe old man's eye resting on the empty bottle, he takes it up, examines it, and slowly tilts it upside down.\n\n\"I say!\" he cries like the hobgoblin in the story. \"Somebody's been making free here!\"\n\n\"I assure you we found it so,\" says Mr. Guppy. \"Would you allow me to get it filled for you?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly I would!\" cries Krook in high glee. \"Certainly I would! Don't mention it! Get it filled next door\u2014Sol's Arms\u2014the Lord Chancellor's fourteenpenny. Bless you, they know ME!\"\n\nHe so presses the empty bottle upon Mr. Guppy that that gentleman, with a nod to his friend, accepts the trust and hurries out and hurries in again with the bottle filled. The old man receives it in his arms like a beloved grandchild and pats it tenderly.\n\n\"But, I say,\" he whispers, with his eyes screwed up, after tasting it, \"this ain't the Lord Chancellor's fourteenpenny. This is eighteenpenny!\"\n\n\"I thought you might like that better,\" says Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"You're a nobleman, sir,\" returns Krook with another taste, and his hot breath seems to come towards them like a flame. \"You're a baron of the land.\"\n\nTaking advantage of this auspicious moment, Mr. Guppy presents his friend under the impromptu name of Mr. Weevle and states the object of their visit. Krook, with his bottle under his arm (he never gets beyond a certain point of either drunkenness or sobriety), takes time to survey his proposed lodger and seems to approve of him. \"You'd like to see the room, young man?\" he says. \"Ah! It's a good room! Been whitewashed. Been cleaned down with soft soap and soda. Hi! It's worth twice the rent, letting alone my company when you want it and such a cat to keep the mice away.\"\n\nCommending the room after this manner, the old man takes them upstairs, where indeed they do find it cleaner than it used to be and also containing some old articles of furniture which he has dug up from his inexhaustible stores. The terms are easily concluded\u2014for the Lord Chancellor cannot be hard on Mr. Guppy, associated as he is with Kenge and Carboy, Jarndyce and Jarndyce, and other famous claims on his professional consideration\u2014and it is agreed that Mr. Weevle shall take possession on the morrow. Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy then repair to Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, where the personal introduction of the former to Mr. Snagsby is effected and (more important) the vote and interest of Mrs. Snagsby are secured. They then report progress to the eminent Smallweed, waiting at the office in his tall hat for that purpose, and separate, Mr. Guppy explaining that he would terminate his little entertainment by standing treat at the play but that there are chords in the human mind which would render it a hollow mockery.\n\nOn the morrow, in the dusk of evening, Mr. Weevle modestly appears at Krook's, by no means incommoded with luggage, and establishes himself in his new lodging, where the two eyes in the shutters stare at him in his sleep, as if they were full of wonder. On the following day Mr. Weevle, who is a handy good-for-nothing kind of young fellow, borrows a needle and thread of Miss Flite and a hammer of his landlord and goes to work devising apologies for window-curtains, and knocking up apologies for shelves, and hanging up his two teacups, milkpot, and crockery sundries on a pennyworth of little hooks, like a shipwrecked sailor making the best of it.\n\nBut what Mr. Weevle prizes most of all his few possessions (next after his light whiskers, for which he has an attachment that only whiskers can awaken in the breast of man) is a choice collection of copper-plate impressions from that truly national work The Divinities of Albion, or Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty, representing ladies of title and fashion in every variety of smirk that art, combined with capital, is capable of producing. With these magnificent portraits, unworthily confined in a band-box during his seclusion among the market-gardens, he decorates his apartment; and as the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty wears every variety of fancy dress, plays every variety of musical instrument, fondles every variety of dog, ogles every variety of prospect, and is backed up by every variety of flower-pot and balustrade, the result is very imposing.\n\nBut fashion is Mr. Weevle's, as it was Tony Jobling's, weakness. To borrow yesterday's paper from the Sol's Arms of an evening and read about the brilliant and distinguished meteors that are shooting across the fashionable sky in every direction is unspeakable consolation to him. To know what member of what brilliant and distinguished circle accomplished the brilliant and distinguished feat of joining it yesterday or contemplates the no less brilliant and distinguished feat of leaving it to-morrow gives him a thrill of joy. To be informed what the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty is about, and means to be about, and what Galaxy marriages are on the tapis, and what Galaxy rumours are in circulation, is to become acquainted with the most glorious destinies of mankind. Mr. Weevle reverts from this intelligence to the Galaxy portraits implicated, and seems to know the originals, and to be known of them.\n\nFor the rest he is a quiet lodger, full of handy shifts and devices as before mentioned, able to cook and clean for himself as well as to carpenter, and developing social inclinations after the shades of evening have fallen on the court. At those times, when he is not visited by Mr. Guppy or by a small light in his likeness quenched in a dark hat, he comes out of his dull room\u2014where he has inherited the deal wilderness of desk bespattered with a rain of ink\u2014and talks to Krook or is \"very free,\" as they call it in the court, commendingly, with any one disposed for conversation. Wherefore, Mrs. Piper, who leads the court, is impelled to offer two remarks to Mrs. Perkins: firstly, that if her Johnny was to have whiskers, she could wish 'em to be identically like that young man's; and secondly, \"Mark my words, Mrs. Perkins, ma'am, and don't you be surprised, Lord bless you, if that young man comes in at last for old Krook's money!\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/16242", "artist_names": "De La Soul (Ft.

brawl\nCatch a stray, but you could visit the pound if you want it, dog\nI'm in Longside, New Jersey, low, gun involved\nI read ya town's population, and nigga, who are you gonna call?\n'cause Dre, ya town small as shit\nAnd I brought a drum for all 2931 of y'all\nI'm gunning for, you know that John bitch like Gotti's girl\nI stick him up until his insides settle and top'll twirl\nAs for your bitch, yeah, miracles happen, he got a girl\nAnd she petite, you threw The Weeknd on, made her body twirl\nShe started ridin' as soon as it came on, Bobby's World\nA lot of niggas is talkin' with no proportion shit\nBut you even gotta pay a price when you die, you heard of coffins, bitch\nIt's fuck the world twice, nigga, seems unfortunate\nBut if I'm such a dick, hop off of it\nMorning, bitch\nOne round down\nWoosah\n[Round 1: Dre Dennis]\nThis nigga was too quick to snatch a rack\nThey wouldn't even let this nigga on Smack\nWhy y'all let him back to battle rap\nYou might've started the PG Step, but bitch I made it great\nAnyone that mentions the shit, they be sayin' Dre\nURL was like making facial changes on a created player, they help you save ya face\nThey was tryin' to protect the kid from the Step like a baby gate\nMy gorillas get ugly in the hood, these is Bathing Apes\nFat nigga, I'll bow ya head over food, nigga, say ya grace\nFuck a one on one, me and my gun

like he got impeached (peach)\nThese niggas with little heart thinking they could ride along\nYoung guns ain't really workin', but they swear they tommy strong\nMy mindset like using a public bathroom and shitting there inside the stall\nBecause I don't wanna leave 'til until everybody gone\n\n[Round 2: Prez Mafia]\nNiggas done gave me the short end of the stick, I'm talking loyalty that, y'know

"Missing You Lyrics[Verse 1]\nEverytime I think of you\nI always catch my breath\nAnd I'm still standing here and your miles away\nAnd I'm wondering why you left\nAnd there's a storm that's raging\nThrough my frozen heart tonight\nI hear your name in certain circles\nAnd it always makes me smile\nI spend my time thinking about you\nAnd it's almost driving me wild\nAnd there's a heart that's breaking\nDown this long distance line tonight\n[Chorus]\nI ain't missing you\nSince you've been gone...away\nI ain't missing you\nNo matter what I might say\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a message in the wire and\nI'm sending you this signal tonight\nYou don't know how desperate I've become\nAnd it looks like I'm losing this fight\nIn your world I have no meaning\nI try so hard to understand\nAnd it's my heart that's breaking\nDown this long distance line tonight\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere's a message that I'm sending out\nLike a telegraph to your soul\nAnd if I can't bridge this

Rap Songs of 2014 Lyrics100. Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams \"The Battlefield\"\"The Battlefield\" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience \"H20\"98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean \"Don't Play\"97. Mac Miller ft. Vince Staples \"Rain\"96. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA \"West Savannah\"95. Vic Mensa\t\"Feel That\"Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year\u2019s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger \"Feel That\". The song breaks away from Vic\u2019s reputation as a \u201clyrical\u201d rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic\u2019s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins\tft Joey Bada$$ \"Jerome\"93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q \"2 On\"92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens \"Better In Tune With The Infinite\"91. Big K.R.I.T. \"King Of The South\"90. PRyhme \"Courtesy\" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino \"Sober\"88. NehruvianDOOM \"OM\"87. Drake\t\"How About Now\"86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought \"The Imperial\"85. O.T Genasis\t\"CoCo\"BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy \"Nate\"83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign \"Deliver\"82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West \"Can't Stop\"81. Future ft. Andre 3000 \"Benz Friends (Whatchutola)\"80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z \"We Made It Freestyle\" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy\u2019s 2013 New Year anthem \u201cWe Made It\u201d. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: \u201cSorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought\u201d79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj \"***Flawless Remix\"78. ScHoolboy Q \"Prescription/Oxymoron\"77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Mamacita\"76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q \"I Just Wanna Party\"75. Dej Loaf\t\"Try Me\"From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS\u2019 \u201cTry Me\u201d beat creeps in, Dej commands the year\u2019s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam\u2019ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf\u2019s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs \"Old English\"73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX \"Gotti\"72. Mick Jenkins \"The Waters\"71. Game \"Bigger Than Me\"70. Childish Gambino \"Candler Road\"Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song \u201cTelegraph Ave.\u201d The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan \"Ruckus In B Minor\"68. Kendrick Lamar \"Untitled\"67. OG Maco \"U Guessed It\"66. Drake \"Draft Day\"65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods\t\"Sunday Candy\"The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago \u201csymphony\u201d, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it\u2019s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper\u2019s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q \"Hoover Street\"63. Common ft. Vince Staples \"Kingdom\"62. Jay Rock \"Parental Advisory\"61. Freddie Gibbs \"Shitsville\"60. Action Bronson \"Easy Rider\"The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like \u201cI had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin\u201d are classic Bam Bam. \"Easy Rider\" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem\t\"Shady XV\"58. Nicki Minaj \"Anaconda\"57. J.Cole \"January 28th\"56. Run The Jewels ft. boots \"Early\"55. Mac Miller \"Diablo\"Mac hit us with \u201cDiablo\u201d  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like \u201cContemplating suicide like it\u2019s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it\u2019s a prison homie leave me be\u201d. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs \"Harold's\"53. Slaughterhouse \"Y'all Ready Know\"52. Logic \"Nikki\"51. Yelawolf \"Till It's Gone\"50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought \"Rapid Eye Movement\"From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. \"My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga\" starts us off with a bang. \"Rapid Eye Movement\" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake \"Recognize\"48. Vic Mensa \"Down On My Luck\"47. PRyhme\t\"PRyhme\"46. Vince Staples \"Blue Suede\"45. Rae Sremmurd\t\"No Flex Zone\"Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne \"Only\" 43. Joey Bada$$\t\"Big Dusty\"42. Run The Jewels \"Blockbuster Night Pt. 1\"41. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Cadillactica\"40. Pusha T \"Lunch Money\"What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push\u2019s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like \u201cWhat's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef\u201d. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013\u2019s MNIMN, he won\u2019t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake \"Who Do You Love\"38. Freddie Gibbs \"Deeper\"37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt \"New Faces V2\"36. Rae Sremmurd \"No Type\"35. Isaiah Rashad \"Heavenly Father\"Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa \"We Dem Boyz\"33. J.Cole \"No Role Modelz\"32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T \"Move That Dope\"31. Logic \"Soul Food\"30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick \"Detroit Vs Everybody\" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em\u2019s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar \"Pay For It\"28. Nas \"The Season\"27. Bad Meets Evil \"Vegas\"26. Logic \"Gang Related\"25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown \"High\"Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug \"About The Money\"23. Drake \"6 God\"22. Eminem ft. Sia \"Guts Over Fear\"21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  \"Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)\"20. Mick Jenkins \"Jazz\" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z \"Seen It All\"Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West \"Sanctified\"Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, \"Sanctified\" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.\n\nNot only did \"Sanctified\" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake \"Tuesday (Remix)\"I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto \u201cTuesday\u201d and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole \t\"Wet Dreamz\"Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake \"Believe Me\" The release of \"Believe Me\"  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion\n\nOne of the more underrated aspects of \"Believe Me\"  is its versatility. You can bump it while you\u2019re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q \"Break tHe Bank\"Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J \"Multiply\"After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in \"Multiply.\" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn\u2019t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP\u2019s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year\u2019s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar \"Never Catch Me\"Like a psychedelic rat race, \u201cNever Catch Me\u201d  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick\u2019s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - \u201cbitch, you\u2019re dead!\u201d11. Joey Bada$$ \"Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)\"With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey\u2019s ability and shows he ain\u2019t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won\u2019t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels \"Oh My Darling Don't Cry\" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to \u201crun backwards through a field of dicks\u201d as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Lifestyle\" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan\u2019s \u201cone-hit wonder status\u201d and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid \"Studio\"ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole \"Fire Squad\"If shock factor was what Cole was after with \"Fire Squad\" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda \"Hot Nigga\"The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn\u2019t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic \"Under Pressure\"The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic\u2019s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track\u2019s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 \"I Don't Fuck With You\"Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with \u201cParadise\u201d, \u201c4th Quarter\u201d, and \u201cJit/Juke\" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples \u201cSay You Love Me\u201d, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not \"down with\" and is reminiscent of \u201cI Don\u2019t Give A Fuck\u201d from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still\u2026.Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Mt. Olympus\"Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. \"Mt. Olympus\" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, \"Is he rap, is he snap?\". \"Is he bass, is he drank?\" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake \"0-100/The Catch Up\"If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. \"Started from the bottom, now we here\" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but \"0 to 100 nigga, real quick\" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release\n\nThe two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes \"0 to 100/The Catch Up\" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar \"i\"Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple \"I love myself\"\n\nSimilar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's \"New Slaves\", every facet of the song\u2019s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can\u2019t trap ya mind.\n\n163Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1114279", "artist_names": "Mulberry Lane", "full_title": "Harmless

you're having doubts, but we can work it out\nIf you wrap your love around me\n'Cause I don't want to fight anymore\nYou've got to believe, I'm begging you please\nHold me harmless tonight\nI know I was wrong, you've got to be strong\nHold me harmless tonight\n\nTomorrow's gonna come\nAnd after all is said and done\nWe still won't get along\n\nIt's really no surprise\nYou have your days and I have mine\nBut still we're holding on\n\nI pace across the floor, your hand is on the door\nThe tension between us is raging higher than ever before\nBut baby turn around, don't make another sound\nJust wrap your love around me\n'Cause I don't want to fight anymore\n\nYou've got to believe, I'm begging you please\nHold me harmless tonight\nI know I was wrong, you've got to be strong\nHold me harmless tonight\n'Cause there's a moon up above, it sure feels like love\nHold me harmless tonight\nYou might also likeHere we are, closer to the end than the beginning\nBut don't let it end\nDon't let it end\nDon't let it end\nDon't let it end\n\nYou've got to believe in love, be strong in love, hold on\nYou've got to believe in love, be strong in love, hold on\n\nYou've got to believe, I'm begging you please\nHold me harmless tonight\n'Cause there's a moon up above, it sure feels like love\nHold me harmless tonightEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

Cool Breeze]\nNow if dirty Bill Clinton fronted me some weight\nTold me to keep two, bring him back eight\nAnd I only brought him five and stuck his ass for three\nDo you think that Clampett will sick his goons on me?\nSee Martel Homes, that's my claim to fame\nThat's where I learned my slickest tricks in the dope-d-game\nLike my favorite, I call it \"Lemonhead Delight\"\nThat's when you lick off all the yellow and you sell the white.\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nRight, well if pimpin' be a sport I be bein' the wide receiver\nThat nigga B-I-G will make ya'll niggas believers\nSippin' on Cuervo Gold off in the club drunk as fuck\nCallin' them hoes bitches, and smokin' my weed up\nWhen I'm too sober, year older, now I'm almost legal\nWanted to live the life of Cadillacs, Impalas and Regals\nFuckin' around wit hoes, bustin' nuts in they mouths\nKickin' that same southern slang\nLookin' for love off in yo' jaw, ho!\n\n[Hook]\nSee powder gets you hyper; reefer makes you calm;\nCigarettes give you cancer; woo woo's make you dumb\nWhat you niggas know about the Dirty South?\nWhat you niggas know about the Dirty South?\n\n[Verse 3: Cool Breeze]\nSee never did I think when I got grown\nThat some pee wee sacks had been done took this town\nSee, life's a bitch, then you figure out\nWhy you really got dropped in the Dirty South\nSee in the 3rd grade this is what you taught\nYou was bought, you was sold\nNow they sayin' Juice left some heads cracked\nI betcha Jed Clampett want his money back\nSee East Point Atlanta threw this road block\nTalkin 'bout all this blow traffic got to stop\nSo the big time players off John Freeman Way\nHad to find themselves another back street to take\n'Cause back in the day we was outta control\nWe didn't understand, \"Naw nigga, that money ain't yours\"\nThat's when me and Big Slate took an oath and sweared\nNever would we talk, never would we tell\nSo when they pulled up bumpin' \"Rock The Bells\"\nWe took what we want and left them quiet as hell\nYou might also likeWhat you niggas know about the Dirty South?\nWhat you niggas know about the Dirty South?\n\n[Verse 4: Big Gipp]\nNow that Cobras got the boys on Delowe on they back\nGipp hollered at Miss Ann, she said they didn't get trapped\nBehind the black, behind green, behind the red tint\nDealers breaking off that blow up for those woodchips\nA lot of faces ain't around, a lot of folks got shot\nScatta Mack droppin' G's while that Cristal pop\nBeen on the grind with Cool Breeze, droppin' pounds with B\nEric Neal is the coolest from my century\nMack town keeps

South\n\nOne to da two da three da four\nDem dirty Red Dogs done hit the door\nAnd they got everybody on they hands and knees\nAnd they ain't gonna leave until they find them keys\n\nSee powder gets

propel at a rate, that complicate their mental state\nAs I invade their Masquerade, they couldn't fade with a clipper blade\n10 years in the trade is not enough, you can't cut it\nI let you take a swing, and you bunted for an easy out\nI leave emcees with doubt of exceeding\nMy name is Bootie Brown and I'm proceeding, leading\nThey try to follow but they're shallow and hollow\nI can see right through them like an empty 40 bottle of O.E\nThey have no key or no clue\nTo the game at all, now they washed up\nHung out to dry\nStand there looking stupid, wondering why\n(why man?)\nIt was the fame, that they tried to get\nNow they walking around talkin' about represent\nAnd keep it real, but I got to appeal\n'Cause they existing in a fantasy when holding the steel\n[Chorus]\nDrop!\nDrop!\nDrop!\nDrop!\nDrop!\nDrop!\n\n[Verse 2: SlimKid3]\nRock-a-bye baby\nListen to your heartbeat pumping to a fine\nRavine of all things it's a vain of a shrine\nAll missions impossible are possible, 'cause I'm\nHeaded for a new sector 365\nDays from now, I'll wipe the sweat from my eye\nAnd each and every true will stick or fall from the skies\nOf my cloud nine\nFrom homies all the way to chicks, no matter how fine\nControlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind\nYou hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying\nTear after tear in the puppet man's hands\nEvery time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance\nAnd the world's at a standstill, deep in broken-man's-ville\nTrapped in the moat with an anvil, still\nKilling yourself, and dogging ya health\nYou ain't amphibious, so grab a hold of yourself\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Imani]\n(Shit is-shit is ill)\nBut through my will, my flow still will spill\nToxic slick to shock

had a bad dream\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams\u201d\n\u201cWhat a time you chose to be born in\u201d\n[Chorus: Life]\nBabies cryin', brothers dyin', and brothers gettin' knocked\nShit is deep on the block and you got me locked down\nIn this cold, cold world\n\n[Verse 1: GZA]\nIt was the night before New Year\u2019s\nAnd all through the fuckin' projects\nNot a handgun was silent, not even a TEC\nOutsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear\nAnd blasted on the spot before the pigs were there\nYou know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight\nFuck blue and white\nThey escape before them flash the fuckin' lights\nGunshots shatter first-floor window panes\nShells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game\nWhether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it\nBeat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses\nBut with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses\nTherefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless\nLinx was snatched off necks, left scars on throats\nJackets took, after bullet rips through coats\nAgainst those who felt the cold from the steel\nMade \u2018em fold and squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill\nConstruction worker, who was caught for his bomber\nNo time to swing the hammer that was hangin' from his farmers\nAnd it\u2019s bugged how some niggas catch slugs\nAnd pockets dug from everythin' except check stubs\nAnd it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville\nOr fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look\nFor fugitives to shoot cops, niggas layin' on roof tops\nFor his C.R.E.A.M he stashed in a shoebox\nBut he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers\nYou don\u2019t suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars\nAnd born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets\nThose who try to flee, they hit the vertebrae\nIncrease the murder rate\nSimilar to hitmen who pull out TECs and then\nDrop those who crack like tacos from Mexican\nRapid, like recipients cashin' checks again\nBack to the motherfuckin' spot on Lexington\n[Chorus: Life]\nBabies cryin', brothers dyin', and brothers gettin' knocked\nShit is deep on the block and you got me locked down\nIn this cold, cold world\nWe be runnin' from the cops, bustin' off shots\nShit is deep on the block and you got me locked down\nIn this cold, cold world\n\n[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]\nYo, no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs\nAnd seize packages and pocket the currency\nCliques control strips, full clips are sprayed\nYellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay\nMadness strikes at twelve o\u2019clock midnight\nStick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light\nAnd I stays harassed, scramblin' for petty cash\nJakes on my ass, young bucks is learnin' fast\nThree-Fifteen-Sevens and Forty-Fours\nBought inside corner stores, provide sparks for wars\nHospital floors surrounded by the law\nHomicide questionin' while the Jakes guard the door\nMy hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team\n\u2018Cause niggas\u2019 main concern is C.R.E.A.M\nSome niggas in the jet-black Galant\nShot up the Chinese restaurant for this kid named Lamont\nI thought he was dead, but instead, he missed the kid\nAnd hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled\nTactical narcotic task force, back off fast\n\u2018Cause the crime boss is passin' off cash\nExtortions for portions of streets, causes beef\nHavin' followers of Indians trying to play Chief\nYou witness the saga, casualties and drama\nLife is a script; I\u2019m not an actor\nBut the author of a modern-day opera\nWhere the main character is presidential papers, the dominant factor\nYou might also like[Bridge: Life]\nYou know, you had me\nWith your sensuous charm\nBut you looked so alarmed\nAs I walked on by\n[Chorus: Life]\nBabies cryin', brothers dyin', and brothers gettin' knocked\nShit is deep on the block and you got me locked down\nIn this cold, cold world\nWe be runnin' from the cops, bustin' off shots\nShit is deep on the block and you got me locked down\nIn this cold, cold world\nBabies cryin', brothers dyin', and brothers gettin' knocked\nShit is deep on the block and you got me locked down\nIn this cold, cold world\nWe be runnin' from the cops, bustin' off shots\nShit is deep on the block and you got me locked down\nIn this cold, cold world24Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI thought I knew the girl so well\nIf she was sad I couldn't tell\nI missed the point, I missed the signs\nSo if she's gone the fault is mine\nI know, I know a whole lot of little things\nAnd even though I confess them one by one\nShe would still be gone\n\n[Chorus]\nHer eyes are blue, her hair is long\nIn '64 she was born in Baton Rouge\nHer favorite song is \"In My Life\"\nI memorized her every move\nI knew her books, her car, her cloths\nBut I paid no attention to what mattered most\n[Verse 2]\nI never asked, she never said\nAnd when she cried I turned my head\nShe dreamed her dreams behind closed doors\nThat made them easy to ignore\nAnd I know, I know I missed the forest for the trees\nAnd all I have to show oh when she walked out the door\nThe cold facts and nothing more\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\nHer eyes are blue, her hair is long\nIn 64 she was born in Baton Rouge\nHer father's tall, her mother's gone\nShe moved out west when she was two\nThe way she laughed, the way she loved\nOh my God what did I doYou might also likeEmbed"}]
