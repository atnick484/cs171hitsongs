with sex, I'm tryna set the mood\nMy Trackhawk run off racing fuel, I'm drivin' like a fool\nThey see my drip, then hold they breath, then dive in like a pool\nIf I got one shot, then I'ma blow it (Blow it)\nThey want what I got, yeah, I'm knowin' (Yeah, I'm knowin')\nPull up in the drop while he snorin' (How he snorin')\nAnd I got that thing on me (And I, and I)\nI hope that they don't think

ballin' just for you, I put y'all faces in my ice\n\n[Verse 1]\nI got a problem, it's no problem, my lil' brother gon' get him\nBefore he hopped up off that porch, we always knew it was in him\nDon't give no fuck, the twins gone, and he wish he was with him\nHe say them niggas ain't been slidin' and his crown don't fit him\nHe want all them niggas dead, it's sad to say, but I feel him\nIf I ain't had so much to lose, I'd be riskin' it with him\nAlways rap about the guys 'cause I genuinely miss 'em\nFive years later, thousand tears later, still feel like the day when they hit 'em\nMake sure I always say y'all name so ain't no way they forget 'em\nGon' always feel like fuck the opps 'cause nigga, I can't forgive 'em\nI got that shit up out the mud, I spent 10K on my denims\nSnakes in

shit like who need a trim?\nInherit hate, it got me wonderin' can we forgive?\nEverybody got they input on how we should live, oh\nLife on the road, I barely see the crib\nFaceTime the fam, my son smilin' every time I call\nBack then, I slipped up, I got artwork on them county walls\nI signed a contract, like Carmelo, I'm just tryna ball\nMatter of time before we blitz him, he been tryna stall\nGot smoke for hoppin' in this shit, he shouldn't have got involved\nThem R.I.P.s put him to sleep like he off Tylenol\nHot 'nem gon' tweak, them boys crazy, they ain't got it all\nYou know my

bond so strong, and from that love, I know you miss me\nConnected to your soul, I feel it when you hug and kiss me\nNow your shoulder is so cold and lately, I been feelin' empty\nI got caught up in this fame and all these hoes, I let it tempt me\nIn that hotel room alone, remember I would hold you gently\nWent on dates, we took some pictures, everything was movin' quickly\nManipulated, I ain't think a new relationship would fit me\nBut I told you we can try it, even though I know it's risky\nMind games with our emotions, swear this shit get kinda tricky\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl, you got me losin'

figure\nI kept you worried, in them trenches tryna dodge the killers\nTryna escape from this commitment made our problems bigger\nIt's hard to love with dysfunction, wish my scars was thinner\nTryna forgive me in your thoughts, I hope your heart remember\nKnow it's gon' hurt to see another nigga bondin' with her\nCan't even look you in your eyes 'cause I'm burnin' up with guilt\nFor that one moment, went too far, and now I fucked up what we built\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nGirl, you got me losin' my mind\nI just want you to see that I'm trying\nEver since you left, the sun don't

from a dream to a nightmare?\nLeft us behind, you seen that light glare\nI know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs\nWhy I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?\nNobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care\n\n[Verse 2]\nLivin' on his own and he runnin' out of options now\n'Cause he felt like he couldn't be hisself at his mama house\nHittin' licks, missin' school, junior year, he thought 'bout droppin' out\nHim against the world, 40 on him when he poppin' out\nOn his dark road, he just tryna find a proper route\nHate the criticism, he uses music to block it out\nBy his auntie, he was molested as a baby boy\nMessed up his head, it even changed the way he play with toys\nUp late night rappin' and they told him to quit makin' noise\nStuck in his feelings, he be spendin' every day annoyed\nHe wanna stand over a nigga, leave his face destroyed\nHe miss his hood, now this something that he can't avoid\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share\nMy dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare\nI know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair\nHow the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?\nLeft us behind, you seen that light glare\nI know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs\nWhy I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?\nNobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they

trustees\nSmokin' on\u2005crushed\u2005leaves\nThey turn they\u2005back on everything we built, then\u2005they must bleed\nI've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze\nStraps over territory they know we must keep\nGet home and white Air Forces get brushed clean\nBack when my mama would interrupt sleep\nTo tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves\nSummertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves\nMy shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys\nI can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?\nNiggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas\nI'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy\nAnd the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy\nIt's on Meech like it's trendy\nRunnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah\nEarly twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies\nI need plenty\nGot me ready to flip the F out like Fendi\nWhatever's in me, it's takin' over\nI gotta bust it down, break it open\nUntil somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'\n[Chorus]\nYeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'\nDeep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in\nNow we rollin'\nYeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'\nDeep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in\nNow we rollin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook\nBack when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing\nBack when the house that I own now was my home screen\nBefore I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team\nRunnin' missions\nPyramid schemes just like the Egyptians\nBack when hotlines were still flippin'\nNow I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different\nTransitions, plans switchin', ambition\nMindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera\nInspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla\nI always had a little somethin' extra\nBack when Corey was our sole investor\nAnd the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya\nLook, I ain't no baller\nStill need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller\nMy soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers\nAnd easin' tensions\nKeepin' family out of East Detention\nAnd out of Pine Hill Funeral Center\nSpots we got no business enterin'\nBack when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye\nI had to find a way to get someone's attention\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might also like[Chorus]\nThen we rollin', then we rollin'\nDeep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in\nNow we rollin'\nYeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'\nDeep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in\nNow we

for the rain\nFive hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain\nFive hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix\nFinally give you niggas the space you need to exist\nMichael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids\nStill women sayin' it's childish, the way we live\nBrought a few Ws to the 6ix\nBaby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is\nBaby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit\nHalf the time, I question my consciousness in this shit\nOther times, I question if compliments are legit\nFull-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch\nTryna make good on the promises that I give\nTryna make sure my accomplices are legit\nRegister the business in my brother's name\nThirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things\nCertified lover man, trappin' out the motherland\nAlways move right so my watch is on the other hand\nShe can try and play it down now, but she was a fan\nPeople wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand\nMy assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands\nKnow my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans\nWord to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can\nI watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands\nI decide what to see next like it's on demand\nI decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans\nI'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman\nI will split heads and break necks for my little man\n6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man\nBut I'm just a sicker man, wicked man\nLook, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?\nIsn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?\nBang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'\nHow you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?\nHow you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?\nHow you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?\nHow you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again\nHow you got a manager you mad at after you got the win?\nBet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end\nBet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends\nGive 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then\nYou just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been\nThere when others should've been\nGot a nigga starin' at the game like, \"Damn, coach, put him in\"\nBut you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again\nGot us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been\nAnd I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in\nAnd it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend\nAnd it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge\nIt's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men\nIt's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends\nIt's because you niggas never learn when to say when\nYeah\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might also like[Outro]\nFor real\nFacts, you know what I'm sayin'?\nHahaha, yeah28Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 8, "api_path": "/songs/5433550", "artist_names": "Drake", "full_title": "Landed by\u00a0Drake", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a545c1b0ea3914ddeaee4a1b0a05eba.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a545c1b0ea3914ddeaee4a1b0a05eba.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 5433550, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 8117646, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1617937233, "path": "/Drake-landed-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 24, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Drake-landed-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2020, "month": 5, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "May 1, 2020", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "May. 1, 2020", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a545c1b0ea3914ddeaee4a1b0a05eba.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a545c1b0ea3914ddeaee4a1b0a05eba.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 235733}, "title": "Landed", "title_with_featured": "Landed", "updated_by_human_at": 1657836582, "url": "https://genius.com/Drake-landed-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/130", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/25aae6030be7bf4a2a9a281b0fb2d3ed.750x210x1.png", "id": 130, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/563e1b6590c65ab94586b8454e37aeaf.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Drake", "slug": "Drake", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Drake"}, "artist": "Drake", "lyrics": "TranslationsEspa\u00f1ol\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439Portugu\u00easLanded Lyrics[Intro]\nYeah, ayy, ayy\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I gotta land, I'ma stick it\nBaby, let it go and you gon'\u2005miss\u2005it\nWrote this with\u2005a Cartier pen, do I sound\u2005different?

I\u2005started\u2005writing it about\u2005family\nJust came up now, so\nAnybody feel\u2005any way about it, I don't give a fuck\n(Yeah, family)\n\n[Verse 1: Drake]\nYeah\nYeah\nLost you to the game, I gotta hug that\nI was here when you was asking where the love at\nDip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back\nI was wishin' on a star when I was that\nI've been fortunate enough to have it my way\nI'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say\n'Member when we used to park up in my driveway\nI always told it how it was, I never shy away\nThis life is really something you get lost in\nI know niggas that got famous and they bought friends\nI had friends that only had half of they heart in\nIt's hard to accept now, and it was hard then\nBut I treated you like gold, I was all in\nSpoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in\nBurnin' incense in your new apartment\nBut you got no sense when it come to\nLost you to the game, I gotta hold that\nHow you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?\nI'll be better off without you, and we know that\nYou ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back\nLike I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap\nYou sold me up the river, but I rowed back\nYou put me on the road without a roadmap\nI'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts\n[Interlude: Drake & Dennis Graham]\nYou got some liquor at the house?\nYeah\nGo get a shot, let's do a shot together\nI don't see it\nOkay, hahaha\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nAyy\nBeing here wasn't in the plans\nI do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram\nI do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam\nI tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am\nEven when being real is out of fashion\nNiggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'\nI did it by being myself with no dramatic acting\nI couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen\nLost you to the game, I gotta face that\nReally think I lost you like a ways back\nAlways sayin' how a nigga never play fair\nI took you up under my wing and you just stayed there\nYou was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair\nWe started this from the bottom, now you alone there\nShit, you treat it like it's home there\nDependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share\nI still love you to my last days\nI never knew that shit would be this fast-paced\nI never thought I'd see awards in a glass case\nI could've ended up in your crib with a masked face\nIt could've went left on a couple bad days\nWhen I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place\nSee me these days, I never got on a sad face\nSee me these days, I\nLost you to the game, and I see why\nIt was always you and I without the T-Y\nThis is not one of them stories that got three sides\nThis is not one of them stories you could rewind\nLike I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap\nYou drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back\nYou wrote me off and then you never wrote back\nI'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might also like[Outro: Drake & Dennis Graham]\nYes, sir\n(Baby)\nHold on, hold on\n(Let me tell you something about me)\n(I really do know, I know

doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy\nI didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy\nNiko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG\nIf man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly\nUsed to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat\nThought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC\nMan went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those\nBefore I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos\nThe woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie\nCan't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy\nWord to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries\nThree waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy\nI don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats\nWoi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less\nI know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress\n'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts\nWassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa\nLink with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza\nPasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings\nYou niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action\nPick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings\nThe LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'\nAre you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz\nJust checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas\nOVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers\nHawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla\nAnd the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga\nYeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up\nAs for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time\nTo me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side\nBring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside\n4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside\nSteppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside\nBringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside\nPrince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names\nJas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting\nEveryone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name\nNiggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train\n[Outro]\nAyy\nYeah\nAXL (AXL), AXL (AXL), AXL (AXL)See Drake LiveGet tickets as low as

all make it back\nAnd I know it's raw that I rap\nBut a street nigga first\nTell the crackers free Mac Deezy\nMa, look at your son, I'm on TV\nThey didn't believe me\nNigga went and got it off the greezy\nIt's hard, but I make it look easy, a crazy achievement\nWon't really fuck with no rappers\nAll these niggas hustling backwards\nMisguiding  the youth\nBut long as I know the truth\nThat's another subject for after\nAnd I'm riding in the Rover\n12 keep on trying to pull me over\nAsking a nigga if I stole it, I bought it, I own it\nI remember walking to school\nCatching the bus early morning, like, Ma, I ain't going\nI was in the hallways roaming\nBut I still got my diploma, I got my diploma\nWent to school all twelve years just to get a job selling donuts, man, that's crazy\nI ain't with the minimum waging\nI ain't with the modern day slavery\nThe fuck is you saying?\nTold the crackers, \"Fuck you, pay me\"\nHad to tell 'em, \"Fuck you, pay me\"\nIt's back to the block\nWell, I guess it's back to the block\nIn the streets running 'round playing hooky (Hooky)\nAnd I ain't never sold no crack, but I'm so street, I can cook it\n[Bridge]\nAnd I know it's hard to find a way\nBut you're bound to see brighter days\nA million dollars can't change me, nigga\n'Cause hard times made me, nigga\nA hard grind saved me, nigga\nI got it off the pavement, nigga\nI got it

cry for me\nThought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI take half a Xan' and I still stay awake\nAll my demons wanna pull me to my grave\nI choose Vegas if they offer Heaven's gate\nI tried to love, but you know I'd never stay\nI'd never stay\nBut if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me\nI want you to follow right behind me\nI want you to hold me while I'm smilin'\nWhile I'm dyin'\nAnd if you know me\nWhen I go missing, you know where to find me\nDriving down the boulevard is blindin'\nAlways blinded by the desert lights and\nI'm alive when\nSee The
