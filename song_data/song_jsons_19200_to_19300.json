meanest man in Waycross Georgia\nI'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave\nSo I said you're gonna pay both you and Davy\nCause I'm gonna see you in your grave\nThey laughed at me and then I shot 'em\nAnd then I dragged their cheatin' skin and bones into Miller's Cave\nI couldn't stand the way she did me cause I guess I showed her I was brave\nThe most wanted man in the state of

my pleas\nAnd now she's\nGoing, going, gone\nAnd I did nothing wrong\nBut she's going, going, gone\n\nIf I disappeared tonight\nIt would not change her mind about me\nShe's in love with someone who has changed\nSince that day\n\nShe tried to tell me\nI was not the only one to turn to\nBut I won't get down on my knees\nSo she's\nGoing, going, gone\nAnd I did nothing wrong\nBut she's going, going,

A.D\nNow this beating brings back the same feeling graffiti gave me\nI'll leave you split, it means my pen's been on a mean streak lately\nFace it, you ain't the lord of a thing, I tried to warn him\nI been the lord of this ring, homie: stare into the eyes of Sauron\nThis is my court, I am Jordan\nMy performance is a dissection, call me DJ Shadow to your vital organs\nEvery line from Saurus is high-octane\nI taught Klay and Steph to let it fly long-range\nSo after this, your list of favorite rappers might not change\nBut when I give Top five, it ain't Dylan's name!\nNow I'm not saying I'm a legend and this man's not\nBut my legend next to his legend is a desert to a sandbox\nIt's Severn vs Shamrock, I'm heavy with the hands Top\nStealing on holmes (homes) call me Benny from the Sandlot\nSo give it everything you can, pops!\nDon't talk that loud nonsense\nThen step out on the field then show us all the Browns offense\nCause I'm trying to do more than knock this clown unconscious\nI'm trying to create a world where my girl can walk around topless\nTime\n[Round 1: Topr]\nYou dare talk about me on some graffiti shit? That shit is dead as fuck\nI'll make you famous when I tag your toe but this time when I'm spraying cans nobody's getting up\nDan gave me the shot of the century I guess\nLike Oswald to Kennedy's death\nNah dawg, this is Tesla versus Edison\nSabertooth versus Weapon X\nMy pen game sharp as a switchblade, knife embedded in flesh to sever his neck\nI'll change his bitch's life in 90 seconds or less like a pregnancy test\nGet him shook, cause every line is twisted, that's an Etch-A-Sketch\nI'm so far ahead of my time with it I'm high on drugs that haven't been invented yet\nLet loose a rampage, I'm Soundwave when his chest ejects\nBring his camp pain (campaign), that close left make him lean far right like Megadef\nBut I'm not Megadef, that fascist prick\nI am more like Megatron, megalodon lexicon, smash the whip\nLike a Decepticon with the weapons drawn, the level I'm on\nOne step beyond upper echelon\nI'm armed and deadly, narcolepsy...that's criminally slept on\nGet gone\nLittle homie, I was a legend before you stepped in\nWith open cases for having beef over paper like your delicatessen\nPlus I was banging with Lords in Santa Clara when the Tec was a weapon\nHave money dancing with a nina like a Mexican wedding\nWhat up Pete? It's Topr the card's deep\nBlood in the water it's Shark Week\nI'm schooling a two time champ\nApollo Creed in Rocky 3 box like a G\nThrow a combo lift him off his feet\nAnd leave him next to the curb with three rights and a left like parking on Market Street\nYou don't want it with me\nYou always rap about fist fights\nTry to measure up, I'll fucking beat you within an inch of your life\nCaught on tape stealing on him like a thief of the night\nBut I prefer disrespect in the ring like I cheat on my wife\nHe needs this type of L to make him trip like taking vials of acid\nA full clip all in his head, now it's psychosomatic\nPlus I got a blade that's sharper than the ones the ancient vikings clashed with\nThat'll open up The Saurus like creative writing classes\nI'm lit major with a razor\nIt's Stanley, originator, that's Stan Lee\nSo I gave y'all a fantasy cameo cause on cam' he owes for the fans to see\nTwo tens it ain't bluffing on cash creek\nDraw the Mac, [?], damn Pete\nYa might play me but it won't be fun, I'm Zangief\nYou might also like[Round 2: The Saurus]\nHe issued me a challenge to start throwing down with his fists\nBut when his face is a fucking mountain like this, how could I miss?\nI can't believe, after all these years, that's what you really rhyme like\nThat was a piss-poor 32, you're a Miller High Life\nYou were battling before me, you were doing shows before me\nNow you're over 40, making that big comeback on the road to glory\nDamn, you one of the oldest friends I ever had Topr!\nYo, but I don't mean that like we're hella tight, it's more like you're my grandfather\nLike when I first came up on the scene I thought he was someone who could help me learn more\nSo I asked him about his first tours and he told me about the first and second World Wars\nI'm sure the gap between us can't get too much wider\nI stay on the road cooking like a food truck driver\nYou went from being a true punchliner to lead singer of a metal band with the appeal of a school bus fire\nBut through time I've evolved\nAny prize fight I lost I made up for with a hundred more highlights you saw\nMuay thai fighter brawl with a right like a white line of raw\nThe way it's giving you that typewriter jaw\nNow there's a fine line to draw between O.G. and \"Oh Jesus\"\nYou're older than our whole scene is\nYou've been old school since '03ish\nNo peace, I wish they found Harambe a hiding place\nYou came a long way to die today Andre The Giant face\nLook I won't lie, the guy can paint but none of these fans give a fuck though\nI got a cap set for your nozzle that ain't Montana or Rust O\nHomie I brought so much ammo they had to cancel the gun show\nI know you couldn't take a Jabber without landing a punch though\nI'm cut throat, never sleep, that's insomnia\nHelping my grandfather rest in peace I hadn't had the honor of\nBut it's obvious he can't stand the rain, so bag his body up\nThe hand of God will leave Top' spinning: Happy Hanukkah!\nI offered you a chance, but some cats can't learn\nYour brain's a piece of cheese on a string that helps the rat's wheel turn\nI'm only here to see if that old Topper gas still burns\nSo I can send your bitch ass back to Asheville in an ash filled urn!\n[Round 2: Topr]\nLast time you were here you lost to Fresco...doing the gang talk!\nIn a skin-tight...yellow tank top\nHe ignored your stripes and bounced around out of pocket: that's a bank shot\nWell I'm the mighty Thor in a lightning storm: welcome to Ragnarok\nI'm back in the Bay building against Wade Wilson without a mask involved\nThe astronaut from Planet Rock blasting off\nEntire catalog out of this world\nI am Isaac Asimov, riding high on Adderalls\nHad your girl get naked, in a way it was a casting call\nCause she gives out so many head shots I nicknamed that bitch Kalashnikov\nIT'S THAT FAT BROAD!\nHey, kitten\nWhat's your favorite position? Rape victim?\nI'll hold you down like a cartridge on a Nintendo game system\nI came different\nPete, do you say, \"I love you\" on the first date with women?\nYou're so soft your teardrops got little fucking mermaids in 'em\nBut I ain't hating pimping\nI'm sure the pussy on this chick is crack\nBut watching your relationship thrown up online is digital ipecac\nI mean I know you love cup-caking obviously since you're fat but\nEven Drake sees you pop up on his feed and thinks, \"Pete's kind of a bitch for that!\"\nYo, this is that aerosol paint for her white-washed brain\nOld-school cuts go over a kid's head, that's a high top fade\nThe way you rap makes me gag like I'm high on yay'\nHolding these beam shots back like Cyclops' shades\nAnd the hands stay seasoned without lime or Tequila\nYeah you spazzing, but I make him bite his tongue like a violent seizure\nFace looking like some kind of creature from Sci-Fi feature\nSo I keep a Heckler on each side like Mystery Science Theater\nWith a permit to conceal and carry where ever the handle's Pearl\nIt never jams, but it sings like Eddie Vedder\nI apply deadly pressure to survive by any measure\nCause when I draw, it'll turn your world upside down like MC Escher\nWith that ox though, I'm Picasso, rearrange his traits\nIt ain't nothing to jump him, I got more battery charges than tripple A\nAnd since we in California I'ma get in his face\nAnd put a buck 50 on it, then another buck 50 on it like minimum wage\nI'm the king of the Bay, I don't have to let lead fly\nShank in his left eye, turn Mr. Potato Head to french fries\nEither write a rhyme on the side of the blade so the next time\nSome skinny faggot bars your life away you get a word in edge wise\n\n[Round 3: The Saurus]\nThis is my girl and I do love her, every fucking thing you say is true\nExcept her favorite sex position, which is \"A Thousand Feet Away From You\"\nLook, now y'all probably missed it, but I wrote an underlying theme\nBecause I see the bitch in Top'\nSo I put two big rounds up front to keep it official, Top'\nBut I got this last missile locked, pointed 'ere; Mr. Spock\nAnd if you thought I'd keep it bottled in you got me twisted Top'\nSee Topr looked like a 1%er\nTopr *is* a 1%er\nMe? I'm the top 1% so fuck a Top gun, it's time Top got taught some respect\nWe can let Top' pick the topic, he'll get boxed up instead\nCause I'm only on this card to put one into Top's upper deck\nLook, we can toss up a bet you ain't been served like that\nSince back when there was only three venues we were all trying to earn stripes at\nAnd I was anchoring our stars like the Burnside Flag\nHomie, your shirt size tag says \"Reverse Live's Dad\"\nBut I ain't come to joke around, you know this clown's been broken down so for my home crowd\nThis is how a closing round is supposed to sound\nFor a decade there's heads that have wondered how I kept up this hunger\nLike when will I finally hang it up like I won't get any younger\nBut if you think age is anything more or less than a number\nThen you already missed the point like betting the under\nReinvented, restructure, I'm on that Rushmore\n{Stumble}\nReinvent and restructure, I'm on that Rushmore hustling\nIf Top' wanna pop off, shit I can uncork something\nI'll even let you choose the route\nEither A: retire if you lose or round\nOr B: We go back to Carolina to Duke it out\nYou shoulda knew by now to not cross me\nOn God my right cross is all topsy right before the autopsy\nSorry not sorry, but your buzz has fallen flat Top'\nI will flat stomp you into the fresh asphalt til you're part of the black Top'\nThis has been a hell of a match Top'\nBut before I can say, \"hats off\", ax chop, you end up with your Apple in your lap top\nTime\n\n[Round 3: Topr]\nHey Peter\nRemember that time I saw you in the city with Lush getting drunk outside that shitty club?\nI hit the blunt, passed it to Plex, you pulled me aside like, \"Listen blood\nAfter that time you served me in Santa Cruz I will forever give you love\nCause you inspired me to become the best at this there ever was.\"\nI must admit I was touched, can't make this shit up\nTopr's a mastermind, the metaphor's vivid enough\nIt's Dr. Frankenstein with the stitches cut\nI created a monster with a lot of different bodies but he never really existed before I lit him up\nI respect it, he's still standing like Stonehenge, maintaining tradition\n{stumbles}\nBut this blueprint I drew it (druid) and y'all don't put faith in my vision\nI paid my dues, shouldn't have to pay again to maintain my position\nCause I'm the GOAT like Satan's depiction in most ancient religions\nAnd if you say any different you're a goddamn liar\nI can't count how many hot rounds these thoughts have inspired\nIt's the Bay's Johnny Blaze, y'all know, the Fresh Coast ghostwriter\nMy punches are off the chain when I raise Hell off the top, whooo I'm on fire\nBut I don't sleep on Pete, I know he looks like a sucker\nBut he's a thesaurus, and I was taught not to judge a book by its cover\nBut you've really had that pro bowler swag cooking this summer\nWell stay in your lane when you roll up or you're getting hooked in the gutter\nI'll smack him back to the 90's, these hands make him time travel\nCause he wasn't doing multisyllabics when him and I battled\nBut I was, this whole time he's been riding the buzz standing in my shadow\nRewriting history on film like Man In The High Castle\nMy advice, don't take a date to see the Bodied premier\nCause the sight of that face on a screen, 20 foot high is just weird\nYou're looking at the uncut dope that inspired your career\nBut the real problem's staring right back, like sniffing lines off a mirror\nBut real talk I love Pete, we're both titans in here\nOver weight right? That's not in contention\nBut bitch, I am king of late night, Johnny carcinogenic\nGot an appetite for destruction at the bar with my henchmen\nYou're just a glutton for punishment that's starved for attention\nAnd it's hard to not mention, but it's brutal to see\nMr. Two Times Everything...including losing to me!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/903288",

Time to let the trees grow tall. Now, if they only can\nTime to let our children live in a land that's free. Ally, ally, ally, ally, oxen free\n\nTime to blow the smoke away and look at the sky again. Time to let our friends know we'd like to begin again\nTime to send a message across the land and sea.

And there many have paused before that exposure of him by old Tom Quad, a flashback in which he sits sated, gowndabout, in clericalease ha-bit, watching bland sol slithe dodgsomely into the nethermore, a globule of maugdleness about to corrugitate his mild dewed cheek and the tata of a tiny victorienne, Alys, pressed by his limper looser.\n\nYet certes one is. Eher the following winter had overed the pages of nature\u2019s book and till Ceadurbar-atta-Cleath became Dablena Tertia, the shadow of the huge outlander, maladik, mult-vult, magnoperous, had bulked at the bar of a rota of tribunals in manor hall as in thieves\u2019 kitchen, mid pillow talk and chithouse chat, on Marlborough Green as through Molesworth Fields, here sentenced pro tried with Jedburgh justice, there acquitted con testimony with benefit of clergy. His Thing Mod have undone him: and his madthing has done him man. His beneficiaries are legion in the part he created: they number up his years. Greatwheel Dunlop was the name was on him: behung, all we are his bisaacles. As hollyday in his house so was he priest and king to that: ulvy came, envy saw, ivy conquered. Lou! Lou! They have waved his green boughs o\u2019er him as they have torn him limb from lamb. For his muertification and uxpiration and dumnation and annu-hulation. With schreis and grida, deprofound souspirs. Steady, sullivans! Mannequins pause! Longtong\u2019s breach is fallen down but Graunya\u2019s spreed\u2019s abroad.

But, lo! lo! by the threnning gods, human, erring and condonable, what the statues of our kuo, who is the messchef be our kuang, ashu ashure there, the unforgettable treeshade looms up behind the jostling judgements of those, as all should owe, malrecapturable days.\n\nTap and pat and tapatagain, (fire firstshot, Missiers the Refusel-eers! Peingpeong! For saxonlootie!) three tommix, soldiers free, cockaleak and cappapee, of the Coldstream. Guards were walking, in (pardonnez-leur, je vous en prie, eh?) Montgomery Street. One voiced an opinion in which on either wide (pardonnez!), nod-ding, all the Finner Camps concurred (je vous en prie, eh?). It was the first woman, they said, souped him, that fatal wellesday, Lili Coninghams, by suggesting him they go in a field. Wroth mod eldfar, ruth redd stilstand, wrath wrackt wroth, confessed private Pat Marchison retro. (Terse!) Thus contenters with san-toys play. One of our coming Vauxhall ontheboards who is resting for the moment (she has been callit by a noted stagey ele-cutioner a wastepacket Sittons) was interfeud in a waistend pewty parlour. Looking perhaps even more pewtyflushed in her cherry- derry padouasoys, girdle and braces by the halfmoon and Seven Stars, russets from the Blackamoor\u2019s Head, amongst the climbing boys at his Eagle and Child and over the corn and hay emptors at their Black and All Black, Mrs F . . . A . . . saidaside, half in stage of whisper to her confidante glass, while recoopering her cartwheel chapot (ahat! \u2014 and we now know what thimbles a baquets on lallance a talls mean), she hoped Sid Arthar would git a Chrissman\u2019s portrout of orange and lemonsized orchids with hollegs and ether, from the feeatre of the Innocident, as the worryld had been uncained. Then, while it is odrous comparisoning to the sprangflowers of his burstday which was a virid \u2014 able goddinpotty for the reinworms and the charlattinas and all branches of climatitis, it has been such a wanderful noyth untirely, added she, with many regards to Maha\u2019s pranjapansies. (Tart!) Prehistoric, obitered to his dictaphone an entychologist: his pro-penomen is a properismenon. A dustman nocknamed Seven \u2014 churches in the employ of Messrs Achburn, Soulpetre and Ashreborn, prairmakers, Glintalook, was asked by the sisterhood the vexed question during his midday collation of leaver and buckrom alternatively with stenk and kitteney phie in a hash-housh and, thankeaven, responsed impulsively: We have just been propogandering his nullity suit and what they took out of his ear among my own crush. All our fellows at O\u2019Dea\u2019s sages with Aratar Calaman he is a cemented brick, buck it all! A more nor usually sober cardriver, who was jauntingly hosing his runabout, Ginger Jane, took a strong view. Lorry hosed her as he talked and this is what he told rewritemen: Irewaker is just a plain pink joint reformee in private life but folks all have it by brehemons laws he has parliamentary honours.

A perspirer (over sixty) who was keeping up his tennises panted he kne ho har twa to clect infamatios but a diffpair flannels climb wall and trespassing on doorbell. After fullblown Braddon hear this fresky troterella! A railways barmaid\u2019s view (they call her Spilltears Rue) was thus expressed: to sympathisers of the Dole Line, Death Avenue, anent those objects of her pity-prompted ministrance, to wet, man and his syphon. Ehim! It is ever too late to whissle when Phyllis floods her stable.

Well done, Drumcollakill! Kitty Tyrrel is proud of you, was the reply of a B.O.T. official (O blame gnot the board!) while the Daughters Benkletter mur-mured in uniswoon: Golforgilhisjurylegs! Brian Lynsky, the cub curser, was questioned at his shouting box, Bawlonabraggat, and gave a snappy comeback, when saying: Paw! Once more I\u2019ll hellbowl! I am for caveman chase and sahara sex, burk you! Them two bitches ought to be leashed, canem! Up hog and hoar hunt! Paw! A wouldbe martyr, who is attending on sanit Asitas where he is being taught to wear bracelets, when grilled on the point, revealed the undoubted fact that the consequence would be that so long as Sankya Moondy played his mango tricks under the mysttetry, with shady apsaras sheltering in his leaves\u2019 licence and his shadowers torrifried by the potent bolts of indradiction, there would be fights all over Cuxhaven. (Tosh!) Missioner Ida Womb-well, the seventeenyearold revivalist, said concerning the coinci \u2014 dent of interfizzing with grenadines and other respectable and disgusted peersons using the park: That perpendicular person is a brut! But a magnificent brut! \u2018Caligula\u2019 (Mr Danl Magrath, bookmaker, wellknown to Eastrailian poorusers of the Sydney Parade Ballotin) was, as usual, antipodal with his: striving todie, hopening tomellow, Ware Splash.

Dauran\u2019s lord (\u2018Sniffpox\u2019) and Moir-gan\u2019s lady (\u2018Flatterfun\u2019) took sides and crossed and bowed to each other\u2019s views and recrossed themselves. The dirty dubs upin their flies, went too free, echoed the dainly drabs downin their scenities, una mona. Sylvia Silence, the girl detective (Meminerva, but by now one hears turtlings all over Doveland!) when supplied with informations as to the several facets of the case in her cozy-dozy bachelure\u2019s flat, quite overlooking John a\u2019Dream\u2019s mews, leaned back in her really truly easy chair to query restfully through her vowelthreaded syllabelles: Have you evew thought, wepow-tew, that sheew gweatness was his twadgedy?

Meagher, a naval rating, seated on one of the granite cromlech setts of our new fish-shambles for the usual aireating after the ever popular act, with whom were Questa and Puella, piquante and quoite, (this had a cold in her brain while that felt a sink in her summock, wit\u2019s wat, wot\u2019s wet) was encouraged, although nearvanashed himself, by one of his co-affianced to get your breath, Walt, and gobbit and when ther chidden by her fastra sastra to saddle up your pance, Naville, thus cor replied to her other\u2019s thankskissing: I lay my two fingerbuttons, fiancee Meagher, (he speaks!) he was to blame about your two velvetthighs up Horniman\u2019s Hill \u2014 as hook and eye blame him or any other piscman? \u2014 but I also think, Puellywally, by the siege of his trousers there was some-one else behind it \u2014 you bet your boughtem blarneys \u2014 about their three drummers down Keysars Lane.

The seventh city, Urovivla, his citadear of refuge, whither (would we believe the laimen and their counts), beyond the outraved gales of Atreeatic, changing clues with a baggermalster, the hejirite had fled, silentioussue-meant under night\u2019s altosonority, shipalone, a raven of the wave, (be mercy, Mara!

It was after the show at Wednesbury that one tall man, humping a suspicious parcel, when returning late amid a dense particular on his home way from the second house of the Boore and Burgess Christy Menestrels by the old spot, Roy\u2019s Corner, had a barkiss revolver placed to his faced with the words: you\u2019re shot, major: by an unknowable assailant (masked) against whom he had been jealous over, Lotta Crabtree or Pomona Evlyn. More than that Whenn the Waylayer (not a Lucalizod diocesan or even of the Glenda-lough see, but hailing fro\u2019 the prow of Little Britain), mention \u2014 ing in a bytheway that he, the crawsopper, had, in edition to Reade\u2019s cutless centiblade, a loaded Hobson\u2019s which left only twin alternatives as, viceversa, either he would surely shoot her, the aunt, by pistol, (she could be okaysure of that!) or, failing of such, bash in Patch\u2019s blank face beyond recognition, pointedly asked with gaeilish gall wodkar blizzard\u2019s business Thornton had with that Kane\u2019s fender only to be answered by the aggravated assaulted that that that was the snaps for him, Midweeks, to sultry well go and find out if he was showery well able.

Was it supposedly in connection with a girls, Myramy Huey or Colores Archer, under Flaggy Bridge (for ann there is but one liv and hir newbridge is her old) or to explode his twelvechamber and force a shrievalty entrance that the heavybuilt Abelbody in a butcherblue blouse from One Life One Suit (a men\u2019s wear store), with a most decisive bottle of single in his possession, seized after dark by the town guard at Haveyou-caught-emerod\u2019s temperance gateway was there in a gate\u2019s way.\n\nFifthly, how parasoliloquisingly truetoned on his first time of hearing the wretch\u2019s statement that, muttering Irish, he had had had o\u2019gloriously a\u2019lot too much hanguest or hoshoe fine to drink in the House of Blazes, the Parrot in Hell, the Orange Tree, the Glibt, the Sun, the Holy Lamb and, lapse not leashed, in Ramitdown\u2019s ship hotel since the morning moment he could dixtinguish a white thread from a black till the engine of the laws declosed unto Murray and was only falling fillthefluthered up against the gatestone pier which, with the cow\u2019s bonnet a\u2019top o\u2019it, he falsetook for a cattlepillar with purest peaceablest intentions. Yet how lamely hobbles the hoy of his then pseudo-jocax axplanation how, according to his own story, he vas a process server and was merely trying to open zozimus a bottlop stoub by mortially hammering his magnum bonum (the curter the club the sorer the savage) against the bludgey gate for the boots about the swan, Maurice Behan, who hastily into his shoes with nothing his hald barra tinnteack and came down with homp, shtemp and jumphet to the tiltyard from the wastes a\u2019sleep in his obi ohny overclothes or choker, attracted by the norse of guns playing Delandy is cartager on the raglar rock to Dulyn, said war\u2019 prised safe in bed as he dreamed that he\u2019d wealthes in mor-mon halls when wokenp by a fourth loud snore out of his land of byelo while hickstrey\u2019s maws was grazing in the moonlight by hearing hammering on the pandywhank scale emanating from the blind pig and anything like it (oonagh!oonagh!) in the whole history of the Mullingcan Inn he never. This battering babel allower the door and sideposts, he always said, was not in the very remotest like the belzey babble of a bottle of boose which would not rouse him out o\u2019 slumber deep but reminded him loads more of the martiallawsey marses of foreign musi-kants\u2019 instrumongs or the overthrewer to the third last days of Pompery, if anything.

A change in the weather is sufficient to create the world and oneself anew. Formerly, when the wind howled in my chimney, I would listen to the blows which it struck on the iron trap with as keen an emotion as if, like the famous bow-taps with which the C Minor Symphony opens, they had been the irresistible appeal of a mysterious destiny. Every change in the aspect of nature offers us a similar transformation by adapting our desires so as to harmonise with the new form of things. The mist, from the moment of my awakening, had made of me, instead of the centrifugal being which one is on fine days, a self-centred man, longing for the chimney corner and the nuptial couch, a shivering Adam in quest of a sedentary Eve, in this different world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Between the soft grey tint of a morning landscape and the taste of a cup of chocolate I tried to account for all the originality of the physical, intellectual and moral life which I had taken with me, about a year earlier, to Donci\u00e8res, and which, blazoned with the oblong form of a bare hillside \u2014 always present even when it was invisible \u2014 formed in me a series of pleasures entirely distinct from all others, incommunicable to my friends, in the sense that the impressions, richly interwoven with one another, which gave them their orchestral accompaniment were a great deal more characteristic of them, to my subconscious mind, than any facts that I might have related. From this point of view the new world in which the mist of this morning had immersed me was a world already known to me (which only made it more real) and forgotten for some time (which restored all its novelty). And I was able to look at several of the pictures of misty landscapes which my memory had acquired, notably a series of \u2018Mornings at Donci\u00e8res,\u2019 including my first morning there in barracks and another, in a neighbouring country house, where I had gone with Saint-Loup to spend the night: in which from the windows, whose curtains I had drawn back at daybreak, before getting into bed again, in the first a trooper, in the second (on the thin margin of a pond and a wood all the rest of which was engulfed in the uniform and liquid softness of the mist) a coachman busy polishing a strap had appeared to me like those rare figures, scarcely visible to the eye obliged to adapt itself to the mysterious vagueness of their half-lights, which emerge from an obliterated fresco\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was from my bed that I was looking this afternoon at these pictorial memories, for I had gone back to bed to wait until the hour came at which, taking advantage of the absence of my parents, who had gone for a few days to Combray, I proposed to get up and go to a little play which was being given that evening in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room. Had they been at home I should perhaps not have ventured to go out; my mother in the delicacy of her respect for my grandmother\u2019s memory, wished the tokens of regret that were paid to it to be freely and sincerely given; she would not have forbidden me this outing, she would have disapproved of it. From Combray, on the other hand, had I consulted her wishes, she would not have replied in a melancholy: \u201cDo just as you like; you are old enough now to know what is right or wrong,\u201d but, reproaching herself for having left me alone in Paris, and measuring my grief by her own, would have wished for it distractions of a sort which she would have refused to herself, and which she persuaded herself that my grandmother, solicitous above all things for my health and the preservation of my nervous balance, would have advised me to take\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That morning the furnace of the new steam heater had for the first time been lighted. Its disagreeable sound \u2014 an intermittent hiccough \u2014 had no part whatsoever in my memories of Donci\u00e8res. But its prolonged encounter, in me this afternoon, with them was to give it so lasting an affinity with them that whenever, after succeeding more or less in forgetting it, I heard the central heater hiccough again it reminded me of them\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was no one else in the house but Fran\u00e7oise. The grey light, falling like a fine rain on the earth, wove without ceasing a transparent web through which the Sunday holiday-makers appeared in a silvery sheen. I had flung to the foot of my bed the Figaro, for which I had been sending out religiously every morning, ever since I had sent in an article which it had not yet printed; despite the absence of the sun, the intensity of the daylight was an indication that we were still only half-way through the afternoon. The tulle window-curtains, vaporous and friable as they would not have been on a fine day, had that same blend of beauty and fragility that dragon flies\u2019 wings have, and Venetian glass. It depressed me all the more that I should be spending this Sunday by myself because I had sent a note that morning to Mlle, de Stermaria. Robert de Saint-Loup, whom his mother had at length succeeded in parting \u2014 after painful and abortive attempts \u2014 from his mistress, and who immediately afterwards had been sent to Morocco in the hope of his there forgetting one whom he had already for some little time ceased to love, had sent me a line, which had reached me the day before, announcing his arrival, presently, in France for a short spell of leave. As he would only be passing through Paris (where his family were doubtless afraid of seeing him renew relations with Rachel), he informed me, to shew me that he had been thinking of me, that he had met at Tangier Mile, or rather Mme. (for she had divorced her husband three months after their marriage) de Stermaria. And Robert, remembering what I had told him at Balbec, had asked her, on my behalf, to arrange a meeting. She would be delighted to dine with me, she had told him, on one of the evenings which, before her return to Brittany, she would be spending in Paris. He warned me to lose no time in writing to Mme. de Stermaria, for she would certainly have arrived before I got his letter. This had corne as no surprise to me, even although I had had no news of him since, at the time of my grandmother\u2019s last illness, he had accused me of perfidy and treachery. It had then been quite easy to see what must have happened. Rachel, who liked to provoke his jealousy \u2014 she had other reasons also for wishing me harm \u2014 had persuaded her lover that I had made a dastardly attempt to have relations with her in his absence. It is probable that he continued to believe in the truth of this allegation, but he had ceased to be in love with her, which meant that its truth or falsehood had become a matter of complete indifference to him, and our friendship alone remained. When, on meeting him again, I attempted to speak to him about his attack on me his sole answer was a cordial and friendly smile, which gave him the air of begging my pardon; then he turned the conversation to something else. All this was not to say that he did not, a little later, see Rachel occasionally when he was in Paris. The fellow-creatures who have played a leading part in one\u2019s life very rarely disappear from it suddenly with any finality. They return to take their old place in it at odd moments (so much so as to lead people to believe in a renewal of old love) before leaving it for ever. Saint-Loup\u2019s breach with Rachel had very soon become less painful to him, thanks to the soothing pleasure that was given him by her incessant demands for money. Jealousy, which prolongs the course of love, is not capable of containing many more ingredients than are the other forms of imagination. If one takes with one, when one starts on a journey, three or four images which incidentally one is sure to lose on the way (such as the lilies and anemones heaped on the Ponte Vecchio, or the Persian church shrouded in mist), one\u2019s trunk is already pretty full. When one parts from a mistress one would be just as glad, until one has begun to forget her, that she should not become the property of three or four potential protectors whom one has in one\u2019s mind\u2019s eye, of whom, that is to say, one is jealous: all those whom one does not so picture count for nothing. Now frequent demands for money from a cast-off mistress no more give one a complete idea of her life than charts shewing a high temperature would of her illness. But the latter would at any rate be an indication that she was ill, and the former furnish a presumption, vague enough, it is true, that the forsaken one, or forsaker (whichever she be) cannot have found anything very remarkable in the way of rich protectors. And so each demand is welcomed with the joy which a lull produces in the jealous one\u2019s sufferings, while he responds to it at once by dispatching money, for naturally he does not like to think of her being in want of anything, except lovers (one of the three lovers he has in his mind\u2019s eye), until time has enabled him to regain his composure and he can learn without the slightest emotion the name of his successor. Sometimes Rachel came in so late at night that she could ask her former lover\u2019s permission to lie down beside him until the morning. This was a great comfort to Robert, for it refreshed his memory of how they had, after all, lived in intimacy together merely to see that even if he took the greater part of the bed for himself it did not in the least interfere with her sleep. He realised that she was more comfortable, lying close to his body, than she would have been elsewhere, that she felt herself, by his side \u2014 even in an hotel \u2014 to be in a bedroom known of old, in which the force of habit prevails and one sleeps better. He felt that his shoulders, his limbs, all of him were for her, even when he was unduly restless, from sleeplessness or from having to get up in the night things so entirely usual that they could not disturb her, and that the perception of them added still further to her sense of repose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To revert to where we were, I had been all the more disquieted by Robert\u2019s letter in that I could read between the lines what he had not ventured to write more explicitly. \u201cYou can most certainly ask her to dine in a private room,\u201d he told me. \u201cShe is a charming young person, a delightful nature you will get on splendidly with her, and I am sure you will have a capital evening together.\u201d As my parents were returning at the end of the week on Saturday or Sunday, and as after that I should be forced to dine every evening at home, I had written at once to Mme. de Stermaria, proposing any evening that might suit her, up to Friday. A message was brought back that I should hear from her in writing the same evening, about eight o\u2019clock. The time would have passed quickly enough if I had had, during the afternoon that separated me from her letter, the help of a visit from anyone else. When the hours pass wrapped in conversation one ceases to count, or indeed to notice them, they vanish, and suddenly it is a long way beyond the point at which it escaped you that there reappears the nimble truant time. But if we are alone, our preoccupation, by bringing before us the still distant and incessantly awaited moment with the frequency and uniformity of a ticking pendulum, divides, or rather multiplies the hours by all the minutes which, had we been with friends, we should not have counted. And confronted, by the incessant return of my desire, with the ardent pleasure which I was going to taste \u2014 not for some days though, alas! \u2014 in Mme. de Stermaria\u2019s company, this afternoon, which I should have to spend by myself, seemed to me very empty and very melancholy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every now and then I heard the sound of the lift coming up, but it was followed by a second sound, not that for which I was hoping, namely the sound of its coming to a halt at our landing, but another very different sound which the lift made in continuing its progress to the floors above and which, because it so often meant the desertion of my floor when I was expecting a visitor, remained for me at other times, even when I had no wish to see anyone, a sound lugubrious in itself, in which there echoed, as it were, a sentence of solitary confinement. Weary, resigned, busy for several hours still over its immemorial task, the grey day stitched its shimmering needlework of light and shade, and it saddened me to think that I was to be left alone with a thing that knew me no more than would a seamstress who, installed by the window so as to see better while she finished her work, paid no attention to the person present with her in the room. Suddenly, although I had heard no bell, Fran\u00e7oise opened the door to let in Albertine, who came forward smiling, silent, plump, containing in the fulness of her body, made ready so that I might continue living them, come in search of me, the days we had spent together at that Balbec to which I had never since returned. No doubt, whenever we see again a person with whom our relations \u2014 however trivial they may have been \u2014 are altered, it is like a juxtaposition of two different periods. For this, we do not require that a former mistress should come to call upon us as a friend, all that we need is the visit to Paris of a person whom we had known in the daily round of some particular kind of life, and that this life should have ceased for us, were it no more than a week ago. On each of Albertine\u2019s smiling, questioning, blushing features I could read the questions: \u201cAnd Madame de Villeparisis? And the dancing-master? And the pastry-cook?\u201d When she sat down her back seemed to be saying: \u201cGracious! There\u2019s no cliff here; you don\u2019t mind if I sit down beside you, all the same, as I used to do at Balbec?\u201d She was like an enchantress handing me a mirror that reflected time. In this she was like all the people whom we seldom see now but with whom at one time we lived on more intimate terms. With Al-bertine, however, there was something more than this. Certainly, even at Balbec, in our daily encounters, I had always been surprised when she came in sight, so variable was her appearance from day to day. But now it was difficult to recognise her. Cleared of the pink vapour that used to bathe them, her features had emerged like those of a statue. She had another face, or rather she had a face at last; her body too had grown. There remained scarcely anything now of the shell in which she had been enclosed and on the surface of which, at Balbec, her future outline had been barely visible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This time, Albertine had returned to Paris earlier than usual. As a rule she came only in the spring, which meant that, already disturbed for some weeks past by the storms that were beating down the first flowers, I did not distinguish, in the elements of the pleasure that I felt, the return of Albertine from that of the fine weather. It was enough that I should be told that she was in Paris and that she had called at the house, for me to see her again like a rose flowering by the sea. I cannot say whether it was the desire for Balbec or for herself that overcame me at such moments; possibly my desire for her was itself a lazy, cowardly, and incomplete method of possessing Balbec, as if to possess a thing materially, to take up one\u2019s abode in a town, were equivalent to possessing it spiritually. Besides, even materially, when she was no longer posed by my imagination before a horizon of sea, but sitting still in a room with me, she seemed to me often a very poor specimen of a rose, so poor, indeed, that I would gladly have shut my eyes in order not to observe this or that blemish of its petals, and to imagine instead that I was inhaling the salt air on the beach\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I must say it at this point, albeit I was not then aware of what was to happen only later on. Certainly, it is more reasonable to devote one\u2019s life to women than to postage stamps or old snuff-boxes, even to pictures or statues. Only the example of other collectors should be a warning to us to make changes, to have not one woman only but several. Those charming suggestions in which a girl abounds of a sea-beach, of the braided hair of a statue in church, of an old print, of everything that makes one see and admire in her, whenever she appears, a charming composition, those suggestions are not very stable. Live with a woman altogether and you will soon cease to see any of the things that made you love her; though I must add that these two sundered elements can be reunited by jealousy. If, after a long period of life in common, I was to end by seeing nothing more in Albertine than an ordinary woman, an intrigue between her and some person whom she had loved at Balbec would still suffice, perhaps, to reincorporate in her, to amalgamate the beach and the unrolling of the tide. Only, as these secondary suggestions no longer captivate our eyes, it is to the heart that they are perceptible and fatal. We cannot, under so dangerous a form, regard the repetition of the miracle as a thing to be desired. But I am anticipating the course of years. And here I need only state my regret that I did not have the sense simply to have kept my collection of women as people keep their collections of old quizzing glasses, never so complete, in their cabinet, that there is not room always for another and rarer still\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Departing from the customary order of her holiday movements, this year she had come straight from Balbec, where furthermore she had not stayed nearly so late as usual. It was a long time since I had seen her, and as I did not know even by name the people with whom she was in the habit of mixing in Paris, I could form no impression of her during the periods in which she abstained from coming to see me. These lasted often for quite a time. Then, one fine day, in would burst Albertine whose rosy apparitions and silent visits left me little if any better informed as to what she might have been doing in an interval which remained plunged in that darkness of her hidden life which my eyes felt little anxiety to pierce\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This time, however, certain signs seemed to indicate that some new experience must have entered into that life. And yet, perhaps, all that one was entitled to conclude from them was that girls change very rapidly at the age which Albertine had now reached. For instance, her intellect was now more in evidence, and on my reminding her of the day when she had insisted with so much ardour on the superiority of her idea of making Sophocles write: \u201cMy dear Racine,\u201d she was the first to laugh, quite wholeheartedly, at her own stupidity. \u201cAndr\u00e9e was quite right; it was stupid of me,\u201d she admitted. \u201cSophocles ought to have begun: \u2018Sir.\u2019\u201d I replied that the \u2018Sir,\u2019 and \u2018Dear Sir,\u2019 of Andr\u00e9e were no less comic than her own \u2018My dear Racine,\u2019 or Gis\u00e8le\u2019s \u2018My dear Friend,\u2019 but that after all the really stupid people were the Professors who still went on making Sophocles write letters to Racine. Here, however, Albertine was unable to follow me. She could not see in what the silliness consisted; her intelligence was dawning, but had not fully developed. There were other more attractive novelties in her; I felt, in this same pretty girl who had just sat down by my bed, something that was different; and in those lines which, in one\u2019s eyes and other features, express one\u2019s general attitude towards life, a change of front, a partial conversion, as though there had now been shattered those resistances against which I had hurled my strength in vain at Balbec, one evening, now remote in time, on which we formed a couple symmetrical with but the converse of our present arrangement, since then it had lieen she who was lying down and I who sat by her bedside. Wishing and not venturing to make certain whether now she would let herself be kissed, every time that she rose to go I asked her to stay beside me a little longer. This was a concession not very easy to obtain, for albeit she had nothing to do (otherwise she would have rushed from the house) she was a person methodical in her habits and moreover not very gracious towards me, scarcely to be at ease in my company, and yet each time, after looking at her watch, she sat down again at my request until finally she had spent several hours with me without my having asked her for anything; the things I was saying to her followed logically those that I had said during the hours before, and bore no relation to what I was thinking about, what I desired from her, remained indefinitely parallel. There is nothing like desire for preventing the thing one says from bearing any resemblance to what one has in one\u2019s mind. Time presses, and yet it seems as though we were seeking to gain time by speaking of subjects absolutely alien to that by which we are obsessed. We then arrange that the sentence which we should like to utter shall be accompanied, or rather preluded, by a gesture, supposing that is to say that we have not to give ourselves the pleasure of an immediate demonstration and to gratify the curiosity we feel as to the reactions which will follow it, without a word said, without even a \u2018By your leave,\u2019 already made this gesture. Certainly I was not in the least in love with Albertine; child of the mists outside, she could merely content the imaginative desire which the change of weather had awakened in me and which was midway between the desires that are satisfied by the arts of the kitchen and of monumental sculpture respectively, for it made me dream simultaneously of mingling with my flesh a substance different and warm, and of attaching at some point to my outstretched body a body divergent, as the body of Eve barely holds by the feet to the side of Adam, to whose body hers is almost perpendicular, in those romanesque bas-reliefs on the church at Balbec which represent in so noble and so reposeful a fashion, still almost like a classical frieze, the Creation of Woman; God in them is everywhere followed, as by two ministers, by two little angels in whom the visitor recognises \u2014 like winged, swarming summer creatures which winter has surprised and spared \u2014 cupids from Herculaneum, still surviving well into the thirteenth century, and winging their last slow flight, weary but never failing in the grace that might be expected of them, over the whole front of the porch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for this pleasure which by accomplishing my desire would have set me free from these meditations and which I should have sought quite as readily from any other pretty woman, had I been asked upon what \u2014 in the course of this endless flow of talk throughout which I took care to keep from Albertine the one thing that was in my mind \u2014 was based my optimistic hypothesis with regard to her possible complaisances, I should perhaps have answered that this hypothesis was due (while the forgotten outlines of Albertine\u2019s voice retraced for me the contour of her personality) to the apparition of certain words which did not form part of her vocabulary, or at least not in the acceptation which she now gave them. Thus she said to roe that Elstir was stupid, and, on my protesting:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she replied, smiling, \u201cI mean that it was stupid of him to behave like that; of course I know he\u2019s quite a distinguished Person, really.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, wishing to say of the Fontainebleau golf club that it was smart, she declared: \u201cThey are quite a selection.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of a duel that I had fought, she said of my seconds: \u201cWhat very choice seconds,\u201d and looking at my face confessed that she would like to see me \u2018wear a moustache.\u2019 She even went so far (and my chance appeared then enormous) as to announce, in a phrase of which I would have sworn that she was ignorant a year earlier, that since she had last seen Gis\u00e8le there had passed a certain \u2018lapse of time.\u2019 This was not to say that Albertine had not already possessed, when I was at Balbec, a quite adequate assortment of those expressions which reveal at once that one\u2019s people are in easy circumstances, and which, year by year, a mother passes on to her daughter just as she bestows on her, gradually, as the girl grows up, on important occasions, her own jewels. It was evident that Albertine had ceased to be a little girl when one day, to express her thanks for a present which a strange lady had given her, she had said: \u201cI am quite confused.\u201d Mme. Bontemps could not help looking across at her husband whose comment was:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGad, she\u2019s old for fourteen.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The approach of nubility had been more strongly marked still when Albertine, speaking of another girl whose tone was bad, said: \u201cOne can\u2019t even tell whether she\u2019s pretty, she paints her face a foot thick.\u201d Finally, though still a schoolgirl, she already displayed the manner of a grown woman of her upbringing and station when she said, of some one whose face twitched: \u201cI can\u2019t look at him, because it makes me want to do the same,\u201d or, if some one else were being imitated: \u201cThe absurd thing about it is that when you imitate her voice you look exactly like her.\u201d All these are drawn from the social treasury. But it did not seem to me possible that Albertine\u2019s natural environment could have supplied her with \u2018distinguished,\u2019 used in the sense in which my father would say of a colleague whom he had not actually met, but whose intellectual attainments he had heard praised: \u201cIt appears he\u2019s quite a distinguished person.\u201d \u2018Selection,\u2019 even when used of a golf club, seemed to me as incompatible with the Simonet family as it would be if preceded by the adjective \u2018Natural,\u2019 with a text published centuries before the researches of Darwin. \u2018Lapse of time\u2019 struck me as being of better augury still. Finally there appeared the evidence of certain upheavals, the nature of which was unknown to me, but sufficient to justify me in all my hopes when Albertine announced, with the satisfaction of a person whose opinion is by no means to be despised:\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo my mind, that is the best thing that could possibly happen. I regard it as the best solution, the stylish way out.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was so novel, so manifestly an alluvial deposit giving one to suspect such capricious wanderings over soil hitherto unknown to her, that on hearing the words \u2018to my mind\u2019 I drew Albertine towards me, and at \u2018I regard\u2019 made her sit on the side of my bed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt it does happen that women of moderate culture, on marrying well-read men, receive such expressions as part of their paraphernalia. And shortly after the metamorphosis which follows the wedding night, when they begin to pay calls, and talk shyly to the friends of their girlhood, one notices with surprise that they have turned into matrons if, in deciding that some person is intelligent, they sound both l\u2019s in the word; but that is precisely the sign of a change of state, and I could see a difference when I thought of the vocabulary of the Albertine I had known of old \u2014 a vocabulary in which the most daring flights were to say of any unusual person: \u2018He\u2019s a type,\u2019 or, if you suggested a game of cards to her: \u2018I\u2019ve no money to lose,\u2019 or again, if any of her friends were to reproach her, in terms which she felt to be undeserved: \u2018That really is magnificent!\u2019 an expression dictated in such cases by a sort of middle-class tradition almost as old as the Magnificat itself, and one which a girl slightly out of temper and confident that she is in the right employs, as the saying is, \u2018quite naturally,\u2019 that is to say because she has learned the words from her mother, just as she has learned to say her prayers or to greet a friend. All these expressions Mme. Bontemps had imparted to her at the same time as her hatred of the Jews and her feeling for black, which was always suitable and becoming, indeed without any formal instruction, but as the piping of the parent goldfinches serves as a model for that of the young ones, recently hatched, so that they in turn grow into true goldfinches also. But when all was said, \u2018selection\u2019 appeared to me of alien growth and \u2018I regard\u2019 encouraging. Albertine was no longer the same; which meant that she would not perhaps act, would not react in the same way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only did I no longer feel any love for her, but I had no longer to consider, as I should have had at Balbec, the risk of shattering in her an affection for myself, which no longer existed. There could be no doubt that she had long since become quite indifferent to me. I was well aware that to her I was in no sense a member now of the \u2018little band\u2019 into which I had at one time so anxiously sought and had then been so happy to have secured admission. Besides, as she had no longer even, as in Balbec days, an air of frank good nature, I felt no serious scruples: still I believe that what made me finally decide was another philological discovery. As, continuing to add fresh links to the external chain of talk behind which I hid my intimate desire, I spoke, having Albertine secure now on the corner of my bed, of one of the girls of the little band, one smaller than the rest, whom, nevertheless, I had thought quite pretty, \u201cYes,\u201d answered Albertine, \u201cshe reminds me of a little mousm\u00e9.\u201d There had been nothing in the world to shew, when I first knew Albertine, that she had ever heard the wordmousm\u00e9. It was probable that, had things followed their normal course, she would never have learned it, and for my part I should have seen no cause for regret in that, for there is no more horrible word in the language. The mere sound of it makes one\u2019s teeth ache as they do when one has put too large a spoonful of ice in one\u2019s mouth. But coming from Albertine, as she sat there looking so pretty, not even \u2018mousm\u00e9\u2018 could strike me as unpleasant. On the contrary, I felt it to be a revelation, if not of an outward initiation, at any rate of an inward evolution. Unfortunately it was now time for me to bid her good-bye if I wished her to reach home in time for her dinner, and myself to be out of bed and dressed in time for my own. It was Fran\u00e7oise who was getting it ready; she did not like having to keep it back, and must already have found it an infringement of one of the articles of her code that Albertine, in the absence of my parents, should be paying me so prolonged a visit, and one which was going to make everything late. But before \u2018mousm\u00e9\u2018 all these arguments fell to the ground and I hastened to say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust fancy; I\u2019m not in the least ticklish; you can go on tickling me for an hour on end and I won\u2019t even feel it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI assure you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She understood, doubtless, that this was the awkward expression of a desire on my part, for, like a person who offers to give you an introduction for which you have not ventured to ask him, though what you have said has shewn him that it would be of great service to you\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWould you like me to try?\u201d she inquired, with womanly meekness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust as you like, but you would be more comfortable if you lay down properly on the bed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLike that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; get right on top.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re sure I\u2019m not too heavy?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she uttered these words the door opened and Fran\u00e7oise, carrying a lamp, came in. Albertine had just time to fling herself back upon her chair. Perhaps Fran\u00e7oise had chosen this moment to confound us, having been listening at the door or even peeping through the keyhole. But there was no need to suppose anything of the sort; she might have scorned to assure herself, by the use of her eyes, of what her instinct must plainly enough have detected, for by dint of living with me and my parents her fears, her prudence, her alertness, her cunning had ended by giving her that instinctive and almost prophetic knowledge of us all that the mariner has of the sea, the quarry of the hunter, and, of the malady, if not the physician, often at any rate the patient. The amount of knowledge that she managed to acquire would have astounded a stranger, and with as good reason as does the advanced state of certain arts and sciences among the ancients, seeing that there was practically no source of information open to them. (Her sources were no larger. They were a few casual remarks forming barely a twentieth part of our conversation at dinner, caught on the wing by the butler and inaccurately transmitted to the kitchen.) Again, her mistakes were due, like theirs, like the fables in which Plato believed, rather to a false conception of the world and to preconceived ideas than to the insufficiency of the materials at her disposal. Only the other day, has it not been possible for the most important discoveries as to the habits of insects to be made by a scientist who had access to no laboratory and used no instruments of any sort? But if the drawbacks arising from her menial position had not prevented her from acquiring a stock of learning indispensable to the art which was its ultimate goal \u2014 and which consisted in putting us to confusion by communicating to us the results of her discoveries \u2014 the limitations under which she worked had done more; in this case the impediment, not content with merely not paralysing the flight of her imagination, had greatly strengthened it. Of course Fran\u00e7oise never let slip any artificial device, those for example of diction and attitude. Since (if she never believed what we said to her, hoping that she would believe it) she admitted without any shadow of doubt the truth of anything that any person of her own condition in life might tell her, however absurd, which might at the same time prove shocking to our ideas, just as her way of listening to our assertions bore witness to her incredulity, so the accents in which she reported (the use of indirect speech enabling her to hurl the most deadly insults at us with impunity) the narrative of a cook who had told her how she had threatened her employers, and won from them, by treating them before all the world like dirt, any number of privileges and concessions, shewed that the story was to her as gospel. Fran\u00e7oise went so far as to add: \u201cI\u2019m sure, if I had been the mistress I should have been quite vexed.\u201d In vain might we, despite our scant sympathy at first with the lady on the fourth floor, shrug our shoulders, as though at an unlikely fable, at this report of so shocking an example; in making it the teller was able to speak with the crushing, the lacerating force of the most unquestionable, most irritating affirmation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But above all, just as great writers often attain to a power of concentration from which they would have been dispensed under a system of political liberty or literary anarchy, when they are bound by the tyranny of a monarch or of a school of poetry, by the severity of prosodie laws or of a state religion, so Fran\u00e7oise, not being able to reply to us in an explicit fashion, spoke like Tiresias and would have written like Tacitus. She managed to embody everything that she could not express directly in a sentence for which we could not find fault with her without accusing ourselves, indeed in less than a sentence, in a silence, in the way in which she placed a thing in a room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus when I happened to leave, by accident, on my table, among a pile of other letters, one which it was imperative that she should not see, because, let us say, it referred to her with a dislike which afforded a presumption of the same feeling towards her in the recipient as in the writer, that evening, if I came home with a troubled conscience and went straight to my room, there on top of my letters, neatly arranged in a symmetrical pile, the compromising document caught my eye as it could not possibly have failed to catch the eye of Fran\u00e7oise, placed by her right at the top, almost separated from the rest, in a prominence that was a form of speech, that had an eloquence all its own, and, as I stood in the doorway, made me shudder like a cry. She excelled in the preparation of these scenic effects, intended so to enlighten the spectator, in her absence, that he already knew that she knew everything when in due course she made her appearance. She possessed, for thus making an inanimate object speak, the art, at once inspired and painstaking, of Irving or Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lema\u00eetre. On this occasion, holding over Albertine and myself the lighted lamp whose searching beams missed none of the still visible depressions which the girl\u2019s body had hollowed in the counterpane, Fran\u00e7oise made one think of a picture of \u2018Justice throwing light upon Crime.\u2019 Albertine\u2019s face did not suffer by this illumination. It revealed on her cheeks the same sunny burnish that had charmed me at Balbec. This face of Albertine, the general effect of Which sometimes was, out of doors, a sort of milky pallor, now shewed, according as the lamp shone on them, surfaces so dazzlingly, so uniformly coloured, so firm, so glowing that one might have compared them to the sustained flesh tints of certain flowers. Taken aback meanwhile by the unexpected entry of Fran\u00e7oise, I exclaimed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat? The lamp already? I say, the light is strong!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My object, as may be imagined, was by the second of these ejaculations to account for my confusion, by the first to excuse my lateness in rising. Fran\u00e7oise replied with a cruel ambiguity:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you want me to extinglish it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2014 guish!\u201d Albertine slipped into my ear, leaving me charmed by the familiar vivacity with which, taking me at once for teacher and for accomplice, she insinuated this psychological affirmation as though asking a grammatical question. When Fran\u00e7oise had left the room and Albertine was seated once again on my bed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you know what I\u2019m afraid of?\u201d I asked her. \u201cIt is that if we go on like this I may not be able to resist the temptation to kiss you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat would be a fine pity.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not respond at once to this invitation, which another man might even have found superfluous, for Albertine\u2019s way of pronouncing her words was so carnal, so seductive that merely in speaking to you she seemed to be caressing you. A word from her was a favour, and her conversation covered you with kisses. And yet it was highly attractive to me, this invitation. It would have been so, indeed, coming from any pretty girl of Albertine\u2019s age; but that Albertine should be now so accessible to me gave me more than pleasure, brought before my eyes a series of images that bore the stamp of beauty. I recalled the original Albertine standing between me and the beach, almost painted upon a background of sea, having for me no more real existence than those figures seen on the stage, when one knows not whether one is looking at the actress herself who is supposed to appear, at an understudy who for the moment is taking her principal\u2019s part, or at a mere projection from a lantern. Then the real woman had detached herself from the luminous mass, had come towards me, with the sole result that I had been able to see that she had nothing in real life of that amorous facility which one supposed to be stamped upon her in the magic pictures. I had learned that it was not possible to touch her, to embrace her, that one might only talk to her, that\u2019 for me she was no more a woman than the jade grapes, an inedible decoration at one time in fashion on dinner tables, are really fruit. And now she was appearing to me in a third plane, real as in the second experience that I had had of her but facile as in the first; facile, and all the more deliciously so in that I had so long imagined that she was not. My surplus knowledge of life (of a life less uniform, less simple than I had at first supposed it to be) inclined me provisionally towards agnosticism. What can one positively affirm, when the thing that one thought probable at first has then shewn itself to be false and in the third instance turns out true? And alas, I was not yet at the end of my discoveries with regard to Albertine. In any case, even if there had not been the romantic attraction of this disclosure of a greater wealth of planes revealed one after another by life (an attraction the opposite of that which Saint-Loup had felt during our dinners at Rivebelle on recognising beneath the mask with which the course of existence had overlaid them, in a calm face, features to which his lips had once been pressed), the knowledge that to kiss Albertine\u2019s cheeks was a possible thing was a pleasure perhaps greater even than that of kissing them. What a difference between possessing a woman to whom one applies one\u2019s body alone, because she is no more than a piece of flesh, and possessing the girl whom one used to see on the beach with her friends on certain days without even knowing why one saw her on those days and not on others, which made one tremble to think that one might not see her again. Life had obligingly revealed to one in its whole extent the romance of this little girl, had lent one, for the study of her, first one optical instrument, then another, and had added to one\u2019s carnal desire an accompaniment which multiplied it an hundredfold and diversified it with those other desires, more spiritual and less easily assuaged, which do not emerge from their torpor, leaving carnal desire to move by itself, when it aims only at the conquest of a piece of flesh, but which to gain possession of a whole tract of memories, whence they have felt the wretchedness of exile, rise in a tempest round about it, enlarge, extend it, are unable to follow it to the accomplishment, the assimilation, impossible in the form in which it is looked for, of an immaterial reality, but wait for this desire halfway and at the moment of recollection, of return furnish it afresh with their escort; to kiss, instead of the cheeks of the first comer, however cool and fresh they might be, but anonymous, with no secret, with no distinction, those of which I had so long been dreaming, would be to know the taste, the savour of a colour on which I had endlessly gazed. One has seen a woman, a mere image in the decorative setting of life, like Albertine, outlined against the sea, and then one has been able to take that image, to detach it, to bring it close to oneself, gradually to discern its solidity, its colours, as though one had placed it behind the glasses of a stereoscope. It is for this reason that the women who are a little difficult, whose resistance one does not at once overcome, of whom one does not indeed know at first whether one ever will overcome it, are alone interesting. For to know them, to approach them, to conquer them is to make fluctuate in form, in dimensions, in relief the human image, is an example of relativity in the appreciation of an image which it is delightful to see afresh when it has resumed the slender proportions of a silhouette in the setting of one\u2019s life. The women one meets first of all in a brothel are of no interest because they remain invariable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Albertine preserved, inseparably attached to her, all my impressions of a series of seascapes of which I was particularly fond. I felt that it was possible for me, on the girl\u2019s two cheeks, to kiss the whole of the beach at Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you really don\u2019t mind my kissing you, I would rather put it off for a little and choose a good moment. Only you mustn\u2019t forget that you\u2019ve said I may. I shall want a voucher: \u2018Valid for one kiss.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShall I have to sign it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut if I took it now, should I be entitled to another later on?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou do make me laugh with your vouchers; I shall issue a new one every now and then.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me; just one thing more. You know, at Balbec, before I had been introduced to you, you used often to have a hard, calculating look; you can\u2019t tell me what you were thinking about when you looked like that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; I don\u2019t remember at all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait; this may remind you: one day your friend Gis\u00e8le put her feet together and jumped over the chair an old gentleman was sitting in. Try to remember what was in your mind at that moment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGis\u00e8le was the one we saw least of; she did belong to the band, I suppose, but not properly. I expect I thought that she was very ill-bred and common.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, is that all?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should certainly have liked, before kissing her, to be able to fill her afresh with the mystery which she had had for me on the beach before I knew her, to find latent in her the place in which she had lived earlier still; for that, at any rate, if I knew nothing of it, I could substitute all my memories of our life at Balbec, the sound of the waves rolling up and breaking beneath my window, the shouts of the children. But when I let my eyes glide over the charming pink globe of her cheeks, the gently curving surfaces of which ran up to expire beneath the first foothills of her piled black tresses which ran in undulating mountain chains, thrust out escarped ramparts and moulded the hollows of deep valleys, I could not help saying to myself: \u201cNow at last, after failing at Balbec, I am going to learn the fragrance of the secret rose that blooms in Albertine\u2019s cheeks, and, since the cycles through which we are able to make things and people pass in the course of our existence are comparatively few, perhaps I ought now to regard mine as nearing its end when, having made to emerge from its remoteness the flowering face that I had chosen from among all others, I shall have brought it into this new plane in which I shall at last acquire a tactual experience of it with my lips.\u201d I told myself this because I believed that there was such a thing as knowledge acquired by the lips; I told myself that I was going to know the taste of this fleshly rose, because I had never stopped to think that man, a creature obviously less rudimentary in structure than the sea-urchin or even the whale, is nevertheless still unprovided with a certain number of essential organs, and notably possesses none that will serve for kissing. The place of this absent organ he supplies with his lips, and thereby arrives perhaps at a slightly more satisfying result than if he were reduced to caressing the beloved with a horny tusk. But a pair of lips, designed to convey to the palate the taste of whatever whets the appetite, must be content, without ever realising their mistake or admitting their disappointment, with roaming over the surface and with coming to a halt at the barrier of the impenetrable but irresistible cheek. Besides, at such moments, at the actual contact between flesh and flesh, the lips, even supposing them to become more expert and better endowed, could taste no better probably the savour which nature prevents their ever actually grasping, for in that desolate zone in which they are unable to find their proper nourishment, they are alone; the sense of sight, then that of smell have long since deserted them. To begin with, as my mouth began gradually to approach the cheeks which my eyes had suggested to it that it should kiss, my eyes, changing their position, saw a different pair of cheeks; the throat, studied at closer range and as though through a magnifying glass shewed in its coarse grain a robustness which modified the character of the face\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from the most recent applications of the art of photography \u2014 which set crouching at the foot of a cathedral all the houses which, time and again, when we stood near them, have appeared to us to reach almost to the height of the towers, drill and deploy like a regiment, in file, in open order, in mass, the same famous and familiar structures, bring into actual contact the two columns on the Piazzetta which a moment ago were so far apart, thrust away the adjoining dome of the Salute, and in a pale and toneless background manage to include a whole immense horizon within the span of a bridge, in the embrasure of a window, among the leaves of a tree that stands in the foreground and is portrayed in a more vigorous tone, give successively as setting to the same church the arched walls of all the others \u2014 I can think of nothing that can so effectively as a kiss evoke from what we believe to be a thing with one definite aspect, the hundred other things which it may equally well be since each is related to a view of it no less legitimate. In short, just as at Balbec Albertine had often appeared to me different, so now, as if, wildly accelerating the speed of the changes of aspect and changes of colouring which a person presents to us in the course of our various encounters, I had sought to contain them all in the space of a few seconds so as to reproduce experimentally the phenomenon which diversifies the individuality of a fellow creature, and to draw out one from another, like a nest of boxes, all the possibilities that it contains, in this brief passage of my lips towards her cheek it was ten Albertines that I saw; this single girl being like a goddess with several heads, that which I had last seen, if I tried to approach it, gave place to another. At least so long as I had not touched it, that head, I could still see it, a faint perfume reached me from it. But alas \u2014 for in this matter of kissing our nostrils and eyes are as ill placed as our lips are shaped \u2014 suddenly my eyes ceased to see; next, my nose, crushed by the collision, no longer perceived any fragrance, and, without thereby gaining any clearer idea of the taste of the rose of my desire, I learned, from these unpleasant signs, that at last I was in the act of kissing Albertine\u2019s cheek\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it because we were enacting \u2014 as may be illustrated by the rotation of a solid body \u2014 the converse of our scene together at Balbec, because it was I, now, who was lying in bed and she who sat beside me, capable of evading any brutal attack and of dictating her pleasure to me, that she allowed me to take so easily now what she had refused me on the former occasion with so forbidding a frown? (No doubt from that same frown the voluptuous expression which her face assumed now at the approach of my lips differed only by a deviation of its lines immeasurably minute but one in which may be contained all the disparity that there is between the gesture of \u2018finishing off\u2019 a wounded man and that of bringing him relief, between a sublime and a hideous portrait.) Not knowing whether I had to give the credit, and to feel grateful for this change of attitude to some unwitting benefactor who in these last months, in Paris or at Balbec, had been working on my behalf, I supposed that the respective positions in which we were now placed might account for it. It was quite another explanation, however, that Albertine offered me; this, in short: \u201cOh, well, you see, that time at Balbec I didn\u2019t know you properly. For all I knew, you might have meant mischief.\u201d This argument left me in perplexity. Albertine was no doubt sincere in advancing it. So difficult is it for a woman to recognise in the movements of her limbs, in the sensations felt by her body in the course of an intimate conversation with a friend, the unknown sin into which she would tremble to think that a stranger was planning her fall\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any case, whatever the modifications that had occurred at some recent time in her life, which might perhaps have explained why it was that she now readily accorded to my momentary and purely physical desire what at Balbec she had with horror refused to allow to my love, another far more surprising manifested itself in Albertine that same evening as soon as her caresses had procured in me the satisfaction which she could not have failed to notice, which, indeed, I had been afraid might provoke in her the instinctive movement of revulsion and offended modesty which Gilberte had given at a corresponding moment behind the laurel shrubbery in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The exact opposite happened. Already, when I had first made her lie on my bed and had begun to fondle her, Albertine had assumed an air which I did not remember in her, of docile good will, of an almost childish simplicity. Obliterating every trace of her customary anxieties and interests, the moment preceding pleasure, similar in this respect to the moment after death, had restored to her rejuvenated features what seemed like the innocence of earliest childhood. And no doubt everyone whose special talent is suddenly brought into play becomes modest, devoted, charming; especially if by this talent he knows that he is giving us a great pleasure, he is himself happy in the display of it, anxious to present it to us in as complete a form as possible. But in this new expression on Albertine\u2019s face there was more than a mere profession of disinterestedness, conscience, generosity, a sort of conventional and unexpected devotion; and it was farther than to her own childhood, it was to the infancy of the race that she had reverted. Very different from myself who had looked for nothing more than a physical alleviation, which I had finally secured, Albertine seemed to feel that it would indicate a certain coarseness on her part were she to seem to believe that this material pleasure could be unaccompanied by a moral sentiment or was to be regarded as terminating anything. She, who had been in so great a hurry a moment ago, now, presumably because she felt that kisses implied love and that love took precedence of all other duties, said when I reminded her of her dinner:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but that doesn\u2019t matter in the least; I have plenty of time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seemed embarrassed by the idea of getting up and going immediately after what had happened, embarrassed by good manners, just as Fran\u00e7oise when, without feeling thirsty, she had felt herself bound to accept with a seemly gaiety the glass of wine which Jupien offered her, would never have dared to leave him as soon as the last drops were drained, however urgent the call of duty. Albertine \u2014 and this was perhaps, with another which the reader will learn in due course, one of the reasons which bad made me unconsciously desire her \u2014 was one of the incarnations of the little French peasant whose type may be seen in stone at Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs. As in Fran\u00e7oise, who presently nevertheless was to become her deadly enemy, I recognised in her a courtesy towards friend and stranger, a sense of decency, of respect for the bedside\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise who, after the death of my aunt, felt obliged to speak only in a plaintive tone, would, in the months that preceded her daughter\u2019s marriage, have been quite shocked if, when the young couple walked out together, the girl had not taken her lover\u2019s arm. Albertine lying motionless beside me said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat nice hair you have; what nice eyes; you are a dear boy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, after pointing out to her that it was getting late, I added: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d she replied, what was perhaps true but could be so only since the minute before and for the next few hours:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI always believe you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She spoke to me of myself, my family, my social position. She said: \u201cOh, I know your parents know some very nice people. You are a friend of Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage.\u201d For the moment these names conveyed absolutely nothing to me. But suddenly I remembered that I had indeed played as a child in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es with Robert Forestier, whom I had never seen since then. As for Suzanne Delage, she was the great-niece of Mme. Blatin, and I had once been going to a dancing lesson, and had even promised to take a small part in a play that was being acted in her mother\u2019s drawing-room. But the fear of being sent into fits of laughter, and of a bleeding nose, had made me decline, so that I had never set eyes on her. I had at the most a vague idea that I had once heard that the Swanns\u2019 governess with the feather in her hat had at one time been with the Delages, but perhaps it was only a sister of this governess, or a friend. I protested to Albertine that Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage occupied a very small place in my life. \u201cThat may be; but your mothers are friends, I can place you by that. I often pass Suzanne Delage in the Avenue de Messine, I admire her style.\u201d Our mothers were acquainted only in the imagination of Mme. Bontemps, who having heard that I had at one time played with Robert Forestier, to whom, it appeared, I used to recite poetry, had concluded from that that we were bound by family ties. She could never, I gathered, hear my mother\u2019s name mentioned without observing: \u201cOh, yes, she is in the Delage Forestier set,\u201d giving my parents a good mark which they had done nothing to deserve\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from this, Albertine\u2019s social ideas were fatuous in the extreme. She regarded the Simonnets with a double \u2018n\u2019 as inferior not only to the Simonets with a single \u2018n\u2019 but to everyone in the world. That some one else should bear the same name as yourself without belonging to your family is an excellent reason for despising him. Of course there are exceptions. It may happen that two Simonnets (introduced to one another at one of those gatherings where one feels the need to converse, no matter on what subject, and where moreover one is instinctively well disposed towards strangers, for instance in a funeral procession on its way to the cemetery), finding that they have the same name, will seek with a mutual friendliness though without success to discover a possible connexion. But that is only an exception. Plenty of people are of dubious character, but we either know nothing or care nothing about them. If, however, a similarity of names brings to our door letters addressed to them, or vice versa, we at once feel a mistrust, often justified, as to their moral worth. We are afraid of being confused with them, we forestall the mistake by a grimace of disgust when anyone refers to them in our hearing. When we read our own name, as borne by them, in the newspaper, they seem to have usurped it. The transgressions of other members of the social organism leave us cold. We lay the burden of them more heavily upon our namesakes. The hatred which we bear towards the other Simonnets is all the stronger in that it is not a personal feeling but has been transmitted by heredity. After the second generation we remember only the expression of disgust with which our grandparents used to refer to the other Simonnets, we know nothing of the reason, we should not be surprised to learn that it had begun with a murder. Until, as is not uncommon, the time comes when a male and female Simonnet, who are not related in any way, are joined together in matrimony and so repair the breach\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only did Albertine speak to me of Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage, but spontaneously, with that impulse to confide which the approximation of two human bodies creates, that is to say at first, before it has engendered a special duplicity and reticence in one person towards the other, she told me a story about her own family and one of Andr\u00e9e\u2019s uncles, as to which, at Balbec, she had refused to utter a word; thinking that now she ought not to appear to have any secrets in which I might not share. From this moment, had her dearest friend said anything to her against me, she would have made it her duty to inform me. I insisted upon her going home, and finally she did go, but so ashamed on my account at my discourtesy that she laughed almost as though to apologise for me, as a hostess to whose party you have gone without dressing makes the best of you but is offended nevertheless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAre you laughing at me?\u201d I inquired\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not laughing, I am smiling at you,\u201d she replied lovingly. \u201cWhen am I going to see you again?\u201d she went on, as though declining to admit that what had just happened between us, since it is generally the crowning consummation, might not be at least the prelude to a great friendship, a friendship already existing which we should have to discover, to confess, and which alone could account for the surrender we had made of ourselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSince you give me leave, I shall send for you when I can.\u201d I dared not let her know that I was subordinating everything else to the chance of seeing Mme. de Stermaria. \u201cIt will have to be at short notice, unfortunately,\u201d I went on, \u201cI never know beforehand. Would it be possible for me to send round for you in the evenings, when I am free?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt will be quite possible in a little while, I am going to have a latch-key of my own. But just at present it can\u2019t be done. Anyhow I shall come round to-morrow or next day in the afternoon. You needn\u2019t see me if you\u2019re busy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On reaching the door, surprised that I had not anticipated her, she offered me her cheek, feeling that there was no need now for any coarse physical desire to prompt us to kiss one another. The brief relations in which we had just indulged being of the sort to which an absolute intimacy and a heartfelt choice often tend, Albertine had felt it incumbent upon her to improvise and add provisionally to the kisses which we had exchanged on my bed the sentiment of which those kisses would have been the symbol for a knight and his lady such as they might have been conceived in the mind of a gothic minstrel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When she had left me, this young Picard, who might have been carved on his porch by the image-maker of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, Fran\u00e7oise brought me a letter which filled me with joy, for it was from Mme. de Stermaria, who accepted my invitation to dinner. From Mme. de Stermaria, that was to say for me not so much from the real Mme. de Stermaria as from her of whom I had been thinking all day before Albertine\u2019s arrival. It is the terrible deception of love that it begins by engaging us in play not with a woman of the external world but with a puppet fashioned and kept in our brain, the only form of her moreover that we have always at our disposal, the only one that we shall ever possess, one which the arbitrary power of memory, almost as absolute as that of imagination, may have made as different from the real woman as had been from the real Balbec the Balbec of my dreams; an artificial creation to which by degrees, and to our own hurt, we shall force the real woman into resemblance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine had made me so late that the play had just finished when I entered Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room; and having little desire to be caught in the stream of guests who were pouring out, discussing the great piece of news, the separation, said to be already effected, of the Duc de Guermantes from his wife, I had, until I should have an opportunity of shaking hands with my hostess, taken my seat on an empty sofa in the outer room, when from the other, in which she had no doubt had her chair in the very front row of all, I saw emerging, majestic, ample and tall in a flowing gown of yellow satin upon which stood out in relief huge black poppies, the Duchess herself. The sight of her no longer disturbed me in the least. There had been a day when, laying her hands on my forehead (as was her habit when she was afraid of hurting my feelings) and saying: \u201cYou really must stop hanging about trying to meet Mme. de Guermantes. All the neighbours are talking about you. Besides, look how ill your grandmother is, you really have something more serious to think about than waylaying a woman who only laughs at you,\u201d in a moment, like a hypnotist who brings one back from the distant country in which one imagined oneself to be, and opens one\u2019s eyes for one, or like the doctor who, by recalling one to a sense of duty and reality, cures one of an imaginary disease in which one has been indulging one\u2019s fancy, my mother had awakened me from an unduly protracted dream. The rest of the day had been consecrated to a last farewell to this malady which I was renouncing; I had sung, for hours on end and weeping as I sang, the sad words of Schubert\u2019s Adieu:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farewell, strange voices call thee\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Away from me, dear sister of the angels\n\nAnd then it had finished. I had given up my morning walks, and with so little difficulty that I thought myself justified in the prophecy (which we shall see was to prove false later on) that I should easily grow accustomed in the course of my life to ceasing to see a woman. And when, shortly afterwards, Fran\u00e7oise had reported to me that Jupien, anxious to enlarge his business, was looking for a shop in the neighbourhood, wishing to find one for him (quite happy, moreover, when strolling along a street which already from my bed I had heard luminously vociferous like a peopled beach, to see behind the raised iron shutters of the dairies the young milk-girls with their white sleeves), I had been able to begin these excursions again. Nor did I feel the slightest constraint; for I was conscious that I was no longer going out with the object of seeing Mme. de Guermantes; much as a married woman who takes endless precautions so long as she has a lover, from the day on which she has broken with him leaves his letters lying about, at the risk of disclosing to her husband an infidelity which ceased to alarm her the moment she ceased to be guilty of it. What troubled me now was the discovery that almost every house sheltered some unhappy person. In one the wife was always in tears because her husband was unfaithful to her. In the next it was the other way about. In another a hardworking mother, beaten black and blue by a drunkard son, was endeavouring to conceal her sufferings from the eyes of the neighbours. Quite half of the human race was in tears. And when I came to know the people who composed it I saw that they were so exasperating that I asked myself whether it might not be the adulterous husband and wife (who were so simply because their lawful happiness had been withheld from them, and shewed themselves charming and faithful to everyone but their respective wife and husband) who were in the right. Presently I ceased to have even the excuse of being useful to Jupien for continuing my morning wanderings. For we learned that the cabinet-maker in our courtyard, whose workrooms were separated from Jupien\u2019s shop only by the flimsiest of partitions, was shortly to be \u2018given notice\u2019 by the Duke\u2019s agent because his hammering made too much noise. Jupien could have hoped for nothing better; the workrooms had a basement for storing timber, which communicated with our cellars. He could keep his coal in this, he could knock down the partition, and would then have a huge shop all in one room. But even without the amusement of house-hunting on his behalf I had continued to go out every day before luncheon, just as Jupien himself, finding the rent that M. de Guermantes was asking him exorbitant, was allowing the premises to be inspected in the hope that,discouraged by his failure to find a tenant, the Duke would resign himself to accepting a lower offer. Fran\u00e7oise, noticing that, even at an hour when no prospective tenant was likely to call, the porter left the door of the empty shop on the latch, scented a trap laid by him to entice the young woman who was engaged to the Guer \u2014 mantes footman (they would find a lovers\u2019 retreat there) and to catch them red-handed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However that might be, and for all that I had no longer to find Jupien a new shop, I still went out before luncheon. Often, on these excursions, I met M. de Norpois. It would happen that, conversing as he walked with a colleague, he cast at me a glance which after making a thorough scrutiny of my person returned to his companion without his having smiled at me or given me any more sign of recognition than if he had never set eyes on me before. For, with these eminent diplomats, looking at you in a certain way is intended to let you know not that they have seen you but that they have not seen you and that they have some serious question to discuss with the colleague who is accompanying them. A tall woman whom I frequently encountered near the house was less discreet with me. For in spite of the fact that I did not know her, she would turn round to look at me, would wait for me, unavailingly, before shop windows, smile at me as though she were going to kiss me, make gestures indicative of a complete surrender. She resumed an icy coldness towards me if anyone appeared whom she knew. For a long time now in these morning walks, thinking only of what I had to do, were it but the most trivial purchase of a newspaper, I had chosen the shortest way, with no regret were it outside the ordinary course which the Duchess followed in her walks, and if on the other hand it lay along that course, without either compunction or concealment, because it no longer appeared to me the forbidden way on which I should snatch from an ungrateful woman the favour of setting eyes on her against her will. But it had never occurred to me that my recovery, when it restored me to a normal attitude towards Mme. de Guermantes, would have a corresponding effect on her, and so render possible a friendliness, even a friendship in which I no longer felt any interest. Until then, the efforts of the entire world banded together to bring me into touch with her would have been powerless to counteract the evil spell that is cast by an ill-starred love. Fairies more powerful than mankind have decreed that in such cases nothing can avail us until the day on which we have uttered sincerely and from our hearts the formula: \u201cI am no longer in love.\u201d I had been vexed with Saint-Loup for not having taken me to see his aunt. But he was no more capable than anyone else of breaking an enchantment. So long as I was in love with Mme. de Guermantes, the marks of politeness that \u00ef received from others, their compliments actually distressed me, not only because they did not come from her but because she would never hear of them. And yet even if she had known of them it would not have been of the slightest use to me. Indeed, among the lesser auxiliaries to success in iove, an absence, the declining of an invitation to dinner, an unintentional, unconscious harshness are of more service than all the cosmetics and fine clothes in the world. There would be plenty of social success, were people taught upon these lines the art of succeeding\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she swept through the room in which I was sitting, her mind filled with thoughts of friends whom I did not know and whom she would perhaps be meeting presently at some other party, Mme. de Guermantes caught sight of me on my sofa, genuinely indifferent and seeking only to be polite whereas while I was in love I had tried so desperately, without ever succeeding, to assume an air of indifference; she swerved aside, came towards me and, reproducing the smile she had worn that evening at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, which the unpleasant feeling of being cared for by some one for whom she did not care was no longer there to obliterate: \u201cNo, don\u2019t move; you don\u2019t mind if I sit down beside you for a moment?\u201d she asked, gracefully gathering in her immense skirt which otherwise would have covered the entire sofa\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of less stature than she, who was further expanded by the volume of her gown, I was almost brushed by her exquisite bare arm round which a faint, innumerable down rose in perpetual smoke like a golden mist, and by the fringe of her fair tresses which wafted their fragrance over me. Having barely room to sit down, she could not turn easily to face me, and so obliged to look straight before her rather than in my direction, assumed the sort of dreamy, sweet expression one sees in a portrait\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you any news of Robert?\u201d she inquired\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment Mme. de Villeparisis entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Sir, you arrive at a fine time, when we do see you here for once in a way!\u201d And noticing that I was talking to her niece, concluding, perhaps, that we were more intimate than she had supposed: \u201cBut don\u2019t let me interrupt your conversation with Oriane,\u201d she went on, and (for these good offices as pander are part of the duties of the perfect hostess): \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t care to dine with her here on Thursday?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was the day on which I was to entertain Mme. de Stermaria, so I declined\n\u201cSaturday, then?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As my mother was returning on Saturday or Sunday, it would never do for me not to stay at home every evening to dine with her; I therefore declined this invitation also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, you\u2019re not an easy person to get hold of.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy do you never come to see me?\u201d inquired Mme. de Guermantes when Mme. de Villeparisis had left us to go and congratulate the performers and present the leading lady with a bunch of roses upon which the hand that offered it conferred all its value, for it had cost no more than twenty francs. (This, incidentally, was as high as she ever went when an artist had performed only once. Those who gave their services at all her afternoons and evenings throughout the season received roses painted by the Marquise.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s such a bore that we never see each other except in other people\u2019s houses. Since you won\u2019t meet me at dinner at my aunt\u2019s, why not come and dine with me?\u201d Various people who had stayed to the last possible moment, upon one pretext or another, but were at length preparing to leave, seeing that the Duchess had sat down to talk to a young man on a seat so narrow as just to contain them both, thought that they must have been misinformed, that it was the Duchess, and not the Duke, who was seeking a separation, and on my account. Whereupon they hastened to spread abroad this intelligence. I had better grounds than anyone to be aware of its falsehood. But I was myself surprised that at one of those difficult periods in which a separation that is not yet completed is beginning to take effect, the Duchess, instead of withdrawing from society should go out of her way to invite a \u2014 person whom she knew so slightly. The suspicion crossed my mind that it had been the Duke alone who had been opposed to her having me in the house, and that now that he was leaving her she saw no further obstacle to her surrounding herself with the people that she liked\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A minute earlier I should have been stupefied had anyone told me that Mme. de Guermantes was going to ask me to call on her, let alone to dine with her. I might be perfectly aware that the Guermantes drawing-room could not furnish those particular refinements which I had extracted from the name of its occupants, the fact that it had been forbidden ground to me, by obliging me to give it the same kind of existence that we give to the drawing-rooms of which we have read the description in a novel, or seen the image in a dream, made me, even when I was certain that it was just like any other, imagine it as quite different. Between myself and it was the barrier at which reality ends. To dine with the Guermantes was like travelling to a place I had long wished to see, making a desire emerge from my brain and take shape before my eyes, forming acquaintance with a dream. At the most, I might have supposed that it would be one of those dinners to which one\u2019s hosts invite one with: \u201cDo come; there\u2019ll beabsolutely nobody but ourselves,\u201d pretending to attribute to the pariah the alarm which they themselves feel at the thought of his mixing with their other friends, seeking indeed to convert into an enviable privilege, reserved for their intimates alone, the quarantine of the outsider, hopelessly uncouth, whom they are befriending. I felt on the contrary that Mme. de Guermantes was anxious for me to enjoy the most delightful society that she had to offer me when she went on, projecting as she spoke before my eyes as it were the violet-hued loveliness of a visit to Fabrice\u2019s aunt with the miracle of an introduction to Count Mosca:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOn Friday, now, couldn\u2019t you? There are just a few people coming; the Princesse de Parme, who is charming, not that I\u2019d ask you to meet anyone who wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discarded in the intermediate social grades which are engaged in a perpetual upward movement, the family still plays an important part in certain stationary grades, such as the lower middle class and the semi-royal aristocracy, which latter cannot seek to raise itself since above it, from its own special point of view, there exists nothing higher. The friendship shewn me by her \u2018aunt Villeparisis\u2019 and Robert had perhaps made me, for Mme. de Guermantes and her friends, living always upon themselves and in the same little circle, the object of a curious interest of which I had no suspicion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had of those two relatives a familiar, everyday, homely knowledge, of a sort, utterly different from what we imagine, in which if we happen to be comprised in it, so far from our actions being at once ejected, like the grain of dust from the eye or the drop of water from the windpipe, they are capable of remaining engraved, and will still be related and discussed years after we ourselves have forgotten them, in the palace in which we are astonished to find them preserved, like a letter in our own handwriting among a priceless collection of autographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People who are merely fashionable may set a guard upon doors which are too freely invalided. But the Guermantes door was not that. Hardly ever did a stranger have occasion to pass by it. If, for once in a way, the Duchess had one pointed out to her, she never dreamed of troubling herself about the social increment that he would bring, since this was a thing that she conferred and could not receive. She thought only of his real merits. Both Mme. de Villeparisis and Saint-Loup had testified to mine Doubtless she might not have believed them if she had not at the same time observed that they could never manage to secure me when they wanted me, and therefore that I attached no importance to worldly things, which seemed to the Duchess a sign that the stranger was to be numbered among what she called \u2018nice people.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was worth seeing, when one spoke to her of women for whom she did not care, how her face changed as soon as one named, in connexion with one of these, let us say, her sister-in-law. \u201cOh, she is charming!\u201d the Duchess would exclaim in a judicious, confident tone. The only reason that she gave was that this lady had declined to be introduced to the Marquise de Chaussegros and the Princesse de Silistrie. She did not add that the lady had declined also an introduction to herself, the Duchesse de Guermantes. This had, nevertheless, been the case, and ever since the mind of the Duchess had been at work trying to unravel the motives of a woman who was so hard to know, she was dying to be invited to call on her. People in society are so accustomed to be sought after that the person who shuns them seems to them a phoenix and at once monopolises their attention. Was the true motive in the mind of Mme. de Guermantes for thus inviting me (now that I was no longer in love with her) that I did not run after her relatives, although apparently run after myself by them? I cannot say. In any case, having made up her mind to invite me, she was anxious to do me the honours of the best company at her disposal and to keep away those of her friends whose presence might have dissuaded me from coming again, those whom she knew to be boring. I had not known to what to attribute her change of direction, when I had seen her deviate from her stellar path, come to sit down beside me and had heard her invite me to dinner, the effect of causes unknown for want of a special sense to enlighten us in this respect. We picture to ourselves the people who know us but slightly \u2014 such as, in my case, the Duchesse de Guermantes \u2014 as thinking of us only at the rare moments at which they set eyes on us. As a matter of fact this ideal oblivion in which we picture them as holding us is a purely arbitrary conception on our part. So that while, in our solitary silence, like that of a cloudless night, we imagine the various queens of society pursuing their course in the heavens at an infinite distance, we cannot help an involuntary start of dismay or pleasure if there falls upon us from that starry height, like a meteorite engraved with our name which we supposed to be unknown on Venus or Cassiopeia, an invitation to dinner or a piece of malicious gossip\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps now and then when, following the example of the Persian princes who, according to the Book of Esther, made their scribes read out to them the registers in which were enrolled the names of those of their subjects who had shewn zeal in their service, Mme. de Guermantes consulted her list of the well-disposed, she had said to herself, on coming to my name: \u201cA man we must ask to dine some day.\u201d But other thoughts had distracted her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Beset by surging cares, a Prince\u2019s mind\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Towards fresh matters ever is inclined)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0until the moment when she had caught sight of me sitting alone like Mordecai at the palace gate; and, the sight of me having refreshed her memory, sought, like Ahasuerus, to lavish her gifts upon me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I must at the same time add that a surprise of a totally different sort was to follow that which I had felt on hearing Mme. de Guermantes ask me to dine with her. Since I had decided that it would shew greater modesty, on my part, and gratitude also not to conceal this initial surprise, but rather to exaggerate my expression of the delight that it gave me, Mme. de Guermantes, who was getting ready to go on to another, final party, had said to me, almost as a justification and for fear of my not being quite certain who she was, since I appeared so astonished at being invited to dine with her: \u201cYou know I\u2019m the aunt of Robert de Saint-Loup, who is such a friend of yours; besides we have met before.\u201d In replying that I was aware of this I added that I knew also M. de Charlus, \u201cwho had been very good to me at Balbec and in Paris.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes appeared dumbfoundered, and her eyes seemed to turn, as though for a verification of this statement, to some page, already filled and turned, of her internal register of events. \u201cWhat, so you know Palam\u00e8de, do you?\u201d This name assumed on the lips of Mme. de Guermantes a great charm, due to the instinctive simplicity with which she spoke of a man who was socially so brilliant a figure, but for her was no more than her brother-in-law and the cousin with whom she had grown up. And on the confused greyness which the life of the Duchesse de Guermantes was for me this name, Palam\u00e8de, shed as it were the radiance of long summer days on which she had played with him as a girl, at Guermantes, in the garden. Moreover, in this long outgrown period in their lives, Oriane de Guermantes and her cousin Palam\u00e8de had been very different from what they had since become; M. de Charlus in particular, entirely absorbed in the artistic pursuits from which he had so effectively restrained himself in later life that I was stupefied to learn that it was he who had painted the huge fan with black and yellow irises which the Duchess was at this moment unfurling. She could also have shewn me a little sonatina which he had once composed for her. I was completely unaware that the Baron possessed all these talents, of which he never spoke. Let me remark in passing that M. de Charlus did not at all relish being called \u2018Palam\u00e8de\u2019 by his family. That the form \u2018M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 might not please him one could easily understand. These stupid abbreviations are a sign of the utter inability of the aristocracy to appreciate its own Poetic beauty (in Jewry, too, we may see the same defect, since a nephew of Lady Israels, whose name was Moses, was commonly known as \u2018Momo\u2019) concurrently with its anxiety not to appear to attach any importance to what is aristocratic. Now M. de Charlus had, in this connexion, a greater wealth of poetic imagination and a more blatant pride. But the reason for his distaste for \u2018M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 could not be this, since it extended also to the fine name Palam\u00e8de. The truth was that, considering, knowing himself to come of a princely stock, he would have liked his brother and sister-in-law to refer to him as \u2018Charlus,\u2019 just as Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans might have spoken of their sons and grandsons, brothers and nephews as \u2018Joinville, Nemours, Chartres, Paris.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a humbug M\u00e9m\u00e9 is!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWe talked to him about you for hours; he told us that he would be delighted to make your acquaintance, just as if he had never set eyes on you. You must admit he\u2019s odd, and \u2014 though it\u2019s not very nice of me to say such a thing about a brother-in-law I\u2019m devoted to, and really do admire immensely \u2014 a trifle mad at times.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was struck by the application of this last epithet to M. de Charlus, and said to myself that this half-madness might perhaps account for certain things, such as his having appeared so delighted by his own proposal that I should ask Bloch to castigate his mother. I decided that, by reason not only of the things he said but of the way in which he said them, M. de Charlus must be a little mad. The first time that one listens to a barrister or an actor, one is surprised by his tone, so different from the conversational. But, observing that everyone else seems to find this quite natural, one says nothing about it to other people, one says nothing in fact to oneself, one is content with appreciating the degree of talent shewn. At the most, one may think, of an actor at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais: \u201cWhy, instead of letting his raised arm fall naturally, did he make it drop in a series of little jerks broken by pauses for at least ten minutes?\u201d or of a Labori: \u201cWhy, whenever he opened his mouth, did he utter those tragic, unexpected sounds to express the simplest things?\u201d But as everybody admits these actions to be necessary and obvious one is not shocked by them. So, upon thinking it over, one said to oneself that M. de Charlus spoke of himself with undue emphasis in a tone which was not in the least that of ordinary speech. It seemed as though one might have at any moment interrupted him with: \u201cBut why do you shout so? Why are you so offensive?\u201d only everyone seemed to have tacitly agreed that it was all right. And one took one\u2019s place in the circle which applauded his outbursts. But certainly, at certain moments, a stranger might have thought that he was listening to the ravings of a maniac\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut are you sure you\u2019re not thinking of some one else? Do you really mean my brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de?\u201d went on the Duchess, a trace of impertinence grafted upon her natural simplicity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I replied that I was absolutely sure, and that M. de Charlus must have failed to catch my name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh well! I shall leave you now,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, as though she regretted the parting. \u201cI must look in for a moment at the Princesse de Ligne\u2019s. You aren\u2019t going on there? No? You don\u2019t care for parties? You\u2019re very wise, they are too boring for words. If only I hadn\u2019t got to go. But she\u2019s my cousin; it wouldn\u2019t be polite. I am sorry, selfishly, for my own sake, because I could have taken you there, and brought you back afterwards, too. So I shall say good-bye now, and look forward to Friday.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That M. de Charlus should have blushed to be seen with me by M. d\u2019Argencourt was all very well. But that to his own sister-in-law, who had so high an opinion of him besides, he should deny all knowledge of me, knowledge which was perfectly natural seeing that I was a friend of both his aunt and his nephew, was a thing that I could not understand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I shall end my account of this incident with the remark that from one point of view there was in Mme. de Guermantes a true greatness which consisted in her entirely obliterating from her memory what other people would have only partially forgotten. Had she never seen me waylaying her, following her, tracking her down as she took her morning walks, had she never responded to my daily salute with an angry impatience, had she never refused Saint-Loup when he begged her to invite me to her house, she could not have greeted me now in a nobler or more gracious manner. Not only did she waste no time in retrospective explanations, in hints, allusions or ambiguous smiles, not only was there in her present affability, without any harking back to the past, without any reticence, something as proudly rectilinear as her majestic stature, but the resentment which she might have felt against anyone in the past was so entirely reduced to ashes, the ashes were themselves cast so utterly from her memory, or at least from her manner, that on studying her face whenever she had occasion to treat with the most exquisite simplification what in so many other people would have been a pretext for reviving stale antipathies and recriminations one had the impression of an intense purity of mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if I was surprised by the modification that had occurred in her opinion of me, how much more did it surprise me to find a similar but ever so much greater change in my feeling for her. Had there not been a time during which I could regain life and strength only if \u2014 always building new castles in the air! \u2014 I had found some one who would obtain for me an invitation to her house and, after this initial boon, would procure many others for my increasingly exacting heart? It was the impossibility of finding any avenue there that had made me leave Paris for Donci\u00e8res to visit Robert de Saint-Loup. And now it was indeed by the consequence of a letter from him that I was agitated, but on account this time of Mme. de Stermaria, not of Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let me add further, to conclude my account of this party, that there Occurred at it an incident, contradicted a few days later, which continued to puzzle me, interrupted for some time my friendship with Bloch, and constitutes in itself one of those curious paradoxes the explanation of which will be found in the next part of this work. At this party at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, Bloch kept on boasting to me about the friendly attentions shewn him by M. de Charlus, who, when he passed him in the street, looked him straight in the face as though he recognised him, was anxious to know him personally, knew quite well who he was. I smiled at first, Bloch having expressed so vehemently at Balbec his contempt for the said M. de Charlus. And I supposed merely that Bloch, like his father in the Case of Bergotte, knew the Baron \u2018without actually knowing him,\u2019 and that what he took for a friendly glance was due to absent-mindedness. But finally Bloch became so precise and appeared so confident that on two or three occasions M. de Charlus had wished to address him that, remembering that I had spoken of my friend to the Baron, who had, as we walked away together from this very house, as it happened, asked me various questions about him, I came to the conclusion that Bloch was not lying that M. de Charlus had heard his name, realised that he was my friend\u2019 and so forth. And so, a little later, at the theatre one evening, I asked M! de Charlus if I might introduce Bloch to him, and, on his assenting, went in search of my friend. But as soon as M. de Charlus caught sight of him an expression of astonishment, instantly repressed, appeared on his face where it gave way to a blazing fury. Not only did he not offer Bloch his hand but whenever Bloch spoke to him he replied in the most insolent manner, in an angry and wounding tone. So that Bloch, who, according to his version, had received nothing until then from the Baron but smiles, assumed that I had not indeed commended but disparaged him in the short speech in which, knowing M. de Charlus\u2019s liking for formal procedure, I had told him about my friend before bringing him up to be introduced. Bloch left us, his spirit broken, like a man who has been trying to mount a horse which is always ready to take the bit in its teeth, or to swim against waves which continually dash him back on the shingle, and did not speak to me again for six months\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The days that preceded my dinner with Mme. de Stermaria were for me by no means delightful, in fact it was all I could do to live through them. For as a general rule, the shorter the interval is that separates us from our planned objective, the longer it seems to us, because we apply to it a more minute scale of measurement, or simply because it occurs to us to measure it at all. The Papacy, we are told, reckons by centuries, and indeed may not think perhaps of reckoning time at all, since its goal is in eternity. Mine was no more than three days off; I counted by seconds, I gave myself up to those imaginings which are the first movements of caresses, of caresses which it maddens us not to be able to make the woman herself reciprocate and complete \u2014 those identical caresses, to the exclusion of all others. And, as a matter of fact, it is true that, generally speaking, the difficulty of attaining to the object of a desire enhances that desire (the difficulty, not the impossibility, for that suppresses it altogether), yet in the case of a desire that is wholly physical the certainty that it will be realised, at a fixed and not distant point in time, is scarcely less exciting than uncertainty; almost as much as an anxious doubt, the absence of doubt makes intolerable the period of waiting for the pleasure that is bound to come, because it makes of that suspense an innumerably rehearsed accomplishment and by the frequency of our proleptic representations divides time into sections as minute as could be carved by agony. What I required was to possess Mme. de Stermaria, for during the last few days, with an incessant activity, my desires had been preparing this pleasure, in my imagination, and this pleasure alone, for any other kind (pleasure, that is, taken with another woman) would not have been ready, pleasure being but the realisation of a previous wish, and of one which is not always the same, but changes according to the endless combinations of one\u2019s fancies, the accidents of one\u2019s memory, the state of one\u2019s temperament, the variability of one\u2019s desires, the most recently granted of which lie dormant until the disappointment of their satisfaction has been to some extent forgotten; I should not have been prepared, I had already turned from the main road of general desires and had ventured along the bridle-path of a particular desire; I should have had \u2014 in order to wish for a different assignation \u2014 to retrace my steps too far before rejoining the main road and taking another path. To take possession of Mme. de Stermaria on the island in the Bois de Boulogne where I had asked her to dine with me, this was the pleasure that I imagined to myself afresh every moment. It would have automatically perished if I had dined on that island without Mme. de Stermaria; but perhaps as greatly diminished had I dined, even with her, somewhere else. Besides, the attitudes in which one pictures a pleasure to oneself exist previously to the woman, to the type of woman required to give one that pleasure. They dictate the pleasure, and the place as well, and on that account bring to the fore alternatively, in our capricious fancy, this or that woman, this or that scene, this or that room, which in other weeks we should have dismissed with contempt. Child of the attitude that produced her, one woman will not appeal to us without the large bed in which we find peace by her side, while others, to be caressed with a more secret intention, require leaves blown by the wind, water rippling in the night, are as frail and fleeting as they\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt in the past, long before I received Saint-Loup\u2019s letter and when there was as yet no question of Mme. de Stermaria, the island in the Bois had seemed to me to be specially designed for pleasure, because I had found myself going there to taste the bitterness of having no pleasure to enjoy in its shelter. It is to the shores of the lake from which one goes to that island, and along which, in the last weeks of summer, those ladies of Paris who have not yet left for the country take the air, that, not knowing where to look for her, or if indeed she has not already left Paris, one wanders in the hope of seeing the girl go by with whom one fell in love at the last ball of the season, whom one will not have a chance of meeting again in any drawing-room until the following spring. Feeling it to be at least the eve, if not the morrow, of the beloved\u2019s departure, one follows along the brink of the shivering water those attractive paths by which already a first red leaf is blooming like a last rose, one scans that horizon where, by a device the opposite of that employed in those panoramas beneath whose domed roofs the wax figures in the foreground impart to the painted canvas beyond them the illusory appearance of depth and mass, our eyes, passing without any transition from the cultivated park to the natural heights of Meudon and the Mont Val\u00e9rien, do not know where to set the boundary, and make the natural country trespass upon the handiwork of the gardener, of which they project far beyond its own limits the artificial charm; like those rare birds reared in the open in a botanical garden which every day in the liberty of their winged excursions sally forth to strike, among the surrounding woods, an exotic note. Between the last festivity of summer and one\u2019s winter exile, one ranges anxiously that romantic world of chance encounters and lover\u2019s melancholy, and one would be no more surprised to learn that it was situated outside the mapped universe than if, at Versailles, looking down from the terrace, an observatory round which the clouds are massed against a blue sky in the manner of Van der Meulen, after having thus risen above the bounds of nature, one were informed that, there where nature begins again at the end of the great canal, the villages which one just could not make out, on a horizon as dazzling as the sea, were called Fleurus or Nim\u00e8gue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, the last carriage having rolled by, when one feels with a throb of pain that she will not come now, one goes to dine on the island; above the shivering poplars which suggest endless mysteries of evening though without response, a pink cloud paints a last touch of life in the tranquil sky. A few drops of rain fall without noise on the water, ancient but still in its diyine infancy coloured always by the weather and continually forgetting the reflexions of clouds and flowers. And after the geraniums have vainly striven, by intensifying the brilliance of their scarlet, to resist the gathering darkness, a mist rises to envelop the now slumbering island; one walks in the moist dimness along the water\u2019s edge, where at the most the silent passage of a swan startles one like, in a bed, at night, the eyes, for a moment wide open, and the swift smile of a child whom one did not suppose to be awake. Then one would like to have with one a loving companion, all the more as one feels oneself to be alone and can imagine oneself to be far away from the world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to this island, where even in summer there was often a mist, how much more gladly would I have brought Mme. de Stermaria now that the cold season, the back end of autumn had come. If the weather that had prevailed since Sunday had not by itself rendered grey and maritime the scenes in which my imagination was living \u2014 as other seasons made them balmy, luminous, Italian \u2014 the hope of, in a few days\u2019 time, making Mme. de Stermaria mine would have been quite enough to raise, twenty times in an hour, a curtain of mist in my monotonously lovesick imagination. In any event the mist, which since yesterday had risen even in Paris, not only made me think incessantly of the native place of the young woman whom I had invited to dine with me, but, since it was probable that, far more thickly than in the streets of the town, it must after sunset be invading the Bois, especially the shores of the lake, I thought that it would make the Swans\u2019 Island, for me, something like that Breton island the marine and misty atmosphere of which had always enwrapped in my mind like a garment the pale outline of Mme. de Stermaria. Of course when we are young, at the age I had reached at the period of my walks along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, our desires, our faith bestow on a woman\u2019s clothing an individual personality, an ultimate quintessence. We pursue reality. But by dint of allowing it to escape we end by noticing that, after all those vain endeavours which have led to nothing, something solid subsists, which is what we have been seeking. We begin to separate, to recognise what we love, we try to procure it for ourselves, be it only by a stratagem. Then, in the absence of our vanished faith, costume fills the gap, by means of a deliberate illusion. I knew quite well that within half an hour of home I should not find myself in Brittany. But in walking arm in arm with Mme. de Stermaria in the dusk of the island, by the water\u2019s edge, I should be acting like other men who, unable to penetrate the walls of \u00e0 convent, do at least, before enjoying a woman, clothe her in the habit of a nun\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could even look forward to hearing, as I sat with the lady, the lapping of waves, for, on the day before our dinner, a storm broke over Paris. I was beginning to shave myself before going to the island to engage the room (albeit at this time of year the island was empty and the restaurant deserted) and order the food for our dinner next day when Fran\u00e7oise came in to tell me that Albertine had called. I made her come in at once, indifferent to her finding me disfigured by a bristling chin, her for whom at Balbec I had never felt smart enough and who had cost me then as much agitation and distress as Mme. de Stermaria was costing me now. The latter, I was determined, must go away with the best possible impression from our evening together. Accordingly I asked Albertine to come with me there and then to the island to order the food. She to whom one gives everything is so quickly replaced by another that one is surprised to find oneself giving all that one has, afresh, at every moment, without any hope of future reward. At my suggestion the smiling rosy face beneath Albertine\u2019s flat cap, which came down very low, to her eyebrows, seemed to hesitate. She had probably other plans; if so she sacrificed them willingly, to my great satisfaction, for I attached the utmost importance to my having with me a young housewife who would know a great deal more than myself about ordering dinner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is quite true that she had represented something utterly different for me at Balbec. But our intimacy, even when we do not consider it close enough at the time, with a woman with whom we are in love creates between her and us, in spite of the shortcomings that pain us while our love lasts, social ties which outlast our love and even the memory of our love. Then, in her who is nothing more for us than a means of approach, an avenue towards others, we are just as astonished and amused to learn from our memory what her name meant originally to that other creature which we then were as if, after giving a cabman an address in the Boulevard des Capucines or the Rue du Bac, thinking only of the person whom we are going to see there, we remind ourself that the names were once those of, respectively, the Capuchin nuns whose convent stood on the site and the ferry across the Seine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, my Balbec desires had so generously ripened Albertine\u2019s body, had gathered and stored in it savours so fresh and sweet that, as we drove through the Bois, while the wind like a careful gardener shook the trees, brought down the fruit, swept up the fallen leaves, I said to myself that had there been any risk of Saint-Loup\u2019s being mistaken, or of my having misunderstood his letter, so that my dinner with Mme. de Stermaria might lead to no satisfactory result, I should have made an appointment for the same evening, later on, with Albertine, so as to forget, for a purely voluptuous hour, as I held in my arms a body of which my curiosity had long since computed, weighed up all the possible charms in which now it abounded, the emotions and perhaps the regrets of this first phase of love for Mme. de Stermaria. And certainly if I could have supposed that Mme de Stermaria would not grant me any of her favours at our first meeting, I should have formed a slightly depressing picture of my evening with her. I knew too well from experience how the two stages which occur in us in the first phase of our love for a woman whom we have desired without knowing her, loving in her rather the particular kind of existence in which she is steeped than her still unfamiliar self \u2014 how distorted is the reflexion of those two stages in the world of facts, that is to say not in ourselves any longer but in our meetings with her. We have, without ever having talked to her, hesitated, tempted as we were by the poetic charm which she represented for us. Shall it be this woman or another? And lo, our dreams become fixed round about her, cease to have any separate existence from her. The first meeting with her which will shortly follow should reflect this dawning love. Nothing of the sort. As if it were necessary that our material life should have its first period also, in love with her already, we talk to her in the most trivial fashion: \u201cI asked you to dine on this island because I thought the surroundings would amuse you. I\u2019ve nothing particular to say to you, don\u2019t you know. But it\u2019s rather damp, I\u2019m afraid, and you may find it cold \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, no, not at all!\u201d \u201cYou just say that out of politeness. Very well, Madame, I shall allow you to battle against the cold for another quarter of an hour, as I don\u2019t want to bother you, but in fifteen minutes I shall carry you off by force. I don\u2019t want to have you catching a chill.\u201d And without another word said we take her home, remembering nothing about her, at the most a certain look in her eyes, but thinking only of seeing her again. Well, at our second meeting (when we do not find even that look, our sole memory of her, but nevertheless have been thinking only of seeing her again), the first stage is passed. Nothing has happened in the interval. And yet, instead of talking about the comfort or want of comfort of the restaurant, we say, without our words appearing to surprise the new person, who seems to us positively plain but to whom we should like to think that people were talking about us at every moment in her life: \u201cWe are going to have our work cut out to overcome all the obstacles in our way. Do you think we shall be successful? Do you suppose that we can triumph over our enemies \u2014 live happily ever afterwards, and all that sort of thing?\u201d But these conversational openings, trivial to begin with, then hinting at love, would not be required; I could trust Saint-Loup\u2019s letter for that. Mme. de Stermaria would yield herself to me from the first, I should have no need therefore to engage Albertine to come to me, as a makeshift, later in the evening. It would be superfluous; Robert never exaggerated, and his letter was explicit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine spoke hardly at all, conscious that my thoughts were elsewhere. We went a little way on foot into the greenish, almost submarine grotto of a dense mass of trees, on the domed tops of which we heard the wind sweep and the rain pelt. I trod underfoot dead leaves which, like shells, were trampled into the soil, and poked with my stick at fallen chestnuts prickly as sea-urchins\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the boughs the last clinging leaves, shaken by the wind, followed it only as far as their stems would allow, but sometimes these broke, and they fell to the ground, along which they coursed to overtake it. I thought with joy how much more remote still, if this weather lasted, the island would be on the morrow \u2014 and in any case quite deserted. We returned to our carriage and, as the storm had passed off, Albertine asked me to take her on to Saint-Cloud. As on the ground the drifting leaves so up above the clouds were chasing the wind. And a stream of migrant evenings, of which a sort of conic section cut through the sky made visible the successive layers, pink, blue and green, were gathered in readiness for departure to warmer climes. To obtain a closer view of a marble goddess who had been carved in the act of leaping from her pedestal and, alone in a great wood which seemed to be consecrated to her, filled it with the mythological terror, half animal, half divine, of her frenzied bounding, Albertine climbed a grassy slope while I waited for her in the road. She herself, seen thus from below, no longer coarse and plump as, a few days earlier, on my bed when the grain of her throat became apparent in the lens of my eye as it approached her person, but chiselled and delicate, seemed a little statue on which our happy hours together at Balbec had left their patina. When I found myself alone again at home, and remembered that I had taken a drive that afternoon with Albertine, that I was to dine in two days\u2019 time with Mme. de Guermantes and that I had to answer a letter from Gilberte, three women each of whom I had once loved, I said to myself that our social existence is, like an artist\u2019s studio, filled with abandoned sketches in which we have fancied for a moment that we could set down in permanent form our need of a great love, but it did not occur to me that sometimes, if the sketch be not too old, it may happen that we return to it and make of it a work wholly different, and possibly more important than what we had originally planned\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next day was cold and fine; winter was in the air \u2014 indeed the season was so far advanced that it had seemed miraculous that we should find in the already pillaged Bois a few domes of gilded green. When I awoke I saw, as from the window of the barracks at Donci\u00e8res, a uniform, dead white mist which hung gaily in the sunlight, consistent and sweet as a web of spun sugar. Then the sun withdrew, and the mist thickened still further in the afternoon. Night fell early, I made ready for dinner, but it was still too soon to start; I decided to send a carriage for Mme. de Stermaria. I did not like to go for her in it myself, not wishing to force my company on her, but I gave the driver a note for her in which I asked whether she would mind my coming to call for her. While I waited for her answer I lay down on my bed, shut my eyes for a moment, then opened them again. Over the top of the curtains there was nothing now but a thin strip of daylight which grew steadily fainter. I recognised that wasted hour, the large ante-room of pleasure, the dark, delicious emptiness of which I had learned at Balbec to know and to enjoy when, alone in my room as I was now, while all the rest were at dinner, I saw without regret the daylight fade from above my curtains, knowing that, presently, after a night of arctic brevity, it was to be resuscitated in a more dazzling brightness in the lighted rooms of Rivebelle. I sprang from my bed, tied my black necktie, passed a brush over my hair, final gestures of a belated tidying carried out at Balbec with my mind not on myself but on the women whom I should see at Rivebelle while I smiled at them in anticipation in the mirror that stood across a corner of my room, gestures which, on that account, had continued to herald a form of entertainment in which music and lights would be mingled. Like magic signs they summoned, nay rather presented this entertainment already; thanks to them I had, of its intoxicating frivolous charm as complete an enjoyment as I had had at Combray, in the month of July, when I heard the hammer-blows ring on the packing cases and enjoyed, in the coolness of my darkened room, a sense of warmth and sunshine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also, it was no longer exactly Mme. de Stermaria that I should have wished most to see. Forced now to spend my evening with her, I should have preferred, as it was almost the last before the return of my parents that it should remain free and myself try instead to find some of the women from Rivebelle. I gave my hands one more final wash and, my sense of pleasure keeping me on the move, dried them as I walked through the shuttered dining-room. It appeared to have a door open on to the lighted hall but what I had taken for the bright chink of the door, which as a matter of fact was closed, was only the gleaming reflexion of my towel in a mirror that had been laid against the wall in readiness to be fixed in its place before Mamma\u2019s return. I thought of all the other illusions of the sort which I had discovered in different parts of the house, and which were not optical only, for when we first came there I had supposed that our next-door neighbour kept a dog on account of the continuous, almost human yapping which came from a certain pipe in the kitchen whenever the tap was turned on. And the door on to the outer landing never closed by itself, very gently, caught by a draught on the staircase, without rendering those broken, voluptuous, whimpering passages which sound over the chant of the pilgrims towards the end of Overture to Tannh\u00e4user. I had, moreover, just as I had put my towel back on its rail, an opportunity of hearing a fresh rendering of this brilliant symphonic fragment, for at a peal of the bell I hurried out to open the door to the driver who had come with Mme. de Stermaria\u2019s answer. I thought that his message would be: \u201cThe lady is downstairs,\u201d or \u201cThe lady is waiting.\u201d But he had a letter in his hand. I hesitated for a moment before looking to see what Mme. de Stermaria had written, who, while she held the pen in her hand, might have been anything but was now, detached from herself, an engine of fate, pursuing a course alone, which she was utterly powerless to alter. I asked the driver to wait downstairs for a moment, although he was cursing the fog. As soon as he had gone I opened the envelope. On her card, inscribed Vicomtesse Alix de. Stermaria, my guest had written: \u201cAm so sorry \u2014 am unfortunately prevented from dining with you this evening on the island in the Bois. Had been so looking forward to it. Will write you a proper letter from Stermaria. Very sorry. Kindest regards.\u201d I stood motionless, stunned by the shock that I had received. At my feet lay the card and envelope, fallen like the spent cartridge from a gun when the shot has been fired. I picked them up, tried to analyse her message. \u201cShe says that she cannot dine with me on the island in the Bois. One might gather from that that she would dine with me somewhere else. I shall not be so indiscreet as to go and fetch her, but, after all, that is quite a reasonable interpretation.\u201d And from that island in the Bois, as for the last few days my thoughts had been installed there beforehand with Mme. de Sterm\u00e2ria, I could not succeed in bringing them back to where I was. My desire responded automatically to the gravitational force which had been pulling it now for so many hours on end, and in spite of this message, too recent to counteract that force, I went on instinctively getting ready to start, just as a student, although ploughed by the examiners, tries to answer one question more. At last I decided to tell Fran\u00e7oise to go down and pay the driver. I went along the passage without finding her, I passed through the dining-room, where suddenly my feet ceased to sound on the bare boards as they had been doing and were hushed to a silence which, even before I had realised the explanation of it, gave me a feeling of suffocation and confinement. It was the carpets which, in view of my parents\u2019 return, the servants had begun to put down again, those carpets which look so well on bright mornings when amid their disorder the sun stays and waits for you like a friend come to take you out to luncheon in the country, and casts over them the dappled light and shade of the forest, but which now on the contrary were the first installation of the wintry prison from which, obliged as I should be to live, to take my meals at home, I should no longer be free now to escape when I chose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTake care you don\u2019t slip, Sir; they\u2019re not tacked yet,\u201d Fran\u00e7oise called to me. \u201cI ought to have lighted up. Oh, dear, it\u2019s the end of \u2018Sectember\u2019 already, the fine days are over.\u201d In no time, winter; at the corner of a window, as in a Galle glass, a vein of crusted snow; and even in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, instead of the girls one waits to see, nothing but solitary sparrows\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What added to my distress at not seeing Mme. de Sterm\u00e2ria was that her answer led me to suppose that whereas, hour by hour, since Sunday, I had been living for this dinner alone, she had presumably never given it a second thought. Later on I learned of an absurd love match that she had suddenly made with a young man whom she must already have been seeing at this time, and who had presumably made her forget my invitation. For if she had remembered it she would surely never have waited for the carriage which I was not, for that matter, supposed to be sending for her, to inform me that she was otherwise engaged. My dreams of a young feudal maiden on a misty island had cleared the way to a still non-existent love. Now my disappointment, my rage, my desperate desire to recapture her who had just refused me were able, by bringing my sensibility into play, to make definite the possible love which until then my imagination alone had \u2014 and that more loosely \u2014 offered me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How many are there in our memories, how many more have we forgotten, of these faces of girls and young women, all different, to which we have added a certain charm and a frenzied desire to see them again only because at the last moment they eluded us? In the case of Mme. de Stermaria there was a good deal more than this, and it was enough now to make me love her for me to see her again so that I might refresh those impressions, so vivid but all too brief, which my memory would not, without such refreshment, have the strength to keep alive when we were apart. Circumstances decided against me; I did not see her again. It was not she that I loved, but it might well have been. And one of the things that made most cruel, perhaps, the great love which was presently to come to me was that when I thought of this evening I used to say to myself that my love might, given a slight modification of very ordinary circumstances, have been directed elsewhere, to Mme. de Stermaria; its application to her who inspired it in me so soon afterwards was not therefore \u2014 as I so longed so needed to believe \u2014 absolutely necessary and predestined\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise had left me by myself in the dining-room with the remark that it was foolish of me to stay there before she had lighted the fire. She went to get me some dinner, for even before the return of my parents, from this very evening, my seclusion was to begin. I caught sight of a huge bundle of carpets, still rolled up, and leaning against one end of the sideboard, and burying my head in it, swallowing its dust with my own tears, as the Jews used to cover their heads with ashes in times of mourning, I began to sob. I shuddered not only because the room was cold, but because a distinct lowering of temperature (against the danger and \u2014 I should add, perhaps \u2014 the by no means disagreeable sensation of which we make no attempt to react) is brought about by a certain kind of tears which fall from our eyes, drop by drop, like a fine, penetrating, icy rain, and seem as though never would they cease to flow. Suddenly I heard a voice:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMay I come in? Fran\u00e7oise told me you would be in the dining-room. I looked in to see whether you would care to come out and dine somewhere, if it isn\u2019t bad for your throat \u2014 there\u2019s a fog outside you could cut with a knife.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was \u2014 arrived in Paris that morning, when I imagined him to be still in Morocco or on the sea \u2014 Robert de Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have already said (as a matter of fact, it was Robert himself who, at Balbec, had helped me, quite without meaning it, to arrive at this conclusion) what I think about friendship: to wit that it is so small a thing that I find it hard to understand how men with some claim to genius \u2014 Nietzsche, for instance \u2014 can have been such simpletons as to ascribe to it a certain intellectual value, and consequently to deny themselves friendships in which intellectual esteem would have no part. Yes, it has always been a surprise to me to find a man who carried sincerity towards himself to so high a pitch as to cut himself off, by a scruple of conscience, from Wagner\u2019s music, imagining that the truth could ever be attained by the mode of expression, naturally vague and inadequate, which our actions in general and acts of friendship in particular furnish, or that there could be any kind of significance in the fact of one\u2019s leaving one\u2019s work to go and see a friend and shed tears with him on hearing the false report that the Louvre was burned. I had got so far, at Balbec, as to find that the pleasure of playing with a troop of girls is less destructive of the spiritual life, to which at least it remains alien, than friendship, the whole effort of which is directed towards making us sacrifice the one real and (save by the channel of art) incommunicable part of ourself to a superficial self which finds \u2014 not, like the other, any joy in itself, but rather a vague, sentimental attraction in the feeling that it is being supported by external props, hospitably entertained by a strange personality, through which, happy in the protection that is afforded it there, it makes its own comfort radiate in warm approval, and marvels at qualities which it would denounce as faults and seek to correct in itself. Moreover the scorners of friendship can, without illusion and not without remorse, be the finest friends in the world, just as an artist carrying in his brain a masterpiece and feeling that his duty is rather to live and carry on his work, nevertheless, so as not to be thought or to run the risk of actually being selfish, gives his life for a vain cause, and gives it all the more gallantly in that the reasons for which he would have preferred not to give it were disinterested. But whatever might be my opinion of friendship, to mention only the pleasure that it procured me, of a quality so mediocre as to be like something halfway between physical exhaustion and mental boredom, there is no brew so deadly that it cannot at certain moments, become precious and invigorating by giving us just the stimulus that was necessary, the warmth that we cannot generate in ourselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The thought of course never entered my mind now of asking Saint-Loup to take me (as, an hour earlier, I had been longing to go) to see some of the Rivebelle women; the scar left by my disappointment with Mme. de Stermaria was too recent still to be so easily healed, but at the moment when I had ceased to feel in my heart any reason for happiness Saint-Loup\u2019s bursting in upon me was like a sudden apparition of kindness, mirth, life, which were external to me, no doubt, but offered themselves to me, asked only to be made mine. He did not himself understand my shout of gratitude, my tears of affection. And yet is there anything more unaccountably affecting than one of those friends, be he diplomat, explorer, airman or soldier like Saint-Loup, who, having to start next day for the country, from where they will go on heaven knows where, seem to form for themselves, in the evening which they devote to us, an impression which we are astonished both to find, so rare and fleeting is it, can be so pleasant to them, and, since it does so delight them, not to see them prolong farther or repeat more often. A meal with us, an event so natural in itself, affords these travellers the same strange and exquisite pleasure as our boulevards give to an Asiatic. We set off together to dine, and as I went downstairs I thought of Donci\u00e8res where every evening I used to meet Robert at his restaurant, and the little dining-rooms there that I had forgotten. I remembered one of these to which I had never given a thought, and which was not in the hotel where Saint-Loup dined but in another, far humbler, a cross between an inn and a boarding-house, where the waiting was done by the landlady and one of her servants. I had been forced to take shelter there once from a snowstorm. Besides, Robert was not to be dining at the hotel that evening and I had not cared to go any farther. My food was brought to me, upstairs, in a little room with bare wooden walls. The lamp went out during dinner and the servant lighted a couple of candles. I, pretending that I could not see very well as I held out my plate, while she helped me to potatoes, took her bare fore-arm in my hand, as though to guide her. Seeing that she did not withdraw it, I began to fondle it, then, without saying a word, pulled her bodily to me, blew out the candles and told her to feel in my pocket for some money. For the next few days physical pleasure seemed to me to require, to be properly enjoyed, not only this servant but the timbered dining-room, so remote and lonely. And yet it was to the other, in which Saint-Loup and his friends dined, that I returned every evening, from force of habit and in friendship for them, until I left Donci\u00e8res. But even of this hotel, where he took his meals with his friends, I had long ceased to think; we make little use of our experience, we leave unconsumed in the summer dusk or precocious nights of winter the hours in which it had seemed to us that there might nevertheless be contained some element of tranquillity or pleasure. But those hours are not altogether wasted. When, in their turn, come and sing to us fresh moments of pleasure, which by themselves would pass by equally bare in outline, the others recur, bringing with them the groundwork, the solid consistency of a rich orchestration. They are in this way prolonged into one of those types of happiness which we recapture only now and again but which continue to exist; in the present instance the type was that of forsaking everything else to dine in comfortable surroundings, which by the help of memory embody in a scene from nature suggestions of the rewards of travel, with a friend who is going to stir our dormant life with all his energy, his affection, to communicate to us an emotional pleasure, very different from anything that we could derive from our own efforts or from social distractions; we are going to exist solely for him, to utter vows of friendship which, born within the confines of the hour, remaining imprisoned in it, will perhaps not be kept on the morrow but which I need have no scruple in taking before Saint-Loup since, with a courage into which there entered a great deal of common sense and the presentiment that friendship cannot explore its own depths, on the morrow he would be gone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If as I came downstairs I lived over again the evenings at Donci\u00e8res, when we reached the street, in a moment the darkness, now almost total, in which the fog seemed to have put out the lamps, which one could make out, glimmering very faintly, only when close at hand, took me back to I could not say what arrival, by night, at Combray, when the streets there were still lighted only at long intervals and one felt one\u2019s way through a darkness moist, warm, consecrated, like that of a Christmas manger, just visibly starred here and there by a wick that burned no brighter than a candle. Between that year \u2014 to which I could ascribe no precise date \u2014 of my Combray life and the evenings at Rivebelle which had, an hour earlier, been reflected above my drawn curtains, what a world of differences! I felt on perceiving them an enthusiasm which might have borne fruit had I been left alone and would then have saved me the unnecessary round of many wasted years through which I was yet to pass before there was revealed to me that invisible vocation of which these volumes are the history. Had the revelation come to me this evening, the carriage in which I sat would have deserved to rank as more memorable with me than Dr. Percepied\u2019s, on the box seat of which I had composed that little sketch \u2014 on which, as it happened, I had recently laid my hands, altered it and sent it in vain to theFigaro \u2014 of the spires of Martinville. Is it because we live over our past years not in their continuous sequence, day by day, but in a memory that fastens upon the coolness or sun-parched heat of some morning or afternoon, receives the shadow of some solitary place, is enclosed, immovable, arrested, lost, remote from all others, because, therefore, the changes gradually wrought not only in the world outside but in our dreams and our evolving character (changes which have imperceptibly carried us through life from one to another, wholly different time), are of necessity eliminated, that, if we revive another memory taken from a different year, we find between the two, thanks to lacunae, to vast stretches of oblivion, as it were the gulf of a difference in altitude or the incompatibility of two divers qualities, that of the air we breathe and the colour of the scene before our eyes? But between one and another of the memories that had now come to me in turn of Combray, of Donci\u00e8res and of Rivebelle, I was conscious at the moment of more than a distance in time, of the distance that there would be between two separate universes the material elements in which were not the same. If I had sought to reproduce the element in which appeared carven my most trivial memories of Rivebelle, I should have had to streak with rosy veins, to render at once translucent, compact, refreshing, resonant a substance hitherto analogous to the coarse dark sandstone walls of Combray. But Robert having finished giving his instructions to the driver joined me now in the carriage. The ideas that had appeared before me took flight. Ideas are goddesses who deign at times to make themselves visible to a solitary mortal, at a turning in the road, even in his bedroom while he sleeps, when they, standing framed in the doorway, bring him the annunciation of their tidings. But as soon as a companion joins him they vanish, in the society of his fellows no man has ever beheld them. And I found myself cast back upon friendship. When he first appeared Robert had indeed warned me that there was a good deal of fog outside, but while we were indoors, talking, it had grown steadily thicker. It was no longer merely the light mist which I had looked forward to seeing rise from the island and envelop Mme. de Stermaria and myself. A few feet away from us the street lamps were blotted out and then it was night, as dark as in the open fields, in a forest, or rather on a mild Breton island whither I would fain have gone; I lost myself, as on the stark coast of some. Northern sea where one risks one\u2019s life twenty times over before coming to the solitary inn; ceasing to be a mirage for which one seeks, the fog became one of those dangers against which one has to fight, so that we had, in finding our way and reaching a safe haven, the difficulties, the anxiety and finally the joy which safety, so little perceived by him who is not threatened with the loss of it, gives to the perplexed and benighted traveller. One thing only came near to destroying my pleasure during our adventurous ride, owing to the angry astonishment into which it flung me for a moment, \u201cYou know, I told Bloch,\u201d Saint-Loup suddenly informed me, \u201cthat you didn\u2019t really think all that of him, that you found him rather vulgar at times. I\u2019m like that, you see, I want people to know where they stand,\u201d he wound up with a satisfied air and in a tone which brooked no reply. I was astounded. Not only had I the most absolute confidence in Saint-Loup, in the loyalty of his friendship, and he had betrayed it by what he had said to Bloch, but it seemed to me that he of all men ought to have been restrained from doing so, by his defects as well as by his good qualities, by that astonishing veneer of breeding which was capable of carrying politeness to what was positively a want of frankness. His triumphant air, was it what we assume to cloak a certain embarrassment in admitting a thing which we know that we ought not to have done, or did it mean complete unconsciousness; stupidity making a virtue out of a defect which I had not associated with him; a passing fit of ill humour towards me prompting him to make an end of our friendship, or the notation in words of a passing fit of ill humour in the company of Bloch to whom he had felt that he must say something disagreeable, even although I should be compromised by it? However that might be, his face was seared, while he uttered this vulgar speech, by a frightful sinuosity which I saw on it once or twice only in all the time I knew him, and which, beginning by running more or less down the middle of his face, when it came to his lips twisted them, gave them a hideous expression of baseness, almost of bestiality, quite transitory and no doubt inherited. There must have been at such moments, which recurred probably not more than once every other year, a partial eclipse of his true self by the passage across it of the personality of some ancestor whose shadow fell on him. Fully as much as his satisfied air, the words: \u201cI want people to know where they stand,\u201d encouraged the same doubt and should have incurred a similar condemnation. I felt inclined to say to him that if one wants people to know where they stand one ought to confine these outbursts of frankness to one\u2019s own affairs and not to acquire a too easy merit at the expense of others. But by this time the carriage had stopped outside the restaurant, the huge front of which, glazed and streaming with light, alone succeeded in piercing the darkness. The fog itself, beside the comfortable brightness of the lighted interior, seemed to be waiting outside on the pavement to shew one the way in with the joy of servants whose faces reflect the hospitable instincts of their master; shot with the most delicate shades of light, it pointed the way like the pillar of fire which guided the Children of Israel. Many of whom, as it happened, were to be found inside. For this was the place to which Bloch and his friends had long been in the habit, maddened by a hunger as famishing as the Ritual Fast, which at least occurs only once a year, for coffee and the satisfaction of political curiosity, of repairing in the evenings. Every mental excitement creating a value that overrides others, a quality superior to the rest of one\u2019s habits, there is no taste at all keenly developed that does not thus gather round it a society which it unites and in which the esteem of his fellows is what each of its members seeks before anything else from life. Here, in their caf\u00e9, be it in a little provincial town, you will find impassioned music-lovers; the greater part of their time, all their spare cash is spent in chamber-concerts, in meetings for musical discussion, in caf\u00e9s where one finds oneself among musical people and rubs shoulders with the members of the orchestra. Others, keen upon flying, seek to stand well with the old waiter in the glazed bar perched on top of the aerodrome; sheltered from the wind as in the glass cage of a lighthouse, they can follow in the company of an airman who is not going up that day the evolutions of a pilot practising loops, while another, invisible a moment ago, comes suddenly swooping down to land with the great winged roar of an Arabian roc. The little group which met to try to perpetuate, to explore the fugitive emotions aroused by the Zola trial attached a similar importance to this particular caf\u00e9. But they were not viewed with favour by the young nobles who composed the rest of its patrons and had taken possession of a second room, separated from the other only by a flimsy parapet topped with a row of plants. These looked upon Dreyfus and his supporters as traitors, albeit twenty-five years later, ideas having had time to classify themselves and Dreyfusism to acquire, in the light of history, a certain distinction, the sons, dance-mad Bolshevists, of these same young nobles were to declare to the \u2018intellectuals\u2019 who questioned them that undoubtedly, had they been alive at the time, they would have stood up for Dreyfus, without having any clearer idea of what the great Case had been about than Comtesse Edmond de Pourtal\u00e8s or the Marquise de Galliffet, other luminaries already extinct at the date of their birth. For on the night of the fog the noblemen of the caf\u00e9, who were in^ due course to become the fathers of these young intellectuals, Dreyfusards in retrospect, were still bachelors. Naturally the idea of a rich marriage was present in the minds of all their families, but none of them had yet brought such a marriage off. While still potential, the only effect of this rich marriage, the simultaneous ambition of several of them (there were indeed several heiresses in view, but after all the number of big dowries was considerably below that of the aspirants to them), was to create among these young men a certain amount of rivalry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As ill luck would have it, Saint-Loup remaining outside for a minute to explain to the driver that he was to call for us again after dinner, I had to make my way in by myself. In the first place, once I had involved myself in the spinning door, to which I was not accustomed, I began to fear that I should never succeed in escaping from it. (Let me note here for the benefit of lovers of verbal accuracy that the contrivance in question, despite its peaceful appearance, is known as a \u2018revolver,\u2019 from the English \u2018revolving door.\u2019) This evening the proprietor, not venturing either to brave the elements outside or to desert his customers, remained standing near the entrance so as to have the pleasure of listening to the joyful complaints of the new arrivals, all aglow with the satisfaction of people who have had difficulty in reaching a place and have been afraid of losing their way. The smiling cordiality of his welcome was, however, dissipated by the sight of a stranger incapable of disengaging himself from the rotating sheets of glass. This flagrant sign of social ignorance made him knit his brows like an examiner who has a good mind not to utter the formula: Dignus est intrare. As a crowning error I went to look for a seat in the room set apart for the nobility, from which he at once expelled me, indicating to me, with a rudeness to which all the waiters at once conformed, a place in the other room. This was all the less to my liking because the seat was in the middle of a crowded row and I had opposite me the door reserved for the Hebrews which, as it did not revolve, opening and shutting at every moment kept me in a horrible draught. But the proprietor declined to move me, saying: \u201cNo, Sir, I cannot have the whole place upset for you.\u201d Presently, however, he forgot this belated and troublesome guest, captivated as he was by the arrival of each newcomer who, before calling for his beer, his wing of cold chicken or his hot grog (it was by now long past dinner-time), must first, as in the old romances, pay his scot by relating his adventure at the moment of his entry into this asylum of warmth and security where the contrast with the perils just escaped made that gaiety and sense of comradeship prevail which create a cheerful harmony round the campfire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One reported that his carriage, thinking it had got to the Pont de la Concorde, had circled three times round the Invalides, another that his, in trying to make its way down the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es, had driven into a clump of trees at the Rond Point, from which it had taken him three quarters of an hour to get clear. Then followed lamentations upon the fog, the cold, the deathly stillness of the streets, uttered and received with the same exceptionally jovial air, which was accounted for by the pleasant atmosphere of the room which, except where I sat, was warm, the dazzling light which set blinking eyes already accustomed to not seeing, and the buzz of talk which restored their activity to deafened ears\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was all the newcomers could do to keep silence. The singularity of the mishaps which each of them thought unique burned their tongues, and their eyes roved in search of some one to engage in conversation. The proprietor himself lost all sense of social distinction. \u201cM. le Prince de Foix lost his way three times coming from the Porte Saint-Martin,\u201d he was not afraid to say with a laugh, actually pointing out, as though introducing one to the other, the illustrious nobleman to an Israelite barrister, who, on any evening but this, would have been divided from him by a barrier far harder to surmount than the ledge of greenery. \u201cThree times \u2014 fancy that!\u201d said the barrister, touching his hat. This note of personal interest was not at all to the Prince\u2019s liking. He formed one of an aristocratic group for whom the practice of impertinence, even at the expense of their fellow-nobles when these were not of the very highest rank, seemed the sole possible occupation. Not to acknowledge a bow, and, if the polite stranger repeated the offence, to titter with sneering contempt or fling back one\u2019s head with a look of fury, to pretend not to know some elderly man who might have done them a service, to reserve their handclasp for dukes and the really intimate friends of dukes whom the latter introduced to them, such was the attitude of these young men, and especially of the Prince de Foix. Such an attitude was encouraged by the ill-balanced mentality of early manhood (a period in which, even in the middle class, one appears ungrateful and behaves like a cad because, having forgotten for months to write to a benefactor after he has lost his wife, one then ceases to nod to him in the street so as to simplify matters), but it was inspired above all by an over-acute caste snobbishness. It is true that, after the fashion of certain nervous affections the symptoms of which grow less pronounced in later life, this snobbishness was on the whole to cease to express itself in so offensive a form in these men who had been so intolerable when young. Once youth is outgrown, it is seldom that anyone remains hidebound by insolence. He had supposed it to be the only thing in the world; suddenly he discovers, for all the Prince that he is, that there also are such things as music, literature, even standing for parliament. The scale of human values is correspondingly altered and he joins in conversation with people whom at one time he would have slain with a glare of lightning. Which is fortunate for those of the latter who have had the patience to wait, and whose character is sufficiently formed \u2014 if one may so put it \u2014 for them to feel pleasure in receiving in their forties the civility and welcome that had been coldly withheld from them at twenty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I have mentioned the Prince de Foix, it may not be inconsequent here to add that he belonged to a set of a dozen or fifteen young men and to an inner group of four. The dozen or fifteen shared this characteristic (which the Prince lacked, I fancy) that each of them faced the world in a dual aspect. Up to their own eyes in debt, they were of no account in those of their tradesmen, notwithstanding the pleasure these took in addressing them as \u2018Monsieur le Comte,\u2019 \u2018Monsieur le Marquis,\u2019 \u2018Monsieur le Duc.\u2019 They hoped to retrieve their fortunes by means of the famous rich marriage (\u2018money-bags\u2019 as the expression still was) and, as the fat dowries which they coveted numbered at the most four or five, several of them would be silently training their batteries on the same damsel. And the secret would be so well kept that when one of them, on arriving at the caf\u00e9, announced: \u201cMy dear fellows, I am too fond of you all not to tell you of my engagement to Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac,\u201d there was a general outburst, more than one of the others imagining that the marriage was as good as settled already between Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac and himself, and not having enough self-control to stifle a spontaneous cry of stupefaction and rage. \u201cSo you like the idea of marriage, do you Bibi?\u201d the Prince de Ch\u00e2tellerault could not help exclaiming, letting his fork drop in his surprise and despair, for he had been fully expecting the engagement of this identical Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac to be announced, but with himself, Ch\u00e2tellerault, as her bridegroom. And heaven only knew all that his father had cunningly hinted to the Ambresacs against Bibi\u2019s mother. \u201cSo you think it\u2019ll be fun, being married, do you?\u201d he was impelled to repeat his question to Bibi, who, better prepared to meet it, for he had had plenty of time to decide on the right attitude to adopt since the engagement had reached the semi-official stage, replied with a smile: \u201cWhat pleases me is not the idea of marriage, which never appealed much to me, but marrying Daisy d\u2019Ambresac, whom I think charming.\u201d In the time taken up by this response M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault had recovered his composure, but he was thinking that he must at the earliest possible moment execute a change of front in the direction of Mlle. de la Canourque or Miss Foster, numbers two and three on the list of heiresses, pacify somehow the creditors who were expecting the Ambresac marriage and finally explain to the people to whom he too had declared that Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac was charming that this marriage was all very well for Bibi, but that he himself would have had all his family down on him like a ton of bricks if he had married her. Mme. Sol\u00e9on (he decided to say) had actually announced that she would not have them in her house\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if in the eyes of tradesmen, proprietors of restaurants and the like they seemed of little account, conversely, being creatures of dual personality, the moment they appeared in society they ceased to be judged by the decay of their fortunes and the sordid occupations by which they sought to repair them. They became once more M. le Prince this, M. le Duc that and were reckoned only in terms of their quarterings. A duke who was prac^ tically a multi-millionaire and seemed to combine in his own person every possible distinction gave precedence to them because, the heads of their various houses, they were by descent sovereign princes of minute territories in which they were entitled to coin money and so forth. Often in this caf\u00e9 one of them lowered his eyes when another came in so as not to oblige the newcomer to greet him. This was because in his imaginative pursuit of riches he had invited a banker to dine. Every time that a man about town enters into relations, on this footing, with a banker, the latter leaves him the poorer by a hundred thousand francs, which does not prevent the man about town from at once repeating the process with another. We continue to burn candles in churches and to consult doctors\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Prince de Foix, who was rich already, belonged not only to this fashionable set of fifteen or so young men, but to a more exclusive and inseparable group of four which included Saint-Loup. These were never asked anywhere separately, they were known as the four gigolos, they were always to be seen riding together, in country houses their hostesses gave them communicating bedrooms, with the result that, especially as they were all four extremely good looking, rumours were current as to the extent of their intimacy. I was in a position to give these the lie direct so far as Saint-Loup was concerned. But the curious thing is that if, later on, one was to learn that these rumours were true of all four, each of the quartet had been entirely in the dark as to the other three. And yet each of them had done his utmost to find out about the others, to gratify a desire or (more probably) a resentment, to prevent a marriage or to secure a hold over the friend whose secret he discovered. A fifth (for in these groups of four there are never four only) had joined this Platonic party who was more so than any of the others. But religious scruples restrained him until long after the group had broken up, and he himself was a married man, the father of a family, fervently praying at Lourdes that the next baby might be a boy or a girl, and spending the intervals of procreation in the pursuit of soldiers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the Prince\u2019s code of manners, the fact that the barrister\u2019s comment, though uttered in his hearing, had not been directly addressed to him made him less angry than he would otherwise have been. Besides, this evening was somewhat exceptional. Finally, the barrister had no more prospect of coming to know the Prince de Foix than the cabman who had driven that noble lord to the restaurant. The Prince felt, accordingly, that he might allow himself to reply, in an arrogant tone, as though speaking to some one \u2018off stage,\u2019 to this stranger who, thanks to the fog, was in the position of a travelling companion whom one meets at some seaside place at the ends of the earth, scoured by all the winds of heaven or shrouded in mist: \u201cLosing your way\u2019s nothing; the trouble is, you can\u2019t find it again.\u201d The wisdom of this aphorism impressed the proprietor, for he had already heard it several times in the course of the evening\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was, in fact, in the habit of always comparing what he heard or read with an already familiar canon, and felt his admiration aroused if he could detect no difference. This state of mind is by no means to be ignored, for, applied to political conversations, to the reading of newspapers, it forms public opinion and thereby makes possible the greatest events in history. An aggregation of German landlords, simply by being impressed by a customer or a newspaper when he or it said that France, England and Russia were \u2018out to crush\u2019 Germany, made war, at the time of Agadir, possible, even if no war occurred. Historians, if they have not been wrong to abandon the practice of attributing the actions of peoples to the will of kings, ought to substitute for the latter the psychology of the person of no importance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In politics the proprietor of this particular caf\u00e9 had for some time now concentrated his pupil-teacher\u2019s mind on certain particular details of the Dreyfus case. If he did not find the terms that were familiar to him in the conversation of a customer or the columns of a newspaper he would pronounce the article boring or the speaker insincere. The Prince de Foix, however, impressed him so forcibly that he barely gave him time to finish what he was saying. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Prince, that\u2019s right,\u201d (which meant neither more nor less than \u2018repeated without a mistake\u2019) \u201cthat\u2019s exactly how it is!\u201d he exclaimed, expanding, like people in the Arabian Nights \u2018to the limit of repletion.\u2019 But the Prince had by this time vanished into the smaller room. Then, as life resumes its normal course after even the most sensational happenings, those who had emerged from the sea of fog began to order whatever they wanted to eat or drink; among them a party of young men from the Jockey Club who, in view of the abnormality of the situation, had no hesitation in taking their places at a couple of tables in the big room, and were thus quite close to me. So the cataclysm had established even between the smaller room and the bigger, among all these people stimulated by the comfort of the restaurant after their long wanderings across the ocean of fog, a familiarity from which I alone was excluded, not unlike the spirit that must have prevailed in Noah\u2019s ark. Suddenly I saw the landlord\u2019s body whipped into a series of bows, the head waiters hurrying to support him in a full muster which drew every eye towards the door. \u201cQuick, send Cyprien here, lay a table for M. le Marquis de Saint-Loup,\u201d cried the proprietor, for whom Robert was not merely a great nobleman possessing a real importance even in the eyes of the Prince de Foix, but a client who drove through life four-in-hand, so to speak, and spent a great deal of money in this restaurant. The customers in the big room looked on with interest, those in the small room shouted simultaneous greetings to their friend as he finished wiping his shoes. But just as he was about to make his way into the small room he caught sight of me in the big one. \u201cGood God,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cwhat on earth are you doing there? And with the door wide open too?\u201d he went on, with an angry glance at the proprietor, who ran to shut it, throwing the blame on his staff: \u201cI\u2019m always telling them to keep it shut.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had been obliged to shift my own table and to disturb others which stood in the way in order to reach him. \u201cWhy did you move? Would you sooner dine here than in the little room? Why, my poor fellow, you\u2019re freezing. You will oblige me by keeping that door locked;\u201d he turned to the proprietor. \u201cThis very instant, M. le Marquis; the gentlemen will have to go out of this room through the other, that is all.\u201d And the better to shew his zeal he detailed for this operation a head waiter and several satel lites, vociferating the most terrible threats of punishment were it not properly carried out. He began to shew me exaggerated marks of respect so as to make me forget that these had begun not upon my arrival but only after that of Saint-Loup, while, lest I should think them to have been prompted by the friendliness shewn me by his rich and noble client he gave me now and again a surreptitious little smile which seemed to indicate a regard that was wholly personal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something said by one of the diners behind me made me turn my head for a moment. I had caught, instead of the words: \u201cWing of chicken, excellent; and a glass of champagne, only not too dry,\u201d the unexpected: \u201cI should prefer glycerine. Yes, hot, excellent.\u201d I wanted to see who the ascetic was that was inflicting upon himself such a diet. I turned quickly back to Saint-Loup so as not to be recognised by the man of strange appetite. It was simply a doctor, whom I happened to know, and of whom another customer, taking advantage of the fog to buttonhole him here in the caf\u00e9, was asking his professional advice. Like stockbrokers, doctors employ the first person singular\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile I was studying Saint-Loup, and my thoughts took a line of their own. They were in this caf\u00e9, I had myself known at other times, plenty of foreigners, intellectuals, budding geniuses of all sorts, resigned to the laughter excited by their pretentious capes, their 1830 neckties and still more by the clumsiness of their movements, going so far as to provoke that laughter in order to shew that they paid no heed to it, who yet were men of real intellectual and moral worth, of an extreme sensibility. They repelled \u2014 the Jews among them principally, the unassimilated Jews, that is to say, for with the other kind we are not concerned \u2014 those who could not endure any oddity or eccentricity of appearance (as Bloch repelled Al-bertine). Generally speaking, one realised afterwards that if they had against them hair worn too long, noses and eyes that were too big, stilted theatrical gestures, it was puerile to judge them by these only, they had plenty of intelligence and spirit and were men to whom, in the long run, one could become closely attached. Among the Jews especially there were few whose parents and kinsfolk had not a warmth of heart, a breadth of mind in comparison with which Saint-Loup\u2019s mother and the Duc de Guermantes cut the poorest of figures by their sereness, their skin-deep religiosity which denounced only the most open scandals, their apology for a Christianity which led invariably (by the unexpected channel of a purely calculating mind) to an enormously wealthy marriage. But in Saint-Loup, when all was said, however the faults of his relatives might be combined in a fresh creation of character, there reigned the most charming openness of mind and heart. And whenever (it must be frankly admitted, to the undying glory of France) these qualities are found in a man who is purely French, be he noble or plebeian, they flower \u2014 flourish would be too strong a word, for a sense of proportion persists and also a certain restraint \u2014 with a grace which the foreign visitor, however estimable he may be, does not present to us. Of these intellectual and moral qualities others undoubtedly have their share, and if we have first to overcome what repels us and what makes us smile they remain no less precious. But it is all the same a pleasant thing, and one which is perhaps exclusively French that what is fine from the standpoint of equity, what is of value to the heart and mind should be first of all attractive to the eyes, charmingly coloured, consummately chiselled, should express outwardly as well in substance as in form an inward perfection. I studied Saint-Loup\u2019s features and said to myself that it is a thing to be glad of when there is no lack of bodily grace to prepare one for the graces within, and when the winged nostrils are spread as delicately and with as perfect a design as the wings of the little butterflies that hover over the field-flowers round Combray; and that the true opus francigenum, the secret of which was not lost in the thirteenth century, the beauty of which would not be lost with the destruction of our churches, consists not so much in the stone angels of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs as in the young sons of France, noble, citizen or peasant, whose faces are carved with that delicacy and boldness which have remained as traditional there as on the famous porch, but are creative still as well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After leaving us for a moment in order to supervise personally the barring of the door and the ordering of our dinner (he laid great stress on our choosing \u2018butcher\u2019s meat,\u2019 the fowls being presumably nothing to boast of) the proprietor came back to inform us that M. le Prince de Foix would esteem it a favour if M. le Marquis would allow him to dine at a table next to ours. \u201cBut they are all taken,\u201d objected Robert, casting an eye over the tables which blocked the way to mine. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter in the least, if M. le Marquis would like it, I can easily ask these people to move to another table. It is always a pleasure to do anything for M. le Marquis!\u201d \u201cBut you must decide,\u201d said Saint-Loup to me. \u201cFoix is a good fellow, he may bore you or he may not; anyhow he\u2019s not such a fool as most of them.\u201d I told Robert that of course I should like to meet his friend but that now that I was for once in a way dining with him and was so entirely happy, I should be just as well pleased to have him all to myself. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very fine cloak, the Prince has,\u201d the proprietor broke in upon our deliberation. \u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Saint-Loup. I wanted to tell Robert that M. de Charlus had disclaimed all knowledge of me to his sister-in-law, and to ask him what could be the reason of this, but was prevented by the arrival of M. de Foix. Come to see whether his request had been favourably received, we caught sight of him standing beside our table. Robert introduced us, but did not hide from his friend that as we had things to talk about he would prefer not to be disturbed. The Prince withdrew, adding to the farewell bow which he made me a smile which, pointed at Saint-Loup, seemed to transfer to him the responsibility for the shortness of a meeting which the Prince himself would have liked to see prolonged. As he turned to go, Robert, struck, it appeared, by a sudden idea, dashed off after his friend, with a \u201cStay where you are and get on with your dinner, I shall be back in a moment,\u201d to me; and vanished into the smaller room. I was pained to hear the smart young men sitting near me, whom I did not know, repeat the most absurd and malicious stories about the young Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg (formerly Comte de Nassau) whom I had met at Balbec and who had shewn me such delicate marks of sympathy at the time of my grandmother\u2019s illness. According to one of these young me he had said to the Duchesse de Guermantes: \u201cI expect everyone to get up when my wife passes,\u201d to which the Duchess had retorted (with as little truth, had she said any such thing, as humour, the grandmother of the young Princess having always been the very pink of propriety): \u201cGet up when your wife passes, do they? Well, that\u2019s a change from her grandmother\u2019s day. She expected the gentlemen to lie down.\u201d Then some one alleged that, having gone down to see his aunt the Princesse de Luxembourg at Balbec, and put up at the Grand Hotel, he had complained to the manager there (my friend) that the royal standard of Luxembourg was not flown in front of the hotel, over the sea. And that this flag being less familiar and less generally in use than the British or Italian, it had taken him several days to procure one, greatly to the young Grand Duke\u2019s annoyance. I did not believe a word of this story, but made up my mind, as soon as I went to Balbec, to inquire of the manager, so as to make certain that it was a pure invention. While waiting for Saint-Loup to return I asked the proprietor to get me some bread. \u201cCertainly, Monsieur le Baron!\u201d \u201cI am not a Baron,\u201d I told him. \u201cOh, beg pardon, Monsieur le Comte!\u201d I had no time to lodge a second protest which would certainly have promoted me to the rank of marquis; faithful to his promise of an immediate return, Saint-Loup reappeared in the doorway carrying over his arm the thick vicuna cloak of the Prince de Foix, from whom I guessed that he had borrowed it in order to keep me warm. He signed to me not to get up, and came towards me, but either my table would have to be moved again or I must change my seat if he was to get to his. Entering the big room he sprang lightly on to one of the red plush benches which ran round its walls and on which, apart from myself, there were sitting only three or four of the young men from the Jockey Club, friends of his own, who had not managed to find places in the other room. Between the tables and the wall electric wires were stretched at a certain height; without the least hesitation Saint-Loup jumped nimbly over them like a horse in a steeplechase; embarrassed that it should be done wholly for my benefit and to save me the trouble of a slight movement, I was at the same time amazed at the precision with which my friend performed this exercise in l\u00e9vitation; and in this I was not alone; for, albeit they would probably have had but little admiration for a similar display on the part of a more humbly born and less generous client, the proprietor and his staff stood fascinated, like racegoers in the enclosure; one underling, apparently rooted to the ground, stood there gaping with a dish in his hand for which a party close beside him were waiting; and when Saint-Loup, having to get past his friends, climbed on the narrow ledge behind them and ran along it, balancing himself with his arms, discreet applause broke from the body of the room. On coming to where I was sitting he stopped short in his advance with the precision of a tributary chieftain before the throne of a sovereign, and, stooping down, handed to me with an air of courtesy and submission the vicuna cloak which, a moment later, having taken his place beside me, without my having to make a single movement he arranged as a light but warm shawl about my shoulders\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBy the way, while I think of it, my uncle Charlus has something to say to you. I promised I\u2019d send you round to him to-morrow evening.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just going to speak to you about him. But to-morrow evening I am dining with your aunt Guermantes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes there\u2019s a regular beanfeast to-morrow at Oriane\u2019s. I\u2019m not asked. But my uncle Palam\u00e8de doesn\u2019t want you to go there. You can\u2019t get out of it, I suppose? Well, anyhow, go on to my uncle\u2019s afterwards. I\u2019m sure he really does want to see you. Look here, you can easily manage to get there by eleven. Eleven o\u2019clock; don\u2019t forget; I\u2019ll let him know. He\u2019s very touchy. If you don\u2019t turn up he\u2019ll never forgive you. And Oriane\u2019s parties are always over quite early. If you are only going to dine there you can quite easily be at my uncle\u2019s by eleven. I ought really to go and see Oriane, about getting shifted from Morocco; I want an exchange. She is so nice about all that sort of thing, and she can get anything she likes out of General de Saint-Joseph, who runs that branch. But don\u2019t say anything about it to her. I\u2019ve mentioned it to the Princesse de Parme, everything will be all right. Interesting place, Morocco. I could tell you all sorts of things. Very fine lot of men out there. One feels they\u2019re on one\u2019s own level, mentally.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t think the Germans are going to go to war about it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; they\u2019re annoyed with us, as after all they have every right to be. But the Emperor is out for peace. They are always making us think they want war, to force us to give in. Pure bluff, you know, like poker. The Prince of Monaco, one of Wilhelm\u2019s agents, comes and tells us in confidence that Germany will attack us. Then we give way. But if we didn\u2019t give way, there wouldn\u2019t be war in any shape or form. You have only to think what a comic spectacle a war would be in these days. It\u2019d be a bigger catastrophe than the Flood and the G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung rolled in one. Only it wouldn\u2019t last so long.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He spoke to me of friendship, affection, regret, albeit like all visitors of his sort he was going off the next morning for some months, which he was to spend in the country, and would only be staying a couple of nights in Paris on his way back to Morocco (or elsewhere); but the words which he thus let fall into the heated furnace which my heart was this evening kindled a pleasant glow there. Our infrequent meetings, this one in particular, have since formed a distinct episode in my memories. For him, as for me, this was the evening of friendship. And yet the friendship that I felt for him at this moment was scarcely, I feared (and felt therefore some remorse at the thought), what he would have liked to inspire. Filled still with the pleasure that I had had in seeing him come bounding towards me and gracefully pause on arriving at his goal, I felt that this pleasure lay in my recognising that each of the series of movements which he had developed against the wall, along the bench, had its meaning, its cause in Saint-Loup\u2019s own personal nature, possibly, but even more in that which by birth and upbringing he had inherited from his race\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A certainty of taste in the region not of beauty but manners, which when he was faced by a novel combination of circumstances enabled the man of breeding to grasp at once \u2014 like a musician who has been asked to play a piece he has never seen \u2014 the feeling, the motions that were required, and to apply the appropriate mechanism and technique; which then allowed this taste to display itself without the constraint of any other consideration, by which the average young man of the middle class would have been paralysed, from fear as well of making himself ridiculous in the eyes of strangers by his disregard of convention as of appearing too deferential in the eyes of his friends; the place of this constraint being taken in Robert by a lofty disdain which certainly he had never felt in his heart but which he had received by inheritance in his body, and which had moulded the attitudes of his ancestors to a familiarity with their inferiors which, they imagined, could only flatter and enchant those to whom it was displayed; lastly, a noble liberality which, taking no account of his boundless natural advantages (lavish expenditure in this restaurant had succeeded in making him, here as elsewhere, the most fashionable customer and the general favourite, a position which was underlined by the deference shewn him throughout the place not only by the waiters but by all its most exclusive young patrons), led him to trample them underfoot, just as he had, actually and symbolically, trodden upon those benches decked with purple, like a triumphal way which pleased my friend only because it enabled him more gracefully and swiftly to arrive at my side; such were the qualities, essential to aristocracy, which through the husk of this body, not opaque and vague as mine would have been, but significant and limpid, transmitted as through a work of art the industrious, energetic force which had created it and rendered the movements of this lightfoot course which Robert had pursued along the wall intelligible and charming as those of a row of knights upon a marble frieze. \u201cAlas!\u201d Robert might have thought, \u201cwas it worth while to have grown up despising birth, honouring only justice and intellect, choosing outside the ranks of the friends provided for me companions who were awkward and ill-dressed, provided they had the gift of eloquence, only for the sole personality apparent in me, which is to remain a treasured memory, to be not that which my will, with the most praiseworthy effort, has fashioned in my likeness, but one which is not of my making, which is not even myself, which I have always disliked and striven to overcome; was it worth while to love my chosen friend as I have loved him, for the greatest pleasure that he can find in me to be that of discovering something far more general than myself, a pleasure which is not in the least (as he says, though he cannot seriously believe it) one of the pleasures of friendship, but an intellectual and detached, a sort of artistic pleasure?\u201d This is what I am now afraid that Saint-Loup may at times have thought. If so, he was mistaken. If he had not (as he steadfastly had) cherished something more lofty than the suppleness innate in his body, if he had not kept aloof for so long from the pride that goes with noble birth, there would have been something more studied, a certain heaviness in his very agility, a self-important vulgarity in his manners. As with Mme. de Villeparisis a strong vein of seriousness had been necessary for her to give in her conversation and in her Memoirs a sense of the frivolous, which is intellectual, so, in order that Saint-Loup\u2019s body might be indwelt by so much nobility, the latter had first to desert a mind that was aiming at higher things, and, reabsorbed into his body, to be fixed there in unconscious, noble lines. In this way his distinction of mind was not absent from a bodily distinction which otherwise would not have been complete. An artist has no need to express his mind directly in his work for it to express the quality of that mind; it has indeed been said that the highest praise of God consists in the denial of Him by the atheist, who finds creation so perfect that it can dispense with a creator. And I was quite well aware that it was not merely a work of art that I was admiring in this young man unfolding along the wall the frieze of his flying course; the young Prince (a descendant of Catherine de Foix, Queen of Navarre and grand-daughter of Charles VII) whom he had just left for my sake, the endowments, by birth and fortune, which he was laying at my feet, the proud and shapely ancestors who survived in the assurance, the agility, the courtesy with which he now arranged about my shivering body the warm woollen cloak, were not all these like friends of longer standing in his life, by whom I might have expected that we should be permanently kept apart, and whom, on the contrary, he was sacrificing to me by a choice which one can make only in the loftiest places of the mind, with that sovereign liberty of which Robert\u2019s movements were the presentment and in which is realised perfect friendship?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How much familiar intercourse with a Guermantes \u2014 in place of the distinction that it had in Robert, because there the inherited scorn of humanity was but the outer garment, become an unconscious charm, of a real moral humility \u2014 could disclose of vulgar arrogance I had had an opportunity of seeing, not in M. de Charlus, in whom certain characteristic faults, for which I had been unable, so far, to account, were overlaid upon his aristocratic habits, but in the Duc de Guermantes. And yet he too, in the general impression of commonness which had so strongly repelled my grandmother when she had met him once, years earlier, at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, included glimpses of historic grandeur of which I became conscious when I went to dine in his house, on the evening following that which I had spent with Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They had not been apparent to me either in himself or in the Duchess when I had met them first in their aunt\u2019s drawing-room, any more than I had discerned, on first seeing her, the differences that set Berma apart from her fellow-players, all the more that in her the individuality was infinitely more striking than in any social celebrity, such distinctions becoming more marked in proportion as the objects are more real, more conceivable by the intellect. And yet, however slight the shades of social distinction may be (and so slight are they that when an accurate portrayer like Sainte-Beuve tries to indicate the shades of difference between the salons of Mme. Geoffrin, Mme. R\u00e9camier and Mme. de Boigne, they appear so much alike that the cardinal truth which, unknown to the author, emerges from his investigations is the vacuity of that form of life), with them, and for the same reason as with Berma, when the Guermantes had ceased to impress me and the tiny drop of their originality was no longer vaporised by my imagination, I was able to distil and analyse it, imponderable as it was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess having made no reference to her husband when she talked to me at her aunt\u2019s party, I wondered whether, in view of the rumours of a divorce that were current, he would be present at the dinner. But my doubts were speedily set at rest, for through the crowd of footmen who stood about in the hall and who (since they must until then have regarded me much as they regarded the children of the evicted cabinet-maker, that is to say with more fellow-feeling perhaps than their master but as a person incapable of being admitted to his house) must have been asking themselves to what this social revolution could be due, I saw slip towards me M. de Guermantes himself, who had been watching for my arrival so as to receive me upon his threshold and take off my greatcoat with his own hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMme. de Guermantes will be as pleased as punch,\u201d he greeted me in a glibly persuasive tone. \u201cLet me help you off with your duds.\u201d (He felt it to be at once companionable and comic to employ the speech of the people.) \u201cMy wife was just the least bit afraid you might fail us, although you had fixed a date. We\u2019ve been saying to each other all day long: \u2018Depend upon it, he\u2019ll never turn up.\u2019 I am bound to say, Mme. de Guermantes was a better prophet than I was. You are not an easy man to get hold of, and I was quite sure you were going to play us false.\u201d And the Duke was so bad a husband, so brutal even (people said), that one felt grateful to him, as one feels grateful to wicked people for their occasional kindness of heart, for those words \u2018Mme. de Guermantes\u2019 with which he appeared to be spreading out over the Duchess a protecting wing, that she might be but one flesh with him. Meanwhile, taking me familiarly by the hand, he began to lead the way, to introduce me into his household. Just as some casual phrase may delight us coming from the lips of a peasant if it points to the survival of a local tradition, shews the trace of some historic event unknown, it may be, to him who thus alludes to it; so this politeness on the part of M. de Guermantes, which, moreover, he was to continue to shew me throughout the evening, charmed me as a survival of habits of many centuries\u2019 growth, habits of the seventeenth century in particular. The people of bygone ages seem to us infinitely remote. We do not feel justified in ascribing to them any underlying intention apart from those to which they give formal expression; we are amazed when we come upon a sentiment more or less akin to what we are feeling to-day in a Homeric hero, or upon a skilful tactical feint in Hannibal, during the buttle of Cannae, where he let his flank be driven back in order to take the enemy by surprise and surround him; it would seem that we imagined the epic poet and the Punic general as being as remote from ourselves as an animal seen in a zoological garden. Even in certain personages of the court of Louis XIV, when we find signs of courtesy in the letters written by them to some man of inferior rank who could be of no service to them whatever, they leave us bewildered because they reveal to us suddenly, as existing among these great gentlemen, a whole world of beliefs to which they never give any direct expression but which govern their conduct, and especially the belief that they are bound in politeness to feign certain sentiments and to carry out with the most scrupulous care certain obligations of friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This imagined remoteness of the past is perhaps one of the things that enable us to understand how even great writers have found an inspired beauty in the works of mediocre mystifiers, such as Macpherson\u2019s Ossian. We so little expected to learn that bards long dead could have modern ideas that we marvel if in what we believe to be an ancient Gaelic ode we come upon one which we should have thought, at the most, ingenious in a contemporary. A translator of talent has simply to add to an ancient writer whom he presents to us more or less faithfully reproduced fragments which, signed with a contemporary name and published separately, would seem entertaining only; at once he imparts a moving grandeur to his poet, who is thus made to play upon the keyboards of several ages at once. This translator was capable only of a mediocre book, if that book had been published as his original work. Given out as a translation, it seems that of a masterpiece. The past not merely is not fugitive, it remains present. It is not within a few months only after the outbreak of a war that laws passed without haste can effectively influence its course, it is not within fifteen years only after a crime which has remained obscure that a magistrate can still find the vital evidence which will throw a light on it; after hundreds and thousands of years the scholar who has been studying in a distant land the place-names, the customs of the inhabitants, may still extract from them some legend long anterior to the Christian era, already unintelligible, if not actually forgotten, at the time of Herodotus, which in the name given to a rock, in a religious rite, dwells surrounded by the present, like an emanation of greater density, immemorial and stable. There was similarly an emanation, though far less ancient, of the life of the court, if not in the manners of M. de Guermantes, which were often vulgar, at least in the mind that controlled them. I was to breathe this again, like the odour of antiquity, when I joined him a little later in the drawing-room. For I did not go there at once\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we left the outer hall, I had mentioned to M. de Guermantes that I was extremely anxious to see his Elstirs. \u201cI am at your service. Is M. Elstir a friend of yours, then? If so, it is most vexing, for I know him slightly; he is a pleasant fellow, what our fathers used to call an \u2018honest fellow\u2019; I might have asked him to honour us with his company, and to dine tonight. I am sure he would have been highly flattered at being invited to spend the evening in your society.\u201d Very little suggestive of the old order when he tried thus to assume its manner, the Duke relapsed unconsciously into it. After inquiring whether I wished him to shew me the pictures, he conducted me to them, gracefully standing aside for me at each door, apologising when, to shew me the way, he was obliged to precede me, a little scene which (since the days when Saint-Simon relates that an ancestor of the Guermantes did him the honours of his town house with the same punctilious exactitude in the performance of the frivolous duties of a gentleman) must, before coming gradually down to us, have been enacted by many other Guermantes for numberless other visitors. And as I had said to the Duke that I would like very much to be left alone for a few minutes with the pictures, he discreetly withdrew, telling me that I should find him in the drawing-room when I was ready\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only, once I was face to face with the Elstirs, I completely forgot about dinner and the time; here again as at Balbec I had before me fragments of that strangely coloured world which was no more than the projection, the way of seeing things peculiar to that great painter, which his speech in no way expressed. The parts of the walls that were covered by paintings from his brush, all homogeneous with one another, were like the luminous images of a magic lantern, which would have been in this instance the brain of the artist, and the strangeness of which one could never have suspected so long as one had known only the man, which was like seeing the iron lantern boxing its lamp before any coloured slide had been slid into its groove. Among these pictures several of the kind that seemed most absurd to ordinary people interested me more than the rest because they recreated those optical illusions which prove to us that we should never succeed in identifying objects if we did not make some process of reasoning intervene How often, when driving in the dark, do we not come upon a long, lighted street which begins a few feet away from us, when what we have actually before our eyes is nothing but a rectangular patch of wall with a bright light falling on it, which has given us the mirage of depth. In view of which is it not logical, not by any artifice of symbolism but by a sincere return to the very root of the impression, to represent one thing by that other for which, in the flash of a first illusion, we mistook it? Surfaces and volumes are in reality independent of the names of objects which our memory imposes on them after we have recognised them. Elstir attempted to wrest from what he had just felt what he already knew, his effort had often been to break up that aggregate of impressions which we call vision\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The people who detested these \u2018horrors\u2019 were astonished to find that Elstir admired Chardin, Perroneau, any number of painters whom they, the ordinary men and women of society, liked. They did not take into account that Elstir had had to make, for his own part, in striving to reproduce reality (with the particular index of his taste for certain lines of approach), the same effort as a Chardin or a Perroneau and that consequently, when he ceased to work for himself, he admired in them attempts of the same order, fragments anticipatory so to speak of works of his own. Nor did these society people include in their conception of Elstir\u2019s work that temporal perspective which enabled them to like, or at least to look without discomfort at Chardin\u2019s painting. And yet the older among them might have reminded themselves that in the course of their lives they had seen gradually, as the years bore them away from it, the unbridgeable gulf between what they considered a masterpiece by Ingres and what, they had supposed, must remain for ever a \u2018horror\u2019 (Manet\u2019sOlympia, for example) shrink until the two canvases seemed like twins. But we learn nothing from any lesson because we have not the wisdom to work backwards from the particular to the general, and imagine ourselves always to be going through an experience which is without precedents in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was moved by the discovery in two of the pictures (more realistic, these, and in an earlier manner) of the same person, in one in evening dress in his own drawing-room, in the other wearing a frock coat and tall hat at some popular regatta where he had evidently no business to be, which proved that for Elstir he was not only a regular sitter but a friend, perhaps a patron whom it pleased him (just as Carpaccio used to introduce prominent figures, and in speaking likenesses, from contemporary life in Venice) to introduce into his pictures, just as Beethoven, too, found pleasure in inscribing at the top of a favourite work the beloved name of the Archduke Rudolph. There was something enchanting about this waterside carnival. The river, the women\u2019s dresses, the sails of the boats, the innumerable reflexions of one thing and another came crowding into this little square panel of beauty which Elstir had cut out of a marvellous afternoon. What delighted one in the dress of a woman who had stopped for a moment in the dance because it was hot and she was out of breath was irresistible also in the same way in the canvas of a motionless sail, in the water of the little harbour, in the wooden bridge, in the leaves of the trees and in the sky. As in one of the pictures that I had seen at Balbec, the hospital, as beautiful beneath its sky of lapis lazuli as the cathedral itself, seemed (more bold than Elstir the theorician, then Elstir the man of taste, the lover of things mediaeval) to be intoning: \u201cThere is no such thing as gothic, there is no such thing as a masterpiece; this tasteless hospital is just as good as the glorious porch,\u201d so I now heard: \u201cThe slightly vulgar lady at whom a man of discernment would refrain from glancing as he passed her by, would except from the poetical composition which nature has set before him \u2014 her dress is receiving the same light as the sail of that boat, and there are no degrees of value and beauty; the commonplace dress and the sail, beautiful in itself, are two mirrors reflecting the same gleam; the value is all in the painter\u2019s eye.\u201d This eye had had the skill to arrest for all time the motion of the hours at this luminous instant, when the lady had felt hot and had stopped dancing, when the tree was fringed with a belt of shadow, when the sails seemed to be slipping over a golden glaze. But just because the depicted moment pressed on one with so much force, this so permanent canvas gave one the most fleeting impression, one felt that the lady would presently move out of it, the boats drift away, the night draw on, that pleasure comes to an end, that life passes and that the moments illuminated by the convergence, at once, of so many lights do not recur. I recognized yet another aspect, quite different it is true, of what the moment means in a series of water-colours of mythological subjects, dating from Elstir\u2019s first period, which also adorned this room. Society people who held \u2018advanced\u2019 views on art went \u2018as far as\u2019 this earliest manner, but no further. These were certainly not the best work that he had done, but already the sincerity with which the subject had been thought out melted its natural coldness. Thus the Muses, for instance, were represented as it might be creatures belonging to a species now fossilised, but creatures which it would not have been surprising in mythological times to see pass in the evening, in twos or threes, along some mountain path. Here and there a poet, of a race that had also a peculiar interest for the zoologist (characterised by a certain sexlessness) strolled with a Muse, as one sees in nature creatures of different but of kindred species consort together. In one of these water-colours one saw a poet wearied by long wanderings on the mountains, whom a Centaur, meeting him and moved to pity by his weakness, had taken on his back and was carrying home. In more than one other, the vast landscape (in which the mythical scene, the fabulous heroes, occupied a minute place and were almost lost) was rendered, from the mountain tops to the sea, with an exactitude which told one more than the hour, told one to the very minute what time of day ft was, thanks to the precise angle of the setting sun, to the fleeting fidelity of the shadows. In this way the artist managed to give, by making it instantaneous, a sort of historical reality, as of a thing actually lived, to the symbol of his fable, painted it and set it at a definite point in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I was examining Elstir\u2019s paintings the bell, rung by arriving guests had been pealing uninterruptedly, and had lulled me into a pleasing unconsciousness. But the silence which followed its clangour and had already lasted for some time succeeded \u2014 less rapidly, it is true \u2014 in awakening me from my dream, as the silence that follows Lindor\u2019s music arouses Bartolo from his sleep. I was afraid that I had been forgotten, that they had sat down to dinner, and hurried to the drawing-room. At the door of the Elstir gallery I found a servant waiting for me, white-haired, though whether with age or powder I cannot say, with the air of a Spanish Minister, but treating me with the same respect that he would have shewn to a King. I felt from his manner that he must have been waiting for at least an hour, and I thought with alarm of the delay I had caused in the service of dinner, especially as I had promised to be at M. de Charlus\u2019s by eleven\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Spanish Minister (though I also met on the way the footman persecuted by the porter, who, radiant with delight when I inquired after his girl, told me that the very next day they were both to be off duty, so that he would be able to spend the whole day with her, and extolled the generosity of Madame la Duchesse) conducted me to the drawing-room, where I was afraid of finding M. de Guermantes in an ill humour. He welcomed me, on the contrary, with a joy that was evidently to a certain extent artificial and dictated by politeness, but was also sincere, prompted both by his stomach which so long a delay had begun to famish, and his consciousness of a similar impatience in all his other guests, who completely filled the room. Indeed I heard afterwards that I had kept them waiting for nearly three-quarters of an hour. The Duc de Guermantes probably thought that to prolong the general torment for two minutes more would not intensify it and that, politeness having driven him to postpone for so long the moment of moving into the dining-room, this politeness would be more complete if, by not having dinner announced immediately, he could succeed in persuading me that I was not late, and that they had not been waiting for me. And so he asked me, as if we had still an hour before dinner and some of the party had not yet arrived, what I thought of his Elstirs. But at the same time, and without letting the cravings of his stomach become apparent, so as not to lose another moment, he, in concert with the Duchess, proceeded to the ceremony of introduction. Then only I perceived that there had occurred round about me, me who until this evening, save for my novitiate in Mme. Swann\u2019s drawing-room, had been accustomed, in my mother\u2019s homes, at Combray and in Paris, to the manners, either protecting or defensive, of the grim ladies of our middle-world, who treated me as a child, a change of surroundings comparable to that which introduces Parsifal suddenly into the midst of the Flower-Maidens. Those who surrounded me now, their bosoms entirely bare (the naked flesh appeared on either side of a sinuous spray of mimosa or behind the broad petals of a rose) could not murmur a word of greeting without at the same time bathing me in long, caressing glances, as though shyness alone restrained them from kissing me. Many of them were nevertheless highly respectable from the moral standpoint; many, not all, for the most virtuous had not for those of a lighter vein the same repulsion that my mother would have felt. The caprices of one\u2019s conduct, denied by saintlier friends, in the face of the evidence, seemed in the Guermantes world to matter far less than the relations which one had been able to maintain. One pretended not to know that the body of one\u2019s hostess was at the disposal of all comers, provided that her visiting list showed no gaps. As the Duke put himself out not at all for his other guests (of whom he had long known everything that there was to know, and they of him) but quite markedly for me, whose kind of superiority, being outside his experience, inspired in him something akin to the respect which the great nobleman of the court of Louis XIV used to feel for his plebeian Ministers, he evidently considered that the fact of my not knowing his other guests mattered not at all \u2014 to me at least, though it might to them \u2014 and while I was anxious, on his account, as to the impression that I was going to make on them he was thinking only of how his friends would impress me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the very outset I found myself completely bewildered. No sooner had I entered the drawing-room than M. de Guermantes, without even allowing me time to shake hands with the Duchess, had led me, as though I were a delightful surprise to the person in question to whom he seemed to be saying: \u201cHere\u2019s your friend! You see, I\u2019m bringing him to you by the scruff of his neck,\u201d towards a lady of smallish stature. Whereupon, long before, thrust forward by the Duke, I had reached her chair, the lady had begun to flash at me continuously from her large, soft, dark eyes the thousand smiles of understanding which we address to an old friend who perhaps has not recognised us. As this was precisely my case and I could not succeed in calling to mind who she was I averted my eyes from her as I approached so as not to have to respond until our introduction should have released me from my predicament. Meanwhile the lady continued to maintain in unstable equilibrium the smile intended for myself. She looked as though she were anxious to be relieved of it and to hear me say: \u201cOh, but this is a pleasure! Mamma will be pleased when I tell her I\u2019ve met you!\u201d I was as impatient to learn her name as she was to see that I did finally greet her, fully aware of what I was doing, so that the smile which she was holding on indefinitely, like the note of a tuning-fork, might at length be let go. But M. de Guermantes managed things so badly (to my mind, at least) that I seemed to have heard only my own name uttered and was given no clue to the identity of my unknown friend, to whom it never occurred to tell me herself what her name was, so obvious did the grounds of our intimacy, which baffled me completely, seem to her. Indeed, as soon as I had come within reach, she did not offer me her hand, but took mine in a familiar clasp, and spoke to me exactly as though I had been equally conscious with herself of the pleasant memories to which her mind reverted. She told me how sorry Albert (who, I gathered, was her son) would be to have missed seeing me. I tried to remember who, among the people I had known as boys, was called Albert, and could think only of Bloch, but this could not be Bloch\u2019s mother that I saw before me since she had been dead for some time. In vain I struggled to identify the past experience common to herself and me to which her thoughts had been carried back. But I could no more distinguish it through the translucent jet of her large, soft pupils which allowed only her smile to pierce their surface than one can distinguish a landscape that lies on the other side of a smoked glass, even when the sun is blazing on it. She asked me whether my father was not working too hard, if I would not come to the theatre some evening with Albert, if I was stronger now, and as my replies, stumbling through the mental darkness in which I was plunged, became distinct only to explain that I was not feeling well that evening, she pushed forward a chair for me herself, going to all sorts of trouble which I was not accustomed to see taken by my parents\u2019 friends. At length the clue to the riddle was furnished me by the Duke: \u201cShe thinks you\u2019re charming,\u201d he murmured in my ear, which felt somehow that it had heard these words before. They were what Mme. de Villeparisis had said to my grandmother and myself after we had made the acquaintance of the Princesse de Luxembourg. Everything became clear; the lady I now saw had nothing in common with Mme. de Luxembourg, but from the language of him who thus served me with her I could discern the nature of the animal. It was a Royalty. She had never before heard of either my family or myself, but, a scion of the noblest race and endowed with the greatest fortune in the world (for, a daughter of the Prince de Parme, she had married a cousin of equal princelihood), she sought always, in gratitude to her Creator, to testify to her neighbour, however poor or lowly he might be, that she did not look down upon him. Really, I might have guessed this from her smile. I had seen the Princesse de Luxembourg buy little rye-cakes on the beach at Balbec to give to my grandmother, as though to a caged deer in the zoological garden. But this was only the second Princess of the Blood Royal to whom I had been presented, and I might be excused my failure to discern in her the common factors of the friendliness of the great. Besides, had not they themselves gone out of their way to warn me not to count too much on this friendliness, since the Duchesse de Guermantes, who had waved me so effusive a greeting with her gloved hand at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, had appeared furious when I bowed to her in the street, like people who, having once given somebody a sovereign, feel that this has set them free from any further obligation toward him. As for M. de Charlus, his ups and downs were even more sharply contrasted. While in the sequel I have known, as the reader will learn, Highnesses and Majesties of another sort altogether, Queens who play the Queen and speak not after the conventions of their kind but like the Queens in Sardou\u2019s plays\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If M. de Guermantes had been in such haste to present me, it was because the presence at a party of anyone not personally known to a Royal Personage is an intolerable state of things which must not be prolonged for a single instant. It was similar to the haste which Saint-Loup had shewn in making me introduce him to my grandmother. By the same token, by a fragmentary survival of the old life of the court which is called social courtesy and is not superficial, in which, rather, by a centripetal reversion, it is the surface that becomes essential and profound, the Due and Duchesse de Guermantes regarded as a duty more essential than those (which one at least of the pair neglected often enough) of charity, chastity, pity and justice, as a more unalterable law that of never addressing the Princesse de Parme save in the third person\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having never yet in my life been to Parma (a pilgrimage I had been anxious to make ever since certain Easter holidays long ago), to meet its Princess, who, I knew, owned the finest palace in that matchless city, where, moreover, everything must be in keeping, isolated as it was from the rest of the world, within the polished walls, in the atmosphere, stifling as a breathless summer evening on the Piazza of a small town in Italy, of its compact and almost cloying name, would surely have substituted in a flash for what I had so often tried to imagine all that did really exist at Parma in a sort of partial arrival there, without my having to stir from Paris, of myself; it was in the algebraical expression of a journey to the city of Correggio a simple equation, so to speak, of that unknown quantity. But if I had for many years past \u2014 like a perfumer impregnating a solid mass of grease with scent \u2014 made this name, Princesse de Parme, absorb the fragrance of thousands of violets, in return, when I set eyes on the Princess, who, until then I should have sworn, must be the Sanseverina herself, a second process began which was not, I may say, completed until several months had passed, and consisted in expelling, by means of fresh chemical combinations, all the essential oil of violets and all the Stendhalian fragrance from the name of the Princess, and in implanting there, in their place, the image of a little dark woman, taken up with good works, of a friendliness so humble that one felt at once in how exalted a pride that friendliness had its roots. Moreover, while, barring a few points of difference, she was exactly like any other great lady, she was as little Stendhalian as is, for example, in Paris, in the Europe quarter, the Rue de Parme, which bears far less resemblance to the name of Parma than to any or all of the neighbouring streets, and reminds one not nearly so much of the Charterhouse in which Fabrice ends his days as of the waiting room in the Saint-Lazare station\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her friendliness sprang from two causes. The first and more general was the education which this daughter of Kings had received. Her mother (not merely allied by blood to all the royal families of Europe but furthermore \u2014 in contrast to the Ducal House of Parma \u2014 richer than any reigning Princess) had instilled into her from her earliest childhood the arrogantly humble precepts of an evangelical snobbery; and to-day every line of the daughter\u2019s face, the curve of her shoulders, the movements of her arms seemed to repeat the lesson: \u201cRemember that if God has caused you to be born on the steps of a throne you ought not to make that a reason for looking down upon those to whom Divine Providence has willed (wherefore His Name be praised) that you should be superior by birth and fortune. On the contrary, you must suffer the little ones. Your ancestors were Princes of Treves and Juliers from the year 647: God has decreed in His bounty that you should hold practically all the shares in the Suez Canal and three times as many Royal Dutch as Edmond de Rothschild; your pedigree in a direct line has been established by genealogists from the year 63 of the Christian Era; you have as sisters-in-law two Empresses. Therefore never seem, in your speech, to be recalling these great privileges, not that they are precarious (for nothing can alter antiquity of race, while the world will always need petrol), but because it is useless to point out that you are better born than other people or that your investments are all gilt-edged, since everyone knows these facts already. Be helpful to the needy. Furnish to all those whom the bounty of Heaven has done you the favour of placing beneath you as much as you can give them without forfeiture of your rank, that is to say help in the form of money, even your personal service by their sickbeds, but never (bear well in mind) invite them to your parties, which would do them no possible good and, by weakening your own position, would diminish the efficacy of your benevolent activities.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so even at the moments when she could not do good the Princess endeavoured to shew, or rather to let it be thought, by all the external signs of dumb language, that she did not consider herself superior to the people among whom she found herself thrown. She treated each of them with that charming courtesy with which well-bred people treat their inferiors and was continually, to make herself useful, pushing back her chair so as to leave more room, holding my gloves, offering me all those services which would demean the proud spirit of a commoner but are very willingly rendered by sovereign ladies or, instinctively and by force of professional habit, by retired servants\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But already the Duke, who seemed in a hurry to complete the round of introduction, had led me off to another of the flower-maidens. On hearing her name I told her that I had passed by her country house, not far from Balbec. \u201cOh, I should have been so pleased to take you over it,\u201d she informed me, almost in a whisper, to enhance her modesty, but in a tone of deep feeling, steeped in regret for the loss of an opportunity to enjoy a quite exceptional pleasure; and went on, with a meaning glance: \u201cI do hope you will come again some day. But I must say that what would interest you more still would be my aunt Brancas\u2019s place. It was built by Mansard; it is the jewel of the province.\u201d It was not only she herself who would have been glad to shew me over her house, but her aunt Brancas would have been no less delighted to do me the honours of hers, or so I was assured by this lady who thought evidently that, especially at a time when the land shewed a tendency to pass into the hands of financiers who had no knowledge of the world, it was important that the great should keep up the exalted traditions of lordly hospitality, by speeches which involved them in nothing. It was also because she sought, like everyone in her world, to say the things which would give most pleasure to the person she was addressing, to give him the highest idea of himself, to make him think that he flattered people by writing to them, that he honoured those who entertained him, that everyone was burning to know him. The desire to give other people this comforting idea of themselves does, it must be admitted, exist even among the middle classes. We find there that kindly disposition, in the form of an individual merit compensating for some other defect, not alas among the most trusty male friends but at any rate among the most agreeable female companions. But there anyhow it blooms only in isolated patches. In an important section of the aristocracy, on the other hand, this characteristic has ceased to be individual; cultivated by education, sustained by the idea of a personal greatness which can fear no humiliation, which knows no rival, is aware that by being pleasant it can make people happy and delights in doing so, it has become the generic feature of a class. And even those whom personal defects of too incompatible a kind prevent from keeping it in their hearts bear the unconscious trace of it in their vocabulary or their gesticulation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe is a very good creature,\u201d said the Duc de Guermantes, of the Princesse de Parme, \u201cand she can play the \u2018great lady\u2019 when she likes, better than anyone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I was being introduced to the ladies, one of the gentlemen of the party had been shewing various signs of agitation: this was Comte Hannibal de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9-Consalvi. Arriving late, he had not had time to investigate the composition of the party, and when I entered the room, seeing in me a guest who was not one of the Duchess\u2019s regular circle and must therefore have some quite extraordinary claim to admission, installed his monocle beneath the groined arch of his eyebrow, thinking that this would be a great help to him in discovering what manner of man I was. He knew that Mme. de Guermantes possessed (the priceless appanage of truly superior women) what was called a \u2018salon,\u2019 that is to say added occasionally to the people of her own set some celebrity who had recently come into prominence by the discovery of a new cure for something or the production of a masterpiece. The Faubourg Saint-Germain had not yet recovered from the shock of learning that, to the reception which she had given to meet the King and Queen of England, the Duchess had not been afraid to invite M. D\u00e9taille. The clever women of the Faubourg who had not been invited were inconsolable, so deliciously thrilling would it have been to come into contact with that strange genius. Mme. de Courvoisier made out that M. Ribot had been there as well, but this was a pure invention, designed to make people believe that Oriane was aiming at an Embassy for her husband. Finally, a last straw of scandal, M. de Guermantes, with a gallantry that would have done credit to Marshal Saxe, had repaired to the green-room of the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise, and had begged Mlle. Reichemberg to come and recite before the King, which having come to pass constituted an event without precedent in the annals of routs. Remembering all these surprises, which, moreover, had his entire approval, his own presence being not merely an ornament but, in the same way as that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, a consecration to any drawing-room, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, when he asked himself who I could be, felt that the field of exploration was very wide. For a moment the name of M. Widor flashed before his mind, but he decided that I was not old enough to be an organist, and M. Widor not striking enough to be \u2018asked out.\u2019 It seemed on the whole more plausible to regard me simply as the new Attach\u00e9 at the Swedish Legation of whom he had heard, and he was preparing to ask me for the latest news of Oscar, by whom he had several times been very hospitably received; but when the Duke, in introducing me, had mentioned my name to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, the latter, finding that name to be completely unknown to him had no longer any doubt that, being where I was, I must be a celebrity Of some sort. Oriane would certainly never invite anyone who was not, and had the art of attracting men who were in the public eye to her house, in a ratio that of course never exceeded one per cent, otherwise she would have lowered its tone. M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 began, therefore, to lick his chops and to sniff the air greedily, his appetite whetted not only by the good dinner upon which he could count, but by the character of the party, which my presence could not fail to make interesting, and which would furnish him with a topic for brilliant conversation next day at the Duc de Chartres\u2019s luncheon-table. He had not yet settled in his own mind whether I was the man who had just been making those experiments with a serum to cure cancer, or the author of the new \u2018curtain-raiser\u2019 then in rehearsal at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais; but, a great intellectual, a great collector of \u2018travellers\u2019 tales,\u2019 he continued an ever increasing display of reverences, signs of mutual understanding, smiles filtered through the glass of his monocle; either in the mistaken idea that a man of my standing would esteem him more highly if he could manage to instil into me the illusion that for him, the Comte de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9-Consalvi, the privileges of the mind were no less deserving of respect than those of birth; or simply from the need to express and difficulty of expressing his satisfaction, in his ignorance of the language in which he ought to address me, just as if, in fact, he had found himself face to face with one of the \u2018natives\u2019 of an undiscovered country on which his keel had grounded, natives from whom, in the hope of ultimate profit, he would endeavour, observing with interest the while their quaint customs and without interrupting his demonstrations of friendship, or like them uttering loud cries, to obtain ostrich eggs and spices in exchange for his glass beads. Having responded as best I could to his joy, I shook hands next with the Duc de Chatellerault, whom I had already met at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, who, he informed me, was as \u2018cunning as they made \u2019em.\u2019 He was typically Guermantes in the fairness of his hair, his arched profile, the points where the skin of his cheeks lost colour, all of which may be seen in the portraits of that family which have come down to us from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. But, as I was no longer in love with the Duchess, her reincarnation in the person of a young man offered me no attraction. I interpreted the hook made by the Duc de Chatellerault\u2019s nose, as if it had been the signature of a painter whose work I had long studied but who no longer interested me in the least. Next, I said good evening also to the Prince de Foix, and to the detriment of my knuckles, which emerged crushed and mangled, let them be caught in a vice which was the German handclasp, accompanied by an ironical or good-natured smile, of the Prince von Faffenheim, M. de Norpois\u2019s friend, who, by virtue of the mania for nicknames which prevailed in this set, was known so universally as Prince Von that he himself used to sign his letters \u2018Prince Von,\u2019 or, when he wrote to his intimates, \u2018Von.\u2019 And yet this abbreviation was understandable, in view of his triple-barrelled name. It was less easy to grasp the reasons which made \u2018Elizabeth\u2019 be replaced, now by \u2018Lili,\u2019 now by \u2018Bebeth,\u2019 just as another world swarmed with \u2018Kikis.\u2019 One can realise that these people, albeit in most respects idle and light-minded enough, might have come to adopt \u2018Quiou\u2019 in order not to waste the precious time that it would have taken them to pronounce \u2018Montesquieu.\u2019 But it is not so easy to see what they saved by naming one of their cousins \u2018Dinand\u2019 instead of \u2018Ferdinand.\u2019 It must not be thought, however, that in the invention of nicknames the Guermantes invariably proceed to curtail or reduplicate syllables. Thus two sisters, the Comtesse de Montpeyroux and the Vicomtesse de V\u00e9lude, who were both of them enormously stout, invariably heard themselves addressed, without the least trace of annoyance on their part or of amusement on other people\u2019s, so long established was the custom, as \u2018Petite\u2019 and \u2018Mignonne.\u2019 Mme. de Guermantes, who adored Mme. de Montpeyroux, would, if her friend had been seriously ill, have flown to the sister with tears in her eyes and exclaimed: \u201cI hear Petite is dreadfully bad!\u201d Mme. de l\u2019Eclin, who wore her hair in bands that entirely hid her ears, was never called anything but \u2018The Empty Stomach\u2019; in some cases people simply added an \u2018a\u2019 to the last or first name of the husband to indicate the wife. The most miserly, most sordid, most inhuman man in the Faubourg having been christened Raphael, his charmer, his flower springing also from the rock always signed herself \u2018Raphaela\u2019\u2014 but these are merely a few specimens taken from innumerable rules, to which we can always return later on, if the occasion offers, and explain some of them. I then asked the Duke to present me to the Prince d\u2019Agrigente. \u201cWhat! Do you mean to say you don\u2019t know our excellent Gri-gri!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes, and gave M. d\u2019Agrigente my name. His own, so often quoted by Fran\u00e7oise, had always appeared to me like a transparent sheet of coloured glass through which I beheld, struck, on the shore of the violet sea, by the slanting rays of a golden sun, the rosy marble cubes of an ancient city of which I had not the least doubt that the Prince \u2014 happening for a miraculous moment to be passing through Paris \u2014 was himself, as luminously Sicilian and gloriously mellowed, the absolute sovereign. Alas, the vulgar drone to whom I was introduced, and who wheeled round to bid me good evening with a ponderous ease which he considered elegant, was as independent of his name as of any work of art that he might have owned without bearing upon his person any trace of its beauty, without, perhaps, ever having stopped to examine it. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente was so entirely devoid of anything princely, anything that might make one think of Girgenti that one was led to suppose that his name, entirely distinct from himself, bound by no ties to his person, had had the power of attracting to itself the whole of whatever vague poetical element there might have been in this man as in any other, and isolating it, after the operation, in the enchanted syllables. If any such operation had been performed, it had certainly been done most efficiently, for there remained not an atom of charm to be drawn from this kinsman of Guermantes. With the result that he found himself at one and the same time the only man in the world who was Prince d\u2019Agrigente and the man who, of all the men in the world was, perhaps, least so. He was, for all that, very glad to be what he was, but as a banker is glad to hold a number of shares in a mine without caring whether the said mine answers to the charming name of Ivanhoe or Primrose, or is called merely the Premier. Meanwhile, as these introductions, which it has taken me so long to recount but which, beginning as I entered the room, had lasted only a few seconds, were coming to an end, and Mme. de Guermantes, in an almost suppliant tone, was saying to me: \u201cI am sure Basin is tiring you, dragging you round like that; we are anxious for you to know our friends, but we are a great deal more anxious not to tire you, so that you may come again often,\u201d the Duke, with a somewhat awkward and timid wave of the hand, gave (as he would gladly have given it at any time during the last hour, filled for me by the contemplation of his Elstirs) the signal that dinner might now be served\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should add that one of the guests was still missing, M. de Grouchy, whose wife, a Guermantes by birth, had arrived by herself, her husband being due to come straight from the country, where he had been shooting all day. This M. de Grouchy, a descendant of his namesake of the First Empire, of whom it has been said, quite wrongly, that his absence at the start of the Battle of Waterloo was the principal cause of Napoleon\u2019s defeat, came of an excellent family which, however, was not good enough in the eyes of certain fanatics for blue blood. Thus the Prince de Guermantes, whose own tastes, in later life, were to prove more easily satisfied, had been in the habit of saying to his nieces: \u201cWhat a misfortune for that poor Mme. de Guermantes\u201d (the Vicomtesse de Guermantes, Mme. de Grouchy\u2019s mother) \u201cthat she has never succeeded in marrying any of her children.\u201d \u201cBut, uncle, the eldest girl married M. de Grouchy.\u201d \u201cI do not call that a husband! However, they say that your uncle Fran\u00e7ois has proposed for the youngest one, so perhaps they won\u2019t all die old maids.\u201d No sooner was the order to serve dinner given than with a vast gyratory whirr, multiple and simultaneous, the double doors of the dining-room swung apart; a chamberlain with the air of a Lord Chamberlain bowed before the Princesse de Parme and announced the tidings \u201cMadame is served,\u201d in a tone such as he would have employed to say \u201cMadame is dead,\u201d which, however, cast no gloom over the assembly for it was with an air of unrestrained gaiety and as, in summer, at \u2018Robinson\u2019 that the couples moved forward one behind another to the dining-room, separating when they had reached their places where footmen thrust their chairs in behind them; last of all, Mme. de Guermantes advanced upon me, that I might lead her to the table, and without my feeling the least shadow of the timidity that I might have feared, for, like a huntress to whom her great muscular prowess has made graceful motion an easy thing, observing no doubt that I had placed myself on the wrong side of her, she pivoted with such accuracy round me that I found her arm resting on mine and attuned in the most natural way to a rhythm of precise and noble movements. I yielded to these with all the more readiness in that the Guermantes attached no more importance to them than does to learning a truly learned man in whose company one is less alarmed than in that of a dunce; other doors opened through which there entered the steaming soup, as though the dinner were being held in a puppet-theatre of skilful mechanism where the belated arrival of the young guest set, on a signal from the puppet-master, all the machinery in motion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Timid and not majestically sovereign had been this signal from the Duke, to which had responded the unlocking of that vast, ingenious, subservient and sumptuous clockwork, mechanical and human. The indecision of his gesture did not spoil for me the effect of the spectacle that was attendant upon it. For I could feel that what had made it hesitating and embarrassed was the fear of letting me see that they were waiting only for myself to begin dinner and that they had been waiting for some time, just as Mme. de Guermantes was afraid that after looking at so many pictures I would find it tiring and would be hindered from taking my ease among them if her husband engaged me in a continuous flow of introductions. So that it was the absence of grandeur in this gesture that disclosed its true grandeur. As, also, did that indifference shewn by the Duke to the splendour of his surroundings, in contrast to his deference towards a guest, however insignificant, whom he desired to honour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not that M. de Guermantes was not in certain respects thoroughly commonplace, shewing indeed some of the absurd weaknesses of a man with too much money, the arrogance of an upstart, which he certainly was not. But just as a public official or a priest sees his own humble talents multiplied to infinity (as a wave is by the whole mass of the sea which presses behind it) by those forces on which they can rely, the Government of France and the Catholic Church, so M. de Guermantes was borne on by that other force, aristocratic courtesy in its truest form. This courtesy drew the line at any number of people. Mme. de Guermantes would not have asked to her house Mme. de Cambremer, or M. de Forcheville. But the moment that anyone (as was the case with me) appeared eligible for admission into the Guermantes world, this courtesy revealed treasures of hospitable simplicity more splendid still, were that possible, than those historic rooms, or the marvellous furniture that had remained in them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he wished to give pleasure to anyone, M. de Guermantes possessed, in this way, for making his guest for the moment the principal person present, an art which made the most of the circumstances and the place. No doubt at Guermantes his \u2018distinctions\u2019 and \u2018favours\u2019 would have assumed another form. He would have ordered his carriage to take me for a drive, alone with himself, before dinner. Such as they were, one could not help feeling touched by his manners as one is in reading memoirs of the period by those of Louis XIV when he replies good-naturedly, smiling and almost with a bow, to some one who has come to solicit his favour. It must however in both instances be borne in mind that this \u2018politeness\u2019 did not go beyond the strict meaning of the word\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Louis XIV (with whom the sticklers for pure nobility of his day find fault, nevertheless, for his scant regard for etiquette, so much so that, according to Saint-Simon, he was only a very minor king, as kings go, when compared with such monarchs as Philippe de Valois or Charles V), has the most minute instructions drawn up so that Princes of the Blood and Ambassadors may know to what sovereigns they ought to give precedence. In certain cases, in view of the impossibility of arriving at a decision a compromise is arranged by which the son of Louis XIV, Monseigneur, shall entertain certain foreign sovereigns only out of doors, in the open air, so that it may not be said that in entering the house one has preceded the other; and the Elector Palatine, entertaining the Duc de Chevreuse at dinner, pretends, so as not to have to make way for his guest, to be taken ill, and dines with him indeed, but dines lying down, thus avoiding the difficulty. M. le Duc evading opportunities of paying his duty to Monsieur the latter, on the advice of the King, his brother, who is moreover extremely attached to him, seizes an excuse for making his cousin attend his levee and forcing him to pass him his shirt. But as soon as the feeling is deep, when the heart is involved, this rule of duty, so inflexible when politeness only is at stake, changes entirely. A few hours after the death of his brother, one of the people whom he most dearly loved, when Monsieur, in the words of the Duc de Montfort, is \u2018still warm,\u2019 we find Louis XIV singing snatches from operas, astonished that the Duchesse de Bourgogne, who has difficulty in concealing her grief, should be looking so woe-begone, and, desiring that the gaiety of the court shall be at once resumed, so that his courtiers may be encouraged to sit down to the tables, ordering the Duc de Bourgogne to start a game of brelan. Well, not only in his social and concentrated activities, but in the most spontaneous utterances, the ordinary preoccupations of M. de Guermantes, the use he made of his time, one found a similar contrast; the Guermantes were no more susceptible than other mortals to grief; one might indeed say that their actual sensibility was lower; on the other hand one saw their names every day in the social columns of the Gaulois on account of the prodigious number of funerals at which they would have felt it a neglect of duty not to have their presence recorded. As the traveller discovers, almost unaltered, the houses roofed with turf, the terraces which may have met the eyes of Xenophon or Saint Paul, so in the manners of M. de Guermantes, a man who melted one\u2019s heart by his courtesy and revolted it by his harshness, I found still intact after the lapse of more than two centuries that deviation typical of court life under Louis XIV which transfers all scruples of conscience from matters of the affections and morality and applies them to purely formal questions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other reason for the friendliness shewn me by the Princesse de Parme was of a more personal kind. It was that she was convinced beforehand that everything that she saw at the Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019s, people and things alike, was of a quality superior to that of anything that she had at home. It is true that in all the other houses of her acquaintance she behaved as if this had been the case; over the simplest dish, the most ordinary flowers, she was not satisfied with going into ecstasies, she would ask leave to send round next morning, to copy the recipe or to examine the variety of blossom, her head cook or head gardener, gentlemen with large salaries who kept their own carriages and were deeply humiliated at having to come to inquire after a dish they despised or to take notes of a kind of carnation that was not half so fine, had not such ornamental streaks, did not produce so large a blossom as those which they had long been growing for her at home. But if in the Princess, wherever she went, this astonishment at the sight of the most commonplace things was assumed, and intended to shew that she did not derive from the superiority of her rank and riches a pride forbidden by her early instructors, habitually dissembled by her mother and intolerable in the sight of her Creator, it was, on the other hand, in all sincerity that she regarded the drawing-room of the Duchesse de Guermantes as a privileged place in which she could pass only from surprise to delight. To a certain extent, for that matter, though not nearly enough to justify this state of mind, the Guermantes were different from the rest of noble society, they were rarer and more refined. They had given me at first sight the opposite impression; I had found them vulgar, similar to all other men and women, but because before meeting them I had seen in them, as in Balbec, in Florence, in Parma, only names. Evidently, in this drawing-room, all the women whom I had imagined as being like porcelain figures were even more like the great majority of women. But, in the same way as Balbec or Florence, the Guermantes, after first disappointing the imagination because they resembled their fellow-creatures rather than their name, could subsequently, though to a less degree, appeal to the intellect by certain distinctive characteristics. Their bodily structure, the colour \u2014 a peculiar pink that merged at times into violet \u2014 of their skins, a certain almost flashing fairness of the finely spun hair, even in the men, on whom it was massed in soft golden tufts, half a wall-growing lichen, half a catlike fur (a luminous sparkle to which corresponded a certain brilliance of intellect, for if people spoke of the Guermantes complexion, the Guermantes hair, they spoke also of the wit of the Guermantes, as of the wit of the Mortemarts \u2014 a certain social quality whose superior fineness was famed even before the days of Louis XIV and all the more universally recognised since they published the fame of it themselves), all this meant that in the material itself, precious as that might be, in which one found them embedded here and there, the Guermantes remained recognisable, easy to detect and to follow, like the veins whose paleness streaks a block of jasper or onyx, or, better still, like the pliant waving of those tresses of light whose loosened hairs run like flexible rays along the sides of a moss-agate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guermantes \u2014 those at least who were worthy of the name \u2014 were not only of a quality of flesh, of hair, of transparency of gaze that was exquisite, but had a way of holding themselves, of walking, of bowing, of looking at one before they shook one\u2019s hand, of shaking hands, which made them as different in all these respects from an ordinary person in society as he in turn was from a peasant in a smock. And despite their friendliness one asked oneself: \u201cHave they not indeed the right, though they waive it, when they see us walk, bow, leave a room, do any of those things which when performed by them become as graceful as the flight of a swallow or the bending of a rose on its stem, to think: \u2018These people are of another race than ours, and we are, we, the true lords of creation.\u2019?\u201d Later on, I realised that the Guermantes did indeed regard me as being of another race, but one that aroused their envy because I possessed merits of which I knew nothing and which they professed to regard as alone important. Later still I came to feel that this profession of faith was only half sincere and that in them scorn or surprise could be coexistent with admiration and envy The physical flexibility essential to the Guermantes was twofold; thanks to one of its forms, constantly in action, at any moment and if, for example, a male Guermantes were about to salute a lady, he produced a silhouette of himself made from the unstable equilibrium of a series of asymmetrical movements with nervous compensations, one leg dragging a little either on purpose or because, having been broken so often in the hunting-field, it imparted to his trunk in its effort to keep pace with the other a deviation to which the upward thrust of one shoulder gave a counterpoise, while the monocle settled itself before his eye, raising an eyebrow just as the tuft of hair on the forehead was lowered in the formal bow; the other flexibility, like the form of the wave, the wind or the ocean track which is preserved on the shell or the vessel, was so to speak stereotyped in a sort of fixed mobility, curving the arched nose which, beneath the blue, protruding eyes, above the over-thin lips, from which, in the women, there emerged a raucous voice, recalled the fabulous origin attributed in the sixteenth century by the complaisance of parasitic and Hellenising genealogists to his race, ancient beyond dispute, but not to the degree of antiquity which they claimed when they gave as its source the mythological impregnation of a nymph by a divine Bird\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guermantes were just as idiomatic from the intellectual as from the physical point of view. With the exception of Prince Gilbert (the husband with antiquated ideas of \u2018Marie-Gilbert,\u2019 who made his wife sit on his left when they drove out together because her blood, though royal, was inferior to his own)\u2014 but he was an exception and furnished, behind his back, a perpetual laughing-stock to the rest of the family, who had always fresh anecdotes to tell of him \u2014 the Guermantes, while living in the pure cream of aristocracy, affected to take no account of nobility. The theories of the Duchesse de Guermantes, who, to tell the truth, by dint of being a Guermantes, became to a certain extent something different and more attractive, subordinated everything else so completely to intellect, and were in politics so socialistic that one asked oneself where in her mansion could be hiding the familiar spirit whose duty it was to ensure the maintenance of the aristocratic standard of living, and which, always invisible but evidently crouching at one moment in the entrance hall, at another in the drawing-room, at a third in her dressing-room, reminded the servants of this woman who did not believe in titles to address her as Mme. la Duchesse, reminding also herself who cared only for reading and had no respect for persons to go out to dinner with her sister-in-law when eight o\u2019clock struck, and to put on a low gown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same familiar spirit represented to Mme. de Guermantes the social duties of duchesses, of the foremost among them, that was, who like herself were multi-millionaires, the sacrifice to boring tea, dinner and evening parties of hours in which she might have read interesting books, as unpleasant necessities like rain, which Mme. de Guermantes accepted, letting play on them her biting humour, but without seeking in any way to justify her acceptance of them. The curious accident by which the butler of Mme. de Guermantes invariably said \u201cMadame la Duchesse\u201d to this woman who believed only in the intellect did not however appear to shock her. Never had it entered her head to request him to address her simply as \u2018Madame.\u2019 Giving her the utmost benefit of the doubt one might have supposed that, thinking of something else at the time, she had heard only the word \u2018Madame\u2019 and that the suffix appended to it had not caught her attention. Only, though she might feign deafness, she was not dumb. In fact, whenever she had a message to give to her husband she would say to the butler: \u201cRemind Monsieur le Duc \u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The familiar spirit had other occupations as well, one of which was to inspire them to talk morality. It is true that there were Guermantes who went in for intellect and Guermantes who went in for morals, and that these two classes did not as a rule coincide. But the former kind \u2014 including a Guermantes who had forged cheques, who cheated at cards and was the most delightful of them all, with a mind open to every new and sound idea \u2014 spoke even more eloquently upon morals than the others, and in the same strain as Mme. de Villeparisis, at the moments in which the familiar spirit expressed itself through the lips of the old lady. At corresponding moments one saw the Guermantes adopt suddenly a tone almost as old-ladylike, as genial and (as they themselves had more charm) more touching than that of the Marquise, to say of a servant: \u201cOne feels that she has a thoroughly sound nature, she\u2019s not at all a common girl, she must come of decent parents, she is certainly a girl who has never gone astray.\u201d At such moments the familiar spirit took the form of an intonation. But at times it could be bearing also, the expression on a face, the same in the Duchess as in her grandfather the Marshal, a sort of undefinable convulsion (like that of the Serpent, the genius of the Carthaginian family of Barca) by which my heart had more than once been set throbbing, on my morning walks, when before I had recognised Mme. de Guermantes I felt her eyes fastened upon me from the inside of a little dairy. This familiar spirit had intervened in a situation which was far from immaterial not merely to the Guermantes but to the Courvoisiers, the rival faction of the family and, though of as good blood as the Guermantes (it was, indeed, through his Courvoisier grandmother that the Guermantes explained the obsession which led the Prince de Guermantes always to speak of birth and titles as though those were the only things that mattered), their opposite in every respect. Not only did the Courvoisiers not assign to intelligence the same importance as the Guermantes, they had not the same idea of it. For a Guermantes (even were he a fool) to be intelligent meant to have a sharp tongue, to be capable of saying cutting things, to \u2018get away with it\u2019; but it meant also the capacity to hold one\u2019s own equally in painting, music, architecture, to speak English. The Courvoisiers had formed a less favourable impression of intelligence, and unless one were actually of their world being intelligent was almost tantamount to \u2018having probably murdered one\u2019s father and mother.\u2019 For them intelligence was the sort of burglar\u2019s jemmy by means of which people one did not know from Adam forced the doors of the most reputable drawing-rooms, and it was common knowledge among the Courvoisiers that you always had to pay in the long run for having \u2018those sort\u2019 of people in your house. To the most trivial statements made by intelligent people who were not \u2018in society\u2019 the Courvoisiers opposed a systematic distrust. Some one having on one occasion remarked: \u201cBut Swann is younger than Palam\u00e8de,\u201d\u2014\u201cHe says so, at any rate, and if he says it you may be sure it\u2019s because he thinks it is to his interest!\u201d had been Mme. de Gallardon\u2019s retort. Better still, when some one said of two highly distinguished foreigners whom the Guermantes had entertained that one of them had been sent in first because she was the elder: \u201cBut is she really the elder?\u201d Mme. de Gallardon had inquired, not positively as though that sort of person did not have any age but as if presumably devoid of civil or religious status, of definite traditions, they were both more or less young, like two kittens of the same litter between which only a veterinary surgeon was competent to decide. The Courvoisiers, more than the Guermantes, maintained also in a certain sense the integrity of the titled class thanks at once to the narrowness of their minds and the bitterness of their hearts. Just as the Guermantes (for whom, below the royal families and a few others like the Lignes, the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles and so forth, all the rest were lost in a common rubbish-heap) were insolent towards various people of long descent who lived round Guermantes, simply because they paid no attention to those secondary distinctions by which the Courvoisiers were enormously impressed, so the absence of such distinctions affected them little. Certain women who did not hold any specially exalted rank in their native provinces but, brilliantly married, rich, good-looking, beloved of Duchesses, were for Paris, where people are never very well up in who one\u2019s \u2018father and mother\u2019 were, an excellent and exclusive piece of \u2018imported goods.\u2019 It might happen, though not commonly, that such women were, through the channel of the Princesse de Parme or by virtue of their own attractions, received by certain Guermantes. But with regard to these the indignation of the Courvoisiers knew no bounds. Having to meet, between five and six in the afternoon, at their cousin\u2019s, people with whose relatives their own relatives did not care to be seen mixing down in the Perche became for them an ever-increasing source of rage and an inexhaustible fount of rhetoric. The moment, for instance, when the charming Comtesse G\u2014\u2014-entered the Guermantes drawing-room, the face of Mme. de Villebon assumed exactly the expression that would have befitted it had she been called to recite the line:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And should but one stand fast, that one were surely I\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a line which for that matter was unknown to her. This Courvoisier had consumed almost every Monday an \u00e9clair stuffed with cream within a few feet of the Comtesse G\u2014 \u2014 but to no consequence. And Mme. de Villebon confessed in secret that she could not conceive how her cousin Guermantes could allow a woman into her house who was not even in the second-best society of Ch\u00e2teaudun. \u201cI really fail to see why my cousin should make such a fuss about whom she knows; it\u2019s making a perfect farce of society!\u201d concluded Mme. de Villebon with a change of facial expression, this time a sly smile of despair, which, in a charade, would have been interpreted rather as indicating another line of poetry, though one with which she was no more familiar than with the first:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gr\u00e2ce aux Dieux mon malheur passe mon esp\u00e9rance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We may here anticipate events to explain that the pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance, (which rhymes, in the following line with esp\u00e9rance) shewn by Mme. de Villebon in snubbing Mme. G\u2014\u2014-was not entirely wasted. In the eyes of Mme. G\u2014\u2014\u2014 it invested Mme. de Villebon with a distinction so supreme, though purely imaginary, that when the time came for Mme. G\u2014\u2014-\u2018s daughter, who was the prettiest girl and the greatest heiress in the ballrooms of that season, to marry, people were astonished to see her refuse all the Dukes in succession. The fact was that her mother, remembering the weekly humiliations she had had to endure in the Rue de Grenelle on account of Chateaudun could think of only one possible husband for her daughter \u2014 a Villebon son\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A single point at which Guermantes and Courvoisiers converged was the art (one, for that matter, of infinite variety) of marking distances. The Guermantes manners were not absolutely uniform towards everyone. And yet, to take an example, all the Guermantes, all those who really were Guermantes, when you were introduced to them proceeded to perform a sort of ceremony almost as though the fact that they held out their hands to you had been as important as the conferring of an order of knighthood. At the moment when a Guermantes, were he no more than twenty, but treading already in the footsteps of his ancestors, heard your name uttered by the person who introduced you, he let fall on you as though he had by no means made up his mind to say \u201cHow d\u2019ye do?\u201d a gaze generally blue, always of the coldness of a steel blade which he seemed ready to plunge into the deepest recesses of your heart. Which was a matter of fact what the Guermantes imagined themselves to be doing, each of them regarding himself as a psychologist of the highest order. They thought moreover that they increased by this inspection the affability of the salute which was to follow it, and would not be rendered you without full knowledge of your deserts. All this occurred at a distance from yourself which, little enough had it been a question of a passage of arms, seemed immense for a handclasp, and had as chilling an effect in this connexion as in the other, so that when the Guermantes, after a rapid twisting thrust that explored the most intimate secrets of your soul and laid bare your title to honour, had deemed you worthy to associate with him thereafter, his hand, directed towards you at the end of an arm stretched out to its fullest extent, appeared to be presenting a rapier at you for a single combat, and that hand was in fact placed so far in advance of the Guermantes himself at that moment that when he afterwards bowed his head it was difficult to distinguish whether it was yourself or his own hand that he was saluting. Certain Guermantes, lacking the sense of proportion, or being incapable of refraining from repeating themselves incessantly, went further and repeated this ceremony afresh every time that they met you. Seeing that they had no longer any need to conduct the preliminary psychological investigation for which the \u2018familiar spirit\u2019 had delegated its powers to them and the result of which they had presumably kept in mind, the insistence of the perforating gaze preceding the handclasp could be explained only by the automatism which their gaze had acquired or by some power of fascination which they believed themselves to possess. The Courvoisiers whose physique was different, had tried in vain to assimilate that searching gaze and had had to fall back upon a lordly stiffness or a rapid indifference On the other hand, it was from the Courvoisiers that certain very exceptional Guermantes of the gentler sex seemed to have borrowed the feminine form of greeting. At the moment when you were presented to one of these she made you a sweeping bow in which she carried towards you, almost to an angle of forty-five degrees, her head and bust, the rest of her body (which came very high, up to the belt which formed a pivot) remaining stationary. But no sooner had she projected thus towards you the upper part of her person than she flung it backwards beyond the vertical line by a sudden retirement through almost the same angle. This subsequent withdrawal neutralised what appeared to have been conceded to you; the ground which you believed yourself to have gained did not even remain a conquest, as in a duel; the original positions were retained. This same annulment of affability by the resumption of distance (which was Courvoisier in origin and intended to shew that the advances made in the first movement were no more than a momentary feint) displayed itself equally clearly, in the Courvoisier ladies as in the Guermantes, in the letters which you received from them, at any rate in the first period of your acquaintance. The \u2018body\u2019 of the letter might contain sentences such as one writes only (you would suppose) to a friend, but in vain might you have thought yourself entitled to boast of being in that relation to the lady, since the letter began with \u2018Monsieur,\u2019 and ended with \u2018Croyez monsieur \u00e0 mes sentiments distingu\u00e9s.\u2019 After which, between this cold opening and frigid conclusion which altered the meaning of all the rest, there might come in succession (were it a reply to a letter of condolence from yourself) the most touching pictures of the grief which the Guermantes lady had felt on losing her sister, of the intimacy that had existed between them, of the beauty of the place in which she was staying, of the consolation that she found in the charm of her young children, all this amounted to no more than a letter such as one finds in printed collections, the intimate character of which implied, however, no more intimacy between yourself and the writer than if she had been the Younger Pliny or Mme. de Simiane\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that certain Guermantes ladies wrote to you from the first as \u2018My dear friend,\u2019 or \u2018My friends\u2019; these were not always the most simple natured among them, but rather those who, living only in the society of kings and being at the same time \u2018light,\u2019 assumed in their pride the certainty that everything which came from themselves gave pleasure and in their corruption the habit of setting no price upon any of the satisfactions that they had to offer. However, since to have had a common ancestor in the reign of Louis XIII was enough to make a young Guermantes say, in speaking of the Marquise de Guermantes: \u201cMy aunt Adam,\u201d the Guermantes were so numerous a clan that, even among these simple rites, that for example of the bow upon introduction to a stranger, there existed a wide divergence. Each subsection of any refinement had its own, which was handed down from parents to children like the prescription for a liniment or a special way of making jam. Thus it was that we saw Saint-Loup\u2019s handclasp thrust out as though involuntarily at the moment of his hearing one\u2019s name, without any participation by his eyes, without the addition of a bow. Any unfortunate commoner who for a particular reason \u2014 which, for that matter, very rarely occurred \u2014 was presented to anyone of the Saint-Loup subsection racked his brains over this abrupt minimum of a greeting, which deliberately assumed the appearance of non-recognition, to discover what in the world the Guermantes \u2014 male or female \u2014 could have against him. And he was highly surprised to learn that the said Guermantes had thought fit to write specially to the introducer to tell him how delighted he or she had been with the stranger, \u2022 whom he or she looked forward to meeting again. As specialised as the mechanical gestures of Saint-Loup were the complicated and rapid capers (which M. de Charlus condemned as ridiculous) of the Marquis de Fierbois, the grave and measured paces of the Prince de Guermantes. But it is impossible to describe here the richness of the choreography of the Guermantes ballet owing to the sheer length of the cast\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to the antipathy which animated the Courvoisiers against the Duchesse de Guermantes, they might have had the consolation of feeling sorry for her so long as she was still unmarried, for she was then comparatively poor. Unfortunately, at all times and seasons, a sort of fuliginous emanation, quite sut generis, enveloped, hid from the eye the wealth of the Courvoisiers which, however great it might be, remained obscure. In vain might a young Courvoisier with an ample dowry find a most eligible bridegroom; it invariably happened that the young couple had no house of their own in Paris, \u2018came up to stay\u2019 in the season with his parents, and for the rest of the year lived down in the country in the thick of a society that may have been unadulterated but was also quite undistinguished. Whereas a Saint-Loup who was up to the eyes in debt dazzled Donci\u00e8res with his carriage-horses, a Courvoisier who was extremely rich always went in the tram. Similarly (though of course many years earlier) Mlle, de Guermantes (Oriane), who had scarcely a penny to her name, created more stir with her clothes than all the Courvoisiers put together. The really scandalous things she said gave a sort of advertisement to her style of dressing and doing her hair. She had had the audacity to say to the Russian Grand Duke: \u201cWell, Sir, I hear you would like to have Tolstoy murdered?\u201d at a dinner-party to which none of the Courvoisiers, not that any of them knew very much about Tolstoy, had been asked. They knew little more about Greek writers, if we may judge by the Dowager Duchesse de Gallardon (mother-in-law of the Princesse de Gallardon who at that time was still a girl) who, not having been honoured by Oriane with a single visit in five years, replied to some one who asked her the reason for this abstention: \u201cIt seems she recites Aristotle\u201d (meaning Aristophanes) \u201cin society. I cannot allow that sort of thing in my house!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One can imagine how greatly this \u2018sally\u2019 by Mlle. de Guermantes upon Tolstoy, if it enraged the Courvoisiers, delighted the Guermantes, and by derivation everyone who was not merely closely but even remotely attached to them. The Dowager Comtesse d\u2019Argencourt (n\u00e9e Seineport) who entertained a little of everything, because she was a blue-stocking and in spite of her son\u2019s being a terrible snob, repeated the saying before her literary friends with the comment: \u201cOriane de Guermantes, you know; she\u2019s as fine as amber, as mischievous as a monkey, there\u2019s nothing she couldn\u2019t do if she chose, her water-colours are worthy of a great painter and she writes better verses than most of the great poets, and as for family, don\u2019t you know, you couldn\u2019t imagine anything better, her grandmother was Mlle, de Montpensier, and she is the eighteenth Oriane de Guermantes in succession, without a single misalliance; it\u2019s the purest blood, the oldest in the whole of France.\u201d And so the sham men of letters, those demi-intellectuals who went to Mme. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s, forming a mental picture of Oriane de Guermantes, whom they would never have an opportunity to know personally, as something more wonderful and more extraordinary than Princess Badroulbadour, not only felt themselves ready to die for her on learning that so noble a person glorified Tolstoy above all others, but felt also quickening with a fresh strength in their minds their own love of Tolstoy, their longing to fight against Tsarism. These liberal ideas might have grown faint in them, they might have begun to doubt their importance, no longer venturing to confess to holding them, when suddenly from Mlle, de Guermantes herself, that is to say from a girl so indisputably cultured and authorised to speak, who wore her hair flat on her brow (a thing that no Courvoisier would ever have consented to do), came this vehement support. A certain number of realities, good or bad in themselves, gain enormously in this way by receiving the adhesion of people who are in authority over us. For instance among the Courvoisiers the rites of affability in a public thoroughfare consisted in a certain bow, very ugly and far from affable in itself but which people knew to be the distinguished way of bidding a person good day, with the result that everyone else, suppressing the instinctive smile of welcome on his own face, endeavoured to imitate these frigid gymnastics. But the Guermantes in general and Oriane in particular, while better conversant than anyone with these rites, did not hesitate, if they caught sight of you from a carriage, to greet you with a sprightly wave of the hand, and in a drawing-room, leaving the Courvoisiers to make their stiff and imitative bows, sketched charming reverences in the air, held out their hands as though to a comrade with a smile from their blue eyes, so that suddenly, thanks to the Guermantes, there entered into the substance of smartness, until then a little hollow and dry, everything that you would naturally have liked and had compelled yourself to forego, a genuine welcome, the effusion of a true friendliness, spontaneity. It is in a similar fashion (but by a rehabilitation which this time is scarcely justified) that people who carry in themselves an instinctive taste for bad music and for melodies, however commonplace, which have in them something easy and caressing, succeed, by dint of education in symphonic culture, in mortifying that appetite. But once they have arrived at this point, when, dazzled \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 by the brilliant orchestral colouring of Richard Strauss, they see that musician adopt with an indulgence worthy of Auber the most vulgar motifs, what those people originally admired finds suddenly in so high an authority a justification which delights them, and they let themselves be enchanted without scruple and with a twofold gratitude, when they listen to Salom\u00e9, by what it would have been impossible for them to admire in Les Diamants de la Couronne. Authentic or not, the retort made by Mlle, de Guermantes to the Grand Duke, retailed from house to house, furnished an opportunity to relate the excessive smartness with which Oriane had been turned out at the dinner-party in question. But if such splendour (and this is precisely what rendered it unattainable by the Courvoisiers) springs not from wealth but from prodigality, the latter does nevertheless last longer if it enjoys the constant support of the former, which allows it to spend all its fire. Given the principles openly advertised not. only by Oriane but by Mlle, de Villeparisis, namely that nobility does not count, that it is ridiculous to bother one\u2019s head about rank, that wealth does not necessarily mean happiness, that intellect, heart, talent are alone of importance, the Courvoisiers were justified in hoping that, as a result of the training she had received from the Marquise, Oriane would marry some one who was not in society, an artist, a fugitive from justice, a scallawag, a free-thinker, that she would pass definitely into the category of what the Courvoisiers called \u2018detrimentals.\u2019 They were all the more justified in this hope since, inasmuch as Mme. de Villeparisis was at this very moment, from the social point of view, passing through an awkward crisis (none of the few bright stars whom I was to meet in her drawing-room had as yet reappeared there), she professed an intense horror of the society which was thus holding her aloof. Even when she referred to her nephew the Prince de Guermantes, whom she did still see, she could never make an end of mocking at him because he was so infatuated about his pedigree. But the moment it became a question of finding a husband for Oriane, it had been no longer the principles publicly advertised by aunt and niece that had controlled the operations, it had been the mysterious \u2018familiar spirit\u2019 of their race. As unerringly as if Mme. de Villeparisis and Oriane had never spoken of anything but rent-rolls and pedigrees in place of literary merit and depth of character, and as if the Marquise, for the space of a few days, had been \u2014 as she would ultimately be \u2014 dead and on her bier, in the church of Combray, where each member of the family would be reduced to a mere Guermantes, with a forfeiture of individuality and baptismal names to which there testified on the voluminous black drapery of the pall the single \u2018G\u2019 in purple surmounted by the ducal coronet, it was on the wealthiest man and the most nobly born, on the most eligible bachelor of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, on the eldest son of the Duc de Guermantes, the Prince des Laumes, that the familiar spirit had let fall the choice of the intellectual, the critical, the evangelical Mme. de Villeparisis. And for a couple of hours, on the day of the wedding, Mme. de Villeparisis received in her drawing-room all the noble persons at whom she had been in the habit of sneering, at whom she indeed sneered still to the various plebeian intimates whom she had invited and on whom the Prince des Laumes promptly left cards, preparatory to \u2018cutting the cable\u2019 in the following year. And then, making the Courvoisiers\u2019 cup of bit terness overflow, the same old maxims, which made out intellect and talent to be the sole claims to social pre-eminence, resumed their doctrinal fore in the household of the Princesse des Laumes immediately after her mar riage. And in this respect, be it said in passing, the point of view which Saint-Loup upheld when he lived with Rachel, frequented the friends of Rachel, would have liked to marry Rachel, implied \u2014 whatever the horror that it inspired in the family \u2014 less falsehood than that of the Guermantes young ladies in general, preaching the virtues of intellect, barely admitting the possibility of anyone\u2019s questioning the equality of mankind, all of which ended at a given point in the same result as if they had professed the opposite principles, that is to say in marriage to an extremely wealthy duke. Saint-Loup did, on the contrary, act in conformity with his theories which led people to say that he was treading in evil ways. Certainly from the moral standpoint Rachel was not altogether satisfactory. But it is by no means certain whether, if she had been some person no more worthy but a duchess or the heiress to many millions, Mme. de Marsantes would not have been in favour of the match\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, to return to Mme. des Laumes (shortly afterwards Duchesse de Guermantes, on the death of her father-in-law), it was the last agonising straw upon the backs of the Courvoisiers that the theories of the young Princess, remaining thus lodged in her speech, should not in any sense be guiding her conduct; with the result that this philosophy (if one may so call it) in no way impaired the aristocratic smartness of the Guermantes drawing-room. No doubt all the people whom Mme. de Guermantes did not invite imagined that it was because they were not clever enough, and some rich American lady who had never had any book in her possession except a little old copy, never opened, of Parny\u2019s poems, arranged because it was of the \u2018period\u2019 upon one of the tables in her inner room, shewed how much importance she attached to the things of the mind by the devouring gaze which she fastened on the Duchesse de Guermantes when that lady made her appearance at the Opera. No doubt, also, Mme. de Guermantes was sincere when she selected a person on account of his or her intellect. When she said of a woman: \u201cIt appears, she\u2019s quite charming!\u201d or of a man that he was the \u201ccleverest person in the world,\u201d she imagined herself to have no other reason for consenting to receive them than this charm or cleverness, the familiar spirit not interposing itself at this last moment; more deeply rooted, stationed at the obscure entry of the region in which the Guermantes exercised their judgment, this vigilant spirit precluded them from finding the man clever or the woman charming if they had no social value, actual or potential. The man was pronounced learned, but like a dictionary, or, on the contrary, common, with the mind of a commercial traveller, the woman pretty, but with a terribly bad style, or too talkative. As for the people who had no definite position, they were simply dreadful \u2014 such snobs! M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, whose country house was quite close to Guermantes, mixed with no one below the rank of Highness. But he laughed at them in his heart and longed only to spend his days in museums. Accordingly Mme. de Guermantes was indignant when anyone spoke of M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 as a snob. \u201cA snob! Babal! But, my poor friend, you must be mad, it\u2019s just the opposite. He loathes smart people; he won\u2019t let himself be introduced to anyone. Even in my house! If I ask him to meet some one he doesn\u2019t know, he swears at me all the time.\u201d This was not to say that, even in practice, the Guermantes did not adopt an entirely different attitude towards cleverness from the Courvoisiers. In a positive sense, this difference between the Guermantes and the Courvoisiers had begun already to bear very promising fruit. Thus the Duchesse de Guermantes, enveloped moreover in a mystery which had set so many poets dreaming of her at a respectful distance, had given that party to which I have already referred, at which the King of England had enjoyed himself more thoroughly than anywhere else, for she had had the idea, which would never have occurred to a Courvoisier mind, of inviting, and the audacity, from which a Courvoisier courage would have recoiled, to invite, apart from the personages already mentioned, the musician Gaston Lemaire and the dramatist Grandmougin. But it was pre-eminently from the negative point of view that intellectuality made itself felt. If the necessary coefficient of cleverness and charm declined steadily as the rank of the person who sought an invitation from the Princesse des Laumes became more exalted, vanishing into zero when he or she was one of the principal Crowned Heads of Europe, conversely the farther they fell below this royal level the higher the coefficient rose. For instance at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s parties there were a number of people whom her Royal Highness invited because she had known them as children, or because they were related to some duchess, or attached to the person of some Sovereign, they themselves being quite possibly ugly, boring or stupid; well, with a Courvoisier any of the reasons: \u201ca favourite of the Princesse de Parme,\u201d \u201ca niece on the mother\u2019s side of the Duchesse d\u2019Arpajon,\u201d \u201cspends three months every year with the Queen of Spain,\u201d would have been sufficient to make her invite such people to her house, but Mme. de Guermantes, who had politely acknowledged their bows for ten years at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s, had never once allowed them to cross her threshold, considering that the same rule applied to a drawing-room in a social as in a material sense, where it only needed a few pieces of furniture which had no particular beauty but were left there to fill the room and as a sign of the owner\u2019s wealth, to render it hideous. Such a drawing-room resembled a book in which the author could not refrain from the use of language advertising his own learning, brilliance, fluency. Like a book, like a house, the quality of a \u2018salon,\u2019 thought Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 and rightly \u2014 is based on the corner-stone of sacrifice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of the friends of the Princesse de Parme, with whom the Duchesse de Guermantes had confined herself for years past to the same conventional greeting, or to returning their cards, without ever inviting them to her parties or going to theirs, complained discreetly of these omissions to her Highness who, on days when M. de Guermantes came by himself to see her, passed on a hint to him. But the wily nobleman, a bad husband to the Duchess in so far as he kept mistresses, but her most tried and trusty friend in everything that concerned the good order of her drawing-room (and her own wit, which formed its chief attraction), replied: \u201cBut doe my wife know her? Indeed! Oh, well, I daresay she does. But the truth is, Ma\u2019am, that Oriane does not care for women\u2019s conversation. She lives surrounded by a court of superior minds \u2014 I am not her husband, I am only the first footman. Except for quite a small number, who are all of them very clever indeed, women bore her. Surely, Ma\u2019am, your Highness with all her fine judgment is not going to tell me that the Marquise de Souvr\u00e9 has any brains. Yes, I quite understand, the Princess receives her out of kindness. Besides, your Highness knows her. You tell me that Oriane has met her; it is quite possible, but once or twice at the most I assure you. And then, I must explain to your Highness, it is really a little my fault as well. My wife is very easily tired, and she is so anxious to be friendly always that if I allowed her she would never stop going to see people. Only yesterday evening she had a temperature, she was afraid of hurting the Duchesse de Bourbon\u2019s feelings by not going to see her. I had to shew my teeth, I assure you; I positively forbade them to bring the carriage round. Do you know, Ma\u2019am, I should really prefer not to mention to Oriane that you have spoken to me about Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. My wife is so devoted to your Highness, she will go round at once to invite Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 to the house; that will mean another call to be paid, it will oblige us to make friends with the sister, whose husband I know quite well. I think I shall say nothing at all about it to Oriane, if the Princess has no objection. That will save her a great deal of strain and excitement. And I assure you that it will be no loss to Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. She goes everywhere, moves in the most brilliant circles. You know, we don\u2019t entertain at all, really, just a few little friendly dinners, Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 would be bored to death.\u201d The Princesse de Parme, innocently convinced that the Duc de Guermantes would not transmit her request to his Duchess, and dismayed by her failure to procure the invitation that Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 sought, was all the more flattered to think that she herself was one of the regular frequenters of so exclusive a household. No doubt this satisfaction had its drawbacks also. Thus whenever the Princesse de Parme invited Mme. de Guermantes to her own parties she had to rack her brains to be sure that there was no one else on her list whose presence might offend the Duchess and make her refuse to come again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On ordinary evenings (after dinner, at which she invariably entertained at a very early hour, for she clung to old customs, a small party) the drawing-room of the Princesse de Parme was thrown open to her regular guests, and, generally speaking, to all the higher ranks of the aristocracy, French and foreign. The order of her receptions was as follows: on issuing from the dining-room the Princess sat down on a sofa before a large round table and chatted with the two most important of the ladies who had dined with her, or else cast her eyes over a magazine, or sometimes played cards (or pretended to play, adopting a German court custom), either a game of patience by herself or selecting as her real or pretended partner some prominent personage. By nine o\u2019clock the double doors of the big drawing-room were in a state of perpetual agitation, opening and shutting and opening again to admit the visitors who had dined quietly at home (or if they had dined in town hurried from their caf\u00e9 promising to return later, since they intended only to go in at one door and out at the other) in order to conform with the Princess\u2019s time-table. She, meanwhile, her mind fixed on her game or conversation, made a show of not seeing the new arrivals, and it was not until they were actually within reach of her that she rose graciously from her seat, with a friendly smile for the women. The latter thereupon sank before the upright Presence in a courtesy which was tantamount to a genuflexion, so as to bring their lips down to the level of the beautiful hand which hung very low, and to kiss it. But at that moment the Princess, just as if she had been every time surprised by a formality with which nevertheless she was perfectly familiar, raised the kneeling figure as though by main force, and with incomparable grace and sweetness, and kissed her on both cheeks. A grace and sweetness that were conditional, you may say, upon the meekness with which the arriving guest inclined her knee. Very likely; and it seems that in a society without distinctions of rank politeness would vanish, not, as is generally supposed, from want of breeding, but because from one class would have vanished the deference due to a distinction which must be imaginary to be effective, and, more completely still, from the other class the affability in the distribution of which one is prodigal so long as one knows it to be, to the recipient, of an untold value which, in a world based on equality, would at once fall to nothing like everything that has only a promissory worth. But this disappearance of politeness in a reconstructed society is by no means certain, and we are at times too ready to believe that the present is the only possible state of things. People of first-rate intelligence have held the opinion that a Republic could not have any diplomacy or foreign alliances, and, more recently, that the peasant class would not tolerate the separation of Church and State. After all, the survival of politeness in a society levelled to uniformity would be no more miraculous than the practical success of the railway or the use of the aeroplane in war. Besides, even if politeness were to vanish, there is nothing to shew that this would be a misfortune. Lastly, would not society become secretly more hierarchical as it became outwardly more democratic? This seems highly probable. The political power of the Popes has grown enormously since they ceased to possess either States or an Army; our cathedrals meant far less to a devout Catholic of the seventeenth century than they mean to an atheist of the twentieth, and if the Princesse de Parme had been the sovereign ruler of a State, no doubt I should have felt myself impelled to speak of her almost as I should speak of a President of the Republic, that is to say not at all\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as the postulant had been raised from the ground and embraced by the Princess, the latter resumed her seat and returned to her game of patience, but first of all, if the newcomer were of any importance, held her for a moment in conversation, making her sit down in an armchair\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the room became too crowded the lady in waiting who had to control the traffic cleared the floor by leading the regular guests into an immense hall on to which the drawing-room opened, a hall filled with portraits and minor trophies of the House of Bourbon. The intimate friends of the Princess would then volunteer for the part of guide and would repeat interesting anecdotes, to which the young people had not the patience to listen, more interested in the spectacle of living Royalties (with the possibility of having themselves presented to them by the lady in waiting and the maids of honour) than in examining the relics of dead Sovereigns. Too much occupied with the acquaintances which they would be able to form and the invitations it might perhaps be possible to secure, they knew absolutely nothing, even in after-years, of what there was in this priceless museum of the archives of the Monarchy, and could only recall confusedly that it was decorated with cacti and giant palms which gave this centre of social elegance a look of the palmarium in the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Naturally the Duchesse de Guermantes, by way of self-mortification, did occasionally appear on these evenings to pay an \u2018after dinner\u2019 call on the Princess, who kept her all the time by her side, while she rallied the Duke. But on evenings when the Duchess came to dine, the Princess took care not to invite her regular party, and closed her doors to the world on rising from table, for fear lest a too liberal selection of guests might offend the exacting Duchess. On such evenings, were any of the faithful who had not received warning to present themselves on the royal doorstep, they would be informed by the porter: \u201cHer Royal Highness is not at home this evening,\u201d and would turn away. But, long before this, many of the Princess\u2019s friends had known that, on the day in question, they would not be asked to her house. These were a special set of parties, a privilege barred to so many who must have longed for admission. The excluded could, with a practical certainty, enumerate the roll of the elect, and would say irritably among themselves: \u201cYou know, of course, that Oriane de Guermantes never goes anywhere without her entire staff.\u201d With the help of this body the Princesse de Parme sought to surround the Duchess as with a protecting rampart against those persons the chance of whose making a good impression on her was at all doubtful. But with several of the Duchess\u2019s favourites, with several members of this glittering \u2018staff,\u2019 the Princesse de Parme resented having to go out of her way to shew them attentions, seeing that they paid little or no attention to herself. No doubt the Princess was fully prepared to admit that it was possible to derive more enjoyment in the company of the Duchesse de Guermantes than in her own. She could not deny that there was always a \u2018crush\u2019 on the Duchess\u2019s at-home days, or that she herself often met there three or four royal personages who thought it sufficient to leave their cards upon her. And in vain might she commit to memory Oriane\u2019s witty sayings, copy her gowns, serve at her own tea parties the same strawberry tarts, there were occasions on which she was left by herself all afternoon with a lady in waiting and some foreign Counsellor of Legation. And so whenever (as had been the case with Swann, for instance, at an earlier period) there was anyone who never let a day pass without going to spend an hour or two at the Duchess\u2019s and paid a call once in two years on the Princesse de Parme, the latter felt no great desire, even for the sake of amusing Oriane, to make to this Swann or whoever he was the \u2018advances\u2019 of an invitation to dinner. In a word, having the Duchess in her house was for the Princess a source of endless perplexity, so haunted was she by the fear that Oriane would find fault with everything. But in return, and for the same reason, when the Princesse de Parme came to dine with Mme. de Guermantes she could be certain beforehand that everything would be perfect, delightful, she had only one fear which was that of her own inability to understand, remember, give satisfaction, her inability to assimilate new ideas and people. On this account my presence aroused her attention and excited her cupidity, just as might a new way of decorating the dinner-table with festoons of fruit, uncertain as she was which of the two it might be \u2014 the table decorations or my presence \u2014 that was the more distinctively one of those charms, the secret of the success of Oriane\u2019s parties, and in her uncertainty firmly resolved to try at her own next dinner-party to introduce them both. What for that matter fully justified the enraptured curiosity which the Princesse de Parme brought to the Duchess\u2019s house was that element \u2014 amusing, dangerous, exciting \u2014 into which the Princess used to plunge with a combination of anxiety, shock and delight (as at the seaside on one of those days of \u2018big waves\u2019 of the danger of which the bathing-masters warn us, simply and solely because none of them knows how to swim), from which she used to emerge terrified, happy, rejuvenated, and which was known as the wit of the Guermantes. The wit of the Guermantes \u2014 a thing as non-existent as the squared circle, according to the Duchess who regarded herself as the sole Guermantes to possess it \u2014 was a family reputation like that of the pork pies of Tours or the biscuits of Rheims. No doubt (since an intellectual peculiarity does not employ for its perpetuation the same channels as a shade of hair or complexion) certain intimate friends of the Duchess who were not of her blood were nevertheless endowed with this wit, which on the other hand had failed to permeate the minds of various Guermantes, too refractory to assimilate wit of any kind. The holders, not related to the Duchess, of this Guermantes wit had generally the characteristic feature of having been brilliant men, fitted for a career to which, whether it were in the arts, diplomacy, parliamentary eloquence or the army, they had preferred the life of a small and intimate group. Possibly this preference could be explained by a certain want of originality, of initiative, of will power, of health or of luck, or possibly by snobbishness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With certain people (though these, it must be admitted, were the exception) if the Guermantes drawing-room had been the stumbling-block in their careers, it had been without their knowledge. Thus a doctor, a painter and a diplomat of great promise had failed to achieve success in the careers for which they were nevertheless more brilliantly endowed than most of their competitors because their friendship with the Guermantes had the result that the two former were regarded as men of fashion and the third as a reactionary, which had prevented each of the three from winning the recognition of his colleagues. The mediaeval gown and red cap which are still donned by the electoral colleges of the Faculties are (or were at least, not so long since) something more than a purely outward survival from a narrow-minded past, from a rigid sectarianism. Under the cap with its golden tassels, like the High Priest in the conical mitre of the Jews, the \u2018Professors\u2019 were still, in the years that preceded the Dreyfus case, fast rooted in rigorously pharisaical ideas. Du Boulbon was at heart an artist, but was safe because he did not care for society. Cottard was always at the Verdurins\u2019. But Mme. Verdurin was a patient; besides, he was protected by his vulgarity; finally, at his own house he entertained no one outside the Faculty, at banquets over which there floated an aroma of carbolic. But in powerful corporations, where moreover the rigidity of their prejudices is but the price that must be paid for the noblest integrity, the most lofty conceptions of morality, which weaken in an atmosphere that, more tolerant, freer at first, becomes very soon dissolute, a Professor in his gown of scarlet satin faced with ermine, like that of a Doge (which is to say a Duke) of Venice enshrined in the Ducal Palace, was as virtuous, as deeply attached to noble principles, but as unsparing of any alien element as that other Duke, excellent but terrible, whom we know as M. de Saint-Simon. The alien, here, was the wordly doctor, with other manners, other social relations. To make good, the unfortunate of whom we are now speaking, so as not to be accused by his colleagues of looking down on them (the strange ideas of a man of fashion!) if he concealed from them his Duchesse de Guermantes, hoped to disarm them by giving mixed dinner-parties in which the medical element was merged in the fashionable. He was unaware that in so doing he signed his own death-warrant, or rather he discovered this later, when the Council of Ten had to fill a vacant chair, and it was invariably the name of another doctor, more normal, it might be obviously inferior, that leaped from the fatal urn, when their \u2018Veto\u2019 thundered from the ancient Faculty, as solemn, as absurd and as terrible as the \u2018Juro\u2019 that spelled the death of Moli\u00e8re. So too with the painter permanently labelled man of fashion, when fashionable people who dabbled in art had succeeded in making themselves be labelled artists; so with the diplomat who had too many reactionary associations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this case was the rarest of all. The type of distinguished man who formed the main substance of the Guermantes drawing-room was that of people who had voluntarily (or so at least they supposed) renounced all else, everything that was incompatible with the wit of the Guermantes, with the courtesy of the Guermantes, with that indefinable charm odious to any \u2018Corporation\u2019 however little centralised\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the people who were aware that in days gone by one of these frequenters of the Duchess\u2019s drawing-room had been awarded the gold medal of the Salon, that another, Secretary to the Bar Council, had made a brilliant start in the Chamber, that a third had ably served France as Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, might have been led to regard as \u2018failures\u2019 people who had done nothing more now for twenty years. But there were few who were thus \u2018well-informed,\u2019 and the parties concerned would themselves have been the last to remind people, finding these old distinctions to be now valueless, in the light of this very Guermantes spirit of wit: for did not this condemn respectively as a bore or an usher, and as a counter-jumper a pair of eminent Ministers, one a trifle solemn, the other addicted to puns, of whose praises the newspapers were always full but in whose company Mme. de Guermantes would begin to yawn and shew signs of impatience if the imprudence of a hostess had placed either of them next to her at the dinner-table. Since being a statesman of the first rank was in no sense a recommendation to the Duchess\u2019s favour, those of her friends who had definitely abandoned the \u2018Career\u2019 or the \u2018Service,\u2019 who had never stood for the Chamber, felt, as they came day after day to have luncheon and talk with their great friend, or when they met her in the houses of Royal Personages, of whom for that matter they thought very little (or at least they said so), that they themselves had chosen the better part, albeit their melancholy air, even in the midst of the gaiety, seemed somehow to challenge the soundness of this opinion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recognised also that the refinement of social life, the subtlety of conversation at the Guermantes\u2019 did also contain, exiguous as it may have been, an element of reality. No official title was equivalent to the approval of certain chosen friends of Mme. de Guermantes, whom the most powerful Ministers had been unable to attract to their houses. If in this drawing-room so many intellectual ambitions, such noble efforts even had been for ever buried, still at least from their dust the rarest blossoms of civilised society had taken life. Certainly men of wit, Swann for instance, regarded themselves as superior to men of genuine worth, whom they despised, but that was because what the Duchesse de Guermantes valued above everything else was not intellect; it was, according to her, that superior, more exquisite form of the human intellect exalted to a verbal variety of talent \u2014 wit. And long ago at the Verdurins\u2019 when Swann condemned Brichot and Elstir, one as a pedant and the other as a clown, despite all the learning of one and the other\u2019s genius, it was the infiltration of the Guermantes spirit that had led him to classify them so. Never would he have dared to present either of them to the Duchess, conscious instinctively of the air with which she would have listened to Brichot\u2019s monologues and Elstir\u2019s hair-splittings, the Guermantes spirit regarding pretentious and prolix speech, whether in a serious or a farcical vein, as alike of the most intolerable imbecility\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the Guermantes of the true flesh and blood, if the Guermantes spirit had not absorbed them as completely as we see occur in, to take an example, those literary circles in which everyone shares a common way of pronouncing his words, of expressing his thoughts, and consequently of thinking, it was certainly not because originality is stronger in purely social groups or presents any obstacle there to imitation. But imitation depends not merely upon the absence of any unconquerable originality but also demands a relative fineness of ear which enables one first of all to discern what one is afterwards to imitate. Whereas there were several Guermantes in whom this musical sense was as entirely lacking as in the Courvoisiers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To take as an instance what is called, in another sense of the word imitation, \u2018giving imitations\u2019 (or among the Guermantes was called \u2018taking off\u2019), Mme. de Guermantes might succeed in this to perfection, the Courvoisiers were as incapable of appreciating her as if they had been a tribe of rabbits instead of men and women, because they had never had the sense to observe the particular defect or accent that the Duchess was endeavouring to copy. When she \u2018gave an imitation\u2019 of the Duc de Limoges, the Courvoisiers would protest: \u201cOh, no, he doesn\u2019t really speak like that! I met him again only yesterday at dinner at Bebeth\u2019s; he talked to me all evening and he didn\u2019t speak like that at all!\u201d whereas the Guermantes of any degree of culture exclaimed: \u201cGad, what fun Oriane is! The odd part of it is that when she is copying him she looks exactly like him! I feel I\u2019m listening to him. Oriane, do give us a little more Limoges!\u201d Now these Guermantes (and not necessarily the few really outstanding members of the clan who when the Duchess imitated the Duc de Limoges, would say admiringly\u2019 \u201cOh, you really have got him,\u201d or \u201cYou do get him,\u201d) might indeed be del void of wit according to Mme. de Guermantes (and in this respect she was right); yet, by dint of hearing and repeating her sayings they had come to imitate more or less her way of expressing herself, of criticising people of what Swann, like the Duke himself, used to call her \u2018phrasing\u2019 of things so that they presented in their conversation something which to the Courvoisiers appeared \u2018fearfully like\u2019 Oriane\u2019s wit and was treated by them collectively as the \u2018wit of the Guermantes.\u2019 As these Guermantes were to her not merely kinsfolk but admirers, Oriane (who kept the rest of the family rigorously at arm\u2019s-length and now avenged by her disdain the insults that they had heaped upon her in her girlhood) went to call on them now and then, generally in company with the Duke, in the season, when she drove out with him. These visits were historic events. The heart began to beat more rapidly in the bosom of the Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who was \u2018at home\u2019 in her big drawing-room on the ground floor, when she perceived afar off, like the first glow of an innocuous fire, or the \u2018reconnaissances\u2019 of an unexpected invasion, making her way across the courtyard slowly, in a diagonal course, the Duchess crowned with a ravishing hat and holding atilt a sunshade from which there rained down a summer fragrance. \u201cWhy, here comes Oriane,\u201d she would say, like an \u2018On guard!\u2019 intended to convey a prudent warning to her visitors, so that they should have time to beat an orderly retreat, to clear the rooms without panic. Half of those present dared not remain, and rose at once to go. \u201cBut no, why? Sit down again, I insist on keeping you a little longer,\u201d said the Princess in a careless tone and seemingly at her ease (to shew herself the great lady) but in a voice that suddenly rang false. \u201cBut you may want to talk to each other.\u201d \u201cReally, you\u2019re in a hurry? Oh, very well, I shall come and see you,\u201d replied the lady of the house to those whom she was just as well pleased to see depart. The Duke and Duchess gave a very civil greeting to people whom they had seen there regularly for years, without for that reason coming to know them any better, while these in return barely said good day to them, thinking this more discreet. Scarcely had they left the room before the Duke began asking good-naturedly who they were, so as to appear to be taking an interest in the intrinsic quality of people whom he himself, owing to the cross-purposes of fate or the wretched state of Oriane\u2019s nerves, never saw in his own house. \u201cTell me, who was that little woman in the pink hat?\u201d \u201cWhy, my dear cousin, you have seen her hundreds of times, she\u2019s the Vicomtesse de Tours, who was a Lamarzelle.\u201d \u201cBut, do you know, she\u2019s quite good-looking; she seems clever too; if it weren\u2019t for a little flaw in her upper lip she\u2019d be a regular charmer. If there\u2019s a Vicomte de Tours, he can\u2019t have any too bad a time. Oriane, do you know what those eyebrows and the way her hair grows reminded me of? Your cousin Hedwige de Ligne.\u201d The Duchesse de Guermantes, who languished whenever people spoke of the beauty of any woman other than herself, let the conversation drop. She bad reckoned without the weakness her husband had for letting it be seen that he knew all about the people who did not come to his house, whereby be believed that he shewed himself to be more seriously minded than his wife. \u2018\u201cBut,\u201d he resumed suddenly with emphasis, \u201cyou mentioned the name Lamarzelle. I remember, when I was in the Chamber, hearing a really remarkable speech made . . . \u201d \u201cThat was the uncle of the young woman you saw just now.\u201d \u201cIndeed! What talent! No, my dear girl,\u201d he assured the Vicomtesse d\u2019Egremont, whom Mme. de Guermantes could not endure, but who, refusing to stir from the Princesse d\u2019Epinay\u2019s drawing-room where she willingly humbled herself to play the part of parlour-maid (and was ready to slap her own parlour-maid on returning home), stayed there, confused, tearful, but stayed when the ducal couple were in the room, took their cloaks, tried to make herself useful, offered discreetly to withdraw into the next room, \u201cyou are not to make tea for us, let us just sit and talk quietly, we are simple souls, really, honestly. Besides,\u201d he went on, turning to the Princesse d\u2019Epinay (leaving the Egremont lady blushing, humble, ambitious and full of zeal), \u201cwe can only give you a quarter of an hour.\u201d This quarter of an hour was entirely taken up with a sort of exhibition of the witty things which the Duchess had said during the previous week, and to which she herself would certainly not have referred had not her husband, with great adroitness, by appearing to be rebuking her with reference to the incidents that had provoked them, obliged her as though against her will to repeat them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who was fond of her cousin and knew that she had a weakness for compliments, went into ecstasies over her hat, her sunshade, her wit. \u201cTalk to her as much as you like about her clothes,\u201d said the Duke in the sullen tone which he had adopted and now tempered with a sardonic smile so that his resentment should not be taken seriously, \u201cbut for heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t speak of her wit, I should be only too glad not to have so witty a wife. You are probably alluding to the shocking pun she made about my brother Palam\u00e8de,\u201d he went on, knowing quite well that the Princess and the rest of the family had not yet heard this pun, and delighted to have an opportunity of shewing off his wife. \u201cIn the first place I consider it unworthy of a person who has occasionally, I must admit, said some quite good things, to make bad puns, but especially about my brother, who is very susceptible, and if it is going to lead to his quarrelling with me, that would really be too much of a good thing.\u201d \u201cBut we never heard a word about it! One of Oriane\u2019s puns! It\u2019s sure to be delicious. Oh, do tell us!\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d the Duke went on, still sulking though with a broader smile, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you haven\u2019t heard it. Seriously, I\u2019m very fond of my brother.\u201d \u201cListen, Basin,\u201d broke in the Duchess, the moment having come for her to take up her husband\u2019s cue, \u201cI can\u2019t think why you should say that it might annoy Palam\u00e8de, you know quite well it would do nothing of the sort. He is far too intelligent to be vexed by a stupid joke which has nothing offensive about it. You are making them think I said something nasty; I simply uttered a remark which was not in the least funny, it is you who make it seem important by losing your temper over it. I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d \u201cYou are making us terribly excited, what is it all about?\u201d \u201cOh, obviously nothing serious!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes. \u201cYou may have heard that my brother offered to give Br\u00e9z\u00e9, the place he got from his wife, to his sister Marsantes.\u201d \u201cYes, but we were told that she didn\u2019t want it, she didn\u2019t care for that part of the country, the climate didn\u2019t suit her.\u201d \u201cVery well, some one had been telling my wife all that and saying that if my brother was giving this place to our sister it was not so much to please her as to tease her. \u2018He\u2019s such a teaser, Charlus,\u2019 was what they actually said. Well, you know Br\u00e9z\u00e9, it\u2019s a royal domain, I should say it\u2019s worth millions, it used to be part of the crown lands, it includes one of the finest forests in the whole of France. There are plenty of people who would be only too delighted to be teased to that tune. And so when she heard the word \u2018teaser\u2019 applied to Charlus because he was giving away such a magnificent property, Oriane could not help exclaiming, without meaning anything, I must admit, there wasn\u2019t a trace of ill-nature about it, for it came like a flash of lightning: \u2018Teaser, teaser? Then he must be Teaser Augustus.\u2019 You understand,\u201d he went on, resuming his sulky tone, having first cast a sweeping glance round the room in order to judge the effect of his wife\u2019s witticism \u2014 and in some doubt as to the extent of Mme. d\u2019Epinay\u2019s acquaintance with ancient history, \u201cyou understand, it\u2019s an allusion to Augustus Caesar, the Roman Emperor; it\u2019s too stupid, a bad play on words, quite unworthy of Oriane. And then, you see, I am more circumspect than my wife, if I haven\u2019t her wit, I think of the consequences; if anyone should be so ill-advised as to repeat the remark to my brother there\u2019ll be the devil to pay. All the more,\u201d he went on, \u201cbecause as you know Palam\u00e8de is very high and mighty, and very fussy also, given to gossip and all that sort of thing, so that quite apart from the question of his giving away Br\u00e9z\u00e9 you must admit that \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 suits him down to the ground. That is what justifies my wife\u2019s remarks; even when she is inclined to stoop to what is almost vulgar, she is always witty and does really describe people.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, thanks on one occasion to \u2018Teaser Augustus,\u2019 on another to something else, the visits paid by the Duke and Duchess to their kinsfolk replenished the stock of anecdotes, and the emotion which these visits aroused lasted long after the departure of the sparkling lady and her \u2018producer.\u2019 Her hostess would begin by going over again with the privileged persons who had been at the entertainment (those who had remained in the room) the clever things that Oriane had said. \u201cYou hadn\u2019t heard \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019?\u201d asked the Princesse d\u2019Epinay. \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Marquise de Baveno, blushing as she spoke, \u201cthe Princesse de Sarsina (the La Rochefoucauld one) mentioned it to me, not quite in the same words. But of course it was far more interesting to hear it repeated like that with my cousin in the room,\u201d she went on, as though speaking of a song that had been accompanied by the composer himself. \u201cWe were speaking of Oriane\u2019s latest \u2014 she was here just now,\u201d her hostess greeted a visitor who would be plunged in despair at not having arrived an hour earlier. \u201cWhat! Has Oriane been here?\u201d \u201cYes, you ought to have come a little sooner,\u201d the Princesse d\u2019Epinay informed her, not in reproach but letting her understand all that her clumsiness had made her miss. It was her fault alone if she had not been present at the Creation of the World or at Mme. Carvalho\u2019s last performance. \u201cWhat do you think of Oriane\u2019s latest? I must say, I do enjoy \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019,\u201d and the \u2018saying\u2019 would be served up again cold next day at luncheon before a few intimate friends who were invited on purpose, and would reappear under various sauces throughout the week. Indeed the Princess happening in the course of that week to pay her annual visit to the Princesse de Parme seized the opportunity to ask whether her Royal Highness had heard the pun, and repeated it to her. \u201cAh! Teaser Augustus,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, her eyes bulging with an instinctive admiration, which begged however for a complementary elucidation which Mme. d\u2019Epinay was not loath to furnish. \u201cI must say, \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 pleases me enormously as a piece of \u2018phrasing\u2019,\u201d she concluded. As a matter of fact the word \u2018phrasing\u2019 was not in the least applicable to this pun, but the Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who claimed to have assimilated her share of the Guermantes spirit, had borrowed from Oriane the expressions \u2018phrased\u2019 and \u2018phrasing\u2019 and employed them without much discrimination. New the Princesse de Parme, who was not at all fond of Mme. d\u2019Epinay, whom she considered plain, knew to be miserly and believed, on the authority of the Courvoisiers, to be malicious, recognised this word \u2018phrasing\u2019 which she had heard used by Mme. de Guermantes but would not by herself have known how or when to apply. She received the impression that it was in fact its \u2018phrasing\u2019 that formed the charm of \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 and, without altogether forgetting her antipathy towards the plain and miserly lady, could not repress a burst of admiration for a person endowed to such a degree with the Guermantes spirit, so strong that she was on the point of inviting the Princesse d\u2019Epinay to the Opera. She was held in check only by the reflexion that it would be wiser perhaps to consult Mme. de Guermantes first. As for Mme. d\u2019Epinay, who, unlike the Courvoisiers, paid endless attentions to Oriane and was genuinely fond of her but was jealous of her exalted friends and slightly irritated by the fun which the Duchess used to make of her before everyone on account of her meanness, she reported on her return home what an effort it had required to make the Princesse de Parme grasp the point of \u2018Teaser Augustus,\u2019 and declared what a snob Oriane must be to number such a goose among her friends. \u201cI should never have been able to see much of the Princesse de Parme even if I had cared to,\u201d she informed the friends who were dining with her. \u201cM. d\u2019Epinay would not have allowed it for a moment, because of her immorality,\u201d she explained, alluding to certain purely imaginary excesses on the part of the Princess. \u201cBut even if I had had a husband less strict in his views, I must say I could never have made friends with her. I don\u2019t know how Oriane can bear to see her every other day, as she does. I go there once a year, and it\u2019s all I can do to sit out my call.\u201d As for those of the Courvoisiers who happened to be at Victurnienne\u2019s on the day of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s visit, the arrival of the Duchess generally put them to flight owing to the exasperation they felt at the \u2018ridiculous salaams\u2019 that were made to her there. One alone remained on the afternoon of \u2018Teaser Augustus.\u2019 He did not entirely see the point, but he did see part of it, being an educated man. And the Courvoisiers went about repeating that Oriane had called uncle Palarned \u2018Caesar Augustus,\u2019 which was, according to them, a good enough descrin tion of him, but why all this endless talk about Oriane, they went on People couldn\u2019t make more fuss about a queen. \u201cAfter all, what is Oriane? I don\u2019t say that the Guermantes aren\u2019t an old family, but the Courvoisiers are every bit as good in rank, antiquity, marriages. We mustn\u2019t forget that on the Field of the Cloth of Gold, when the King of England asked Fran\u00e7ois I who was the noblest of the lords there present, \u2018Sire,\u2019 said the King of France, \u2018Courvoisier.\u2019\u201d But even if all the Courvoisiers had stayed in the room to hear them, Oriane\u2019s sayings would have fallen on deaf ears, since the incidents that usually gave occasion for those sayings would have been regarded by them from a totally different point of view. If, for instance, a Courvoisier found herself running short of chairs, in the middle of a party, or if she used the wrong name in greeting a guest whose face she did not remember, or if one of her servants said something stupid, the Courvoisier, extremely annoyed, flushed, quivering with excitement, would deplore so unfortunate an occurrence. And when she had a visitor in the room and Oriane was expected, she would say in a tone anxiously and imperiously questioning: \u201cDo you know her?\u201d, fearing that if the visitor did not know her his presence might make an unfortunate impression on Oriane. But Mme. de Guermantes on the contrary extracted from such incidents opportunities for stories which made the Guermantes laugh until the tears streamed down their cheeks, so that one was obliged to envy her her having run short of chairs, having herself made or having allowed her servant to make a blunder, having had at her party some one whom nobody knew, as one is obliged to be thankful that great writers have been kept at a distance by men and betrayed by women when their humiliations and their sufferings have been if not the direct stimulus of their genius, at any rate the subject matter of their works\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Courvoisiers were incapable of rising to the level of the spirit of innovation which the Duchesse de Guermantes introduced into the life of society and, by adapting it, following an unerring instinct, to the necessities of the moment, made into something artistic where the purely rational application of cut and dried rules would have given as unfortunate results as would greet a man who, anxious to succeed in love or in politics, was to reproduce in his own daily life the exploits of Bussy d\u2019Amboise. If the Courvoisiers gave a family dinner or a dinner to meet some prince, the addition of a recognised wit, of some friend of their son seemed to them an anomaly capable of producing the direst consequences. A Courvoisier whose father had been a Minister of the Empire having to give an afternoon party to meet Princesse Mathilde deduced by a geometrical formula that she could invite no one but Bonapartists. Of whom she knew practically none. All the smart women of her acquaintance, all the amusing men were ruthlessly barred because, from their Legitimist views or connexions, they might easily, according to Courvoisier logic, give offence to the Imperial Highness. The latter, who in her own house entertained the flower of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, was quite surprised when she found at Mme. de Courvoisier\u2019s only a notorious old sponger whose husband had been an Imperial Prefect, the widow of the Director of Posts and sundry others known for their loyalty to Napoleon, their stupidity and their dullness. Princesse Mathilde, however, in no way stinted the generous and refreshing shower of her sovereign grace over these miserable scarecrows whom the Duchesse de Guermantes, for her part, took good care not to invite when it was her turn to entertain the Princess, but substituted for them without any abstract reasoning about Bonapartism the most brilliant coruscation of all the beauties, all the talents, all the celebrities, who, the exercise of some subtle sixth sense made her feel, would be acceptable to the niece of the Emperor even when they belonged actually to the Royal House. There was not lacking indeed the Due d\u2019Aumale, and when on withdrawing the Princess, raising Mme. de Guermantes from the ground where she had sunk in a curtsey and was trying to kiss the august hand, embraced her on both cheeks, it was from the bottom of her heart that she was able to assure the Duchess that never had she spent a happier afternoon nor seen so delightful a party. The Princesse de Parme was Courvoisier in her incapacity for innovation in social matters, but unlike the Courvoisiers the surprise that was perpetually caused her by the Duchesse de Guermantes engendered in her not, as in them, antipathy but admiration. This astonishment was still farther enhanced by the infinitely backward state of the Princess\u2019s education. Mme. de Guermantes was herself a great deal less advanced than she supposed. But it was enough for her to have gone a little beyond Mme. de Parme to stupefy that lady, and, as the critics of each generation confine themselves to maintaining the direct opposite of the truths admitted by their predecessors, she had only to say that Flaubert, that archenemy of the bourgeois, had been bourgeois through and through, or that there was a great deal of Italian music in Wagner, to open before the Princess, at the cost of a nervous exhaustion which recurred every time, as before the eyes of a swimmer in a stormy sea, horizons that seemed to her unimaginable and remained for ever vague. A stupefaction caused also by the paradoxes uttered with relation not only to works of art but to persons of their acquaintance and to current social events. No doubt the incapacity that prevented Mme. de Parme from distinguishing the true wit of the Guermantes from certain rudimentarily acquired forms of that wit (which made her believe in the high intellectual worth of certain, especially certain female Guermantes, of whom she was bewildered on hearing the Duchess confide to her with a smile that they were mere blockheads) was one of the causes of the astonishment which the Princess always felt on hearing Mme. de Guermantes criticise other people. But there was another cause also, one which I, who knew at this time more books than people and literature better than life, explained to myself by thinking that the Duchess, living this wordly life the idleness and sterility of which are to a true social activity what criticism, in art, is to creation, extended to the persons who surrounded her the instability of point of view, the uneasy thirst of the reasoner who to assuage a mind that has grown too dry goes in search of no matter what paradox that is still fairly new, and will make no bones about upholding the refreshing opinion that the really great Iphig\u00e9nie is Piccini\u2019s and not Gluck\u2019s, at a pinch the true Ph\u00e8dre that of Pradon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a woman who was intelligent, educated, witty had married a shy bumpkin whom one saw but seldom and never heard, Mme. de Guermantes one fine day would find a rare intellectual pleasure not only in decrying the wife but in \u2018discovering\u2019 the husband. In the Cambremer household for example, if she had lived in that section of society at the time, she would have decreed that Mme. de Cambremer was stupid, and that the really interesting person, misunderstood, delightful, condemned to silence by a chattering wife but himself worth a thousand of her, was the Marquis, and the Duchess would have felt on declaring this the same kind of refreshment as the critic who, after people have for seventy years been admiring Hernani, confesses to a preference for Le Lion Amoureux. And from this same morbid need of arbitrary novelties, if from her girlhood everyone had been pitying a model wife, a true saint, for being married to a scoundrel, one fine day Mme. de Guermantes would assert that this scoundrel was perhaps a frivolous man but one with a heart of gold, whom the implacable harshness of his wife had driven to do the most inconsistent things. I knew that it is not only over different works, in the long course of centuries, but over different parts of the same work that criticism plays, thrusting back into the shadow what for too long has been thought brilliant, and making emerge what has appeared to be doomed to permanent obscurity. I had not only seen Bellini, Winterhalter, the Jesuit architects, a Restoration cabinetmaker come to take the place of men of genius who were called \u2018worn out,\u2019 simply because they had worn out the lazy minds of the intellectuals, as neurasthenics are always worn out and always changing; I had seen preferred in Sainte-Beuve alternately the critic and the poet, Musset rejected so far as his poetry went save for a few quite unimportant little pieces. No doubt certain essayists are mistaken when they set above the most famous scenes in Le Cid or Polyeucte some speech from Le Menteur which, like an old plan, furnishes information about the Paris of the day, but their predilection, justified if not by considerations of beauty at least by a documentary interest, is still too rational for our criticism run mad. It will barter the whole of Moli\u00e8re for a line fromL\u2019Etourdi, and even when it pronounces Wagner\u2019s Tristan a bore will except a \u2018charming note on the horns\u2019 at the point where the hunt goes by. This depravation of taste helped me to understand that of which Mme. de Guermantes gave proof when she decided that a man of their world, recognised as a good fellow but a fool, was a monster of egoism, sharper than people thought \u2014 that another widely known for his generosity might be the personification of avarice, that a good mother paid no attention to her children, and that a woman generally supposed to be vicious was really actuated by the noblest feelings. As though spoiled by the nullity of life in society, the intelligence and perception of Mme. de Guermantes were too vacillating for disgust not to follow pretty swiftly in the wake of infatuation (leaving her still ready to feel herself attracted afresh by the kind of cleverness which she had in turn sought out and abandoned) and for the charm which she had felt in some warm-hearted man not to change, if he came too often to see her, sought too freely from her directions which she was incapable of giving him, into an irritation which she believed to be produced by her admirer but which was in fact due to the utter impossibility of finding pleasure when one does nothing else than seek it. The variations of the Duchess\u2019s judgment spared no one, except her husband. He alone had never been in love with her, in him she had always felt an iron character, indifferent to the caprices that she displayed, contemptuous of her beauty, violent, of a will that would never bend, the sort under which alone nervous people can find tranquillity. M. de Guermantes on the other hand, pursuing a single type of feminine beauty but seeking it in mistresses whom he constantly replaced, had, once he had left them, and to express derision of them, only an associate, permanent and identical, who irritated him often by her chatter but as to whom he knew that everyone regarded her as the most beautiful, the most virtuous, the cleverest, the best-read member of the aristocracy, as a wife whom he, M. de Guermantes, was only too fortunate to have found, who cloaked all his irregularities, entertained like no one else in the world, and upheld for their drawing-room its position as the premier in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. This common opinion he himself shared; often moved to ill-humour against her, he was proud of her. If, being as niggardly as he was fastidious, he refused her the most trifling sums for her charities or for the servants, yet he insisted upon her wearing the most sumptuous clothes and driving behind the best horses in Paris. Whenever Mme. de Guermantes had just perpetrated, with reference to the merits and defects, which she suddenly transposed, of one of their friends, a new and succulent paradox, she burned to make trial of it before people capable of relishing it, to bring out its psychological originality and to set its epigrammatic brilliance sparkling. No doubt these new opinions embodied as a rule no more truth than the old, often less; but this very element, arbitrary and incalculable, of novelty which they contained conferred on them something intellectual which made the communication of them exciting. Only the patient on whom the Duchess was exercising her psychological skill was generally an intimate friend as to whom those people to whom she longed to hand on her discovery were entirely unaware that he was not still at the apex of her favour; thus the reputation that Mme. de Guermantes had of being an incomparable friend, sentimental, tender and devoted, made it difficult for her to launch the attack herself; she could at the most intervene later on, as though under constraint, by uttering a response to appease, to contradict in appearance but actually to support a partner who had taken it on himself to provoke her; this was precisely the part in which M. de Guermantes excelled\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for social activities, it was yet another form of pleasure, arbitrary and spectacular, that Mme. de Guermantes felt in uttering, with regard to them, those unexpected judgments which pricked with an incessant and exquisite feeling of surprise the Princesse de Parme. But with this one of the Duchess\u2019s pleasures it was not so much with the help of literary criticism as by following political life and the reports of parliamentary debates that I tried to understand in what it might consist. The successive and contradictory edicts by which Mme. de Guermantes continually reversed the scale of values among the people of her world no longer sufficing to distract her, she sought also in the manner in which she ordered her own social behaviour, in which she recorded her own most trivial decisions on points of fashion, to taste those artificial emotions, to fulfil those adventitious obligations which stimulate the perceptions of Parliaments and gain hold of the minds of politicians. We know that when a Minister explains to the Chamber that he believed himself to be acting rightly in following a line of conduct which does, as a matter of fact, appear quite straightforward to the commonsense person who next morning in his newspaper reads the report of the sitting, this commonsense reader does nevertheless feel himself suddenly stirred and begins to doubt whether he has been right in approving the Minister\u2019s conduct when he sees that the latter\u2019s speech was listened to with the accompaniment of a lively agitation and punctuated with expressions of condemnation such as: \u201cIt\u2019s most serious!\u201d ejaculated by a Deputy whose name and titles are so long, and followed in the report by movements so emphatic that in the whole interruption the words \u201cIt\u2019s most serious!\u201d occupy less room than a hemistich does in an alexandrine. For instance in the days when M. de Guermantes, Prince des Laumes, sat in the Chamber, one used to read now and then in the Paris newspapers, albeit it was intended primarily for the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise division, to shew the electors there that they had not given their votes to an inactive or voiceless mandatory:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Monsieur de Guermantes-Bouillon, Prince des Laumes: \u201cThis is serious!\u201d \u201cHear, hear!\u201d from the Centre and some of the Right benches, loud exclamations from the Extreme Left.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The commonsense reader still retains a gleam of faith in the sage Minister, but his heart is convulsed with a fresh palpitation by the first words of the speaker who rises to reply:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe astonishment, it is not too much to say the stupor\u201d (keen sensation on the Right side of the House) \u201cthat I have felt at the words of one who is still, I presume, a member of the Government\u201d (thunder of applause) . . . Several Under-Secretaries of State for Posts and Telegraphs without Deputies then crowded round the Ministerial bench. Then rising from his seat, nodded his head in the affirmative\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This \u2018thunder of applause\u2019 carries away the last shred of resistance in the mind of the commonsense reader; he discovers to be an insult to the Chamber, monstrous in fact, a course of procedure which in itself is of no importance; it may be some normal action such as arranging that the rich shall pay more than the poor, bringing to light some piece of injustice, preferring peace to war; he will find it scandalous and will see in it an offence to certain principles to which as a matter of fact he had never given a thought, which are not engraved on the human heart, but which move him forcibly by reason of the acclamations which they provoke and the compact majorities which they assemble\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must at the same time be recognised that this subtlety of the politician which served to explain to me the Guermantes circle, and other groups in society later on, is nothing more than the perversion of a certain fineness of interpretation often described as \u2018reading between the lines.\u2019 If in representative assemblies there is absurdity owing to perversion of this quality, there is equally stupidity, through the want of it, in the public who take everything \u2018literally,\u2019 who do not suspect a dismissal when a high dignitary is relieved of his office \u2018at his own request,\u2019 and say: \u201cHe cannot have been dismissed, since it was he who asked leave to retire,\u201d\u2014 a defeat when the Russians by a strategic movement withdraw upon a stronger position that has been prepared beforehand, a refusal when, a Province having demanded its independence from the German Emperor, he grants it religious autonomy. It is possible, moreover (to return to these sittings of the Chamber), that when they open the Deputies themselves are like the commonsense person who will read the published report. Learning that certain workers on strike have sent their delegates to confer with a Minister, they may ask one another innocently: \u201cThere now, I wonder what they can have been saying; let\u2019s hope it\u2019s all settled,\u201d at the moment when the Minister himself mounts the tribune in a solemn silence which has already brought artificial emotions into play. The first words of the Minister: \u201cThere is no necessity for me to inform the Chamber that I have too high a sense of what is the duty of the Government to have received a deputation of which the authority entrusted to me could take no cognisance,\u201d produce a dramatic effect, for this was the one hypothesis which the commonsense of the Deputies had not imagined. But precisely because of its dramatic effect it is greeted with such applause that it is only after several minutes have passed that the Minister can succeed in making himself heard, the Minister who will receive on returning to his place on the bench the congratulations of his colleagues. We are as deeply moved as on the day when the same Minister failed to invite to a big official reception the President of the Municipal Council who was supporting the Opposition, and declare that on this occasion as on the other he has acted with true statesmanship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes at this period in his life had, to the great scandal of the Courvoisiers, frequently been among the crowd of Deputies who came forward to congratulate the Minister. I have heard it said afterwards that even at a time when he was playing a fairly important part in the Chamber and was being thought of in connexion with Ministerial office or an Embassy he was, when a friend came to ask a favour of him, infinitely more simple, behaved politically a great deal less like the important political personage than anyone else who did not happen to be Duc de Guermantes. For if he said that nobility made no difference, that he regarded his fellow Deputies as equals, he did not believe it for a moment. He sought, pretended to value but really despised political importance, and as he remained in his own eyes M. de Guermantes it did not envelop his person in that dead weight of high office which makes other politicians unapproachable. And in this way his pride guarded against every assault not only his manners which were of an ostentatious familiarity but also such true simplicity as he might actually have\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to those artificial and moving decisions such as are made by politicians, Mme. de Guermantes was no less disconcerting to the Guermantes, the Courvoisiers, the Faubourg in general and, more than anyone, the Princesse de Parme by her habit of issuing unaccountable decrees behind which one could feel to be latent principles which impressed one all the more, the less one expected them. If the new Greek Minister have a fancy dress ball, everyone chose a costume and asked everyone else what the Duchess would wear. One thought that she would appear as the Duchesse de Bourgogne, another suggested as probable the guise of Princess of Dujabar, a third Psyche. Finally, a Courvoisier having asked her: \u201cWhat are you going to wear, Oriane?\u201d provoked the one response of which nobody had thought: \u201cWhy, nothing at all!\u201d which at once set every tongue wagging, as revealing Oriane\u2019s opinion as to the true social position of the new Greek Minister and the proper attitude to adopt towards him, that is to say the opinion which ought to have been foreseen namely that a duchess \u2018was not expected\u2019 to attend the fancy dress bali given by this new Minister: \u201cI do not see that there is any necessity to go to the Greek Minister\u2019s; I do not know him; I am not a Greek; why should I go to these people\u2019s house, I have nothing to do with them?\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cBut everybody will be there, they say it\u2019s going to be charming!\u201d cried Mme. de Gallardon. \u201cStill, it\u2019s just as charming sometimes to sit by one\u2019s own fireside,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. The Courvoisiers could not get over this, but the Guermantes, without copying it, approved of their cousin\u2019s attitude. \u201cNaturally, everybody isn\u2019t in a position like Oriane to break with all the conventions. But if you look at it in one way you can\u2019t say she was actually wrong in wishing to shew that we are going rather far in flinging ourselves at the feet of all these foreigners who appear from heaven knows where.\u201d Naturally, knowing the stream of comment which one or other attitude would not fail to provoke, Mme. de Guermantes took as much pleasure in appearing at a party to which her hostess had not dared to count on her coming as in staying at home or spending the evening at the play with her husband on the night of a party to which \u2018everybody was going,\u2019 or, again, when people imagined that she would eclipse the finest diamonds with some historic diadem, by stealing into the room without a single jewel, and in another style of dress than what had been, wrongly, supposed to be essential to the occasion. Albeit she was anti-Dreyfusard (while retaining her belief in the innocence of Dreyfus, just as she spent her life in the social world believing only in abstract ideas) she had created an enormous sensation at a party at the Princesse de Ligne\u2019s, first of all by remaining seated after all the ladies had risen to their feet as General Mercier entered the room, and then by getting up and in a loud voice asking for her carriage when a Nationalist orator had begun to address the gathering, thereby shewing that she did not consider that society was meant for talking politics; all heads were turned towards her at a Good Friday concert at which, although a Voltairean, she had not remained because she thought it indecent to bring Christ upon the stage. We know how important, even for the great queens of society, is that moment of the year at which the round of entertainment begins: so much so that the Marquise d\u2019Amoncourt, who, from a need to say something, a form of mania, and also from want of perception, was always making a fool of herself, had actually replied to somebody who had called to condole with her on the death of her father, M. de Montmorency: \u201cWhat makes it sadder still is that it should come at a time when one\u2019s mirror is simply stuffed with cards!\u201d Very well, at this point in the social year, when people invited the Duchesse de Guermantes to dinner, making every effort to see that she was not already engaged, she declined, for the one reason of which nobody in society would ever have thought; she was just starting on a cruise among the Norwegian fjords, which were so interesting. People in society were stupefied, and, without any thought of following the Duchess\u2019s example, derived nervertheless from her action that sense of relief which one has in reading Kant when after the most rigorous demonstration of determinism one finds that above the world of necessity there is the world of freedom. Every invention of which no one has ever thought before excites the interest even of people who can derive no benefit from it. That of steam navigation was a small thing compared with the employment of steam navigation at that sedentary time of year called \u2018the season.\u2019 The idea that anyone could voluntarily renounce a hundred dinners or luncheons, twice as many afternoon teas, three times as many evening parties, the most brilliant Mondays at the Opera and Tuesdays at the Fran\u00e7ais to visit the Norwegian fjords seemed to the Courvoisiers no more explicable than the idea of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, but conveyed to them a similar impression of independence and charm. So that not a day passed on which somebody might not be heard to ask, not merely: \u201cYou\u2019ve heard Oriane\u2019s latest joke?\u201d but \u201cYou know Oriane\u2019s latest?\u201d and on \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest\u2019 as on \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest joke\u2019 would follow the comment: \u201cHow typical of Oriane!\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that pure Oriane?\u201d Oriane\u2019s latest might be, for instance, that, having to write on behalf of a patriotic society to Cardinal X \u2014 Bishop of Macon (whom M. de Guermantes when he spoke of him invariably called \u2018Monsieur de Mascon,\u2019 thinking this to be \u2018old French\u2019), when everyone was trying to imagine what form the letter would take, and had no difficulty as to the opening words, the choice lying between \u2018Eminence,\u2019 and \u2018Monseigneur,\u2019 but was puzzled as to the rest, Oriane\u2019s letter, to the general astonishment, began: \u2018Monsieur le Cardinal,\u2019 following an old academic form, or: \u2018My Cousin,\u2019 this term being in use among the Princes of the Church, the Gsermantes and Crowned Heads, who prayed to God to take each and all of them into \u2018His fit and holy keeping.\u2019 To start people on the topic of an \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest\u2019 it was sufficient that at a performance at which all Paris was present and a most charming play was being given, when they looked for Mme. de Guermantes in the boxes of the Princesse de Parme, the Princesse de Guermantes, countless other ladies who had invited her, they discovered her sitting by herself, in black, with a tiny hat on her head, in a stall in which she had arrived before the curtain rose. \u201cYou hear better, when it\u2019s a play that\u2019s worth listening to,\u201d she explained, to the scandal of the Courvoisiers and the admiring bewilderment of the Guermantes and the Princesse de Parme, who suddenly discovered that the \u2018fashion\u2019 of hearing the beginning of a play was more up to date, was a proof of greater originality and intelligence (which need not astonish them, coming from Oriane) than that of arriving for the last act after a big dinner-party and \u2018going on\u2019 somewhere first. Such were the various kinds of surprise for which the Princesse de Parme knew that she ought to be prepared if she put a literary or social question to Mme. de Guermantes, one result of which was that during these dinner-parties at Oriane\u2019s her Royal Highness never ventured upon the slightest topic save with the uneasy and enraptured prudence of the bather emerging from between two breakers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among the elements which, absent from the three or four other more or less equivalent drawing-rooms that set the fashion for the Faubourg Saint-Germain, differentiated from them that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, just as Leibniz allows that each monad, while reflecting the entire universe, adds to it something of its own, one of the least attractive was regularly furnished by one or two extremely good-looking women who had no title to be there apart from their beauty and the use that M. de Guermantes had made of them, and whose presence revealed at once, as does in other drawing-rooms that of certain otherwise unaccountable pictures, that in this household the husband was an ardent appreciator of feminine graces. They were all more or less alike, for the Duke had a taste for large women, at once statuesque and loose-limbed, of a type half-way between the Venus of Milo and the Samothracian Victory; often fair, rarely dark, sometimes auburn, like the most recent, who was at this dinner, that Vicomtesse d\u2019Arpajon whom he had loved so well that for a long time he had obliged her to send him as many as ten telegrams daily (which slightly annoyed the Duchess), corresponded with her by carrier pigeon when he was at Guermantes, and from whom moreover he had long been so incapable of tearing himself away that, one winter which he had had to spend at Parma, he travelled back regularly every week to Paris, spending two days in the train, in order to see her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a rule these handsome \u2018supers\u2019 had been his mistresses but were no longer (as was Mme. d\u2019Arpajon\u2019s case) or were on the point of ceasing to be so. It may well have been that the importance which the Duchess enjoyed in their sight and the hope of being invited to her house, though they themselves came of thoroughly aristocratic, but still not quite first-class stock, had prompted them, even more than the good looks and generosity of the Duke, to yield to his desires. Not that the Duchess would have placed any insuperable obstacle in the way of their crossing her threshold: she was aware that in more than one of them she had found an ally, thanks to whom she had obtained a thousand things which she wanted but which M. de Guermantes pitilessly denied his wife so long as he was not in love with some one else. And so the reason why they were not invited by the Duchess until their intimacy with the Duke was already far advanced lay principally in the fact that he, every time that he had embarked on the deep waters of love, had imagined nothing more than a brief flirtation, as a reward for which he considered an invitation from his wife to be more than adequate. And yet he found himself offering this as the price of far less, for a first kiss in fact, because a resistance upon which he had never reckoned had been brought into play or because there had been no resistance. In love it often happens that gratitude, the desire to give pleasure, makes us generous beyond the limits of what the other person\u2019s expectation and self-interest could have anticipated. But then the realisation of this offer was hindered by conflicting circumstances. In the first place, all the women who had responded to M. de Guermantes\u2019s love, and sometimes even when they had not yet surrendered themselves to him, he had, one after another, segregated from the world. He no longer allowed them to see anyone, spent almost all his time in their company, looked after the education of their children to whom now and again, if one was to judge by certain speaking likenesses later on, he had occasion to present a little brother or sister. And so if, at the start of the connexion, the prospect of an introduction to Mme. de Guermantes, which had never crossed the mind of the Duke, had entered considerably into the thoughts of his mistress, their connexion had by itself altered the whole of the lady\u2019s point of view; the Duke was no longer for her merely the husband of the smartest woman in Paris, but a man with whom his new mistress was in love, a man moreover who had given her the means and the inclination for a more luxurious style of living and had transposed the relative importance in her mind of questions of social and of material advantage; while now and then a composite jealousy, into which all these factors entered, of Mme. de Guermantes animated the Duke\u2019s mistresses. But this case was the rarest of all; besides, when the day appointed for the introduction at length arrived (at a point when as a rule the Duke had lost practically all interest in the matter, his actions, like everyone\u2019s else, being generally dictated by previous actions the prime motive of which had already ceased to exist), it frequently happened that it was Mme. de Guermantes who had sought the acquaintance of the mistress in whom she hoped, and so greatly needed, to discover, against her dread husband, a valuable ally. This is not to say that, save at rare moments, in their own house, where, when the Duchess talked too much, he let fall a few words or, more dreadful still, preserved a silence which rendered her speechless, M. de Guermantes failed in his outward relations with his wife to observe what are called the forms. People who did not know them might easily misunderstand. Sometimes between the racing at Deauville, the course of waters and the return to Guermantes for the shooting, in the few weeks which people spend in Paris, since the Duchess had a liking for caf\u00e9-concerts, the Duke would go with her to spend the evening at one of these. The audience remarked at once, in one of those little open boxes in which there is just room for two, this Hercules in his \u2018smoking\u2019 (for in France we give to everything that is more or less British the one name that it happens not to bear in England), his monocle screwed in his eye, in his plump but finely shaped hand, on the ring-finger of which there glowed a sapphire, a plump cigar from which now and then he drew a puff of smoke, keeping his eyes for the most part on the stage but, when he did let them fall upon the audience in which there was absolutely no one whom he knew, softening them with an air of gentleness, reserve, courtesy and consideration. When a verse struck him as amusing and not too indecent, the Duke would turn round with a smile to his wife, letting her share, by a twinkle of good-natured understanding, the innocent merriment which the new song had aroused in himself. And the spectators might believe that there was no better husband in the world than this, nor anyone more enviable than the Duchess \u2014 that woman outside whom every interest in the Duke\u2019s life lay, that woman with whom he was not in love, to whom he had been consistently unfaithful; when the Duchess felt tired, they saw M. de Guermantes rise, put on her cloak with his own hands, arranging her necklaces so that they did not catch in the lining, and clear a path for her to the street with an assiduous and respectful attention which she received with the coldness of the woman of the world who sees in such behaviour simply conventional politeness, at times even with the slightly ironical bitterness of the disabused spouse who has no illusion left to shatter. But despite these externals (another element of that politeness which has made duty evolve from the depths of our being to the surface, at a period already remote but still continuing for its survivors) the life of the Duchess was by no means easy. M. de Guermantes never became generous or human save for a new mistress who would take, as it generally happened, the Duchess\u2019s part; the latter saw becoming possible for her once again generosities towards inferiors, charities to the poor, even for herself, later on, a new and sumptuous motor-car. But from the irritation which developed as a rule pretty rapidly in Mme. de Guermantes at people whom she found too submissive the Duke\u2019s mistresses were not exempt. Presently the Duchess grew tired of them. Simultaneously, at this moment, the Duke\u2019s intimacy with Mme. d\u2019Arpajon was drawing to an end. Another mistress dawned on the horizon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt the love which M. de Guermantes had had for each of them in succession would begin one day to make itself felt afresh; in the first place, this love in dying bequeathed them, like beautiful marbles \u2014 marbles beautiful to the Duke, become thus in part an artist, because he had loved them and was sensitive now to lines which he would not have appreciated without love \u2014 which brought into juxtaposition in the Duchess\u2019s drawing-room their forms long inimical, devoured by jealousies and quarrels, and finally reconciled in the peace of friendship; besides, this friendship itself was an effect of the love which had made M. de Guermantes observe in those who were his mistresses virtues which exist in every human being but are perceptible only to the sensual eye, so much so that the ex-mistr\u00eass, become \u2018the best of comrades\u2019 who would do anything in the world for one, is as recognised a type as the doctor or father who is not a doctor or a father but a friend. But during a period of transition the woman whom M. de Guermantes was preparing to abandon bewailed her lot, made scenes, shewed herself exacting, appeared indiscreet, became a nuisance. The Duke began to take a dislike to her. Then Mme. de Guermantes had an opportunity to bring into prominence the real or imagined defects of a person who annoyed her. Known as a kind woman, Mme. de Guermantes received the telephone messages, the confidences, the tears of the abandoned mistress and made no complaint. She laughed at them, first with her husband, then with a few chosen friends. And imagining that this pity which she shewed for the poor wretch gave her the right to make fun of her, even to her face, whatever the lady might say, provided it could be included among the attributes of the character for absurdity which the puke and Duchess had recently fabricated for her, Mme. de Guermantes had no hesitation in exchanging with her husband a glance of ironical connivance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, as she sat down to table, the Princesse de Parme remembered that she had thought of inviting a certain other Princess to the Opera, and, wishing to be assured that this would not in any way offend Mme. de Guermantes, was preparing to sound her. At this moment there entered M. de Grouchy, whose train, owing to some block on the line, had been held up for an hour. He made what excuses he could. His wife, had she been a Courvoisier, would have died of shame. But Mme. de Grouchy was not a Guermantes for nothing. As her husband was apologising for being late:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see,\u201d she broke in, \u201cthat even in little things arriving late is a tradition in your family.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSit down, Grouchy, and don\u2019t let them pull your leg,\u201d said the Duke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope I move with the times, still I must admit that the Battle of Waterloo had its points, since it brought about the Restoration of the Bourbons, and better still in a way which made them unpopular. But you seem to be a regular Nimrod!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, as a matter of fact, I have had quite a good bag. I shall take the liberty of sending the Duchess six brace of pheasants to-morrow.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An idea seemed to flicker in the eyes of Mme. de Guermantes. She insisted that M. de Grouchy must not give himself the trouble of sending the pheasants. And making a sign to the betrothed footman with whom I had exchanged a few words on my way from the Elstir room:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPoullein,\u201d she told him, \u201cyou will go to-morrow and fetch M. le Comte\u2019s pheasants and bring them straight back \u2014 you won\u2019t mind, will you, Grouchy, if I make a few little presents. Basin and I can\u2019t eat a whole dozen by ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut the day after to-morrow will be soon enough,\u201d said M. de Grouchy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, to-morrow suits me better,\u201d the Duchess insisted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Poullein had turned pale; his appointment with his sweetheart would have to be missed. This was quite enough for the diversion of the Duchess, who liked to appear to be taking a human interest in everyone. \u201cI know it\u2019s your day out,\u201d she went on to Poullein, \u201call you\u2019ve got to do is to change with Georges; he can take to-morrow off and stay in the day after.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the day after, Poullein\u2019s sweetheart would not be free. A holiday then was of no account to him. As soon as he was out of the room, everyone complimented the Duchess on the interest she took in her servants. \u201cBut I only behave towards them as I like people to behave to me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just it. They can say they\u2019ve found a good place with you.\u201d \u201cOh, nothing so very wonderful. But I think they all like me. That one is a little annoying because he\u2019s in love. He thinks it incumbent on him to go about with a long face.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point Poullein reappeared. \u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d said M. de Grouchy, \u201che doesn\u2019t look much like smiling. With those fellows one has to be good but not too good.\u201d \u201cI admit I\u2019m not a very dreadful mistress. He\u2019ll have nothing to do all day but call for your pheasants, sit in the house doing nothing and eat his share of them.\u201d \u201cThere are plenty of people who would be glad to be in his place,\u201d said M. de Grouchy, for envy makes men blind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOriane,\u201d began the Princesse de Parme, \u201cI had a visit the other day from your cousin Heudicourt; of course she\u2019s a highly intelligent woman \u2014 she\u2019s a Guermantes, one can say no more, but they tell me she has a spitel ful tongue.\u201d The Duke fastened on his wife a slow gaze of deliberate stupefaction. Mme. de Guermantes began to smile. Gradually the Princess became aware of their pantomime. \u201cBut . . . do you mean to say you don\u2019t agree with me?\u201d she stammered with growing uneasiness. \u201cReally Ma\u2019am, it\u2019s too good of you to pay any attention to Basin\u2019s faces. Now\u2019 Basin, you\u2019re not to hint nasty things about our cousins.\u201d \u201cHe thinks her too wicked?\u201d inquired the Princess briskly. \u201cOh, dear me, no!\u201d replied the Duchess. \u201cI don\u2019t know who told your Highness that she was spiteful. On the contrary, she\u2019s an excellent creature who never said any harm of anyone, or did any harm to any one.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d sighed Mme. de Parme, greatly relieved. \u201cI must say I never noticed anything myself. But I know it\u2019s often difficult not to be a little spiteful when one is so full of wit . . . \u201d \u201cAh! Now that is a quality of which she has even less.\u201d \u201cLess wit?\u201d asked the stupefied Princess. \u201cCome now, Oriane,\u201d broke in the Duke in a plaintive tone, casting to right and left of him a glance of amusement, \u201cyou heard the Princess tell you that she was a superior woman.\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cSuperior in chest measurement, at any rate.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Ma\u2019am, he\u2019s not sincere; she\u2019s as stupid as a (h\u2019m) goose,\u201d came in a loud and rasping voice from Mme. de Guermantes, who, a great deal more \u2018old French\u2019 even than the Duke when he was not trying, did often deliberately seek to be, but in a manner the opposite of the lace-neckcloth, deliquescent style of her husband and in reality far more subtle, by a sort of almost peasant pronunciation which had a harsh and delicious flavour of the soil. \u201cBut she\u2019s the best woman in the world. Besides, I don\u2019t really know that one can call it stupidity when it\u2019s carried to such a point as that. I don\u2019t believe I ever met anyone quite like her; she\u2019s a case for a specialist, there\u2019s something pathological about her, she\u2019s a sort of \u2018innocent\u2019 or \u2018cretin\u2019 or an \u2018arrested development,\u2019 like the people you see in melodramas, or in L\u2019Arl\u00e9sienne. I always ask myself, when she comes to see me, whether the moment may not have arrived at which her intelligence is going to dawn, which makes me a little nervous always.\u201d The Princess was lost in admiration of these utterances but remained stupefied by the preceding verdict. \u201cShe repeated to me \u2014 and so did Mme. d\u2019Epinay \u2014 what you said about \u2018Teaser Augustus.\u2019 It\u2019s delicious,\u201d she put in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes explained the joke to me. I wanted to tell him that his brother, who pretended not to know me, was expecting me that same evening at eleven o\u2019clock. But I had not asked Robert whether I might mention this engagement, and as the fact that M. de Charlus had practically fixed it with me himself directly contradicted what he had told the Duchess I judged it more tactful to say nothing. \u201c\u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 was not bad,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cbut Mme. d\u2019Heudicourt probably did not tell you a far better thing that Oriane said to her the other day in reply to an invitation to luncheon.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed! Do tell me!\u201d \u201cNow Basin, you keep quiet; in the first place, it was a stupid remark, and it will make the Princess think me inferior even to my fool of a cousin. Though I don\u2019t know why I should call her my cousin. She\u2019s one of Basin\u2019s cousins. Still, I believe she is related to me in some sort of way.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d cried the Princesse de Parme, at the idea that she could possibly think Mme. de Guermantes stupid, and protesting helplessly that nothing could ever lower the Duchess from the place she held in her estimation. \u201cBesides we have already subtracted from her the quality of wit; as what I said to her tends to deny her certain other good qualities also, it seems to me inopportune to repeat it.\u201d \u201c\u2018Deny her!\u2019 \u2018Inopportune!\u2019 How well she expresses herself!\u201d said the Duke with a pretence of irony, to win admiration for the Duchess. \u201cNow, then, Basin, you\u2019re not to make fun of your wife.\u201d \u201cI should explain to your Royal Highness,\u201d went on the Duke, \u201cthat Oriane\u2019s cousin may be superior, good, stout, anything you like to mention, but she is not exactly \u2014 what shall I say \u2014 lavish.\u201d \u201cNo, I know, she\u2019s terribly close-fisted,\u201d broke in the Princess. \u201cI should not have ventured to use the expression, but you have hit on exactly the right word. You can see it in her house-keeping, and especially in the cooking, which is excellent, but strictly rationed.\u201d \u201cWhich leads to some quite amusing scenes,\u201d M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 interrupted him. \u201cFor instance, my dear Basin, I was down at Heudicourt one day when you were expected, Oriane and yourself. They had made the most elaborate preparations when, during the afternoon, a footman brought in a telegram to say that you weren\u2019t coming.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me!\u201d said the Duchess, who not only was difficult to secure, but liked people to know as much. \u201cYour cousin read the telegram, was duly distressed, then immediately, without losing her head, telling herself that there was no point in going to unnecessary expense for so unimportant a gentleman as myself, called the footman back. \u2018Tell the cook not to put on the chicken!\u2019 she shouted after him. And that evening I heard her asking the butler: \u2018Well? What about the beef that was left over yesterday? Aren\u2019t you going to let us have that?\u2019\u201d \u201cAll the same, one must admit that the cheer you get there is of the very best,\u201d said the Duke, who fancied that in using this language he shewed himself to belong to the old school. \u201cI don\u2019t know any house where one gets better food.\u201d \u201cOr less,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cIt is quite wholesome and quite enough for what you would call a vulgar yokel like myself,\u201d went on the Duke, \u201cone keeps one\u2019s appetite.\u201d \u201cOh, if it\u2019s to be taken as a cure, it\u2019s certainly more hygienic than sumptuous. Not that it\u2019s as good as all that,\u201d added Mme. de Guermantes, who was not at all pleased that the title of \u2018best table in Paris\u2019 should be awarded to any but her own. \u201cWith my cousin it\u2019s just the same as with those costive authors who hatch out every fifteen years a one-act play or a sonnet. The sort of thing people call a little masterpiece, trifles that are perfect gems, in fact the one thing I loathe most in the world. The cooking at Z\u00e9na\u00efde\u2019s is not bad, but you would think it more ordinary if she was less parsimonious. There are some things her cook does quite well, and others that he spoils. I have had some thoroughly bad dinners there, as in most houses, only they\u2019ve done me less harm there because the stomach is, after all, more sensitive to quantity than to quality.\u201d \u201cWell, to get on with the story,\u201d the Duke concluded \u201cZ\u00e9na\u00efde insisted that Oriane should go to luncheon there, and as my wife is not very fond of going out anywhere she resisted, wanted to be sure that under the pretence of a quiet meal she was not being trapped into some great banquet, and tried in vain to find out who else were to be of the party. \u2018You must come,\u2019 Z\u00e9na\u00efde insisted, boasting of all the good things there would be to eat. \u2018You are going to have a pur\u00e9e of chestnuts, I need say no more than that, and there will be seven littlebouch\u00e9es \u00e0 la reine.\u2019 \u2018Seven little bouch\u00e9es!\u2019 cried Oriane, \u2018that means that we shall be at least eightl\u2019\u201d There was silence for a few seconds, and then the Princess having seen the point let her laughter explode like a peal of thunder. \u201cAh! \u2018Then we shall be eight,\u2019\u2014 it\u2019s exquisite. How very well phrased!\u201d she said, having by a supreme effort recaptured the expression she had heard used by Mme. d\u2019Epinay, which this time was more appropriate. \u201cOriane, that was very charming of the Princess, she said your remark was well phrased.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear, you\u2019re telling me nothing new. I know how clever the Princess is,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, who readily assimilated a remark when it was uttered at once by a Royal Personage and in praise of her own wit. \u201cI am very proud that Ma\u2019am should appreciate my humble phrasings. I don\u2019t remember, though, that I ever did say such a thing, and if I did it must have been to flatter my cousin, for if she had ordered seven \u2018mouthfuls,\u2019 the mouths, if I may so express myself, would have been a round dozen if not more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe used to have all M. de Bornier\u2019s manuscripts,\u201d went on the Princess, still speaking of Mme. d\u2019Heudicourt, and anxious to make the most of the excellent reasons she might have for associating with that lady. \u201cShe must have dreamed it, I don\u2019t believe she ever even know him,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cWhat is really interesting about him is that he kept up a correspondence with people of different nationalities at the same time,\u201d put in the Vicomtesse d\u2019Arpajon who, allied to the principal ducal and even reigning families of Europe, was always glad that people should be reminded of the fact. \u201cSurely, Oriane,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, with ulterior purpose, \u201cyou can\u2019t have forgotten that dinner-party where you had M. de Bornier sitting next to you!\u201d \u201cBut, Basin,\u201d the Duchess interrupted him, \u201cif you mean to inform me that I knew M. de Bornier, why of course I did, he even called upon me several times, but I could never bring myself to invite him to the house because I should always have been obliged to have it disinfected afterwards with formol. As for the dinner you mean, I remember it only too well, but it was certainly not at Z\u00e9na\u00efde\u2019s, who never set eyes on Bornier in her life, and would probably think if you spoke to her of the Fille de Roland that you meant a Bonaparte Princess who was said at one time to be engaged to the son of the King of Greece; no, it was at the Austrian Embassy. Dear Hoyos imagined he was giving me a great treat by planting on the chair next to mine that pestiferous academician. I quite thought I had a squadron of mounted police sitting beside me. I was obliged to stop my nose as best I could, all through dinner; until the gruy\u00e8re came round I didn\u2019t dare to breathe.\u201d M. de Guermantes, whose secret object was attained, made a furtive examination of his guests\u2019 faces to judge the effect of the Duchess\u2019s pleasantry. \u201cYou were speaking of correspondence; I must say, I thought Gambetta\u2019s admirable,\u201d she went on, to shew that she was not afraid to be found taking an interest in a proletarian and a radical. M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, who fully appreciated the brilliance of this feat of daring, gazed round him with an eye at once flashing and affectionate, after which he wiped his monocle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGad, it\u2019s infernally dull that Fille de Roland,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, with the satisfaction which he derived from the sense of his own superiority to a work which had bored him so, perhaps also from the suave mari magno feeling one has in the middle of a good dinner, when one recalls so terrible an evening in the past. \u201cStill, there were some quite good lines in it, and a patriotic sentiment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I let it be understood that I had no admiration for M. de Bornier. \u201cIndeed! You have some fault to find with him?\u201d the Duke asked with a note of curiosity, for he always imagined when anyone spoke ill of a man that it must be on account of a personal resentment, just as to speak well of a woman marked the beginning of a love-affair. \u201cI see you\u2019ve got your knife into him. What did he do to you? You must tell us. Why yes, there must be some skeleton in the cupboard or you wouldn\u2019t run him down. It\u2019s long-winded, the Fille de Roland, but it\u2019s quite strong in parts.\u201d \u201cStrong is just the right word for an author who smelt like that,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes broke in sarcastically. \u201cIf this poor boy ever found himself face to face with him, I can quite understand that he carried away an impression in his nostrils!\u201d \u201cI must confess, though, to Ma\u2019am,\u201d the Duke went on, addressing the Princesse de Parme, \u201cthat quite apart from theFille de Roland, in literature and even in music I am terribly old-fashioned; no old nightingale can be too stale for my taste. You won\u2019t believe me, perhaps, but in the evenings, if my wife sits down to the piano, I find myself calling for some old tune by Auber or Boieldieu, or even Beethoven! That\u2019s the sort of thing that appeals to me. As for Wagner, he sends me to sleep at once.\u201d \u201cYou are wrong there,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cin spite of his insufferable long-windedness, Wagner was a genius. Lohengrin is a masterpiece. Even in Tristan there are some amusing passages scattered about. And the Chorus of Spinners in the Flying Dutchman is a perfect marvel.\u201d \u201cA\u2019n\u2019t I right, Babal,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, turning to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, \u201cwhat we like is:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Les rendez-vous de noble compagnie\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Se donnent tous en ce charmant s\u00e9jour\n\nIt\u2019s delicious. And Fra Diavolo, and the Magic Flute, and the Chalet, and the Marriage of Figaro, and the Diamants de la Couronne \u2014 there\u2019s music for you! It\u2019s the same thing in literature. For instance, I adore Balzac, theBal de Sceaux, the Mohicans de Paris.\u201d \u201cOh, my dear, if you are going to begin about Balzac, we shall never hear the end of it; do wait, keep it for some evening when M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2018s here. He\u2019s even better, he knows it all by heart.\u201d Irritated by his wife\u2019s interruption, the Duke held her for some seconds under the fire of a menacing silence. And his huntsman\u2019s eyes reminded me of a brace of loaded pistols. Meanwhile Mme. d\u2019Arpajon had been exchanging with the Princesse de Parme, upon tragic and other kinds of poetry, a series of remarks which did not reach me distinctly until I caught the following from Mme. d\u2019Arpajon: \u201cOh, Ma\u2019am is sure to be right; I quite admit he makes the world seem ugly, because he\u2019s unable to distinguish between ugliness and beauty, or rather because his insufferable vanity makes him believe that everything he says is beautiful; I agree with your Highness that in the piece we are speaking of there are some ridiculous things, quite unintelligible, errors of taste, that it is difficult to understand, that it\u2019s as much trouble to read as if it was written in Russian or Chinese, for of course it\u2019s anything in the world but French, still when one has taken the trouble, how richly one is rewarded, it\u2019s so full of imagination!\u201d Of this little lecture I had missed the opening sentences. I gathered in the end not only that the poet incapable of distinguishing between beauty and ugliness was Victor Hugo, but furthermore that the poem which was as difficult to understand as Chinese or Russian was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lorsque l\u2019enfant para\u00eet, le cercle de famille\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applaudit \u00e0 grands cris\n\nA piece dating from the poet\u2019s earliest period, and perhaps even nearer to Mme. Deshouli\u00e8res than to the Victor Hugo of the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles. Far from condemning Mme. d\u2019Arpajon as absurd, I saw her (the only one, at that table so matter-of-fact, so nondescript, at which I had sat down with such keen disappointment), I saw her in my mind\u2019s eye crowned with that lace cap, with the long spiral ringlets falling from it on either side, which was worn by Mme. de R\u00e9musat, Mme. de Broglie, Mme. de Saint-Aularie, all those distinguished women who in their fascinating letters quote with so much learning and so aptly passages from Sophocles, Schiller and theImitation, but in whom the earliest poetry of the Romantics induced the alarm and exhaustion inseparable for my grandmother from the latest verses of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. \u201cMme. d\u2019Arpajon is very fond of poetry,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme to her hostess, impressed by the ardent tone in which the speech had been delivered. \u201cNo; she knows absolutely nothing about it,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes in an undertone, taking advantage of the fact that Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, who was dealing with an objection raised by General de Beautreillis, was too much intent upon what she herself was saying to hear what was being murmured by the Duchess. \u201cShe has become literary since she\u2019s been forsaken. I can tell your Highness that it is I who have to bear the whole burden of it because it is to me that she comes in floods of tears whenever Basin hasn\u2019t been to see her, which is practically every day. And yet it isn\u2019t my fault, after all, if she bores him, and I can\u2019t force him to go to her, although I would rather he were a little more faithful to her, because then I shouldn\u2019t see quite so much of her myself. But she drives him crazy, and there\u2019s nothing extraordinary in that. She isn\u2019t a bad sort, but she\u2019s boring to a degree you can\u2019t imagine. And all this because Basin took it into his head for a year or so to play me false with her. And to have in addition a footman who has fallen in love with a little street-walker and goes about with a long face if I don\u2019t request the young person to leave her profitable pavement for half an hour and come to tea with me! Oh! Life really is too tedious!\u201d the Duchess languorously concluded. Mme. d\u2019Arpajon bored M. de Guermantes principally because he had recently fallen in love with another, whom I discovered to be the Marquise de Surgis-le-Duc. At this moment the footman who had been deprived of his holiday was waiting at table. And it struck me that, still disconsolate, he was doing it with a good deal of difficulty, for I noticed that, in handing the dish to M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault, he performed his task so awkwardly that the Duke\u2019s elbow came in contact several times with his own. The young Duke was not in the least annoyed with the blushing footman, but looked up at him rather with a smile in his clear blue eyes. This good humour seemed to me on the guest\u2019s part to betoken a kindness of heart. But the persistence of his smile led me to think that, aware of the servant\u2019s discomfiture, what he felt was perhaps really a malicious joy. \u201cBut, my dear, you know you\u2019re not revealing any new discovery when you tell us about Victor Hugo,\u201d went on the Duchess, this time addressing Mme. d\u2019Arpajon whom she had just seen turn away from the General with a troubled air. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t expect to launch that young genius. Everybody knows that he has talent. What is utterly detestable is the Victor Hugo of the last stage, the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles, I forget all their names. But in the Feuilles d\u2019Automne, the Chants du Cr\u00e9puscule, there\u2019s a great deal that\u2019s the work of a poet, a true poet! Even in theContemplations,\u201d went on the Duchess, whom none of her listeners dared to contradict, and with good reason, \u201cthere are still some quite pretty things. But I confess that I prefer not to venture farther than theCrepuscule! And then in the finer poems of Victor Hugo, and there really are some, one frequently comes across an idea, even a profound idea.\u201d And with the right shade of sentiment, bringing out the sorrowful thought with the full strength of her intonation, planting it somewhere beyond the sound of her voice, and fixing straight in front of her a charming, dreamy gaze, the Duchess said slowly: \u201cTake this:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La douleur est un fruit\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.Dieu ne le fait pas cro\u00eetre\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sur la branche trop faible encor pour le porter\n\nOr, better still:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Les morts durent bien peu\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0H\u00e9las, dans le cercueil ils tombent en poussi\u00e8re\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moins vite qu\u2019en nos coeurs!\u201d\n\nAnd, while a smile of disillusionment contracted with a graceful undulation her sorrowing lips, the Duchess fastened on Mme. d\u2019Arpajon the dreaming gaze of her charming, clear blue eyes. I was beginning to know them, as well as her voice, with its heavy drawl, its harsh savour. In those eyes and in that voice, I recognised much of the life of nature round Combray. Certainly, in the affectation with which that voice brought into prominence at times a rudeness of the soil there was more than one element: the wholly provincial origin of one branch of the Guermantes family, which had for long remained more localised, more hardy, wilder, more provoking than the rest; and also the usage of really distinguished people, and of witty people who know that distinction does not consist in mincing speech, and the usage of nobles who fraternise more readily with their peasants than with the middle classes; peculiarities all of which the regal position of Mme. de Guermantes enabled her to display more easily to bring out with every sail spread. It appears that the same voice existed also in certain of her sisters whom she detested, and who, less intelligent than herself and almost plebeianly married, if one may coin this adverb to speak of unions with obscure noblemen, entrenched on their provincial estates, or, in Paris, in a Faubourg Saint-Germain of no brilliance, possessed this voice also but had bridled it, corrected it, softened it so far as lay in their power, just as it is very rarely that any of us presumes on his own originality and does not apply himself diligently to copying the most approved models. But Oriane was so much more intelligent, so much richer, above all, so much more in fashion than her sisters, she had so effectively, when Princesse des Laumes, behaved just as she pleased in the company of the Prince of Wales, that she had realised that this discordant voice was an attraction, and had made of it, in the social order, with the courage of originality rewarded by success, what in the theatrical order a R\u00e9jane, a Jeanne Granier (which implies no comparison, naturally, between the respective merits and talents of those two actresses) had made of theirs, something admirable and distinctive which possibly certain R\u00e9jane and Granier sisters, whom no one has ever known, strove to conceal as a defect\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To all these reasons for displaying her local originality, the favourite writers of Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy \u2014 had brought in addition, with the respect for what was natural, a feeling for the prosaic by which she attained to poetry and a spirit purely of society which called up distant landscapes before my eyes. Besides, the Duchess was fully capable, adding to these influences an artistic research of her own, of having chosen for the majority of her words the pronunciation that seemed to her most \u2018He de France,\u2019 most \u2018Champenoise,\u2019 since, if not quite to the same extent as her sister-in-law Marsantes, she rarely used anything but the pure vocabulary that might have been employed by an old French writer. And when one was tired of the composite patchwork of modern speech, it was, albeit one was aware that she expressed far fewer ideas, a thorough relaxation to listen to the talk of Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 almost the same feeling, if one was alone with her and she restrained and clarified still further her flow of words, as one has on hearing an old song. Then, as I looked at, as I listened to Mme. de Guermantes, I could see, a prisoner in the perpetual and quiet afternoon of her eyes, a sky of the He de France or of Champagne spread itself, grey-blue, oblique, with the same angle of inclination as in the eyes of Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, by these several formations, Mme. de Guermantes expressed at once the most ancient aristocratic France, then, from a far later source, the manner in which the Duchesse de Broglie might have enjoyed and found fault with Victor Hugo under the July Monarchy, and, finally, a keen taste for the literature that sprang from M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Meilhac. The first of these formations attracted me more than the second, did more to console me for the disappointments of my pilgrimage to and arrival in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, so different from what I had imagined it to be; but even the second I preferred to the last. For, so long as Mme. de Guermantes was being, almost spontaneously, a Guermantes and nothing more, her Pailleronism, her taste for the younger Dumas were reflected and deliberate. As this taste was the opposite of my own, she was productive, to my mind, of literature when she talked to me of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and never seemed to me so stupidly Faubourg Saint-Germain as when she was talking literature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moved by this last quotation, Mme. d\u2019Arpajon exclaimed: \u201c\u2019Ces reliques du coeur ont aussi leur poussi\u00e8re!\u2019 Sir, you must write that down for me on my fan,\u201d she said to M. de Guermantes. \u201cPoor woman, I feel sorry for her!\u201d said the Princesse de Parme to Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cNo, really, Ma\u2019am, you must not be soft-hearted, she has only got what she deserves.\u201d \u201cBut \u2014 you\u2019ll forgive me for saying this to you \u2014 she does really love him all the same!\u201d \u201cOh, not at all; she isn\u2019t capable of it; she thinks she loves him just as she thought just now she was quoting Victor Hugo, when she repeated a line from Musset. Listen,\u201d the Duchess went on in a tone of melancholy, \u201cnobody would be more touched than myself by any true sentiment. But let me give you an instance. Only yesterday, she made a terrible scene with Basin. Your Highness thinks perhaps that it was because he\u2019s in love with other women, because he no longer loves her; not in the least, it was because he won\u2019t put her sons down for the Jockey. Does Ma\u2019am call that the behaviour of a woman in love? No; I will go farther;\u201d Mme. de Guermantes added with precision, \u201cshe is a person of singular insensibility.\u201d Meanwhile it was with an eye sparkling with satisfaction that M. de Guermantes had listened to his wife talking about Victor Hugo \u2018point-blank\u2019 and quoting his poetry. The Duchess might frequently annoy him; at moments like this he was proud of her. \u201cOriane is really extraordinary. She can talk about anything, she has read everything. She could not possibly have guessed that the conversation this evening would turn on Victor Hugo. Whatever subject you take up, she is ready for you, she can hold her own with the most learned scholars. This young man must be quite captivated.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo let us change the conversation,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes went on, \u201cbecause she\u2019s dreadfully susceptible. You will think me quite old-fashioned,\u201d she began, turning to me. \u201cI know that nowadays it\u2019s considered a weakness to care for ideas in poetry, poetry with some thought in it.\u201d \u201cOld-fashioned?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme, quivering with the slight thrill sent through her by this new wave which she had not expected, albeit she knew that the conversation of the Duchesse de Guermantes always held in store for her these continuous and delightful shocks, that breath-catching panic, that wholesome exhaustion after which her thoughts instinctively turned to the necessity of taking a footbath in a dressing cabin and a brisk walk to \u2018restore her circulation.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFor my part, no, Oriane,\u201d said Mme. de Brissac, \u201cI don\u2019t in the least object to Victor Hugo\u2019s having ideas, quite the contrary, but I do object to his seeking for them in sheer monstrosities. After all, it was he who accustomed us to ugliness in literature. There are quite enough ugly things already in real life. Why can\u2019t we be allowed at least to forget it while we are reading. A distressing spectacle, from which we should turn away in real life, that is what attracts Victor Hugo.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVictor Hugo is not as realistic as Zola though, surely?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme. The name of Zola did not stir a muscle on the face of M. de Beautreillis. The General\u2019s anti-Dreyfusism was too deep-rooted for him to seek to give expression to it. And his good-natured silence when anyone broached these topics moved the profane heart as a proof of the same delicacy that a priest shews in avoiding any reference to your religious duties, a financier when he takes care not to recommend your investing in the companies which he himself controls, a strong man when he behaves with lamblike gentleness and does not hit you in the jaw. \u201cI know you\u2019re related to Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re,\u201d was murmured to me with an air of connivance by Mme. de Varambon, the lady in waiting to the Princesse de Parme, an excellent but limited woman, procured for the Princess in the past by the Duke\u2019s mother. She had not previously uttered a word to me, and I could never afterwards, despite the admonitions of the Princess and my own protestations, get out of her mind the idea that I was in some way connected with the Academician Admiral, who was a complete stranger to me. The obstinate persistence of the Princesse de Parme\u2019s lady in waiting in seeing in me a nephew of Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re was in itself quite an ordinary form of silliness. But the mistake she made was only a crowning instance of all the other mistakes, less serious, more elaborate, unconscious or deliberate, which accompany one\u2019s name on the label which society writes out and attaches to one. I remember that a friend of the Guermantes who had expressed a keen desire to meet me gave me as the reason that I was a great friend of his cousin, Mme. de Chaussegros. \u201cShe is a charming person, she\u2019s so fond of you.\u201d I scrupulously, though quite vainly, insisted on the fact that there must be some mistake, as I did not know Mme. de Chaussegros. \u201cThen it\u2019s her sister you know; it comes to the same thing. She met you in Scotland.\u201d I had never been in Scotland, and took the futile precaution, in my honesty, of letting my informant know this. It was Mme. de Chaussegros herself who had said that she knew me, and no doubt sincerely believed it, as a result of some initial confusion, for from that time onwards she never failed to hold out her hand to me whenever she saw me. And as, after all, the world in which I moved was precisely that in which Mme. de Chaussegros moved my modesty had neither rhyme nor reason. To say that I was intimate with the Chaussegros was, literally, a mistake, but from the social point of view was to state an equivalent of my position, if one can speak of the social position of so young a man as I then was. It therefore mattered not in the least that this friend of the Guermantes should tell me only things that were false about myself, he neither lowered nor exalted me (from the worldly point of view) in the idea which he continued to hold of me. And when all is said, for those of us who are not professional actors the tedium of living always in the same character is removed for a moment, as if we were to go on the boards, when another person forms a false idea of us, imagines that we are friends with a lady whom we do not know and are reported to have met in the course of a delightful tour of a foreign country which we have never made. Errors that multiply themselves and are harmless when they have not the inflexible rigidity of this one which had been committed, and continued for the rest of her life to be committed, in spite of my denials, by the imbecile lady in waiting to Mme. de Parme, rooted for all time in the belief that I was related to the tiresome Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re. \u201cShe is not very strong in her head,\u201d the Duke confided to me, \u201cand besides, she ought not to indulge in too many libations. I fancy, she\u2019s slightly under the influence of Bacchus.\u201d As a matter of fact Mme. de Varambon had drunk nothing but water, but the Duke liked to find scope for his favourite figures of speech. \u201cBut Zola is not a realist, Ma\u2019am, he\u2019s a poet!\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, drawing inspiration from the critical essays which she had read in recent years and adapting them to her own personal genius. Agreeably buffeted hitherto, in the course of this bath of wit, a bath stirred for herself, which she was taking this evening and which, she considered, must be particularly good for her health, letting herself be swept away by the waves of paradox which curled and broke one after another, before this, the most enormous of them all, the Princesse de Parme jumped for fear of being knocked over. And it was in a choking voice, as though she were quite out of breath, that she now gasped: \u201cZola a poet!\u201d \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d answered the Duchess with a laugh, entranced by this display of suffocation. \u201cYour Highness must have remarked how he magnifies everything he touches. You will tell me that he touches just what \u2014 perish the thought! But he makes it into something colossal. His is the epic dungheap. He is the Homer of the sewers! He has not enough capitals to print Cambronne\u2019s word.\u201d Despite the extreme exhaustion which she was beginning to feel, the Princess was enchanted; never had she felt better. She would not have exchanged for an invitation to Schonbrunn, albeit that was the one thing that really flattered her, these divine dinner-parties at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s, made invigorating by so liberal a dose of attic salt. \u201cHe writes it with a big C,\u201d cried Mme. d\u2019Arpajon. \u201cSurely with a big M, I think, my dear,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, exchanging first with her husband a merry glance which implied: \u201cDid you ever hear such an idiot?\u201d \u201cWait a minute, now.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes turned to me, fixing on me a tender, smiling gaze, because, as an accomplished hostess, she was anxious to display her own knowledge of the artist who interested me specially, to give me, if I required it, an opportunity for exhibiting mine. \u201cWait,\u201d she urged me, gently waving her feather fan, so conscious was she at this moment that she was performing in full the duties of hospitality, and, that she might be found wanting in none of them, making a sign also to the servants to help me to more of the asparagus and mousseline sauce: \u201cwait, now, I do believe that Zola has actually written an essay on Elstir, the painter whose things you were looking at just now \u2014 the only ones of his, really, that I care for,\u201d she concluded. As a matter of fact sh hated Elstir\u2019s work, but found a unique quality in anything that was in her own house. I asked M. de Guermantes if he knew the name of the gentleman in the tall hat who figured in the picture of the crowd and whom I recognised as the same person whose portrait the Guermantes also had and had hung beside the other, both dating more or less from the same early period in which Elstir\u2019s personality was not yet completely established and he derived a certain inspiration from Manet. \u201cGood Lord, yes,\u201d he replied, \u201cI know it\u2019s a fellow who is quite well-known and no fool either in his own line, but I have no head for names. I have it on the tip of my tongue, Monsieur. . . . Monsieur. . . . oh, well, it doesn\u2019t matter, I can\u2019t remember it. Swann would be able to tell you, it was he who made Mme. de Guermantes buy all that stuff; she is always too good-natured, afraid of hurting people\u2019s feelings if she refuses to do things; between ourselves, I believe he\u2019s landed us with a lot of rubbish. What I can tell you is that the gentleman you mean has been a sort of Maecenas to M. Elstir, he started him and has often helped him out of tight places by ordering pictures from him. As a compliment to this man \u2014 if you can call that sort of thing a compliment \u2014 he has painted him standing about among that crowd, where with his Sunday-go-to-meeting look he creates a distinctly odd effect. He may be a big gun in his own way but he is evidently not aware of the proper time and place for a top hat. With that thing on his head, among all those bare-headed girls, he looks like a little country lawyer on the razzle-dazzle. But tell me, you seem quite gone on his pictures. If I had only known, I should have got up the subject properly. Not that there\u2019s any need to rack one\u2019s brains over the meaning of M. Elstir\u2019s work, as one would for Ingres\u2019s Source or the Princes in the Towier by Paul Delaroche. What one appreciates in his work is that it\u2019s shrewdly observed, amusing, Parisian, and then one passes on to the next thing. One doesn\u2019t need to be an expert to look at that sort of thing. I know of course that they\u2019re merely sketches, still, I don\u2019t feel myself that he puts enough work into them. Swann was determined that we should buy aBundle of Asparagus. In fact it was in the house for several days. There was nothing else in the picture, a bundle of asparagus exactly like what you\u2019re eating now. But I must say I declined to swallow M. Elstir\u2019s asparagus. He asked three hundred francs for them. Three hundred francs for a bundle of asparagus. A louis, that\u2019s as much as they\u2019re worth, even if they are out of season. I thought it a bit stiff. When he puts real people into his pictures as well, there\u2019s something rather caddish, something detrimental about him which does not appeal to me. I am surprised to see a delicate mind, a superior brain like yours admire that sort of thing.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why you should say that, Basin,\u201d interrupted the Duchess, who did not like to hear people run down anything that her rooms contained. \u201cI am by no means prepared to admit that there\u2019s nothing distinguished in Elstir\u2019s pictures. You have to take it or leave it. But it\u2019s not always lacking in talent. And you must admit that the ones I bought are singularly beautiful.\u201d \u201cWell, Oriane, in that style of thing I\u2019d a thousand times rather have the little study by M. Vibert we saw at the water-colour exhibition. There\u2019s nothing much in it, if you like, you could take it in the palm of your hand, but you can see the man\u2019s clever through and through: that unwashed scarecrow of a missionary standing before the sleek prelate who is making his little dog do tricks, it\u2019s a perfect little poem of subtlety, and in fact goes really deep.\u201d \u201cI believe you know M. Elstir,\u201d the Duchess went on to me, \u201cas a man, he\u2019s quite pleasant.\u201d \u201cHe is intelligent,\u201d said the Duke; \u201cone is surprised, when one talks to him, that his painting should be so vulgar.\u201d \u201cHe is more than intelligent, he is really quite clever,\u201d said the Duchess in the confidently critical tone of a person who knew what she was talking about. \u201cDidn\u2019t he once start a portrait of you, Oriane?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme. \u201cYes, in shrimp pink,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cbut that\u2019s not going to hand his name down to posterity. It\u2019s a ghastly thing; Basin wanted to have it destroyed.\u201d This last statement was one which Mme. de Guermantes often made. But at other times her appreciation of the picture was different: \u201cI do not care for his painting, but he did once do a good portrait of me.\u201d The former of these judgments was addressed as a rule to people who spoke to the Duchess of her portrait, the other to those who did not refer to it and whom therefore she was anxious to inform of its existence. The former was inspired in her by coquetry, the latter by vanity. \u201cMake a portrait of you look ghastly! Why, then it can\u2019t be a portrait, it\u2019s a falsehood; I don\u2019t know one end of a brush from the other, but I\u2019m sure if I were to paint you, merely putting you down as I see you, I should produce a masterpiece,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme ingenuously. \u201cHe sees me probably as I see myself, without any allurements,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, with the look, melancholy, modest and coaxing, which seemed to her best calculated to make her appear different from what Elstir had portrayed. \u201cThat portrait ought to appeal to Mme. de Gallardon,\u201d said the Duke. \u201cBecause she knows nothing about pictures?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme, who knew that Mme. de Guermantes had an infinite contempt for her cousin. \u201cBut she\u2019s a very good woman, isn\u2019t she?\u201d The Duke assumed an air of profound astonishment. \u201cWhy, Basin, don\u2019t you see the Princess is making fun of you?\u201d (The Princess had never dreamed of doing such a thing.) \u201cShe knows as well as you do that Gallardonette is an old poison,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, whose vocabulary, limited as a rule to all these old expressions, was as savoury as those dishes which it is possible to come across in the delicious books of Pampille, but which have in real life become so rare, dishes where the jellies, the butter, the gravy, the quails are all genuine, permit of no alloy, where even the salt is brought specially from the salt-marshes of Brittany; from her accent, her choice of words, one felt that the basis of the Duchess\u2019s conversation came directly from Guermantes. In this way the Duchess differed profoundly from her nephew Saint-Loup, the prey of so many new ideas and expressions; it is difficult, when one\u2019s mind is troubled by the ideas of Kant and the longings of Baudelaire, to write the exquisite French of Henri IV, which meant that the very purity of the Duchess\u2019s language was a sign of limitation, and that, in her, both her intelligence and her sensibility had remained proof against all innovation. Here again, Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s mind attracted me just because of what it excluded was exactly the content of my own thoughts) and by everything which by virtue of that exclusion, it had been able to preserve, that seductive vigour of the supple bodies which no exhausting necessity to think no moral anxiety or nervous trouble has deformed. Her mind, of a formation so anterior to my own, was for me the equivalent of what had been offered me by the procession of the girls of the little band along the seashore Mme. de Guermantes offered me, domesticated and held in subjection by her natural courtesy, by the respect due to another person\u2019s intellectual worth, all the energy and charm of a cruel little girl of one of the noble families round Combray who from her childhood had been brought up in the saddle, tortured cats, gouged out the eyes of rabbits, and; albeit she had remained a pillar of virtue, might equally well have been, a good few years ago now, the most brilliant mistress of the Prince de Sagan. Only she was incapable of realising what I had sought for in her, the charm of her historic name, and the tiny quantity of it that I had found in her, a rustic survival from Guermantes. Were our relations founded upon a misunderstanding which could not fail to become manifest as soon as my homage, instead of being addressed to the relatively superior woman that she believed herself to be, should be diverted to some other woman of equal mediocrity and breathing the same unconscious charm? A misunderstanding so entirely natural, and one that will always exist between a young dreamer like myself and a woman of the world, one however that profoundly disturbs him, so long as he has not yet discovered the nature of his imaginative faculties and has not acquired his share of the inevitable disappointments which he is destined to find in people, as in the theatre, in his travels and indeed in love. M. de Guermantes having declared (following upon Elstir\u2019s asparagus and those that were brought round after the financi\u00e8re chicken) that green asparagus grown in the open air, which, as has been so quaintly said by the charming writer who signs himself E. de Clermont-Tonnerre, \u201chave not the impressive rigidity of their sisters,\u201d ought to be eaten with eggs: \u201cOne man\u2019s meat is another man\u2019s poison, as they say,\u201d replied M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. \u201cIn the province of Canton, in China, the greatest delicacy that can be set before one is a dish of ortolan\u2019s eggs completely rotten.\u201d M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, the author of an essay on the Mormons which had appeared in the Revue des Deux Mondes, moved in none but the most aristocratic circles, but among these visited only such as had a certain reputation for intellect, with the result that from his presence, were it at all regular, in a woman\u2019s house one could tell that she had a \u2018salon.\u2019 He pretended to a loathing of society, and assured each of his duchesses in turn that it was for the sake of her wit and beauty that he came to see her. They all believed him. Whenever, with death in his heart, he resigned himself to attending a big party at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s, he summoned them all to accompany him, to keep up his courage, and thus appeared only to be moving in the midst of an intimate group. So that his reputation as an intellectual might survive his worldly success, applying certain maxims of the Guermantes spirit, he would set out with ladies of fashion on long scientific expeditions at the height of the dancing season, and when a woman who was a snob, and consequently still without any definite position, began to go everywhere, he would put a savage obstinacy into his refusal to know her, to allow himself to be introduced to her. His hatred of snobs was a derivative of his snobbishness, but made the simpletons (in other words, everyone) believe that he was immune from snobbishness. \u201cBabal always knows everything,\u201d exclaimed the Duchesse de Guermantes. \u201cI think it must be charming, a country where you can be quite sure that your dairyman will supply you with really rotten eggs, eggs of the year of the comet. I can see myself dipping my bread and butter in them. I must say, you get the same thing at aunt Madeleine\u2019s\u201d (Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s) \u201cwhere everything\u2019s served in a state of putrefaction, eggs included.\u201d Then, as Mme. d\u2019Arpajon protested, \u201cBut my dear Phili, you know it as well as I do. You can see the chicken in the egg. What I can\u2019t understand is how they manage not to fall out. It\u2019s not an omelette you get there, it\u2019s a poultry-yard. You were so wise not to come to dinner there yesterday, there was a brill cooked in carbolic! I assure you, it wasn\u2019t a dinner-table, it was far more like an operating-table. Really, Norpois carries loyalty to the pitch of heroism. He actually asked for more!\u201d \u201cI believe I saw you at dinner there the time she made that attack on M. Bloch\u201d (M. de Guermantes, perhaps to give to an Israelite name a more foreign sound, pronounced the \u2018ch\u2019 in Bloch not like a \u2018k\u2019 but as in the German \u2018hoch\u2019) \u201cwhen he said about some poit\u201d (poet) \u201cor other that he was sublime. Ch\u00e2tellerault did his best to break M. Bloch\u2019s shins, the fellow didn\u2019t understand in the least and thought my nephew\u2019s kick was aimed at a young woman sitting opposite him.\u201d (At this point, M. de Guermantes coloured slightly.) \u201cHe did not realise that he was annoying our aunt by his \u2018sublimes\u2019 chucked about all over the place like that. In short, aunt Madeleine, who doesn\u2019t keep her tongue in her pocket, turned on him with: \u2018Indeed, Sir, and what epithet do you keep for M. de Bousset?\u2019\u201d (M. de Guermantes thought that, when one mentioned a famous name, the use of \u2018Monsieur\u2019 and a particle was eminently \u2018old school.\u2019) \u201cThat put him in his place, all right.\u201d \u201cAnd what answer did this M. Bloch make?\u201d came in a careless tone from Mme. de Guermantes, who, running short for the moment of original ideas, felt that she must copy her husband\u2019s teutonic pronunciation. \u201cAh! I can assure you, M. Bloch did not wait for any more, he\u2019s still running.\u201d \u201cYes, I remember quite well seeing you there that evening,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes with emphasis as though, coming from her, there must be something in this reminiscence highly flattering to myself. \u201cIt is always so interesting at my aunt\u2019s. At the last party she gave, which was, of course, when I met you, I meant to ask you whether that old gentleman who went past where we were, sitting wasn\u2019t Fran\u00e7ois Copp\u00e9e. You must know who everyone is,\u201d she went on, sincerely envious of my relations with poets and poetry, and also out of \u2018consideration\u2019 for myself, the wish to establish in a better position in the eyes of her other guests a young man so well versed in literature. I assured the Duchess that I had not observed any celebrities at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s party. \u201cWhat!\u201d she replied with a bewilderment which revealed that her respect for men of letters and her contempt for society were more superficial than she said, perhaps even than she thought, \u201cWhat! There were no famous authors there! You astonish me! Why, I saw all sorts of quite impossible people!\u201d I remembered the evening in question distinctly owing to an entirely trivial incident that had occurred at the party. Mme. de Villeparisis had introduced Bloch to Mme. Alphonse de Rothschild, but my friend had not caught the name and, thinking he was talking to an old English lady who was a trifle mad had replied only in monosyllables to the garrulous conversation of the historic beauty, when Mme. de Villeparisis in making her known to some one else uttered, quite distinctly this time: \u201cThe Baronne Alphonse de Rothschild.\u201d Thereupon there had coursed suddenly and simultaneously through Bloch\u2019s arteries so many ideas of millions and of social importance, which it would have been more prudent to subdivide and separate, that he had undergone, so to speak, a momentary failure of heart and brain alike, and cried aloud in the dear old lady\u2019s presence: \u201cIf I\u2019d only known!\u201d an exclamation the silliness of which kept him from sleeping for at least a week afterwards. His remark was of no great interest, but I remembered it as a proof that sometimes in this life, under the stress of an exceptional emotion, people do say what is in their minds. \u201cI fancy Mme. de Villeparisis is not absolutely . . . moral,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, who knew that the best people did not visit the Duchess\u2019s aunt, and, from what the Duchess herself had just been saying, that one might speak freely about her. But, Mme. de Guermantes not seeming to approve of this criticism, she hastened to add: \u201cThough, of course, intellect carried to that degree excuses everything.\u201d \u201cBut you take the same view of my aunt that everyone else does,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cwhich is, really, quite mistaken. It\u2019s just what M\u00e9m\u00e9 was saying to me only yesterday.\u201d She blushed; a reminiscence unknown to me filmed her eyes. I formed the supposition that M. de Charlus had asked her to cancel my invitation, as he had sent Robert to ask me not to go to her house. I had the impression that the blush \u2014 equally incomprehensible to me \u2014 which had tinged the Duke\u2019s cheek when he made some reference to his brother could not be attributed to the same cause. \u201cMy poor aunt \u2014 she will always have the reputation of being a lady of the old school, of sparkling wit and uncontrolled passions. And really there\u2019s no more middle-class, serious, commonplace mind in Paris. She will go down as a patron of the arts, which means to say that she was once the mistress of a great painter, though he was never able to make her understand what a picture was; and as for her private life, so far from being a depraved woman, she was so much made for marriage, so conjugal from her cradle that, not having succeeded in keeping a husband, who incidentally was a cad, she has never had a love-affair which she hasn\u2019t taken just as seriously as if it were holy matrimony, with the same susceptibilities, the same quarrels, the same fidelity. By which token, those relations are often the most sincere; you\u2019ll find, in fact, more inconsolable lovers than husbands.\u201d \u201cYet, Oriane, if you take the case of your brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de you were speaking about just now; no mistress in the world could ever dream of being mourned as that poor Mme. de Charlus has been.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cYour Highness must permit me to be not altogether of her opinion. People don\u2019t all like to be mourned in the same way, each of us has his preferences.\u201d \u201cStill, he did make a regular cult of her after her death. It is true that people sometimes do for the dead what they would not have done for the living.\u201d \u201cFor one thing,\u201d retorted Mme. de Guermantes in a dreamy tone which belied her teasing purpose, \u201cwe go to their funerals, which we never do for the living!\u201d M. de Guermantes gave a sly glance at M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 as though to provoke him into laughter at the Duchess\u2019s wit. \u201cAt the same time I frankly admit,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cthat the manner in which I should like to be mourned by a man I loved would not be that adopted by my brother-in-law.\u201d The Duke\u2019s face darkened. He did not like to hear his wife utter rash judgments, especially about M. de Charlus. \u201cYou are very particular. His grief set an example to everyone,\u201d he reproved her stiffly. But the Duchess had in dealing with her husband that sort of boldness which animal tamers shew, or people who live with a madman and are not afraid of making him angry. \u201cOh, very well, just as you like \u2014 he does set an example, I never said he didn\u2019t, he goes every day to the cemetery to tell her how many people he has had to luncheon, he misses her enormously, but \u2014 as he\u2019d mourn for a cousin, a grandmother, a sister. It is not the grief of a husband. It is true that they were a pair of saints, which makes it all rather exceptional.\u201d M. de Guermantes, infuriated by his wife\u2019s chatter, fixed on her with a terrible immobility a pair of eyes already loaded. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to say anything against poor M\u00e9m\u00e9, who, by the way, could not come this evening,\u201d went on the Duchess, \u201cI quite admit there\u2019s no one like him, he\u2019s delightful; he has a delicacy, a warmth of heart that you don\u2019t as a rule find in men. He has a woman\u2019s heart, M\u00e9m\u00e9 has!\u201d \u201cWhat you say is absurd,\u201d M. de Guermantes broke in sharply. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing effeminate about M\u00e9m\u00e9, I know nobody so manly as he is.\u201d \u201cBut I am not suggesting that he\u2019s the least bit in the world effeminate. Do at least take the trouble to understand what I say,\u201d retorted the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s always like that the moment anyone mentions his brother,\u201d she added, turning to the Princesse de Parme. \u201cIt\u2019s very charming, it\u2019s a pleasure to hear him. There\u2019s nothing so nice as two brothers who are fond of each other,\u201d replied the Princess, as many a humbler person might have replied, for it is possible to belong to a princely race by birth and at the same time to be mentally affiliated to a race that is thoroughly plebeian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs we\u2019re discussing your family, Oriane,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cI saw your nephew Saint-Loup yesterday; I believe he wants to ask you to do something for him.\u201d The Duc de Guermantes bent his Olympian brow. When he did not himself care to do a service, he preferred his wife not to assume the responsibility for it, knowing that it would come to the same thing in the end and that the people to whom the Duchess would be obliged to apply would put this concession down to the common account of the household, just as much as if it had been asked of them by the husband alone. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell me about it himself?\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cHe was here yesterday and stayed a couple of hours, and heaven only knows what a bore he managed to make himself. He would be no stupider than anyone else if he had only the sense, like many people we know, to be content with being a fool. It\u2019s his veneer of knowledge that\u2019s so terrible. He wants to preserve an open mind \u2014 open to all the things he doesn\u2019t understand. He talks to you about Morocco. It\u2019s appalling.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe can\u2019t go back there, because of Rachel,\u201d said the Prince de Foix \u201cSurely, now that they\u2019ve broken it off,\u201d interrupted M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. \u201cSo far from breaking it off, I found her a couple of days ago in Robert\u2019s rooms, they didn\u2019t look at all like people who\u2019d quarrelled, I can assure you,\u201d replied the Prince de Foix, who loved to spread abroad every rumour that could damage Robert\u2019s chances of marrying, and might for that matter have been misled by one of the intermittent resumptions of a connexion that was practically at an end\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat Rachel was speaking to me about you, I see her like that in the mornings, on the way to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es; she\u2019s a kind of head-in-air, as you say, what you call \u2018unlaced,\u2019 a sort of \u2018Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias,\u2019 only figuratively speaking, of course.\u201d This speech was addressed to me by Prince Von, who liked always to appear conversant with French literature and Parisian catchwords\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, that\u2019s just what it was \u2014 Morocco!\u201d exclaimed the Princess, flinging herself into this opening. \u201cWhat on earth can he want in Morocco?\u201d asked M. de Guermantes sternly; \u201cOriane can do absolutely nothing for him there, as he knows perfectly well.\u201d \u201cHe thinks he invented strategy,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes pursued the theme, \u201cand then he uses impossible words for the most trivial things, which doesn\u2019t prevent him from making blots all over his letters. The other day he announced that he\u2019d been given some sublime potatoes, and that he\u2019d taken a sublime stage box.\u201d \u201cHe speaks Latin,\u201d the Duke went one better. \u201cWhat! Latin?\u201d the Princesse gasped. \u201c\u2018Pon my soul he does! Ma\u2019am can ask Oriane if I\u2019m not telling the truth.\u201d \u201cWhy, of course, Ma\u2019am; the other day he said to us straight out, without stopping to think: \u2018I know of no more touching example of sic transit gloria mundi.\u2019 I can repeat the phrase now to your Highness because, after endless inquiries and by appealing to linguists, we succeeded in reconstructing it, but Robert flung it out without pausing for breath, one could hardly make out that there was Latin in it, he was just like a character in the Malade Imaginaire. And all this referred simply to the death of the Empress of Austria!\u201d \u201cPoor woman!\u201d cried the Princess, \u201cwhat a delicious creature she was.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201ca trifle mad, a trifle headstrong, but she was a thoroughly good woman, a nice, kind-hearted lunatic; the only thing I could never make out about her was why she had never managed to get her teeth made to fit her; they always came loose half-way through a sentence and she was obliged to stop short or she\u2019d have swallowed them.\u201d \u201cThat Rachel was speaking to me about you, she told me that young Saint-Loup worshipped you, that he was fonder of you than he was of her,\u201d said Prince Von to me, devouring his food like an ogre as he spoke, his face scarlet, his teeth bared by his perpetual grin. \u201cBut in that case she must be jealous of me and hate me,\u201d said I. \u201cNot at all, she told me all sorts of nice things about you. The Prince de Foix\u2019s mistress would perhaps be jealous if he preferred you to her. You don\u2019t understand? Come home with me, and I\u2019ll explain it all to you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t, I\u2019m going on to M. de Charlus at eleven.\u201d \u201cWhy, he sent round to me yesterday to ask me to dine with him this evening, but told me not to come after a quarter to eleven. But if you must go to him, at least come with me as far as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, you will be in the periphery,\u201d said the Prince, who thought doubtless that this last word meant \u2018proximity\u2019 or possibly \u2018centre.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the bulging eyes in his coarse though handsome red face frightened me and I declined, saying that a friend was coming to call for me. This reply seemed to me in no way offensive. The Prince, however, apparently formed a different impression of it for he did not say another word to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI really must go and see the Queen of Naples; what a grief it must be to her,\u201d said (or at least appeared to me to have said) the Princesse de Parme. For her words had come to me only indistinctly through the intervening screen of those addressed to me, albeit in an undertone, by Prince Von, who had doubtless been afraid, if he spoke louder, of being overheard by the Prince de Foix. \u201cOh, dear, no!\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it has been any grief at all.\u201d \u201cNone at all! You do always fly to extremes so, Oriane,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, resuming his part of the cliff which by standing up to the wave forces it to fling higher its crest of foam. \u201cBasin knows even better than I that I\u2019m telling the truth,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cbut he thinks he\u2019s obliged to look severe because you are present, Ma\u2019am, and he\u2019s afraid of my shocking you.\u201d \u201cOh, please, no, I beg of you,\u201d cried the Princesse de Parme, dreading the slightest alteration on her account of these delicious Fridays at the Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019s, this forbidden fruit which the Queen of Sweden herself had not yet acquired the right to taste. \u201cWhy, it was Basin himself that she told, when he said to her with a duly sorrowful expression: \u2018But the Queen is in mourning; for whom, pray, is it a great grief to your Majesty?\u2019\u2014\u2018No, it\u2019s not a deep mourning, it\u2019s a light mourning, quite a light mourning, it\u2019s my sister.\u2019 The truth is, she\u2019s delighted about it, as Basin knows perfectly well, she invited us to a party that very evening, and gave me two pearls. I wish she could lose a sister every day! So far from weeping for her sister\u2019s death, she was in fits of laughter over it. She probably says to herself, like Robert, \u2018sic transit \u2014\u2014\u2019 I forget how it goes on,\u201d she added modestly, knowing how it went on perfectly well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In saying all this Mme. de Guermantes was only being witty, and with complete insincerity, for the Queen of Naples, like the Duchesse d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, also doomed to a tragic fate, had the warmest heart in the world and mourned quite sincerely for her kinsfolk. Mme. de Guermantes knew those noble Bavarian sisters, her cousins, too well not to be aware of this. \u201cHe would like not to go back to Morocco,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, alighting hurriedly again upon the perch of Robert\u2019s name which had been held out to her, quite unintentionally, by Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cI believe you know General de Monserfeuil.\u201d \u201cVery slightly,\u201d replied the Duchess, who was an intimate friend of the officer in question. The Princess explained what it was that Saint-Loup wanted. \u201cGood gracious, yes, if I see him \u2014 it is possible that I may meet him,\u201d the Duchess replied, so as not to appear to be refusing, the occasions of her meeting General de Monserfeuil seeming to extend rapidly farther apart as soon as it became a question of her asking him for anything. This uncertainty did not, however, satisfy the Duke, who interrupted his wife: \u201cYou know perfectly well you won\u2019t seeing him, Oriane, and besides you have already asked him for two thing which he hasn\u2019t done. My wife has a passion for doing good turns to people,\u201d he went on, growing more and more furious, in order to force the Princess to withdraw her request, without there being any question made of his wife\u2019s good nature and so that Mme. de Parme should throw the blame back upon his own character, which was essentially obstructive. \u201cRobert could get anything he wanted out of Monserfeuil. Only, as he happens not to know himself what he wants, he gets us to ask for it because he knows there\u2019s no better way of making the whole thing fall through. Oriane has asked too many favours of Monserfeuil. A request from her now would be a reason for him to refuse.\u201d \u201cOh, in that case, it would be better if the Duchess did nothing,\u201d said Mme. de Parme\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cObviously!\u201d the Duke closed the discussion. \u201cPoor General, he\u2019s been defeated again at the elections,\u201d said the Princess, so as to turn the conversation from Robert. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing serious, it\u2019s only the seventh time,\u201d said the Duke, who, having been obliged himself to retire from politics, quite enjoyed hearing of other people\u2019s failures at the polls. \u201cHe has consoled himself by giving his wife another baby.\u201d \u201cWhat! Is that poor Mme. de Monserfeuil in an interesting condition again?\u201d cried the Princess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d replied the Duke, \u201cthat\u2019s the one division where the poor General has never failed to get in.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the period that followed I was continually to be invited, were it with a small party only, to these repasts at which I had at one time imagined the guests as seated like the Apostles in the Sainte-Chapelle. They did assemble there indeed, like the early Christians, not to partake merely of a material nourishment, which incidentally was exquisite, but in a sort of social Eucharist; so that in the course of a few dinner-parties I assimilated the acquaintance of all the friends of my hosts, friends to whom they presented me with a shade of benevolent patronage so marked (as a person for whom they had always had a sort of parental affection) that there was not one among them who would not have felt himself to be failing in his duty to the Duke and Duchess if he had given a ball without including my name on his list, and at the same time, while I sipped one of those Yquems which lay concealed in the Guermantes cellars, I tasted ortolans dressed according to each of the different recipes which the Duke himself used to elaborate and modified with prudence. However, for one who had already set his knees more than once beneath the mystic board, the consumption of the latter was not indispensable. Old friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes came in to see them after dinner, \u2018with the tooth-picks,\u2019 as Mme. Swann would have said, without being expected, and took in winter a cup of tilleul in the lighted warmth of the great drawing-room, in summer a glass of orangeade in the darkness of the little rectangular strip of garden outside. There was no record of anything else, among the Guermantes, in these evenings in the garden, but orangeade. It had a sort of ritual meaning. To have added other refreshments would have seemed to be falsifying the tradition, just as a big at-home in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ceases to be an at-home if there is a play also, or music. You must be supposed to have come simply \u2014 though there be five hundred of you \u2014 to pay a call on, let us say, the Princesse de Guermantes. People marvelled at my influence because I was able to procure the addition to this orangeade of a jug containing the juice of stewed cherries or stewed pears. I took a dislike on this account to the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, who was like all the people who, lacking in imagination but not in covetousness, take a keen interest in what one is drinking and ask if they may taste a little of it themselves. Which meant that, every time, M. d\u2019Agrigente, by diminishing my ration, spoiled my pleasure. For this fruit juice can never be provided in sufficient quantities to quench one\u2019s thirst for it. Nothing is less cloying than these transpositions into flavour of the colour of a fruit which when cooked seems to have travelled backwards to the past season of its blossoming. Blushing like an orchard in spring, or, it may be, colourless and cool like the zephyr beneath the fruit-trees, the juice lets itself be breathed and gazed into one drop by drop, and M. d\u2019Agrigente prevented me, regularly, from taking my fill of it. Despite these distillations the traditional orangeade persisted like the tilleul. In these humble kinds, the social communion was none the less administered. In this respect, doubtless, the friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes had, after all, as I had originally imagined, remained more different from the rest of humanity than their outward appearance might have misled me into supposing. Numbers of elderly men came to receive from the Duchess, together with the invariable drink, a welcome that was often far from cordial. Now this could not have been due to snobbishness, they themselves being of a rank to which there was none superior; nor to love of splendour; they did love it perhaps, but on less stringent social conditions might have been enjoying a glittering example of it, for on these same evenings the charming wife of a colossally rich financier would have given anything in the world to have them among the brilliant shooting-party she was giving for a couple of days for the King of Spain. They had nevertheless declined her invitation, and had come round without fail to inquire whether Mme. de Guermantes was at home. They were not even certain of finding there opinions that conformed entirely with their own, or sentiments of any great warmth; Mme. de Guermantes let fall now and then, on the Dreyfus case, on the Republic, the Laws against Religion, or even in an undertone on themselves, their weaknesses, the dullness of their conversation, comments which they had to appear not to notice. No doubt, if they kept up their habit of coming there, it was owing to their superfine training as epicures in things worldly, to their clear consciousness of the prime and perfect quality of the social dish, with its familiar, reassuring, sappy savour, free from blend or taint, with the origin and history of which they were as well aware as she who served them with it, remaining more \u2018noble\u2019 in this respect than they themselves imagined. Now, on this occasion, among the visitors to whom I was introduced after dinner, it so happened that there was that General de Monserfeuil of whom the Princesse de Parme had been speaking, while Mme. de Guermantes, of whose drawing-room he was one of the regular frequenters, had not known that he was going to be there that evening. He bowed before me, on hearing my name, as though I had been the President of the Supreme War Council. I had supposed it to be simply from some deep-rooted unwillingness to oblige, in which the Duke, as in wit if not in love, was his wife\u2019s accomplice, that the Duchess had practically refused to recommend her nephew to M. de Monserfeuil. And I saw in this an indifference all the more blameworthy in that I seemed to have gathered from a few words let fall by the Princess that Robert was in a post of danger from which it would be prudent to have him removed. But it was by the genuine malice of Mme. de Guermantes that I was revolted when, the Princesse de Parme having timidly suggested that she might say something herself and on her own responsibility to the General, the Duchess did everything in her power to dissuade her. \u201cBut Ma\u2019am,\u201d she cried, \u201cMonserfeuil has no sort of standing or influence whatever with the new Government. You would be wasting your breath.\u201d \u201cI think he can hear us,\u201d murmured the Princess, as a hint to the Duchess not to speak so loud. Without lowering her voice: \u201cYour Highness need not be afraid, he\u2019s as deaf as a post,\u201d said the Duchess, every word reaching the General distinctly. \u201cThe thing is, I believe M. de Saint-Loup is in a place that is not very safe,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cWhat is one to do?\u201d replied the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s in the same boat as everybody else, the only difference being that it was he who originally asked to be sent there. Besides, no, it\u2019s not really dangerous; if it was, you can imagine how anxious I should be to help. I, should have spoken to Saint-Joseph about it during dinner. He has far more influence, and he\u2019s a real worker. But, as you see, he\u2019s gone now. Still, asking him would be less awkward than going to this one, who has; three of his sons in Morocco just now and has refused to apply for them to be exchanged; he might raise that as an objection. Since your Highness insists on it, I shall speak to Saint-Joseph \u2014 if I see him again, or to Beautreillis. But if I don\u2019t see either of them, you mustn\u2019t waste your pity on Robert. It was explained to us the other day exactly where he is. I\u2019m sure he couldn\u2019t wish for a better place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a pretty flower, I\u2019ve never seen one like it; there\u2019s no one like you, Oriane, for having such marvellous things in your house,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, who, fearing that General de Monserfeuil might have overheard the Duchess, sought now to change the conversation. I looked and recognised a plant of the sort that I had watched Elstir painting. \u201cI am so glad you like them; they are charming, do look at their little purple velvet collars; the only thing against them is \u2014 as may happen with people who are very pretty and very nicely dressed \u2014 they have a hideous name and a horrid smell. In spite of which I am very fond of them. But what is rather sad is that they are dying.\u201d \u201cBut they\u2019re growing in a pot, they aren\u2019t cut flowers,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cNo,\u201d answered the Duchess with a smile, \u201cbut it comes to the same thing, as they\u2019re all ladies. It\u2019s a kind of plant where the ladies and the gentlemen don\u2019t both grow on the same stalk. I\u2019m like people who keep a lady dog. I have to find a husband for my flowers. Otherwise I shan\u2019t have any young ones!\u201d \u201cHow very strange. Do you mean to say that in nature . . .?\u201d \u201cYes! There are certain insects whose duty it is to bring about the marriage, as they do with Sovereigns, by proxy, without the bride and bridegroom ever having set eyes on one another. And so, I assure you, I always tell my man to put my plant out in the window as often as possible, on the courtyard side and the garden side turn about, in the hope that the necessary insect will arrive. But the odds are too great. Fancy, he has first to have been seen by a person of the same species and the opposite sex, and he must then have taken it into his head to come and leave cards at the house. He hasn\u2019t appeared so far, I believe my plant can still qualify for the white flower of a blameless life, but I must say a little immodesty would please me better. It\u2019s just the same with that fine tree we have in the courtyard; he will die childless because he belongs to a kind that\u2019s very rare in these latitudes. In his case, it\u2019s the wind that\u2019s responsible for consummating the marriage, but the wall is a trifle high.\u201d \u201cBy Jove, yes,\u201d said M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, \u201cyou ought to take just a couple of inches off the top, that will be quite enough. There are certain operations one ought to know how to perform. The flavour of vanilla we tasted in the excellent ice you gave us this evening, Duchess, comes from a plant called the vanilla tree. This plant produces flowers which are both male and female, but a sort of solid wall set up between them prevents any communication. And so we could never get any fruit from them until a young Negro, a native of R\u00e9union, by the name of Albins, which by the way is rather an odd name for a black man since it means \u2018white,\u2019 had the happy thought of using the point of a needle to bring the separate organs into contact.\u201d \u201cBabal, you\u2019re divine, you know everything,\u201d cried the Duchess. \u201cBut you yourself, Oriane, have told me things I had no idea of,\u201d the Princesse de Parme assured her. \u201cI must explain to your Highness that it is Swann who has always talked to me all about botany. Sometimes when we were too bored to go to a tea-party or a concert we would set off for the country, and he would shew me extraordinary marriages between flowers, which was far more amusing than going to human marriages \u2014 no wedding-breakfast and no crowd in the sacristy. We never had time to go very far. Now that motor-cars have come in, it Would be delightful. Unfortunately, in the interval he himself has made an even more astonishing marriage, which makes everything very difficult. Oh, Ma\u2019am, life is a dreadful business, we spend our whole time doing things that bore us, and when by mere chance we come across somebody with whom we could go and look at something really interesting, he has to make a marriage like Swann\u2019s. Faced with the alternatives of giving up my botanical expeditions and being obliged to call upon a degrading person, I chose the former calamity. Besides, when it comes to that, there was no need to go quite so far. It seems that here, in my own little bit of garden, more odd things happen in broad daylight than at midnight \u2014 in the Bois de Boulogne! Only they attract no attention, because among flowers it\u2019s all done quite simply, you see a little orange shower, or else a very dusty fly coming to wipe its feet or take a bath before crawling into a flower. And that does the trick!\u201d \u201cThe cabinet the plant is standing on is splendid, too; it\u2019s Empire, I think,\u201d said the Princess, who, not being familiar with the works of Darwin and his followers, was unable to grasp the point of the Duchess\u2019s pleasantries. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m so glad Ma\u2019am likes it,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cit\u2019s a magnificent piece. I must tell you that I\u2019ve always adored the Empire style, even when it wasn\u2019t in fashion. I remember at Guermantes I got into terrible disgrace with my mother-in-law because I told them to bring down from the attics all the splendid Empire furniture Basin had inherited from the Montesquious, and used it to furnish the wing we lived in.\u201d M. de Guermantes smiled. He must nevertheless have remembered that the course of events had been totally different. But, the witticisms of the Princesse des Laumes at the expense of her mother-in-law\u2019s bad taste having been a tradition during the short time in which the Prince was in love with his wife, his love for the latter had been outlasted by a certain contempt for the intellectual inferiority of the former, a contempt which, however, went hand in hand with a considerable attachment and respect. \u201cThe I\u00e9nas have the same armchair with Wedgwood medallions, it\u2019s a lovely thing, but I prefer my own;\u201d said the Duchess, with the same air of impartiality as if she had been the possessor of neither of the articles under discussion. \u201cI know, of course, that they\u2019ve some marvellous things which I haven\u2019t got.\u201d The Princesse de Parme remained silent. \u201cBut it\u2019s quite true; your Highness hasn\u2019t seen their collection. Oh, you ought really to come there one day with me, it\u2019s one of the most magnificent things in Paris. You\u2019d say it was a museum come to life.\u201d And since this suggestion was one of the most \u2018Guermantes\u2019 of the Duchess\u2019s audacities, inasmuch as the l\u00e9nas were for the Princesse de Parme rank usurpers, their son bearing like her own the title of Duc de Guastalla, Mme. de Guermantes in thus launching it could not refrain (so far did the love that she bore for her own originality prevail over the deference due to the Princesse de Parme) from casting at her other guests a smiling glance of amusement. They too made an effort to smile, at once frightened, bewildered, and above all delighted to think that they were being ear-witnesses of Oriane\u2019s very \u2018latest\u2019 and could carry it away with them \u2018red hot.\u2019 They were only half shocked, knowing that the Duchess had the knack of strewing the ground with all the Courvoisier prejudices to achieve a vital success more thrilling and more enjoyable. Had she not, within the last few years, brought together Princesse Mathilde and that Due d\u2019Aumale who had written to the Princess\u2019s own brother the famous letter: \u201cIn my family all the men are brave and the women chaste\u201d? And inasmuch as Princes remain princely even at those moments when they appear anxious to forget that they are, the Due d\u2019Aumale and Princesse Mathilde had enjoyed themselves so greatly at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s that they had thereafter formed a defensive alliance, with that faculty for forgetting the past which Louis XVIII shewed when he took as his Minister Fouch\u00e9, who had voted the death of his brother. Mme. de Guermantes was now nourishing a similar project of arranging a meeting between Princesse Mur\u00e2t and the Queen of Naples. In the meantime, the Princesse de Parme appeared as embarrassed as might have been the heirs-apparent to the Thrones of the Netherlands and Belgium, styled respectively Prince of Orange and Duke of Brabant, had one offered to present to them M. de Mailly Nesle, Prince d\u2019Orange, and M. de Charlus, Due de Brabant. But, before anything further could happen, the Duchess, whom Swann and M. de Charlus between them (albeit the latter was resolute in ignoring the l\u00e9nas\u2019 existence) had with great difficulty succeeded in making admire the Empire style, exclaimed: \u201cHonestly, Ma\u2019am, I can\u2019t tell you how beautiful you will think it! I must confess that the Empire style has always had a fascination for me. But at the l\u00e9nas\u2019 it is really like a hallucination. That sort of \u2014 what shall I say \u2014 reflux from the Expedition to Egypt, and also the sweep forward into our own times from Antiquity, all those things that invade our houses, the Sphinxes that come to crouch at the feet of the sofas, the serpents coiled round candelabra, a huge Muse who holds out a little torch for you to play at bouillotte, or has quietly climbed on to the mantelpiece and is leaning against your clock; and then all the Pompeian lamps, the little boat-shaped beds which look as if they had been found floating on the Nile so that you expect to see Moses climb out of them, the classical chariots galloping along the bed tables. . . . \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not very comfortable to sit in, those Empire chairs,\u201d the Princess ventured. \u201cNo,\u201d the Duchess agreed, \u201cbut,\u201d she at once added, insisting on the point with a smile: \u201cI like being uncomfortable on those mahogany seats covered with ruby velvet or green silk. I like that discomfort of the warrior who understands nothing but the curule chair and in the middle of his principal drawing-room crosses his fasces and piles his laurels. I can assure you that at the I\u00e9nas\u2019 one doesn\u2019t stop to think for a moment of how comfortable one is, when one sees in front of one a great strapping wench of a Victory painted in fresco on the wall. My husband is going to say that I\u2019m a very bad Royalist, but I\u2019m terribly disaffected, as you know, I can assure you that in those people\u2019s house one comes to love all the big N\u2019s and all the bees. Good gracious, after all for a good many years under our Kings we weren\u2019t exactly surfeited with glory, and so these warriors who brought home so many crowns that they stuck them even on the arms of the chairs, I must say I think it\u2019s all rather fetching! Your Highness ought really.\u201d \u201cWhy, my dear, if you think so,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cbut it seems to me that it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d \u201cBut Ma\u2019am will find that it will all go quite smoothly. They are very good people, and no fools. We took Mme. de Chevreuse there,\u201d added the Duchess, knowing the force of this example, \u201cshe was enchanted. The son is really very pleasant. I\u2019m going to say something that\u2019s not quite proper,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut he has a bedroom, and more especially a bed in it, in which I should love to sleep \u2014 without him! What is even less proper is that I went to see him once when he was ill and lying in it. By his side on the frame of the bed was moulded a long Siren, stretched out at full length, a lovely thing with a mother-of-pearl tail and some sort of lotus flowers in her hand. I assure you,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, reducing the speed of her utterances to bring into even bolder relief the words which she had the air of modelling with the pout of her fine lips, drawing them out with her long expressive hands, directing on the Princess as she spoke a gentle, steady and searching gaze, \u201cthat with the palms and the golden crown at the side, it was most moving, it was just the arrangement of Gustave Moreau\u2019s Death and the Young Man (your Highness must know that great work, of course).\u201d The Princesse de Parme, who did not know so much as the painter\u2019s name, made violent movements with her head and smiled ardently, in order to manifest her admiration for his picture. But the intensity of her mimicry could not fill the place of that light which is absent from our eyes so long as we do not understand what people are trying to tell us. \u201cA good-looking boy, I believe?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo for he\u2019s just like a tapir. The eyes are a little those of a Queen Hortense on a screen. But he has probably come to the conclusion that it is rather absurd for a man to develop such a resemblance, and it is lost in the encaustic surface of his cheeks which give him really rather a Mameluke appearance. You feel that the polisher must call round every morning. Swann,\u201d she went on, reverting to the bed of the young Duke, \u201cwas struck by the resemblance between this Siren and Gustave Moreau\u2019s Death. But apart from that,\u201d she added, her speech becoming more rapid though still serious, so as to provoke more laughter, \u201cthere was nothing really that could strike us, for it was only a cold in the head, and the young man made a marvellous recovery.\u201d \u201cThey say he\u2019s a snob?\u201d put in M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, with a malicious twinkle, expecting to be answered with the same precision as though he had said: \u201cThey tell me that he has only four fingers on his right hand; is that so?\u201d \u201cG\u2014 ood g \u2014 racious, n \u2014 o,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes with a smile of benign indulgence. \u201cPerhaps just the least little bit of a snob in appearance, because he\u2019s extremely young, but I should be surprised to hear that he was really, for he\u2019s intelligent,\u201d she added, as though there were to her mind some absolute incompatibility between snobbishness and intelligence. \u201cHe has wit, too, I\u2019ve known him to be quite amusing,\u201d she said again, laughing with the air of an epicure and expert, as though the act of declaring that a person could be amusing demanded a certain expression of merriment from the speaker, or as though the Duc de Guastalla\u2019s sallies were recurring to her mind as she spoke. \u201cAnyway, as he never goes anywhere, he can\u2019t have much field for his snobbishness,\u201d she wound up, forgetting that this was hardly encouraging the Princesse de Parme to make overtures. \u201cI cannot help wondering what the Prince de Guermantes, who calls her Mme. I\u00e9na, will say if he hears that I\u2019ve been to see her.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Duchess with extraordinary vivacity. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that it was we who gave up to Gilbert\u201d (she bitterly regretted that surrender now) \u201ca complete card-room done in the Empire style which came to us from Quiou-Quiou, and is an absolute marvel! There was no room for it here, though I think it would look better here than it does with him. It\u2019s a thing of sheer beauty, half Etruscan, half Egyptian. . . . \u201d \u201cEgyptian?\u201d queried the Princess, to whom the word Etruscan conveyed little. \u201cWell, really, you know, a little of both. Swann told us that, he explained it all to me, only you know I\u2019m such a dunce. But then, Ma\u2019am, what one has to bear in mind is that the Egypt of the Empire cabinetmakers has nothing to do with the historical Egypt, nor their Roman with the Romans nor their Etruria. . . . \u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cNo, it\u2019s like what they used to call a Louis XV costume under the Second Empire, when Anna de Monchy and dear Brigode\u2019s mother were girls. Basin was talking to you just now about Beethoven. We heard a thing of his played the other day which was really quite good, though a little stiff, with a Russian theme in it. It\u2019s pathetic to think that he believed it to be Russian. In the same way as the Chinese painters believed they were copying Bellini. Besides, even in the same country, whenever anybody begins to look at things in a way that is slightly novel, nine hundred and ninety-nine people out of a thousand are totally incapable of seeing what he puts before them. It takes at least forty years before they can manage to make it out.\u201d \u201cForty years!\u201d the Princess cried in alarm. \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d went on the Duchess, adding more and more to her words (which were practically my own, for I had just been expressing a similar idea to her), thanks to her way of pronouncing them, the equivalent of what on the printed page is called italics: \u201cit\u2019s like a sort of first isolated individual of a species which does not yet exist but is going to multiply in the future, an individual endowed with a kind of sense which the human race of his generation does not possess. I can hardly give myself as an instance because I, on the contrary, have always loved any interesting production from the very start, however novel it might be. But really, the other day I was with the Grand Duchess in the Louvre and we happened to pass before Manet\u2019s Olympia. Nowadays nobody is in the least surprised by it. It looks just like an Ingres! And yet, heaven only knows how many spears I\u2019ve had to break for that picture, which I don\u2019t altogether like but which is unquestionably the work of somebody.\u201d \u201cAnd is the Grand Duchess well?\u201d inquired the Princesse de Parme, to whom the Tsar\u2019s aunt was infinitely more familiar than Manet\u2019s model. \u201cYes; we talked about you. After all,\u201d she resumed, clinging to her idea, \u201cthe fact of the matter is, as my brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de always says, that one has between oneself and the rest of the world the barrier of a strange language. Though I admit that there\u2019s no one it\u2019s quite so true of as Gilbert. If it amuses you to go to the I\u00e9nas\u2019, you have far too much sense to let your actions be governed by what that poor fellow may think, who is a dear, innocent creature, but really lives in a different world. I feel myself nearer, more akin to my coachman, my horses even, than to a man who keeps on harking back to what people would have thought under Philip the Bold or Louis the Fat. Just fancy, when he goes for a walk in the country, he takes a stick to drive the peasants out of his way, quite in a friendly spirit, saying: \u2018Get on, clowns!\u2019 Really, I\u2019m just as much surprised when he speaks to me as if I heard myself addressed by one of the \u2018recumbents\u2019 on the old gothic tombs. It\u2019s all very well that animated gravestone\u2019s being my cousin; he frightens me, and the only idea that comes into my head is to let him stay in his Middle Ages. Apart from that, I quite admit that he\u2019s never assassinated anyone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve just been seeing him at dinner at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s,\u201d said the General, but without either smiling at or endorsing the Duchess\u2019s pleasantries. \u201cWas M. de Norpois there?\u201d asked Prince Von, whose mind still ran on the Academy of Moral Sciences. \u201cWhy, yes;\u201d said the General. \u201cIn fact, he was talking about your Emperor.\u201d \u201cIt seems, the Emperor William is highly intelligent, but he does not care for Elstir\u2019s painting. Not that I\u2019m saying this against him,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cI quite share his point of view. Although Elstir has done a fine portrait of me. You don\u2019t know it? It\u2019s not in the least like me, but it\u2019s a remarkable piece of work. He is interesting while one\u2019s sitting to him. He has made me like a little old woman It\u2019s after the style of the Regents of the Hospital, by Hals. I expect you know those sublimities, to borrow my nephew\u2019s favourite expression,\u201d the Duchess turned to myself, gently flapping her fan of black feathers. More than erect on her chair, she flung her head nobly backwards, for, while always a great lady, she was a trifle inclined to play the great lady also. I said that I had been once to Amsterdam and The Hague, but that to avoid confusing my mind, as my time was limited, I had left out Haarlem. \u201cAh! The Hague! What a gallery!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes. I said to him that he had doubtless admired Vermeer\u2019s Street in Delft. But the Duke was less erudite than arrogant. Accordingly he contented himself with replying in a tone of sufficiency, as was his habit whenever anyone spoke to him of a picture in a gallery, or in the Salon, which he did not remember having seen. \u201cIf it\u2019s to be seen, I saw it!\u201d \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve been to Holland, and you never visited Haarlem!\u201d cried the Duchess. \u201cWhy, even if you had only a quarter of an hour to spend in the place, they\u2019re an extraordinary thing to have seen, those Halses. I don\u2019t mind saying that a person who only caught a passing glimpse of them from the top of a tramway-car without stopping, supposing they were hung out to view in the street, would open his eyes pretty wide.\u201d This utterance shocked me as indicating a misconception of the way in which artistic impressions are formed in our minds, and because it seemed to imply that our eye is in that case simply a recording machine which takes instantaneous photographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes, rejoicing that she should be speaking to me with so competent a knowledge of the subjects that interested me, gazed at the illustrious bearing of his wife, listened to what she was saying about Franz Hals, and thought: \u201cShe rides rough-shod over everything! Our young friend can go home and say that he\u2019s had before his eyes a great lady of the old school, in the full sense of the word, the like of whom couldn\u2019t be found anywhere to-day.\u201d Thus I beheld the pair of them, withdrawn from that name Guermantes in which long ago I had imagined them leading an unimaginable life, now just like other men and other women, lingering, only, behind their contemporaries a little way, and that not evenly, as in so many households of the Faubourg, where the wife has had the good taste to stop at the golden, the husband the misfortune to come down to the pinchbeck age of history, she remaining still Louis XV while her partner is pompously Louis-Philippe. That Mme. de Guermantes should be like other women had been for me at first a disappointment; it was now, by a natural reaction and with all these good wines to help, almost a miracle. A Don John of Austria, an Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9, situated for us in the world of names, have as little communication with the great pages of history as the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way had with the Guermantes. Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9 was no doubt in reality a very minor Princess, similar to those who under Louis XIV obtained no special place at Court. But seeming to us to be of a unique and therefore incomparable essence, we cannot conceive of her as being any less in greatness, so that a supper-party with Louis XIV would appear to us only to be rather interesting, whereas with Isabella d\u2019Este we should find ourselves, were we to meet her, gazing with our own eyes on a supernatural heroine of romance. Well, after we have, in studying Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9, in transplanting her patiently from this world of fairyland into that of history, established the fact that her life, her thought contained nothing of that mysterious strangeness which had been suggested to us by her name, once this disappointment is complete we feel a boundless gratitude to this Princess for having had, of Mantegna\u2019s paintings, a knowledge almost equal to that, hitherto despised by us and put, as Fran\u00e7oise would have said, lower than the dirt, of M. Lafenestre. After having scaled the inaccessible heights of the name Guermantes, on descending the inner slope of the life of the Duchess, I felt on finding there the names, familiar elsewhere, of Victor Hugo, Franz Hals and, I regret to say, Vibert, the same astonishment that an explorer, after having taken into account, to imagine the singularity of the native customs in some wild valley of Central America or Northern Africa, its geographical remoteness, the strangeness of its flora, feels on discovering, once he has made his way through a hedge of giant aloes or manchineels, inhabitants who (sometimes indeed among the ruins of a Roman theatre and beneath a column dedicated to Venus) are engaged in reading M\u00e9rope or Alzire. And similarly, so remote, so distinct from, so far superior to the educated women of the middle classes whom I had known, the similar culture by which Mme. de Guermantes had made herself, with no ulterior motive, to gratify no ambition, descend to the level of people whom she would never know, had the character \u2014 meritorious, almost touching by virtue of being wholly useless \u2014 of an erudition in Phoenician antiquities in a politician or a doctor. \u201cI might have shewn you a very fine one,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, still speaking of Hals, \u201cthe finest in existence, some people say, which was left to me by a German cousin. Unfortunately, it turned out to be \u2018enfeoffed\u2019 in the castle \u2014 you don\u2019t know the expression, nor I either,\u201d she added, with her fondness for making jokes (which made her, she thought, seem modern) at the expense of the old customs to which nevertheless she was unconsciously but keenly attached. \u201cI am glad you have seen my Elstirs, but, I must admit, I should have been a great deal more glad if I could have done you the honours of my Hals, this \u2018enfeoffed\u2019 picture.\u201d \u201cI know the one,\u201d said Prince Von, \u201cit\u2019s the Grand Duke of Hesse\u2019s Hals.\u201d \u201cQuite so; his brother married my sister,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cand his mother and Oriane\u2019s were first cousins as well.\u201d \u201cBut so far as M. Elstir is concerned,\u201d the Prince went on, \u201cI shall take the liberty of saying, without having any opinion of his work, which I do not know, that the hatred with which the Emperor pursues him ought not, it seems to me, to be counted against him. The Emperor is a man of marvellous intelligence.\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019ve met him at dinner twice, once at my aunt Sagan\u2019s and once at my aunt Radziwill\u2019s, and I must say I found him quite unusual. I didn\u2019t find him at all simple! But there is something amusing about him, something \u2018forced,\u2019\u201d she detached the word, \u201clike a green carnation, that is to say a thing that surprises me and docs not please me enormously, a thing it is surprising that anyone should have been able to create but which I feel would have been just as well uncreated. I trust I\u2019m not shocking you.\u201d \u201cThe Emperor is a man of astounding intelligence,\u201d resumed the Prince, \u201che is passionately fond of the arts he has for works of art a taste that is practically infallible, if a thing is good he spots it at once and takes a dislike to it. If he detests anything there can be no more doubt about it, the thing is excellent.\u201cEveryone smiled. \u201cYou set my mind at rest,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cI should be inclined to compare the Emperor,\u201d went on the Prince, who, not knowing how to pronounce the word archaeologist (that is to say, as though it were spelt \u2018arkeologist\u2019), never missed an opportunity of using it, \u201cto an old archaeologist\u201d (but the Prince said \u2018arsheologist\u2019) \u201cwe have in Berlin. If you put him in front of a genuine Assyrian antique, he weeps. But if it is a modern sham, if it is not really old, he does not weep. And so, when they want to know whether an arsheological piece is really old, they take it to the old arsheologist. If he weeps, they buy the piece for the Museum. If his eyes remain dry, they send it back to the dealer, and prosecute him for fraud. Well, every time I dine at Potsdam, if the Emperor says to me, of a play: \u2018Prince, you must see that, it\u2019s a work of genius,\u2019 I make a note not to go to it; and when I hear him fulminating against an exhibition, I rush to see it at the first possible opportunity.\u201d \u201cNorpois is in favour of an Anglo-French understanding, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said M. de Guermantes. \u201cWhat use would that be to you?\u201d asked Prince Von, who could not endure the English, in a tone at once of irritation and cunning. \u201cThe English are so schtubid. I know, of course, that it would not be as soldiers that they would help you. But one can judge them, all the same, by the stupidity of their Generals. A friend of mine was talking the other day to Botha, you know, the Boer leader. He said to my friend: \u2018It\u2019s terrible, an army like that. I rather like the English, as a matter of fact, but just imagine that I, who am only a peasant, have beaten them in every battle. And in the last, when I gave way before a force twenty times the strength of my own, while I myself surrendered, because I had to, I managed to take two thousand prisoners! That was good enough, because I was only commanding an army of farmers, but if those poor fools ever have to stand up against a European army, one trembles to think what may happen to them!\u2019 Besides, you have only to see how their King, whom you know as well as I do, passes for a great man in England.\u201d I barely listened to these stories, stories of the kind that M. de Norpois used to tell my father; they supplied no food for my favourite train of thought; and besides, even had they possessed the elements which they lacked, they would have had to be of a very exciting quality for my inner life to awaken during those hours in which I dwelt in my skin, my well-brushed hair, my starched shirt-front, in which, that is to say, I could feel nothing of what constituted for me the pleasure of life. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t agree with you at all,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, who felt that the German Prince was wanting in tact, \u201cI find King Edward charming, so simple, and much cleverer than people think. And the Queen is, even now, the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen in the world.\u201d \u201cBut, Madame la Duchesse,\u201d said the Prince, who was losing his temper and did not see that he was giving offence, \u201cyou must admit that if the Prince of Wales had been an ordinary person there isn\u2019t a club that wouldn\u2019t have blackballed him, and nobody would have been willing to shake hands with him. The Queen is charming, exceedingly sweet and limited. But after all there is something shocking about a royal couple who are literally kept by their subjects, who get the big Jewish financiers to foot all the bills they ought to pay themselves, and create them Baronets in return. It\u2019s like the Prince of Bulgaria . . . \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s our cousin,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s a clever fellow.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s mine, too, but we don\u2019t think him a good fellow on that account. No, it is us you ought to make friends with, it\u2019s the Emperor\u2019s dearest wish, but he insists on its coming from the heart. He says: \u2018What I want to see is a hand clasped in mine, not waving a hat in the air.\u2019 With that, you would be invincible. It would be more practical than the Anglo-French friendship M. de Norpois preaches.\u201d \u201cYou know him, of course,\u201d the Duchess said, turning to me, so as not to leave me out of the conversation. Remembering that M. de Norpois had said that I had once looked as though I wanted to kiss his hand, thinking that he had no doubt repeated this story to Mme. de Guermantes, and in any event could have spoken of me to her only with malice, since in spite of his friendship with my father he had not hesitated to make me appear so ridiculous, I did not do what a man of the world would have done. He would have said that he detested M. de Norpois, and had let him see it; he would have said this so as to give himself the appearance of being the deliberate cause of the Ambassador\u2019s slanders, which would then have been no more than lying and calculated reprisals. I said, on the other hand, that, to my great regret, I was afraid that M. de Norpois did not like me. \u201cYou are quite mistaken,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201che likes you very much indeed. You can ask Basin, for if people give me the reputation of only saying nice things, he certainly doesn\u2019t. He will tell you that we have never heard Norpois speak about anyone so kindly as he spoke to us of you. And only the other day he was wanting to give you a fine post at the Ministry. As he knew that you were not very strong and couldn\u2019t accept it, he had the delicacy not to speak of his kind thought to your father, for whom he has an unbounded admiration.\u201d M. de Norpois was quite the last person whom I should have expected to do me any practical service. The truth was that, his being a mocking and indeed somewhat malicious spirit, those people who had let themselves be taken in as I had by his outward appearance of a Saint Louis delivering justice beneath an oak-tree, by the sounds, easily modulated to pity, that emerged from his somewhat too tuneful lips, believed in a deliberate betrayal when they learned of a slander uttered at their expense by a man who had always seemed to put his whole heart into his speech. These slanders were frequent enough with him. But that did not prevent him from feeling attractions, from praising the people he liked and taking pleasure in shewing that he could be of use to them. \u201cNot that I\u2019m in the least surprised at his appreciating you,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, \u201che\u2019s an intelligent man. And I can quite understand,\u201d she added, for the benefit of the rest of the party, making allusion to a purpose of marriage of which I had heard nothing, \u201cthat my aunt, who has long ceased to amuse him as an old mistress, may not seem of very much use to him as a young wife. Especially as I understand that even as a mistress she has ceased for years now to serve any practical purpose, she is more wrapped up in her devotions than anv thing else. Boaz-Norpois can say, in the words of Victor Hugo:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Voil\u00e0 longtemps que celle avec qui j\u2019ai dormi\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O Seigneur, a quitt\u00e9 ma couche pour la v\u00f4tre!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Really, my poor aunt is like the artists of the advanced guard who have stood out all their lives against the Academy, and in the end start a little academy of their own, or the unfrocked priests who get up a little private religion. They should either keep their frocks, or not stick to their profession. And who knows,\u201d went on the Duchess with a meditative air, \u201cit may be in preparation for her widowhood, there\u2019s nothing sadder than the weeds one\u2019s not entitled to wear.\u201d \u201cAh! If Mme. de Villeparisis were to become Mme. de Norpois, I really believe our cousin Gilbert would take to his bed,\u201d said General de Monserfeuil. \u201cThe Prince de Guermantes is a charming man, but he is, really, very much taken up with questions of birth and manners,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme. \u201cI went down to spend a few days with them in the country, when the Princess, unfortunately, was ill in bed. I was accompanied by Petite.\u201d (This was a nickname that was given to Mme. d\u2019Hunolstein because she was enormously stout.) \u201cThe Prince came to meet me at the foot of the steps, and pretended not to see Petite. We went up to the first floor, to the door into the reception rooms, and then, stepping back to make way for me, he said: \u2018Oh, how d\u2019ye do, Mme. d\u2019Hunolstein?\u2019 (he always calls her that now, since her separation) pretending to have caught sight of Petite for the first time, so as to shew her that he had not come down to receive her at the foot of the steps.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least. I don\u2019t need to tell you,\u201d said the Duke, who regarded himself as extremely modern, more contemptuous than anyone in the world of mere birth, and in fact a Republican, \u201cthat I have not many ideas in common with my cousin. Ma\u2019am can imagine that we are just about as much agreed on most subjects as day and night. But I must say that if my aunt were to marry Norpois, for once I should be of Gilbert\u2019s opinion. To be the daughter of Florimond de Guise, and then to make a marriage like that would be enough, as the saying is, to make a cat laugh; what more can I say?\u201d These last words, which the Duke uttered as a rule in the middle of a sentence, were here quite superfluous. But he felt a perpetual need to be saying them which made him postpone them to the end of a speech if he had found no place for them elsewhere. They were for him, among other things, almost a question of prosody. \u201cRemember, though,\u201d he added, \u201cthat the Norpois are gallant gentlemen with a good place, of a good stock.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen to me, Basin, it\u2019s really not worth your while to poke fun at Gilbert if you\u2019re going to speak the same language as he does,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, for whom the \u2018goodness\u2019 of a family, no less than that of a wine, consisted in its age. But, less frank than her cousin and more subtle than her husband, she made a point of never in her conversation playing false to the Guermantes spirit, and despised rank in her speech while ready to honour it by her actions. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you some sort of cousins?\u201d asked General de Monserfeuil. \u201cI seem to remember that Norpois married a La Rochefoucauld.\u201d \u201cNot in that way at all, she belonged to the branch of the Ducs de La Rochefoucauld, my grandmother came from the Ducs de Doudeauville. She was own grandmother to Edouard Coco, the wisest man in the family,\u201d replied the Duke, whose views of wisdom were somewhat superficial, \u201cand the two branches haven\u2019t intermarried since Louis XIV\u2019s time; the connexion would be rather distant.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, that\u2019s interesting; I never knew that,\u201d said the General. \u201cHowever,\u201d went on M. de Guermantes, \u201chis mother, I believe, was the sister of the Duc de Montmorency, and had originally been married to a La Tour d\u2019Auvergne. But as those Montmorencys are barely Montmorencys, while those La Tour d\u2019Auvergnes are not La Tour d\u2019Auvergnes at all, I cannot see that it gives him any very great position. He says \u2014 and this should be more to the point \u2014 that he\u2019s descended from Saintrailles, and as we ourselves are in a direct line of descent. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was at Combray a Rue de Saintrailles, to which I had never given another thought. It led from the Rue de la Bretonnerie to the Rue de l\u2019Oiseau. And as Saintrailles, the companion of Joan of Arc, had, by marrying a Guermantes, brought into that family the County of Combray, his arms were quartered with those of Guermantes at the foot of one of the windows in Saint-Hilaire. I saw again a vision of dark sandstone steps, while a modulation of sound brought to my ears that name, Guermantes, in the forgotten tone in which I used to hear it long ago, so different from that in which it was used to signify the genial hosts with whom I was dining this evening. If the name, Duchesse de Guermantes, was for me a collective name, it was so not merely in history, by the accumulation of all the women who had successively borne it, but also in the course of my own short life, which had already seen, in this single Duchesse de Guermantes, so many different women superimpose themselves, each one vanishing as soon as the next had acquired sufficient consistency. Words do not change their meaning as much in centuries as names do for us in the space of a few years. Our memory and our heart are not large enough to be able to remain faithful. We have not room enough, in our mental field, to keep the dead there as well as the living. We are obliged to build over what has gone before and is brought to light only by a chance excavation, such as the name Saintrailles had just wrought in my mind. I felt that it would be useless to explain all this, and indeed a little while earlier I had lied by implication in not answering when M. de Guermantes said to me: \u201cYou don\u2019t know our old wheedler?\u201d Perhaps he was quite well aware that I did know him, and it was only from good breeding that he did not press the question\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes drew me out of my meditation. \u201cReally, I find all that sort of thing too deadly. Listen, it\u2019s not always as boring as this at my parties. I hope that you will soon come and dine again as a compensation, with no pedigrees next time,\u201d she murmured, incapable both of appreciating the kind of charm which I could find in her house and of having sufficient humility to be content to appeal to me only as a herbarium, filled with plants of another day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What Mme. de Guermantes believed to be disappointing my expectations was on the contrary what in the end \u2014 for the Duke and the General went on to discuss pedigrees now without stopping \u2014 saved my evening from becoming a complete disappointment. How could I have felt otherwise until now? Each of my fellow-guests at dinner, smothering the mysterious name under which I had only at a distance known and dreamed of them with a body and with a mind similar or inferior to those of all the people I knew, had given me the impression of flat vulgarity which the view on entering the Danish port of Elsinore would give to any passionate admirer of Hamlet. No doubt those geographical regions and that ancient past which put forest glades and gothic belfries into their names had in a certain measure formed their faces, their intellects and their prejudices, but survived in them only as does the cause in the effect, that is to say as a thing possible for the brain to extract but in no way perceptible to the imagination\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And these old-time prejudices restored in a flash to the friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes their vanished poetry. Assuredly, the motions in the possession of nobles, which make of them the scholars, the etymologists of the language not of words but of names (and this, moreover, relatively only to the ignorant mass of the middle classes, for if at the same level of mediocrity a devout Catholic would be better able to stand questioning upon the details of the Liturgy than a free-thinker, on the other hand an anti-clerical archaeologist can often give points to his parish priest on everything connected even with the latter\u2019s own church), those notions, if we are going to confine ourselves to the truth, that is to say to the spirit, had not for these great gentlemen the charm that they would have had for a man of simple birth. They knew perhaps better than myself that the Duchesse de Guise was Princess of Cleves, of Orleans and of Porcien, and all the rest, but they had known, long before they knew all these names, the face of the Duchesse de Guise which thenceforward the names reflected back to them. I had begun with the fairy \u2014 were she fated shortly to perish \u2014 they with the woman\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In middle-class families one sometimes sees jealousies spring up if the younger sister is married before the elder. So the aristocratic world, Courvoisiers especially but Guermantes also, reduced its ennobled greatness to simple domestic superiorities, by a system of child\u2019s-play which I had me\u2019 originally (and this gave it for me its sole charm) in books. Is it not just as though Tallemant des R\u00e9aux were speaking of the Guermantes, and not of the Rohans, when he relates with evident satisfaction how M. de Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9e cried to his brother: \u201cYou can come in here; this is not the Louvre!\u201d and said of the Chevalier de Rohan (because he was a natural son of the Duc de Clermont): \u201cAt any rate, he\u2019s a Prince.\u201d The only thing that distressed me in all this talk was to find that the absurd stories which were being circulated about the charming Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg found as much credence in this drawing-room as they had among Saint-Loup\u2019s friends. Plainly it was an epidemic that would not last longer than perhaps a year or two but had meanwhile infected everyone. People repeated the same old stories, or enriched them with others equally untrue. I gathered that the Princesse de Luxembourg herself, while apparently defending her nephew, supplied weapons for the assault. \u201cYou are wrong to stand up for him,\u201d M. de Guermantes told me, as Saint-Loup had told me before. \u201cWhy, without taking into consideration the opinion of our family, who are unanimous about him, you have only to talk to his servants, and they, after all, are the people who know him best. M. de Luxembourg gave his little Negro page to his nephew. The Negro came back in tears: \u2018Grand Duke beaten me; me no bad boy; Grand Duke naughty man,\u2019 it\u2019s really too much. And I can speak with some knowledge, he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin.\u201d I cannot, by the way, say how many times in the course of this evening I heard the word \u2018cousin\u2019 used. On the one hand, M. de Guermantes, almost at every name that was mentioned, exclaimed: \u201cBut he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d with the sudden joy of a man who, lost in a forest, reads at the ends of a pair of arrows pointing in opposite directions on a metal plate, and followed by quite a low number of kilometres, the words: \u201cBelv\u00e9d\u00e8re Casimir-Perier\u201d and \u201cCroix du Grand-Veneur,\u201d and gathers from them that he is on the right road. On the other hand the word cousin was employed in a wholly different connexion (which was here the exception to the prevailing rule) by the Turkish Ambassadress, who had come in after dinner. Devoured by social ambition and endowed with a real power of assimilating knowledge, she would pick up with equal facility the story of the Retreat of the Ten Thousand or the details of sexual perversion among birds. It would have been impossible to \u2018stump\u2019 her on any of the most recent German publications, whether they dealt with political economy, mental aberrations, the various forms of onanism, or the philosophy of Epicurus. She was, incidentally, a dangerous person to listen to, for, perpetually in error, she would point out to you as being of the loosest morals women of irreproachable virtue, would put you on your guard against a gentleman whose intentions were perfectly honourable, and would tell you anecdotes of the sort that seem always to have come out of a book, not so much because they are serious as because they are so wildly improbable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was at this period little received in society. She had been going for some weeks now to the houses of women of real social brilliance, such as the Duchesse de Guermantes, but as a general rule had confined herself, of necessity, in the noblest families, to obscure scions whom the Guermantes had ceased to know. She hoped to give herself a really fashionable air by quoting the most historic names of the little-known people who were her friends. At once M. de Guermantes, thinking that she was referring to people who frequently dined at his table, quivered with joy at finding himself once more in sight of a landmark and shouted the rallying-cry: \u201cBut he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin! I know him as well as I know my own name. He lives in the Rue Vaneau. His mother was Mlle. d\u2019Uz\u00e9s.\u201d The Ambassadress was obliged to admit that her specimen had been drawn from smaller game. She tried to connect her friends with those of M. de Guermantes by cutting across his track: \u201cI know quite well who\u2019 you mean. No, it\u2019s not those ones, they\u2019re cousins.\u201d But this cross-current launched by the unfortunate Ambassadress ran but a little way. For M. de Guermantes, losing interest, answered: \u201cOh, then I don\u2019t know who\u2019 you\u2019re talking about.\u201d The Ambassadress offered no reply, for if she never knew anyone nearer than the \u2018cousins\u2019 of those whom she ought to have known in person, very often these \u2018cousins\u2019 were not even related at all. Then from the lips of M. de Guermantes, would flow a fresh wave of \u201cBut she\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d words which seemed to have for the Duke the same practical value as certain epithets, convenient to the Roman poets because they provided them with dactyls or spondees for their hexameters. At least the explosion of: \u201cBut she\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d appeared to me quite natural when applied to the Princesse de Guermantes, who was indeed very closely related to the Duchess. The Ambassadress did not seem to care for this Princess. She said to me in an undertone: \u201cShe is stupid. No, she is not so beautiful as all that. That claim is usurped. Anyhow,\u201d she went on, with an air at once reflective, rejecting and decided, \u201cI find her most uncongenial.\u201d But often the cousinship extended a great deal further than this, Mme. de Guermantes making it a point of honour to address as \u2018Aunt\u2019 ladies with whom it would have been impossible to find her an ancestress in common without going back at least to Louis XV; just as, whenever the \u2018hardness\u2019 of the times brought it about that a multimillionairess married a prince whose great-great-grandfather had espoused, as had Oriane\u2019s also, a daughter of Louvois, one of the chief joys of the fair American was to be able, after a first visit to the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes, where she was, incidentally, more or less coldly received and hotly cross-examined, to say \u2018Aunt\u2019 to Mme. de Guermantes, who allowed her to do so with a maternal smile. But little did it concern me what birth meant for M. de Guermantes and M. de Monserfeuil; in the conversations which they held on the subject I sought only for a poetic pleasure. Without being conscious of it themselves, they procured me this pleasure as might a couple of labourers or sailors speaking of the soil or the tides, realities too little detached from their own lives for them to be capable of enjoying the beauty which personally I proceeded to extract from them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes rather than of a race it was of a particular fact, of a date that a name reminded me. Hearing M. de Guermantes recall that M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9\u2018s mother had been a Choiseul and his grandmother a Lucinge, I fancied I could see beneath the commonplace shirt with its plain pearl studs, bleeding still in two globes of crystal, those august relics, the hearts of Mme. de Praslin and of the Duc de Berri. Others were more voluptuous: the fine and flowing hair of Mme. de Tallien or Mme. de Sabran\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Better informed than his wife as to what their ancestors had been, M. de Guermantes found himself the possessor of memories which gave to his conversation a fine air of an ancient mansion stripped of its real treasures but still full of pictures, authentic, indifferent and majestic, which taken as a whole look remarkably well. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente having asked why Prince Von had said, in speaking of the Due d\u2019Aumale, \u2018my uncle,\u2019 M. de Guermantes had replied: \u201cBecause his mother\u2019s brother, the Duke of Wurttemberg, married a daughter of Louis-Philippe.\u201d At once I was lost in contemplation of a casket, such as Carpaccio or Memling used to paint, from its first panel in which the Princess, at the wedding festivities of her brother the Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, appeared wearing a plain garden dress to indicate her resentment at having seen the return, empty-handed, of the ambassadors who had been sent to sue on her behalf for the hand of the Prince of Syracuse, down to the last, in which she had just given birth to a son, the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg (the first cousin of the Prince whom I had met at dinner), in that castle called Fantaisie, one of those places which are as aristocratic as certain families. They, moreover, outlasting a single generation of men, see attached to themselves more than one historical personage. In this one, especially, survive side by side memories of the Margravine of Bayreuth, of this other somewhat fantastic Princess (the Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans\u2019s sister), to whom it was said that the name of her husband\u2019s castle made a distinct appeal, of the King of Bavaria, and finally of Prince Von, to whom it was simply his own postal address, at which he had just asked the Duc de Guermantes to write to him, for he had succeeded to it, and let it only during the Wagner festivals, to the Prince de Polignac, another delightful \u2018fantasist.\u2019 When M. de Guermantes, to explain how he was related to Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, was obliged, going so far and so simply, to climb the chain formed by the joined hands of three or five ancestresses back to Marie-Louise or Colbert, it was still the same thing in each case; a great historical event appeared only in passing, masked, unnatural, reduced, in the name of a property, in the Christian names of a woman, so selected because she was the granddaughter of Louis-Philippe and Marie-Am\u00e9lie, considered no longer as King and Queen of the French, but merely in the extent to which in their capacity as grandparents they bequeathed a heritage. (We see for other reasons in a gazetteer of the works of Balzac, where the most illustrious personages figure only according to their connexion with the Com\u00e9die Humaine, Napoleon occupy a space considerably less than that allotted to Rastignac, and occupy that space solely because he once spoke to the young ladies of Cinq-Cygne.) Similarly the aristocracy, in its heavy structure, pierced with rare windows, admitting a scanty daylight, shewing the same incapacity to soar but also the same massive and blind force as the architecture of the romanesque age, embodies all our history, immures it, beetles over it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus the empty spaces of my memory were covered by degrees with names which in taking order, in composing themselves with relation to one another, in linking themselves to one another by an increasingly numerous connexion, resembled those finished works of art in which there is not one touch that is isolated, in which every part in turn receives from the rest a justification which it confers on them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Luxembourg\u2019s name having come up again in the course of the conversation, the Turkish Ambassadress told us how, the young bride\u2019s grandfather (he who had made that immense fortune out of flour and cereals) having invited M. de Luxembourg to luncheon, the latter had written to decline, putting on the envelope: \u201cM. So-and-So, Miller,\u201d to which the grandfather had replied: \u201cI am all the more disappointed that you were not able to come, my dear friend, because I should have been able to enjoy your society quite intimately, for we were quite an intimate party, just ourselves, and there would have been only the Miller, his Son, and you.\u201d This story was not merely utterly distasteful to me, who knew the impossibility of my dear M. de Nassau\u2019s writing to the grandfather of his wife (whose fortune, moreover, he was expecting to inherit) and addressing him as \u2018Miller\u2019; but furthermore its stupidity became glaring from the start, the word \u2018Miller\u2019 having obviously been dragged in only to lead up to the title of La Fontaine\u2019s fable. But there is in the Faubourg Saint-Germain a silliness so great, when it is aggravated by malice, that they decided that the letter had been sent and that the grandfather, as to whom at once everyone confidently declared that he was a remarkable man, had shewn a prettier wit than his grandson-in-law. The Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault tried to take advantage of this story to tell the one that I had heard in the caf\u00e9: \u201cEveryone had to lie down!\u201d\u2014 but scarcely had he begun, or reported M. de Luxembourg\u2019s pretension that in his wife\u2019s presence M. de Guermantes ought to stand up, when the Duchess stopped him with the protest: \u201cNo, he is very absurd, but not as bad as that.\u201d I was privately convinced that all these stories at the expense of M. de Luxembourg were equally untrue, and that whenever I found myself face to face with any of th reputed actors or spectators I should hear the same contradiction. I asked myself, nevertheless, whether the contradiction just uttered by Mme. de Guermantes had been inspired by regard for truth or by self-esteem. In either event the latter quality succumbed to malice, for she went on, with a laugh: \u201cNot that I haven\u2019t had my little fling at him too, for he invited me to luncheon, wishing to make me know the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, which is how he has the good taste to describe his wife when he\u2019s writing to his aunt. I sent a reply expressing my regret, and adding: As for the \u2018Grand Duchess of Luxembourg\u2019 (in inverted commas), tell her that if she is coming to see me I am at home every Thursday after five. I have even had another little fling. Happening to be at Luxembourg, I telephoned, asking him to ring me up. His Highness was going to luncheon, had just risen from luncheon, two hours went by and nothing happened; so then I employed another method: \u2018Will you tell the Comte de Nassau to come and speak to me?\u2019 Cut to the quick, he was at the instrument that very minute.\u201d Everyone laughed at the Duchess\u2019s story, and at other analogous, that is to say (I am convinced of it) equally untrue stories, for a man more intelligent, better, more refined, in a word more exquisite than this Luxembourg-Nassau I have never met. The sequel will shew that it was I who was in the right. I must admit that, in the midst of her onslaught, Mme. de Guermantes had still a kind word for him. \u201cHe was not always like that,\u201d she informed us. \u201cBefore he went off his head, like the man in the story-book who thinks he\u2019s become king, he was no fool, and indeed in the early days of his engagement he used to speak of it in really quite a nice way, as something he could never have dreamed of: \u2018It\u2019s just like a fairy-tale; I shall have to make my entry into Luxembourg in a fairy coach,\u2019 he said to his uncle d\u2019Ornessan, who answered \u2014 for you know it\u2019s not a very big place, Luxembourg: \u2018A fairy coach! I\u2019m afraid, my dear fellow, you\u2019d never get it in. I should suggest that you take a goat carriage.\u2019 Not only did this not annoy Nassau, but he was the first to tell us the story, and to laugh at it.\u201d \u201cOrnessan is a witty fellow, and he\u2019s every rea \u2014 son to be; his mother was a Montjeu. lie\u2019s in a very bad way now, poor Ornessan.\u201d This name had the magic virtue of interrupting the flow of stale witticisms which otherwise would have gone on for ever. In fact, M. de Guermantes had to explain that M. d\u2019Ornessan\u2019s great-grandmother had been the sister of Marie de Castille Montjeu, the wife of Timol\u00e9on de Lorraine, and consequently Oriane\u2019s aunt, with the result that the conversation drifted back to genealogies, while the idiot of a Turkish Ambassadress breathed in my ear: \u201cYou appear to be very much in the Duke\u2019s good books; have a care!\u201d and, on my demanding an explanation: \u201cI mean to say, you understand what I mean, he\u2019s a man to whom one could safely entrust one\u2019s daughter, but not one\u2019s son.\u201d Now if ever, on the contrary, a man existed who was passionately and exclusively a lover of women, it was certainly the Duc de Guermantes. The state of error, the falsehood fatuously believed to be the truth, were for the Ambassadress like a vital element out of which she could not move. \u201cHis brother M\u00e9m\u00e9, who is, as it happens, for other reasons altogether\u201d (he did not bow to her) \u201cprofoundly uncongenial to me, is genuinely distressed by the Duke\u2019s morals. So is their aunt Villeparisis. Ah, now, her I adore! There is a saint of a woman for you, the true type of the great ladies of the past. It\u2019s not only her actual virtue that\u2019s so wonderful but her restraint. She still says \u2018Monsieur\u2019 to the Ambassador Norpois whom she sees every day, and who, by the way, left an excellent impression behind him in Turkey.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not even reply to the Ambassadress, in order to listen to the genealogies. They were not all of them important. There came up indeed in the course of the conversation one of those unexpected alliances, which, M. de Guermantes informed me, was a misalliance, but not without charm, for, uniting under the July Monarchy the Duc de Guermantes and the Duc de Fezensac with the two irresistible daughters of an eminent navigator, it gave the two Duchesses the exciting novelty of a grace exotically middle-class, \u2018Louisphilippically\u2019 Indian. Or else, under Louis XIV, a Norpois had married the daughter of the Duc de Mortenart, whose illustrious title struck, in the remoteness of that epoch, the name \u2014 which I had found colourless and might have supposed to be modern \u2014 of Norpois, carving deeply upon it the beauty of an old medal. And in these cases, moreover, it was not only the less well-known name that benefited by the association; the other, grown commonplace by the fact of its lustre, struck me more forcibly in this novel and more obscure aspect, just as among the portraits painted by a brilliant colourist the most striking is sometimes one that is all in black. The sudden mobility with which all these names seemed to me to have been endowed, as they sprang to take their places by the side of others from which I should have supposed them to be remote, was due not to my ignorance alone; the country-dances which they were performing in my mind they had carried out no less spontaneously at those epochs in which a title, being always attached to a piece of land, used to follow it from one family to another, so much so that, for example, in the fine feudal structure that is the title of Duc de Nemours or Duc de Chevreuse, I was able to discover successively hidden, as in the hospitable abode of a hermit-crab, a Guise, a Prince of Savoy, an Orl\u00e9ans, a Luynes. Sometimes several remained in competition for a single shell: for the Principality of Orange the Royal House of the Netherlands and MM. de Mailly-Nesle for the Duchy of Brabant the Baron de Charlus and the Royal House of Belgium, various others for the titles of Prince of Naples, Duke of Parma Duke of Reggio. Sometimes it was the other way; the shell had been so\u2019 long uninhabited by proprietors long since dead that it had never occurred to me that this or that name of a country house could have been, at an epoch which after all was comparatively recent, the name of a family. And so, when M. de Guermantes replied to a question put to him by M. de Monserfeuil: \u201cNo, my cousin was a fanatical Royalist; she was the daughter of the Marquis de F\u00e9terne, who played a certain part in the Chouan rising,\u201d on seeing this name F\u00e9terne, which had been for me, since my stay at Balbec, the name of a country house, become, what I had never dreamed that it could possibly be, a family name, I felt the same astonishment as in reading a fairy-tale, where turrets and a terrace come to life and turn into men and women. In this sense of the words, we may say that history, even mere family history, gives life to the old stones of a house. There have been in Parisian society men who played as considerable a part in it, who were more sought after for their distinction or for their wit, who were equally well born as the Duc de Guermantes or the Duc de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle. They have now fallen into oblivion because, as they left no descendants, their name which we no longer hear sounds like a name unknown; at most, the name of a thing beneath which we never think to discover the name of any person, it survives in some country house, some remote village. The day is not distant when the traveller who, in the heart of Burgundy, stops in the little village of Charlus to look at its church, if he has not sufficient industry or is in too great a hurry to examine its tombstones, will go away ignorant that this name, Charlus, was that of a man who ranked with the highest in the land. This thought reminded me that it was time to go, and that while I was listening to M. de Guermantes talking pedigrees, the hour was approaching at which I had promised to call upon his brother. \u201cWho knows,\u201d I continued to muse, \u201cwhether one day Guermantes itself may not appear nothing more than a place-name, save to the archaeologists who, stopping by chance at Combray and standing beneath the window of Gilbert the Bad, have the patience to listen to the account given them by Theodore\u2019s successor or to read the Cure\u2019s guide?\u201d But so long as a great name is not extinct it keeps in the full light of day those men and women who bear it; and there can be no doubt that, to a certain extent, the interest which the illustriousness of these families gave them in my eyes lay in the fact that one can, starting from to-day, follow their ascending course, step by step, to a point far beyond the fourteenth century, recover the diaries and correspondence of all the forebears of M. de Charlus, of the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, of the Princesse de Parme, in a past in which an impenetrable night would cloak the origins of a middle-class family, and in which we make out, in the luminous backward projection of a name, the origin and persistence of certain nervous characteristics, certain vices, the disorders of one or another Guermantes. Almost identical pathologically with their namesakes of the present day, they excite from century to century the startled interest of their correspondents, whether these be anterior to the Princess Palatine and Mme. de Motteville, or subsequent to the Prince de Ligne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, my historical curiosity was faint in comparison with my aesthetic pleasure. The names cited had the effect of disincarnating the Duchess\u2019s guests, whom, for all they might call themselves Prince d\u2019Agrigente or de Cystira, their mask of flesh and of a common intelligence or want of intelligence had transformed into ordinary mortals, so much so that I had made my landing on the ducal door-mat not as upon the threshold (as I had supposed) but as at the farthest confines of the enchanted world of names. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente himself, as soon as I heard that his mother had been a Damas, a granddaughter of the Duke of Modena, was delivered, as from an unstable chemical alloy, from the face and speech that prevented one from recognising him, and went to form with Damas and Modena, which themselves were only titles, a combination infinitely more seductive. Each name displaced by the attractions of another, with which I had never suspected it of having any affinity, left the unalterable position which it had occupied in my brain, where familiarity had dulled it, and, speeding to join the Mortemarts, the Stuarts or the Bourbons, traced with them branches of the most graceful design and an ever-changing colour. The name Guermantes itself received from all the beautiful names \u2014 extinct, and so all the more glowingly rekindled \u2014 with which I learned only now that it was connected, a new sense and purpose, purely poetical. At the most, at the extremity of each spray that burgeoned from the exalted stem, I could see it flower in some face of a wise king or illustrious princess, like the sire of Henri IV or the Duchesse de Longueville. But as these faces, different in this respect from those of the party around me, were not discoloured for me by any trace of physical experience or fashionable mediocrity, they remained, in their handsome outlines and rainbow iridescence, homogeneous with those names which at regular intervals, each of a different hue, detached themselves from the genealogical tree of Guermantes, and disturbed with no foreign or opaque matter the buds \u2014 pellucid, alternate, many-coloured \u2014 which (like, in the old Jesse windows, the ancestors of Jesus) blossomed on either side of the tree of glass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Already I had made several attempts to slip away, on account, more than for any other reason, of the triviality which my presence at it imparted to the gathering, albeit it was one of those which I had long imagined as being so beautiful \u2014 as it would doubtless have been had there been no inconvenient witness present. At least my departure would permit the other guests, once the profane intruder was no longer among them, to constitute themselves at length into a secret conclave. They would be free to celebrate the mysteries for the celebration of which they had met together, for it could obviously not have been to talk of Franz Hals or of avarice, and to talk of them in the same way as people talk in middle-class society. They uttered nothing but trivialities, doubtless because I was in the room, and I felt with some compunction, on seeing all these pretty women kept apart, that I was preventing them by my presence from carrying on, in the most precious of its drawing-rooms, the mysterious life of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. But this departure which I was trying at every moment to effect, M. and Mme. de Guermantes carried the spirit of self-sacrifice so far as to postpone, by keeping me in the room. A more curious thing still, several of the ladies who had come hurrying, delighted, beautifully dressed, with constellations of jewels, to be present at a party which, through my fault only, differed in no essential point from those that are given elsewhere than in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, any more than one feels oneself at Balbec to be in a town that differs from what one\u2019s eyes are accustomed to see \u2014 several of these ladies retired not at all disappointed, as they had every reason to be, but thanking Mme. de Guermantes most effusively for the delightful evening which they had spent, as though on the other days, those on which I was not present, nothing more used to occur\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it really for the sake of dinners such as this that all these people dressed themselves up and refused to allow the penetration of middle-class women into their so exclusive drawing-rooms \u2014 for dinners such as this? The same, had I been absent? The suspicion flashed across my mind for a moment, but it was too absurd. Plain commonsense enabled me to brush it aside. And then, if I had adopted it, what would have been left of the name Guermantes, already so degraded since Combray?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It struck me that these flower-maidens were, to a strange extent, either ready to be pleased with another person or anxious to make that person pleased with them, for more than one of them, to whom I had not uttered, during the whole course of the evening, more than two or three casual remarks, the stupidity of which had left me blushing, made a point, before leaving the drawing-room, of coming to tell me, fastening on me her fine caressing eyes, straightening as she spoke the garland of orchids that followed the curve of her bosom, what an intense pleasure it had been to her to make my acquaintance, and to speak to me \u2014 a veiled allusion to an invitation to dinner \u2014 of her desire to \u2018arrange something\u2019 after she had \u2018fixed a day\u2019 with Mme. de Guermantes. None of these flower ladies left the room before the Princesse de Parme. The presence of that lady \u2014 one must never depart before Royalty \u2014 was one of the two reasons, neither of which I had guessed, for which the Duchess had insisted so strongly on my remaining. As soon as Mme. de Parme had risen, it was like a deliverance. Each of the ladies having made a genuflexion before the Princess, who raised her up from the ground, they received from her, in a kiss, and like a benediction which they had craved kneeling, the permission to ask for their cloaks and carriages. With the result that there followed, at the front door, a sort of stentorian recital of great names from the History of France. The Princesse de Parme had forbidden Mme. de Guermantes to accompany her downstairs to the hall for fear of her catching cold, and the Duke had added: \u201cThere, Oriane, since Ma\u2019am gives you leave, remember what the doctor told you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sure the Princesse de Parme was most pleased to take dinner with you.\u201d I knew the formula. The Duke had come the whole way across the drawing-room in order to utter it before me with an obliging, concerned air, as though he were handing me a diploma or offering me a plateful of biscuits. And I guessed from the pleasure which he appeared to be feeling as he spoke, and which brought so sweet an expression momentarily into his face, that the effort which this represented for him was of the kind which he would continue to make to the very end of his life, like one of those honorific and easy posts which, even when paralytic, one is still allowed to retain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as I was about to leave, the lady in waiting reappeared in the drawing-room, having forgotten to take away some wonderful carnations, sent up from Guermantes, which the Duchess had presented to Mme. de Parme. The lady in waiting was somewhat flushed, one felt that she had just been receiving a scolding, for the Princess, so kind to everyone else, could not contain her impatience at the stupidity of her attendant. And so the latter picked up the flowers and ran quickly, but to preserve her air of ease and independence flung at me as she passed: \u201cThe Princess says I\u2019m keeping her waiting; she wants to be gone, and to have the carnations as well. Good lord! I\u2019m not a little bird, I can\u2019t be in two places at once.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! the rule of not leaving before Royalty was not the only one. I could not depart at once, for there was another: this was that the famous lavishness, unknown to the Courvoisiers, with which the Guermantes, whether opulent or practically ruined, excelled in entertaining their friends, was not only a material lavishness, of the kind that I had often experienced with Robert de Saint-Loup, but also a lavish display of charming words, of courteous actions, a whole system of verbal elegance supplied from a positive treasure-house within. But as this last, in the inactivity of fashionable existence, must remain unemployed, it expanded at times, sought an outlet in a sort of fugitive effusion, all the more intense, which might, in Mme. de Guermantes, have led one to suppose a genuine affection for oneself. Which she did, for that matter, feel at the moment when she let it overflow, for she found then in the society of the friend, man or woman, with whom she happened to be a sort of intoxication, in no way sensual, similar to that which music produces in certain people; she would suddenly detach a flower from her bodice, or a medallion, and present it to someone with whom she would have liked to prolong the evening, with a melancholy feeling the while that such a prolongation could have led to nothing but idle talk, into which nothing could have passed of the nervous pleasure, the fleeting emotion, similar to the first warm days of spring in the impression they leave behind them of exhaustion and regret. As for the friend, it did not do for him to put too implicit a faith in the promises, more exhilarating than anything he had ever heard, tendered by these women who, because they feel with so much more force the sweetness of a moment, make of it, with a delicacy, a nobility of which normally constituted creatures are incapable, a compelling masterpiece of grace and goodness, and have no longer anything of themselves left to give when the next moment has arrived. Their affection does not outlive the exaltation that has dictated it; and the subtlety of mind which had then led them to divine all the things that you wished to hear and to say them to you will permit them just as easily, a few days later, to seize hold of your absurdities and use them to entertain another of their visitors with whom they will then be in the act of enjoying one of those \u2018musical moments\u2019 which are so brief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the hall where I asked a footman for my snowboots which I had brought as a precaution against the snow, several flakes of which had already fallen, to be converted rapidly into slush, not having realised that they were hardly fashionable, I felt, at the contemptuous smile on all sides, a shame which rose to its highest pitch when I saw that Mme. de Parme had not gone and was watching me put on my American \u2018rubbers.\u2019 The Princess came towards me. \u201cOh! What a good idea,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cit\u2019s so practical! There\u2019s a sensible man for you. Madame, we shall have to get a pair of those,\u201d she went on to her lady in waiting, while the mockery of the footmen turned to respect and the other guests crowded round me to inquire where I had managed to find these marvels. \u201cWith those on, you will have nothing to fear even if it starts snowing again and you have a long way to go. You\u2019re independent of the weather,\u201d said the Princess to me. \u201cOh! If it comes to that, your Royal Highness can be reassured,\u201d broke in the lady in waiting with a knowing air, \u201cit will not snow again.\u201d \u201cWhat do you know about it, Madame?\u201d came witheringly from the excellent Princesse de Parme, who alone could succeed in piercing the thick skin of her lady in waiting. \u201cI can assure your Royal Highness, it cannot snow again. It is a physical impossibility.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d \u201cIt cannot snow any more, they have taken the necessary steps to prevent it, they have put down salt in the streets!\u201d The simple-minded lady did not observe either the anger of the Princess or the mirth of the rest of her audience, for instead of remaining silent she said to me with a genial smile, paying no heed to my repeated denials of any connexion with Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re: \u201cNot that it matters, after all. This gentleman must have stout sea-legs. What\u2019s bred in the bone!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, having escorted the Princesse de Parme to her carriage, M. de Guermantes said to me, taking hold of my greatcoat: \u201cLet me help you into your skin.\u201d He had ceased even to smile when he employed this expression, for those that were most vulgar had for that very reason, because of the Guermantes affectation of simplicity, become aristocratic\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An exaltation that sank only into melancholy, because it was artificial, was what I also, although quite differently from Mme. de Guermantes, felt once I had finally left her house, in the carriage that was taking me to that of M. de Charlus. We can at pleasure abandon ourselves to one or other of two forces of which one rises in ourselves, emanates from our deepest impressions, the other comes to us from without. The first carries with it naturally a joy, the joy that springs from the life of the creator. The other current, that which endeavours to introduce into us the movement by which persons external to ourselves are stirred, is not accompanied by pleasure; but we can add a pleasure to it, by the shock of reaction, in an intoxication so feigned that it turns swiftly into boredom, into melancholy, whence the gloomy faces of so many men of fashion, and all those nervous conditions which may make them end in suicide. Well, in the carriage which was taking me to M. de Charlus, I was a prey to this second sort of exaltation, widely different from that which is given us by a personal impression, such as I had received in other carriages, once at Combray, in Dr. Percepied\u2019s gig, from which I had seen painted against the setting sun the spires of Martinville, another day at Balbec, in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s barouche, when I strove to identify the reminiscence that was suggested to me by an avenue of trees. But in this third carriage, what I had before my mind\u2019s eye were those conversations that had seemed to me so tedious at Mme. de Guermante\u2019s dinner-table, for example Prince Von\u2019s stories about the German Emperor, General Botha and the British Army. I had slipped them into the frame of the internal stereoscope through the lenses of which, once we are no longer ourselves, once, endowed with the spirit of society, we no longer wish to receive our life save from other people, we cast into relief what they have said and done. Like a tipsy man filled with tender feeling for the waiter who has been serving him, I marvelled at my good fortune, a good fortune not realised by me, it is true, at the actual moment, in having dined with a person who knew William II so well, and had told stories about him that were \u2014 upon my word \u2014 really witty. And, as I repeated to myself, with the Prince\u2019s German accent, the story of General Botha, I laughed out loud, as though this laugh, like certain kinds of applause which increase one\u2019s inward admiration, were necessary to the story as a corroboration of its comic element. Through the magnifying lenses even those of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s pronouncements which had struck me as being stupid (as for example that on the Hals pictures which one ought to see from the top of a tramway-car) took on a life, a depth that were extraordinary. And I must say that, even if this exaltation was quick to subside, it was not altogether unreasonable. Just as there may always come a day when we are glad to know the person whom we despise more than anyone in the world because he happens to be connected with a girl with whom we are in love, to whom he can introduce us, and thus offers us both utility and gratification, attributes in each of which we should have supposed him to be entirely lacking, so there is no conversation, any more than there are personal relations, from which we can be certain that we shall not one day derive some benefit. What Mme. de Guermantes had said to me about the pictures which it would be interesting to see, even from a tramway-car, was untrue, but it contained a germ of truth which was of value to me later on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly the lines of Victor Hugo which I had heard her quote were, it must be admitted, of a period earlier than that in which he became something more than a new man, in which he brought to light, in the order of evolution, a literary species till then unknown, endowed with more complex organs than any then in existence. In these first poems, Victor Hugo is still a thinker, instead of contenting himself, like Nature, with supplying food for thought. His \u2018thoughts\u2019 he at that time expressed in the most direct form, almost in the sense in which the Duke employed the word when, feeling it to be out of date and a nuisance that the guests at his big parties at Guermantes should, in the visitors\u2019 book, append to their signatures a philosophico-poetical reflexion, he used to warn novices in an appealing tone: \u201cYour name, my dear fellow, but no \u2018thoughts\u2019 please!\u201d Well, it was these \u2018thoughts\u2019 of Victor Hugo (almost as entirely absent from the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles as \u2018airs,\u2019 as \u2018melodies\u2019 are from Wagner\u2019s later manner) that Mme. de Guermantes admired in the early Hugo. Nor was she altogether wrong. They were touching, and already round about them, without their form\u2019s having yet the depth which it was to acquire only in later years, the rolling tide of words and of richly articulated rhymes put them beyond comparison with the lines that one might discover in a Corneille, for example, lines in which a Romanticism that is intermittent, restrained and so all the more moving, nevertheless has not at all penetrated to the physical sources of life, modified the unconscious and generalisable organism in which the idea is latent. And so I had been wrong in confining myself, hitherto, to the later volumes of Hugo. Of the earlier, of course, it was only a fractional part that Mme. de Guermantes used to embellish her conversation. But simply by quoting in this way an isolated line one multiplies its power of attraction tenfold. The lines that had entered or returned to my mind during this dinner magnetised in turn, summoned to themselves with such force the poems in the heart of which they were normally embedded, that my magnetised hands could not hold out for longer than forty-eight hours against the force that drew them towards the volume in which were bound up the Orientales and the Chants du Cr\u00e9puscule. I cursed Franchise\u2019s footman for having made a present to his native village of my copy of the Feuilles d\u2019Automne, and sent him off, with not a moment to be lost, to procure me another. I read these volumes from cover to cover and found peace of mind only when I suddenly came across, awaiting me in the light in which she had bathed them, the lines that I had heard Mme. de Guermantes quote. For all these reasons, conversations with the Duchess resembled the discoveries that we make in the library of a country house, out of date, incomplete, incapable of forming a mind, lacking in almost everything that we value, but offering us now and then some curious scrap of information, for instance the quotation of a fine passage which we did not know and as to which we are glad to remember in after years that we owe our knowledge of it to a stately mansion of the great. We are then, by having found Balzac\u2019s preface to the Chartreuse, or some unpublished letters of Joubert, tempted to exaggerate the value of the life we led there, the sterile frivolity of which, for this windfall of a single evening, we forget\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From this point of view, if the fashionable world had been unable, at the first moment, to provide what my imagination expected, and must consequently strike me first of all by what it had in common with all the other worlds rather than by its difference, still it revealed itself to me by degrees as something quite distinct. Great noblemen are almost the only people of whom one learns as much as one does of peasants; their conversation is adorned with everything that concerns the land, houses, as people used to live in them long ago, old customs, everything of which the world of money is profoundly ignorant. Even supposing that the aristocrat most moderate in his aspirations has finally overtaken the period in which he lives, his mother, his uncles, his great-aunts keep him in touch, when he recalls his childhood, with the conditions of a life almost unknown today. In the death-chamber of a contemporary corpse Mme. de Guermantes would not have pointed out, but would immediately have perceived, all the lapses from the traditional customs. She was shocked to see at a funeral women mingling with the men, when there was a particular ceremony which ought to be celebrated for the women. As for the pall, the use of which Bloch would doubtless have believed to be confined to coffins, on account of the pall bearers of whom one reads in the reports of funerals, M. de Guermantes could remember the time when, as a child, he had seen it borne at the wedding of M. de Mailly-Nesle. While Saint-Loup had sold his priceless \u2018Genealogical Tree,\u2019 old portraits of the Bouillons, letters of Louis XIII, in order to buy Carri\u00e8res and furniture in the modern style, M. and Mme. de Guermantes, moved by a sentiment in which the burning love of art may have played only a minor part, and which left them themselves more insignificant than before, had kept their marvellous Boule furniture, which presented a picture attractive in a different way to an artist. A literary man would similarly have been enchanted by their conversation, which would have been for him \u2014 for one hungry man has no need of another to keep him company \u2014 a living dictionary of all those expressions which every day are becoming more and more forgotten: Saint-Joseph cravats, children dedicated to the Blue, and so forth, which one finds to-day only among those people who have constituted themselves the friendly and benevolent custodians of the past. The pleasure that a writer, more than among other writers, feels among them is not without danger, for there is a risk of his coming to believe that the things of the past have a charm in themselves, of his transferring them bodily into his work, still-born in that case, exhaling a tedium for which he consoles himself with the reflexion: \u201cIt is attractive because it\u2019s true; that is how people do talk.\u201d These aristocratic conversations had moreover the charm, with Mme. de Guermantes, of being couched in excellent French. For this reason they made permissible on the Duchess\u2019s part her hilarity at the words \u2018viaticum,\u2019 \u2018cosmic,\u2019 \u2018pythian,\u2019 \u2018pre-eminent,\u2019 which Saint-Loup used to employ \u2014 as, similarly, at his Bing furniture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When all was said, very different in this respect from what I had been able to feel before the hawthorns, or when I tasted a crumb of madeleine, the stories that I had heard at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s remained alien to me. Entering for a moment into me, who was only physically possessed by them, one would have said that, being of a social, not an individual nature, they were impatient to escape. I writhed in my seat in the carriage like the priestess of an oracle. I looked forward to another dinner-party at which I might myself become a sort of Prince Von to Mme. de Guermantes, and repeat them. In the meantime they made my lips quiver as I stammered them to myself, and I tried in vain to bring back and concentrate a mind that was carried away by a centrifugal force. And so it was with a feverish impatience not to have to bear the whole weight of them any longer by myself in a carriage where, for that matter, I atoned for the lack of conversation by soliloquising aloud, that I rang the bell at M. de Charlus\u2019s door, and it was in long monologues with myself, in which I rehearsed everything that I was going to tell him and gave scarcely a thought to what he might have to say to me, that I spent the whole of the time during which I was kept waiting in a drawing-room into which a footman shewed me and where I was incidentally too much excited to look at what it contained. I felt so urgent a need that M. de Charlus should listen to the stories which I was burning to tell him that I was bitterly disappointed to think that the master of the house was perhaps in bed, and that I might have to go home to sleep off by myself my drunkenness of words. I had just noticed, in fact, that I had been twenty-five minutes \u2014 that they had perhaps forgotten about me \u2014 in this room of which, despite this long wait, I could at the most have said that it was very big, greenish in colour, and contained a large number of portraits. The need to speak prevents one not merely from listening but from seeing things, and in this case the absence of any description of my external surroundings is tantamount to a description of my internal state. I was preparing to leave the room to try to get hold of some one, and if I found no one to make my way back to the hall and have myself let out, when, just as I had risen from my chair and taken a few steps across the mosaic parquet of the floor, a manservant came in, with a troubled expression: \u201cMonsieur le Baron has been engaged all evening, Sir,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere are still several people waiting to see him. I am doing everything I possibly can to get him to receive you, I have already telephoned up twice to the secretary.\u201d \u201cNo; please don\u2019t bother. I had an appointment with M. le Baron, but it is very late already, and if he is busy this evening I can come back another day.\u201d \u201cOh no, Sir, you must not go away,\u201d cried the servant. \u201cM. le Baron might be vexed. I will try again.\u201d I was reminded of the things I had heard about M. de Charlus\u2019s servants and their devotion to their master. One could not quite say of him as of the Prince de Conti that he sought to give pleasure as much to the valet as to the Minister, but he had shewn such skill in making of the least thing that he asked of them a sort of personal favour that at night, when, his body-servants assembled round him at a respectful distance, after running his eye over them he said: \u201cCoignet, the candlestick!\u201d or \u201cDucret, the nightshirt!\u201d it was with an envious murmur that the rest used to withdraw, jealous of him who had been singled out by his master\u2019s favour. Two of them, indeed, who could not abide one another, used to try to snatch the favour each from his rival by going on the most flimsy pretext with a message to the Baron, if he had gone upstairs earlier than usual, in the hope of being invested for the evening with the charge of candlestick or nightshirt. If he addressed a few words directly to one of them on some subject outside the scope of his duty, still more if in winter, in the garden, knowing that one of his coachmen had caught cold, he said to him, after ten minutes: \u201cPut your cap on!\u201d the others would not speak to the fellow again for a fortnight, in their jealousy of the great distinction that had been conferred on him. I waited ten minutes more, and then, after requesting me not to stay too long as M. le Baron was tired and had had to send away several most important people who had made appointments with him many days before, they admitted me to his presence. This setting with which M. de Charlus surrounded himself seemed to me a great deal less impressive than the simplicity of his brother Guermantes, but already the door stood open, I could see the Baron, in a Chinese dressing-gown, with his throat bare, lying upon a sofa. My eye was caught at the same moment by a tall hat, its nap flashing like a mirror, which had been left on a chair with a cape, as though the Baron had but recently come in. The valet withdrew. I supposed that M. de Charlus would rise to greet me. Without moving a muscle he fixed on me a pair of implacable eyes. I went towards him, I said good evening; he did not hold out his hand, made no reply, did not ask me to take a chair. After a moment\u2019s silence I asked him, as one would ask an ill-mannered doctor, whether it was necessary for me to remain standing. I said this without any evil intention, but my words seemed only to intensify the cold fury on M. de Charlus\u2019s face. I was not aware, as it happened, that at home, in the country, at the Ch\u00e2teau de Charlus, he was in the habit, after dinner (so much did he love to play the king) of sprawling in an armchair in the smoking-room, letting hi3 guests remain standing round him. He would ask for a light from one, offer a cigar to another and then, after a few minutes\u2019 interval, would say: \u201cBut Argencourt, why don\u2019t you sit down? Take a chair, my dear fellow,\u201d and so forth, having made a point of keeping them standing simply to remind them that it was from himself that permission came to them to be seated. \u201cPut yourself in the Louis XIV seat,\u201d he answered me with an imperious air, as though rather to force me to move away farther from himself than to invite me to be seated. I took an armchair which was comparatively near. \u201cAh! so that is what you call a Louis XIV seat, is it? I can see you have been well educated,\u201d he cried in derision. I was so much taken aback that I did not move, either to leave the house, as I ought to have done, or to change my seat, as he wished. \u201cSir,\u201d he next said to me, weighing each of his words, to the more impertinent of which he prefixed a double yoke of consonants, \u201cthe interview which I have condescended to grant you at the request of a person who desires to be nameless, will mark the final point in our relations. I shall not conceal from you that I had hoped for better things! I should perhaps be forcing the sense of the words a little, which one ought not to do, even with people who are ignorant of their value, simply out of the respect due to oneself, were I to tell you that I had felt a certain attraction towards you. I think, however, that benevolence, in its most actively protecting sense, would exceed neither what I felt nor what I was proposing to display. I had, immediately on my return to Paris, given you to understand, while you were still at Balbec, that you could count upon me.\u201d I who remembered with what a torrent of abuse M. de Charlus had parted from me at Balbec made an instinctive gesture of contradiction. \u201cWhat!\u201d he cried with fury, and indeed his face, convulsed and white, differed as much from his ordinary face as does the sea when on a morning of storm one finds instead of its customary smiling surface a thousand serpents writhing in spray and foam, \u201cdo you mean to pretend that you did not receive my message \u2014 almost a declaration \u2014 that you were to remember me? What was there in the way of decoration round the cover of the book that I sent you?\u201d \u201cSome very pretty twined garlands with tooled ornaments,\u201d I told him. \u201cAh!\u201d he replied, with an air of scorn, \u201cthese young Frenchmen know little of the treasures of our land. What would be said of a young Berliner who had never heard of the Walk\u00fcre? Besides, you must have eyes to see and see not, since you yourself told me that you had stood for two hours in front of that particular treasure. I can see that you know no more about flowers than you do about styles; don\u2019t protest that you know about styles,\u201d he cried in a shrill scream of rage, \u201cyou can\u2019t even tell me what you are sitting on. You offer your hindquarters a Directorychauffeuse as a Louis XIV berg\u00e8re. One of these days you\u2019ll be mistaking Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s knees for the seat of the rear, and a fine mess you\u2019ll make of things then. It\u2019s precisely the same; you didn\u2019t even recognise on the binding of Bergotte\u2019s book the lintel of myosotis over the door of Balbec church. Could there be any clearer way of saying to you: \u2018Forget me not!\u2019?\u201d I looked at M. de Charlus. Undoubtedly his magnificent head, though repellent, yet far surpassed that of any of his relatives; you would have called him an Apollo grown old; but an olive-hued, bilious juice seemed ready to start from the corners of his evil mouth; as for intellect, one could not deny that his, over a vast compass, had taken in many things which must always remain unknown to his brother Guermantes. But whatever the fine words with which he coloured all his hatreds, one felt that, even if there was now an offended pride, now a disappointment in love, or a rancour, or sadism, a love of teasing, a fixed obsession, this man was capable of doing murder, and of proving by force of logic that he had been right in doin^ it and was still superior by a hundred cubits in moral stature to his brother, his sister-in-law, or any of the rest. \u201cJust as, in Velazquez\u2019sLances,\u201d he went on, \u201cthe victor advances towards him who is the humbler in rank, as is the duty of every noble nature, since I was everything and you were nothing, it was I who took the first steps towards you. You have made an idiotic reply to what it is not for me to describe as an act of greatness. But I have not allowed myself to be discouraged. Our religion inculcates patience. The patience I have shewn towards you will be counted, I hope, to my credit, and also my having only smiled at what might be denounced as impertinence, were it within your power to offer any impertinence to me who surpass you in stature by so many cubits; but after all, Sir, all this is now neither here nor there. I have subjected you to the test which the one eminent man of our world has ingeniously named the test of excessive friendliness, and which he rightly declares to be the most terrible of all, the only one that can separate the good grain from the tares. I could scarcely reproach you for having undergone it without success, for those who emerge from it triumphant are very few. But at least, and this is the conclusion which I am entitled to draw from the last words that we shall exchange on this earth, at least I intend to hear nothing more of your calumnious fabrications.\u201d So far, I had never dreamed that M. de Charlus\u2019s rage could have been caused by an unflattering remark which had been repeated to him; I searched my memory; I had not spoken about him to anyone. Some evil-doer had invented the whole thing. I protested to-M. de Charlus that I had said absolutely nothing about him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can have annoyed you by saying to Mme. de Guermantes that I was a friend of yours.\u201d He gave a disdainful smile, made his voice climb to the supreme pitch of its highest register, and there, without strain, attacking the shrillest and most insolent note: \u201cOh! Sir,\u201d he said, returning by the most gradual stages to a natural intonation, and seeming to revel as he went in the oddities of this descending scale, \u201cI think that you are doing yourself an injustice when you accuse yourself of having said that we were friends. I do not look for any great verbal accuracy in anyone who could readily mistake a piece of Chippendale for a rococo chaire, but really I do not believe,\u201d he went on, with vocal caresses that grew more and more winning and brought to hover over his lips what was actually a charming smile, \u201cI do not believe that you can ever have said, or thought, that we were frlends! As for your having boasted that you had been presented to me, had talked to me, knew me slightly, had obtained, almost without solicitation, the prospect of coming one day under my protection, I find it on the contrary very natural and intelligent of you to have done so. The extreme difference in age that there is between us enables me to recognise without absurdity that thatpresentation, those talks, that vague prospect of future relations were for you, it is not for me to say an honour, but still, when all is said and done, an advantage as to which I consider that your folly lay not in divulging it but in not having had the sense to keep it. I will go so far as to say,\u201d he went on, passing abruptly for a moment from his arrogant wrath to a gentleness so tinged with melancholy that I expected him to burst into tears, \u201cthat when you left unanswered the proposal I made to you here in Paris it seemed to me so unheard-of an act on your part, coming from you who had struck me as well brought up and of a good bourgeois family,\u201d (on this adjective alone his voice sounded a little whistle of impertinence) \u201cthat I was foolish enough to imagine all the excuses that never really happen, letters miscarrying, addresses copied down wrong. I can see that on my part it was great foolishness, but Saint Bonaventure preferred to believe that an ox could fly rather than that his brother was capable of lying. Anyhow, that is all finished now, the idea did not attract you, there is no more to be said. It seems to me only that you might have brought yourself,\u201d (and there was a genuine sound of weeping in his voice) \u201cwere it only out of consideration for my age, to write to me. I had conceived and planned for you certain infinitely seductive things, which I had taken good care not to tell you. You have preferred to refuse without knowing what they were; that is your affair. But, as I tell you, one can always write. In your place, and indeed in my own, I should have done so. I like my place, for that reason, better than yours \u2014 I say \u2018for that reason\u2019 because I believe that we are all equal, and I have more fellow-feeling for an intelligent labourer than for many of our dukes. But I can say that I prefer my place to yours, because what you have done, in the whole course of my life, which is beginning now to be a pretty long one, I am conscious that I have never done.\u201d His head was turned away from the light, and I could not see if his eyes were dropping tears as I might have supposed from his voice. \u201cI told you that I had taken a hundred steps towards you; the only effect of that has been to make you retire two hundred from me. Now it is for me to withdraw, and we shall know one another no longer. I shall retain not your name but your story, so that at moments when I might be tempted to believe that men have good hearts, good manners, or simply the intelligence not to allow an unparalleled opportunity to escape them, I may remember that that is ranking them too highly. No, that you should have said that you knew me, when it was true \u2014 for henceforward it ceases to be true \u2014 I regard that as only natural, and I take it as an act of homage, that is to say something pleasant. Unfortunately, elsewhere and in other circumstances, you have uttered remarks of a very different nature.\u201d \u201cSir, I swear to you that I have said nothing that could insult you.\u201d \u201cAnd who says that I am insulted?\u201d he cried with fury, flinging himself into an erect posture on the seat on which hitherto he had been reclining motionless, while, as the pale frothing serpents stiffened in his face, his voice became alternately shrill and grave, like the deafening onrush of a storm. (The force with which he habitually spoke, which used to make strangers turn round in the street, was multiplied an hundredfold, as is a musical forte if, instead of being played on the piano, it is played by an orchestra, and changed into afortissimo as well. M. de Charlus roared.) \u201cDo you suppose that it is within your power to insult me? You evidently are not aware to whom you are speaking? Do you imagine that the envenomed spittle of five hundred little gentlemen of your type, heaped one upon another, would succeed in slobbering so much as the tips of my august toes?\u201d A moment before this my desire to persuade M. de Charlus that I had never said, nor heard anyone else say any evil of him had given place to a mad rage, caused by the words which were dictated to him solely, to my mind, by his colossal pride. Perhaps they were indeed the effect, in part at any rate, of this pride. Almost all the rest sprang from a feeling of which I was then still ignorant, and for which I could not therefore be blamed for not making due allowance. I could at least, failing this unknown element, have mingled with his pride, had I remembered the words of Mme. de Guermantes, a trace of madness. But at that moment the idea of madness never even entered my head. There was in him, according to me, only pride, in me there was only fury. This fury (at the moment when M. de Charlus ceased to shout, in order to refer to his august toes, with a majesty that was accompanied by a grimace, a nausea of disgust at his obscure blasphemers), this fury could contain itself no longer. With an impulsive movement, I wanted to strike something, and, a lingering trace of discernment making me respect the person of a man so much older than myself, and even, in view of their dignity as works of art, the pieces of German porcelain that were grouped around him, I flung myself upon the Baron\u2019s new silk hat, dashed it to the ground, trampled upon it, began blindly pulling it to pieces, wrenched off the brim, tore the crown in two, without heeding the vociferations of M. de Charlus, which continued to sound, and, crossing the room to leave it, opened the door. One on either side of it, to my intense stupefaction, stood two footmen, who moved slowly away, so as to appear only to have been casually passing in the course of their duty. (I afterwards learned their names; one was called Burnier, the other Charmel.) I was not taken in for a moment by this explanation which their leisurely gait seemed to offer me. It was highly improbable; three others appeared to me to be less so; one that the Baron sometimes entertained guests against whom, as he might happen to need assistance (but why?), he deemed it necessary to keep reinforcements posted close at hand. The second was that, drawn by curiosity, they had stopped to listen at the keyhole, not thinking that I should come out so quickly. The third, that, the whole of the scene which M. de Charlus had made with me having been prepared and acted, he had himself told them to listen, from a love of the spectacular combined, perhaps, with a \u2018nunc crudimini\u2018 from which each would derive a suitable profit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My anger had not calmed that of M. de Charlus, my departure from the room seemed to cause him acute distress; he called me back, made his servants call me back, and finally, forgetting that a moment earlier, when he spoke of his \u2018august toes,\u2019 he had thought to make me a witness of his own deification, came running after me at full speed, overtook me in the hall, and stood barring the door. \u201cThere, now,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t be childish; come back for a minute; he who loveth well chasteneth well, and if I have chastened you well it is because I love you well.\u201d My anger had subsided; I let the word \u2018chasten\u2019 pass, and followed the Baron, who, summoning a footman, ordered him without a trace of self-consciousness to clear away the remains of the shattered hat, which was replaced by another. \u201cIf you will tell me, Sir, who it is that has treacherously maligned me,\u201d I said to M. de Charlus, \u201cI will stay here to learn his name and to confute the impostor.\u201d \u201cWho? Do you not know? Do you retain no memory of the things you say? Do you think that the people who do me the service of informing me of those things do not begin by demanding secrecy? And do you imagine that I am going to betray a person to whom I have given my promise?\u201d \u201cSir, is it impossible then for you to tell me?\u201d I asked, racking my brains in a final effort to discover (and discovering no one) to whom I could have spoken about M. de Charlus. \u201cYou did not hear me say that I had given a promise of secrecy to my informant?\u201d he said in a snapping voice. \u201cI see that with your fondness for abject utterances you combine one for futile persistence. You ought to have at least the intelligence to profit by a final conversation, and so to speak as to say something that does not mean precisely nothing.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d I replied, moving away from him, \u201cyou insult me; I am unarmed, because you are several times my age, we are not equally matched; on the other hand, I cannot convince you; I have already sworn to you that I have said nothing.\u201d \u201cI am lying, then, am I?\u201d he cried in a terrifying tone, and with a bound forwards that brought him within a yard of myself. \u201cSome one has misinformed you.\u201d Then in a gentle, affectionate, melancholy voice, as in those symphonies which are played without any break between the different movements, in which a gracefulscherzo, amiable and idyllic, follows the thunder-peals of the opening pages: \u201cIt is quite possible,\u201d he told me. \u201cGenerally speaking, a remark repeated at second hand is rarely true. It is your fault if, not having profited by the opportunities of seeing me which I had held out to you, you have not furnished me, by that open speech of daily intercourse which creates confidence, with the unique and sovereign remedy against a spoken word which made you out a traitor. Either way, true or false, the remark has done its work. I can never again rid myself of the impression it made on me. I cannot even say that he who chasteneth well loveth well, for I have chastened you well enough but I no longer love you.\u201d While saying this he had forced me to sit down and had rung the bell. A different footman appeared. \u201cBring something to drink and order the brougham.\u201d I said that I was not thirsty and besides had a carriage waiting. \u201cThey have probably paid him and sent him away,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou needn\u2019t worry about that. I am ordering a carriage to take you home. . . . If you\u2019re anxious about the time . . . I could have given you a room here. . . . \u201d I said that my mother would be uneasy. \u201cAh! Of course, yes. Well, true or false, the remark has done its work. My affection, a trifle premature, had flowered too soon, and, like those apple trees of which you spoke so poetically at Balbec, it has been unable to withstand the first frost.\u201d If M. de Charlus\u2019s affection for me had not been destroyed, he could hardly have acted differently, since, while assuring me that we were no longer acquainted, he made me sit down, drink, asked me to stay the night, and was going now to send me home. He had indeed an air of dreading the moment at which he must part from me and find himself alone, that sort of slightly anxious fear which his sister-in-law and cousin Guermantes had appeared to me to be feeling when she had tried to force me to stay a little longer, with something of the same momentary fondness for myself, of the same effort to prolong the passing minute. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he went on, \u201cI have not the power to make blossom again what has once been destroyed. My affection for you is quite dead. Nothing can revive it. I believe that it is not unworthy of me to confess that I regret it. I always feel myself to be a little like Victor Hugo\u2019s Boaz: \u2018I am widowed and alone, and the darkness gathers o\u2019er me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I passed again with him through the big green drawing-room. I told him, speaking quite at random, how beautiful I thought it. \u201cAin\u2019t it?\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to be fond of something. The woodwork is Bagard. What is rather charming, d\u2019you see, is that it was made to match the Beauvais chairs and the consoles. You observe, it repeats the same decorative design. There used to be only two places where you could see this, the Louvre and M. d\u2019Hinnisdal\u2019s house. But naturally, as soon as I had decided to come and live in this street, there cropped up an old family house of the Chimays which nobody had ever seen before because it came here expressly for me. On the whole, it\u2019s good. It might perhaps be better, but after all it\u2019s not bad. Some pretty things, ain\u2019t there? These are portraits of my uncles, the King of Poland and the King of England, by Mignard. But why am I telling you all this? You must know it as well as I do, you were waiting in this room. No? Ah, then they must have put you in the blue drawing-room,\u201d he said with an air that might have been either impertinence, on the score of my want of interest, or personal superiority, in not having taken the trouble to ask where I had been kept waiting. \u201cLook now, in this cabinet I have all the hats worn by Mlle. Elisabeth, by the Princesse de Lamballe, and by the Queen. They don\u2019t interest you, one would think you couldn\u2019t see. Perhaps you are suffering from an affection of the optic nerve. If you like this kind of beauty better, here is a rainbow by Turner beginning to shine out between these two Rembrandts, as a sign of our reconciliation. You hear: Beethoven has come to join him.\u201d And indeed one could hear the first chords of the third part of the Pastoral Symphony, \u2018Joy after the Storm,\u2019 performed somewhere not far away, on the first landing no doubt, by a band of musicians. I innocently inquired how they happened to be playing that, and who the musicians were. \u201cAh, well, one doesn\u2019t know. One never does know. They are unseen music. Pretty, ain\u2019t it?\u201d he said to me in a slightly impertinent tone, which, nevertheless, suggested somehow the influence and accent of Swann. \u201cBut you care about as much for it as a fish does for little apples. You want to go home, regardless of any want of respect for Beethoven or for me. You are uttering your own judgment and condemnation,\u201d he added, with an affectionate and mournful air, when the moment had come for me to go. \u201cYou will excuse my not accompanying you home, as good manners ordain that I should,\u201d he said to me. \u201cSince I have decided not to see you again, spending five minutes more in your company would make very little difference to me. But I am tired, and I have a great deal to do.\u201d And then, seeing that it was a fine night: \u201cVery well, yes, I will come in the carriage, there is a superb moon which I shall go on to admire from the Bois after I have taken you home. What, you don\u2019t know how to shave; even on a night when you\u2019ve been dining out, you have still a few hairs here,\u201d he said, taking my chin between two fingers, so to speak magnetised, which after a moment\u2019s resistance ran up to my ears, like the fingers of a barber. \u201cAh! It would be pleasant to look at the \u2018blue light of the moon\u2019 in the Bois with some one like yourself,\u201d he said to me with a sudden and almost involuntary gentleness, then, in a sadder tone: \u201cFor you are nice, all the same; you could be nicer than anyone,\u201d he went on, laying his hand in a fatherly way on my shoulder. \u201cOriginally, I must say that I found you quite insignificant.\u201d I ought to have reflected that he must find me so still. I had only to recall the rage with which he had spoken to me, barely half an hour before. In spite of this I had the impression that he was, for the moment, sincere, that his kindness of heart was prevailing over what I regarded as an almost delirious condition of susceptibility and pride. The carriage was waiting beside us, and still he prolonged the conversation. \u201cCome along,\u201d he said abruptly, \u201cjump in, in five minutes we shall be at your door. And I shall bid you a good night which will cut short our relations, and for all time. It is better, since we must part for ever, that we should do so, as in music, on a perfect chord.\u201d Despite these solemn affirmations that we should never see one another again, I could have sworn that M. de Charlus, annoyed at having forgotten himself earlier in the evening and afraid of having hurt my feelings, would not have been displeased to see me once again. Nor was I mistaken, for, a moment later: \u201cThere, now,\u201d he said, \u201cif I hadn\u2019t forgotten the most important thing of all. In memory of your grandmother, I have had bound for you a curious edition of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. That is what is going to prevent this from being our last meeting. One must console oneself with the reflexion that complicated affairs are rarely settled in a day. Just look how long they took over the Congress of Vienna.\u201d \u201cBut I could call for it without disturbing you,\u201d I said obligingly. \u201cWill you hold your tongue, you little fool,\u201d he replied with anger, \u201cand not give yourself a grotesque appearance of regarding as a small matter the honour of being probably (I do not say certainly, for it will perhaps be one of my servants who hands you the volumes) received by me.\u201d Then, regaining possession of himself: \u201cI do not wish to part from you on these words. No dissonance, before the eternal silence of the dominant.\u201d It was for his own nerves that he seemed to dread an immediate return home after harsh words of dissension. \u201cYou would not care to come to the Bois?\u201d he addressed me in a tone not so much interrogative as affirmative, and that not, as it seemed to me, because he did not wish to make me the offer but because he was afraid that his self-esteem might meet with a refusal. \u201cOh, very well,\u201d he went on, still postponing our separation, \u201cit is the moment when, as Whistler says, the bourgeois go to bed\u201d (perhaps he wished now to capture me by my self-esteem) \u201cand the right time to begin to look at things. But you don\u2019t even know who Whistler was!\u201d I changed the conversation and asked him whether the Princesse d\u2019I\u00e9na was an intelligent person. M. de Charlus stopped me, and, adopting the most contemptuous tone that I had yet heard him use, \u201cOh! There, Sir,\u201d he informed me, \u201cyou are alluding to an order of nomenclature with which I have no concern. There is perhaps an aristocracy among the Tahitians, but I must confess that I know nothing about it. The name which you have just mentioned, strangely enough, did sound in my ears only a few days ago. Some one asked me whether I would condescend to allow them to present to me the young Duc de Guastalla. The request astonished me, for the Duc de Guastalla has no need to get himself presented to me, for the simple reason that he is my cousin, and has known me all his life; he is the son of the Princesse de Parme, and, as a young kinsman of good upbringing, he never fails to come and pay his respects to me on New Year\u2019s Day. But, on making inquiries, I discovered that it was not my relative who was meant but the son of the person in whom you are interested. As there exists no Princess of that title, I supposed that my friend was referring to some poor wanton sleeping under the Pont d\u2019I\u00e9na, who had picturesquely assumed the title of Princesse d\u2019I\u00e9na, just as one talks about the Panther of the Batignolles, or the Steel King. But no, the reference was to a rich person who possesses some remarkable furniture which I had seen and admired at an exhibition, and which has this advantage over the name of its owner that it is genuine. As for this self-styled Duc de Guastalla, he, I supposed, must be my secretary\u2019s stockbroker; one can procure so many things with money. But no; it was the Emperor, it appears, who amused himself by conferring on these people a title which simply was not his to give. It was perhaps a sign of power, or of ignorance, or of malice; in any case, I consider, it was an exceedingly scurvy trick to play on these unconscious usurpers. But really, I cannot help you by throwing any light on the matter; my knowledge begins and ends with the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where, among all the Courvoisiers and Gallardons, you will find, if you can manage to secure an introduction, plenty of mangy old cats taken straight out of Balzac who will amuse you. Naturally, all that has nothing to do with the position of the Princesse de Guermantes, but without me and my \u2018Open, Sesame\u2019 her portals are unapproachable.\u201d \u201cIt is really very lovely, isn\u2019t it, Sir, the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s mansion?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s not very lovely. It\u2019s the loveliest thing in the world. Next to the Princess herself, of course.\u201d \u201cThe Princesse de Guermantes is better than the Duchesse de Guermantes?\u201d \u201cOh! There\u2019s no comparison.\u201d (It is to be observed that, whenever people in society have the least touch of imagination, they will crown or dethrone, to suit their affections or their quarrels, those whose position appeared most solid and unalterably fixed.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes\u201d (possibly, in not calling her \u2018Oriane,\u2019 he wished to set a greater distance between her and myself) \u201cis delightful, far superior to anything you can have guessed. But, after all, she is incommensurable with her cousin. The Princess is exactly what the people in the Markets might imagine Princess Metternich to have been, but old Metternich believed she had started Wagner, because she knew Victor Maurel. The Princesse de Guermantes, or rather her mother, knew the man himself. Which is a distinction, not to mention the incredible beauty of the lady. And the Esther gardens alone!\u201d \u201cOne can\u2019t see them?\u201d \u201cNo, you would have to be invited, but they never invite anyone unless I intervene.\u201d But at once withdrawing, after casting it at me, the bait of this offer, he held out his hand, for we had reached my door. \u201cMy part is played, Sir, I will simply add these few words. Another person will perhaps some day offer you his affection, as I have done. Let the present example serve for your instruction. Do not neglect it. Affection is always precious. What one cannot do by oneself in this life, because there are things which one cannot ask, nor do, nor wish, nor learn by oneself, one can do in company, and without needing to be Thirteen, as in Balzac\u2019s story, or Four, as in The Three Musketeers. Good-bye.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He must have been feeling tired and have abandoned the idea of going to look at the moonlight, for he asked me to tell his coachman to drive home. At once he made a sharp movement as though he had changed his mind. But I had already given the order, and, so as not to lose any more time, went across now to ring the bell, without its entering my head that I had been meaning to tell M. de Charlus, about the German Emperor and General Botha, stories which had been an hour ago such an obsession but which his unexpected and crushing reception had sent flying far out of my mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On entering my room I saw on my desk a letter which Franchise\u2019s young footman had written to one of his friends and had left lying there. Now that my mother was away, there was no liberty which he had the least hesitation in taking; I was the more to blame of the two for taking that of reading the letter which, without an envelope, lay spread out before me and (which was my sole excuse) seemed to offer itself to my eye\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDear Friend and Cousin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope this finds you in good health, and the same with all the young folk, particularly my young godson Joseph whom I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting but whom I prefer to you all as being my godson, these relics of the heart they have their dust also, upon their blest remains let us not lay our hands. Besides dear friend and cousin who can say that to-morrow you and your dear wife my cousin Marie, will not both of you be cast headlong down into the bottom of the sea, like the sailor clinging to the mast on high, for this life is but a dark valley. Dear friend I must tell you that my principal occupation, which will astonish you I am certain, is now poetry which I love passionately, for one must somehow pass the time away. And so dear friend do not be too surprised if I have not answered your last letter before now, in place of pardon let oblivion come. As you are aware, Madame\u2019s mother has passed away amid unspeakable sufferings which fairly exhausted her as she saw as many as three doctors. The day of her interment was a great day for all Monsieur\u2019s relations came in crowds as well as several Ministers. It took them more than two hours to get to the cemetery, which will make you all open your eyes pretty wide in your village for they certainly won\u2019t do as much for mother Michu. So all my life to come can be but one long sob. I am amusing myself enormously with the motorcycle of which I have recently learned. What would you say, my dear friends, if I arrived suddenly like that at full speed at Les Ecorces. But on that head I shall no more keep silence for I feel that the frenzy of grief sweeps its reason away. I am associating with the Duchesse de Guermantes, people whose very names you have never heard in our ignorant villages. Therefore it is with pleasure that I am going to send the works of Racine, of Victor Hugo, of Pages Choisies de Chenedolle, of Alfred de Musset, for I would cure the land in which I saw the light of ignorance which leads unerringly to crime. I can think of nothing more to say to you and send you like the pelican wearied by a long flight my best regards as well as to your wife my godson and your sister Rose. May it never be said of her: And Rose she lived only as live the roses, as has been said by Victor Hugo, the sonnet of Arvers, Alfred de Musset, all those great geniuses who for that cause have had to die upon the blazing scaffold like Jeanne d\u2019Arc. Hoping for your next letter soon, receive my kisses like those of a brother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cP\u00e9rigot (Joseph).\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are attracted by every form of life which represents to us something unknown and strange, by a last illusion still unshattered. In spite of this, the mysterious utterances by means of which M. de Charlus had led me to imagine the Princesse de Guermantes as an extraordinary creature, different from anyone that I knew, were not sufficient to account for the stupefaction in which I was plunged, speedily followed by the fear that I might be the victim of some bad joke planned by some one who wanted to send me to the door of a house to which I had not been invited, when, about two months after my dinner with the Duchess and while she was at Cannes, having opened an envelope the appearance of which had not led me to suppose that it contained anything out of the common, I read the following words engraved on a card: \u201cThe Princesse de Guermantes,n\u00e9e Duchesse en Bavi\u00e8re, At Home, the \u2014\u2014-th.\u201d No doubt to be invited to the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s was perhaps not, from the social point of view, any more difficult than to dine with the Duchess, and my slight knowledge of heraldry had taught me that the title of Prince is not superior to that of Duke. Besides, I told myself that the intelligence of a society woman could not be essentially so heterogeneous to that of her congeners as M. de Charlus made out, nor so heterogeneous to that of any one other woman in society. But my imagination, like Elstir engaged upon rendering some effect of perspective without reference to a knowledge of the laws of nature which he might quite well possess, depicted for me not what I knew but what it saw; what it saw, that is to say what the name shewed it. Now, even before I had met the Duchess, the name Guermantes preceded by the title of Princess, like a note or a colour or quantity, profoundly modified from the surrounding values by the mathematical or aesthetic sign that governs it, had already suggested to me something entirely different. With that title one finds one\u2019s thoughts straying instinctively to the memoirs of the days of Louis XIII and Louis XIV, the English Court, the Queen of Scots, the Duchesse d\u2019Aumale; and I imagined the town house of the Princesse de Guermantes as more or less frequented by the Duchesse de Longueville and the great Cond\u00e9, whose presence there rendered it highly improbable that I should ever make my way into it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of the things that M. de Charlus had told me had driven a vigorous spur into my imagination and, making it forget how much the reality had disappointed me at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s (people\u2019s names are in this respect like the names of places), had swung it towards Oriane\u2019s cousin. For that matter, M. de Charlus misled me at times as to the imaginary value and variety of people in society only because he was himself at times misled. And this, perhaps, because he did nothing, did not write, did not paint, did not even read anything in a serious and thorough manner. But, superior by several degrees to the people in society, if it was from them and the spectacle they afforded that he drew the material for his conversation, he was not for that reason understood by them. Speaking as an artist, he could at the most reveal the fallacious charm of people in society. But reveal it to artists alone, with relation to whom he might be said to play the part played by the reindeer among the Esquimaux. This precious animal plucks for them from the barren rocks lichens and mosses which they themselves could neither discover nor utilise, but which, once they have been digested by the reindeer, become for the inhabitants of the far North a nourishing form of food\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To which I may add that the pictures which M. de Charlus drew of society were animated with plenty of life by the blend of his ferocious hatreds and his passionate affections. Hatreds directed mainly against the young men, adoration aroused principally by certain women\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If among these the Princesse de Guermantes was placed by M. de Charlus upon the most exalted throne, his mysterious words about the \u2018unapproachable Aladdin\u2019s palace\u2019 in which his cousin dwelt were not sufficient to account for my stupefaction. Apart from whatever may be due to the divers subjective points of view, of which I shall have to speak later, in these artificial magnifications, the fact remains that there is a certain objective reality in each of these people, and consequently a difference among them. And how, when it comes to that, could it be otherwise? The humanity with which we consort and which bears so little resemblance to our dreams is, for all that, the same that, in the Memoirs, in the Letters of eminent persons, we have seen described and have felt a desire to know. The old man of complete insignificance whom we met at dinner is the same who wrote that proud letter, which (in a book on the War of 1870) we read with emotion, to Prince Friedrich-Karl. We are bored at a dinner-table because our imagination is absent, and because it is bearing us company we are interested in a book. But the people in question are the same. We should like to have known Mme. de Pompadour, who was so valuable a patron of the arts, and we should have been as much bored in her company as among the modern Egerias, at whose houses we cannot bring ourselves to pay a second call, so uninteresting do we find them. The fact remains, nevertheless, that these differences do exist. People are never exactly similar to one another, their mode of behaviour with regard to ourselves, at, one might say, the same level of friendship, reveals differences which, in the end, offer compensations. When I knew Mme. de Montmorency, she loved to say unpleasant things to me, but if I was in need of a service she would squander, in the hope of obtaining it for me effectively, all the credit at her disposal, without counting the cost. Whereas some other woman, Mme. de Guermantes for example, would never have wished to hurt my feelings, never said anything about me except what might give me pleasure, showered on me all those tokens of friendship which formed the rich manner of living, morally, of the Guermantes, but, had I asked her for the least thing above and beyond that, would not have moved an inch to procure it for me, as in those country houses where one has at one\u2019s disposal a motor-car and a special footman, but where it is impossible to obtain a glass of cider, for which no provision has been made in the arrangements for a party. Which was for me the true friend, Mme. de Montmorency, so glad always to annoy me and always so ready to oblige, or Mme. de Guermantes, distressed by the slightest offence that might have been given me and incapable of the slightest effort to be of use to me? The types of the human mind are so varied, so opposite, not only in literature but in society, that Baudelaire and M\u00e9rim\u00e9e are not the only people who have the right to despise one another mutually. These peculiarities continue to form in everyone a system of attitudes, of speech, of actions, so coherent, so despotic, that when we are in the presence of anyone his or her system seems to us superior to the rest. With Mme. de Guermantes, her words, deduced like a theorem from her type of mind, seemed to me the only ones that could possibly be said. And I was, at heart, of her opinion when she told me that Mme. de Montmorency was stupid and kept an open mind towards all the things she did not understand, or when, having heard of some spiteful remark by that lady, she said: \u201cThat is what you call a good woman; it is what I call a monster.\u201d But this tyranny of the reality which confronts us, this preponderance of the lamplight which turns the dawn \u2014 already distant \u2014 as pale as the faintest memory, disappeared when I was away from Mme. de Guermantes, and a different lady said to me, putting herself on my level and reckoning the Duchess as placed far below either of us: \u201cOriane takes no interest, really, in anything or anybody,\u201d or even (what in the presence of Mme. de Guermantes it would have seemed impossible to believe, so loudly did she herself proclaim the opposite): \u201cOriane is a snob.\u201d Seeing that no mathematical process would have enabled one to convert Mme. d\u2019Arpajon and Mme. de Montpensier into commensurable quantities, it would have been impossible for me to reply, had anyone asked me which of the two seemed to me superior to the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, among the peculiar characteristics of the drawing-room of the Princesse de Guermantes, the one most generally quoted was a certain exclusiveness, due in part to the royal birth of the Princess, but especially to the almost fossilised rigidity of the aristocratic prejudices of the Prince, prejudices which, incidentally, the Duke and Duchess had made no scruple about deriding in front of me, and which naturally were to make me regard it as more improbable than ever that I should have been invited to a party by this man who reckoned only in royalties and dukes, and at every dinner-party made a scene because he had not been put in the place to which he would have been entitled under Louis XIV, a place which, thanks to his immense erudition in matters of history and genealogy, he was the only person who knew. For this reason, many of the people in society placed to the credit of the Duke and Duchess the differences which distinguished them from their cousins. \u201cThe Duke and Duchess are far more modern, far more intelligent, they don\u2019t think of nothing, like the other couple, but how many quarterings one has, their house is three hundred years in advance of their cousins\u2019,\u201d were customary remarks, the memory of which made me tremble as I looked at the card of invitation, to which they gave a far greater probability of its having been sent me by some practical joker\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Duke and Duchess had not been still at Cannes, I might have tried to find out from them whether the invitation which I had received was genuine. This state of doubt in which I was plunged was not due, as I flattered myself for a time by supposing, to a sentiment which a man of fashion would not have felt and which, consequently, a writer, even if he belonged apart from his writership to the fashionable caste, ought to reproduce in order to be thoroughly \u2018objective\u2019 and to depict each class differently. I happened, in fact, only the other day, in a charming volume of memoirs, to come upon the record of uncertainties analogous to those which the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s card made me undergo. \u201cGeorges and I\u201d (or \u201cH\u00e9ly and I,\u201d I have not the book at hand to verify the reference) \u201cwere so keen to be asked to Mme. Delessert\u2019s that, having received an invitation from her, we thought it prudent, each of us independently, to make certain that we were not the victims of an April fool.\u201d Now, the writer is none other than the Comte d\u2019Haussonville (he who married the Duc de Broglie\u2019s daughter) and the other young man who \u2018independently\u2019 makes sure that he is not having a practical joke played on him is, according to whether he is called Georges or H\u00e9ly, one or other of the two inseparable friends of M. d\u2019Haussonville, either M. d\u2019Harcourt or the Prince de Chalais\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day on which the party was to be given at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, I learned that the Duke and Duchess had just returned to Paris. The Princess\u2019s ball would not have brought them back, but one of their cousins was seriously ill, and moreover the Duke was greatly taken up with a revel which was to be held the same night, and at which he himself was to appear as Louis XI and his wife as Isabel of Bavaria. And I determined to go and see her that morning. But, having gone out early, they had not yet returned; I watched first of all from a little room, which had seemed to me to be a good look-out post, for the arrival of their carriage. As a matter of fact I had made a singularly bad choice in my observatory from which I could barely make out our courtyard, but I did see into several others, and this, though of no value to me, occupied my mind for a time. It is not only in Venice that one has those outlooks on to several houses at once which have proved so tempting to painters; it is just the same in Paris. Nor do I cite Venice at random. It is of its poorer quarters that certain poor quarters of Paris make one think, in the morning, with their tall, wide chimneys to which the sun imparts the most vivid pinks, the brightest reds; it is a whole garden that flowers above the houses, and flowers in such a variety of tints that one would call it, planted on top of the town, the garden of a tulip-fancier of Delft or Haarlem. And then also, the extreme proximity of the houses, with their windows looking opposite one another on to a common courtyard, makes of each casement the frame in which a cook sits dreamily gazing down at the ground below, in which farther off a girl is having her hair combed by an old woman with the face, barely distinguishable in the shadow, of a witch: thus each courtyard provides for the adjoining house, by suppressing all sound in its interval, by leaving visible a series of silent gestures in a series of rectangular frames, glazed by the closing of the windows, an exhibition of a hundred Dutch paintings hung in rows. Certainly from the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes one did not have the same kind of view, but one had curious views also, especially from the strange trigonometrical point at which I had placed myself and from which one\u2019s gaze was arrested by nothing nearer than the distant heights formed by the comparatively vague plots of ground which preceded, on a steep slope, the mansion of the Marquise de Plassac and Mme. de Tresmes, cousins (of the most noble category) of M. de Guermantes, whom I did not know. Between me and this house (which was that of their father, M. de Br\u00e9quigny) nothing but blocks of buildings of low elevation, facing in every conceivable direction, which, without blocking the view, increased the distance with their diagonal perspective. The red-tiled turret of the coach-house in which the Marquis de Fr\u00e9court kept his carriages did indeed end in a spire that rose rather higher, but was so slender that it concealed nothing, and made one think of those picturesque old buildings in Switzerland which spring up in isolation at the foot of a mountain. All these vague and divergent points on which my eyes rested made more distant apparently than if it had been separated from us by several streets or by a series of foothills the house of Mme. de Plassac, actually quite near but chimerically remote as in an Alpine landscape. When its large paned windows, glittering in the sunlight like flakes of rock crystal, were thrown open so as to air the rooms, one felt, in following from one floor to the next the footmen whom it was impossible to see clearly but who were visibly shaking carpets, the same pleasure as when one sees in a landscape by Turner or Elstir a traveller in a mail-coach, or a guide, at different degrees of altitude on the Saint-Gothard. But from this point of view in which I had ensconced myself I should have been in danger of not seeing M. or Mme. de Guermantes come in, so that when in the afternoon I was free to resume my survey I simply stood on the staircase, from which the opening of the carriage-gate could not escape my notice, and it was on this staircase that I posted myself, albeit there did not appear there, so entrancing with their footmen rendered minute by distance and busily cleaning, the Alpine beauties of the Br\u00e9quigny-Tresmes mansion. Now this wait on the staircase was to have for me consequences so considerable, and to reveal to me a picture no longer Turneresque but ethical, of so great importance, that it is preferable to postpone the account of it for a little while by interposing first that of my visit to the Guermantes when I knew that they had come home. It was the Duke alone who received me in the library. As I went in there came out a little man with snow-white hair, a look of poverty, a little black neckcloth such as was worn by the lawyer at Combray and by several of my grandfather\u2019s friends, but of a more timid aspect than they, who, making me a series of profound bows, refused absolutely to go downstairs until I had passed him. The Duke shouted after him from the library something which I did not understand, and the other responded with further bows, addressed to the wall, for the Duke could not see him, but endlessly repeated nevertheless, like the purposeless smiles on the faces of people who are talking to one over the telephone; he had a falsetto voice, and saluted me afresh with the humility of a man of business. And he might, for that matter, have been a man of business from Combray, so much was he in the style, provincial, out of date and mild, of the small folk, the modest elders of those parts. \u201cYou shall see Oriane in a minute,\u201d the Duke told me when I had entered the room. \u201cAs Swann is coming in presently and bringing her the proofs of his book on the coinage of the Order of Malta, and, what is worse, an immense photograph he has had taken shewing both sides of each of the coins, Oriane preferred to get dressed early so that she can stay with him until it\u2019s time to go out to dinner. We have such a heap of things in the house already that we don\u2019t know where to put them all, and I ask myself where on earth we are going to stick this photograph. But I have too good-natured a wife, who is too fond of giving people pleasure. She thought it would be polite to ask Swann to let her see side by side on one sheet the heads of all those Grand Masters of the Order whose medals he has found at Rhodes. I said Malta, didn\u2019t I, it is Rhodes, but it\u2019s all the same Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. As a matter of fact, she is interested in them only because Swann makes a hobby of it. Our family is very much mixed up in the whole story; even at the present day, my brother, whom you know, is one of the highest dignitaries in the Order of Malta. But I might have told all that to Oriane, she simply wouldn\u2019t have listened to me. On the other hand, it was quite enough that Swann\u2019s researches into the Templars (it\u2019s astonishing the passion that people of one religion have for studying others) should have led him on to the history of the Knights of Rhodes, who succeeded the Templars, for Oriane at once to insist on seeing the heads of these Knights. They were very small fry indeed compared with the Lusignans, Kings of Cyprus, from whom we descend in a direct line. But so far, as Swann hasn\u2019t taken them up, Oriane doesn\u2019t care to hear anything about the Lusignans.\u201d I could not at once explain to the Duke why I had come. What happened was that several relatives or friends, including Mme. de Silistrie and the Duchesse de Montrose, came to pay a call on the Duchess, who was often at home before dinner, and not finding her there stayed for a short while with the Duke. The first of these ladies (the Princesse de Silistrie), simply attired, with a dry but friendly manner, carried a stick in her hand. I was afraid at first that she had injured herself, or was a cripple. She was on the contrary most alert. She spoke regretfully to the Duke of a first cousin of his own \u2014 not on the Guermantes side, but more illustrious still, were that possible \u2014 whose health, which had been in a grave condition for some time past, had grown suddenly worse. But it was evident that the Duke, while full of pity for his cousin\u2019s lot, and repeating \u201cPoor Mama! He\u2019s such a good fellow!\u201d had formed a favourable prognosis. The fact was that the dinner at which the Duke was to be present amused him, the big party at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s did not bore him, but above all he was to go on at one o\u2019clock in the morning with his wife to a great supper and costume ball, with a view to which a costume of Louis XI for himself, and one of Isabel of Bavaria for his wife were waiting in readiness. And the Duke was determined not to be disturbed amid all these gaieties by the sufferings of the worthy Amanien d\u2019Osmond. Two other ladies carrying sticks, Mme. de Plassac and Mme. de Tresmes, both daughters of the Comte de Br\u00e9quigny, came in next to pay Basin a visit, and declared that cousin Mama\u2019s state left no room now for hope. The Duke shrugged his shoulders, and to change the conversation asked whether they were going that evening to Marie-Gilbert\u2019s. They replied that they were not, in view of the state of Amanien who was in his last agony, and indeed they had excused themselves from the dinner to which the Duke was going, the other guests at which they proceeded to enumerate: the brother of King Theodosius, the Infanta Maria Concepcion, and so forth. As the Marquis d\u2019Osmond was less nearly related to them than he was to Basin, their \u2018defection\u2019 appeared to the Duke to be a sort of indirect reproach aimed at his own conduct. And so, albeit they had come down from the heights of the Br\u00e9quigny mansion to see the Duchess (or rather to announce to her the alarming character, incompatible for his relatives with attendance at social gatherings, of their cousin\u2019s illness) they did not stay long, and, each armed with her alpenstock, Walpurge and Doroth\u00e9e (such were the names of the two sisters) retraced the craggy path to their citadel. I never thought of asking the Guermantes what was the meaning of these sticks, so common in a certain part of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Possibly, looking upon the whole parish as their domain, and not caring to hire cabs, they were in the habit of taking long walks, for which some old fracture, due to immoderate indulgence in the chase, and to the falls from horseback which are often the fruit of that indulgence, or simply rheumatism caused by the dampness of the left bank and of old country houses made a stick necessary. Perhaps they had not set out upon any such long expedition through the quarter, but, having merely come down into their garden (which lay at no distance from that of the Duchess) to pick the fruit required for stewing, had looked in on their way home to bid good evening to Mme. de Guermantes, though without going so far as to bring a pair of shears or a watering-can into her house. The Duke appeared touched that I should have come to see them so soon after their return to Paris. But his face grew dark when I told him that I had come to ask his wife to find out whether her cousin really had invited me. I had touched upon one of those services which M. and Mme. de Guermantes were not fond of rendering. The Duke explained to me that it was too late, that if the Princess had not sent me an invitation it would make him appear to be asking her for one, that his cousins had refused him one once before, and he had no wish to appear either directly or indirectly to be interfering with their visiting list, be \u2018meddling\u2019; finally, he could not even be sure that he and his wife, who were dining out that evening, would not come straight home afterwards, that in that case their best excuse for not having gone to the Princess\u2019s party would be to conceal from her the fact of their return to Paris, instead of hastening to inform her of it, as they must do if they sent her a note, or spoke to her over the telephone about me, and certainly too late to be of any use, since, in all probability, the Princess\u2019s list of guests would be closed by now. \u201cYou\u2019ve not fallen foul of her in any way?\u201d he asked in a suspicious tone, the Guermantes living in a constant fear of not being informed of the latest society quarrels, and so of people\u2019s trying to climb back into favour on their shoulders. Finally, as the Duke was in the habit of taking upon himself all decisions that might seem not very good-natured: \u201cListen, my boy,\u201d he said to me suddenly, as though the idea had just come into his head, \u201cI would really rather not mention at all to Oriane that you have been speaking to me about it. You know how kind-hearted she is; besides, she has an enormous regard for you, she would insist on sending to ask her cousin, in spite of anything I might say to the contrary, and if she is tired after dinner, there will be no getting out of it, she will be forced to go to the party. No, decidedly, I shall say nothing to her about it. Anyhow, you will see her yourself in a minute. But not a word about that matter, I beg of you. If you decide to go to the party, I have no need to tell you what a pleasure it will be to us to spend the evening there with you.\u201d The motives actuating humanity are too sacred for him before whom they are invoked not to bow to them, whether he believes them to be sincere or not; I did not wish to appear to be weighing in the balance for a moment the relative importance of my invitation and the possible tiredness of Mme. de Guermantes, and I promised not to speak to her of the object of my visit, exactly as though I had been taken in by the little farce which M. de Guermantes had performed for my benefit. I asked him if he thought there was any chance of my seeing Mme. de Stermaria at the Princess\u2019s. \u201cWhy, no,\u201d he replied with the air of an expert; \u201cI know the name you mention, from having seen it in lists of club members, it is not at all the type of person who goes to Gilbert\u2019s. You will see nobody there who is not excessively proper and intensely boring, duchesses bearing titles which one thought were extinct years ago and which they have revived for the occasion, all the Ambassadors, heaps of Coburgs, foreign royalties, but you mustn\u2019t hope for the ghost of a Stermaria. Gilbert would be taken ill at the mere thought of such a thing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait now, you\u2019re fond of painting, I must shew you a superb picture I bought from my cousin, partly in exchange for the Elstirs, which frankly did not appeal to us. It was sold to me as a Philippe de Champaigne, but I believe myself that it\u2019s by some one even greater. Would you like to know my idea? I believe it to be a Velazquez, and of the best period,\u201d said the Duke, looking me boldly in the eyes, whether to learn my impression or in the hope of enhancing it. A footman came in. \u201cMme. la Duchesse has told me to ask M. le Duc if M. le Duc will be so good as to see M. Swann, as Mme. la Duchesse is not quite ready.\u201d \u201cShew M. Swann in,\u201d said the Duke, after looking at his watch and seeing that he had still a few minutes before he need go to dress. \u201cNaturally my wife, who told him to come, is not ready. There\u2019s no use saying anything before Swann about Marie-Gilbert\u2019s party,\u201d said the Duke. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s been invited. Gilbert likes him immensely, because he believes him to be the natural grandson of the Duc de Berri, but that\u2019s a long story. (Otherwise, you can imagine! My cousin, who falls in a fit if he sees a Jew a mile off.) But now, don\u2019t you see, the Dreyfus case has made things more serious. Swann ought to have realised that he more than anyone must drop all connexion with those fellows, instead of which he says the most offensive things.\u201d The Duke called back the footman to know whether the man who had been sent to inquire at cousin Osmond\u2019s had returned. His plan was as follows: as he believed, and rightly, that his cousin was dying, he was anxious to obtain news of him before his death, that is to say before he was obliged to go into mourning. Once covered by the official certainty that Amanien was still alive, he could go without a thought to his dinner, to the Prince\u2019s party, to the midnight revel at which he would appear as Louis XI, and had made the most exciting assignation with a new mistress, and would make no more inquiries until the following day, when his pleasures would be at an end. Then one would put on mourning if the cousin had passed away in the night. \u201cNo, M. le Duc, he is not back yet.\u201d \u201cWhat in the Name of God! Nothing is ever done in this house till the last minute,\u201d cried the Duke, at the thought that Amanien might still be in time to \u2018croak\u2019 for an evening paper, and so make him miss his revel. He sent for the Temps, in which there was nothing. I had not seen Swann for a long time, and asked myself at first whether in the old days he used to clip his moustache, or had not his hair brushed up vertically in front, for I found in him something altered; it was simply that he was indeed greatly \u2018altered\u2019 because he was very ill, and illness produces in the face modifications as profound as are created by growing a beard or by changing the line of one\u2019s parting. (Swann\u2019s illness was the same that had killed his mother, who had been attacked by it at precisely the age which he had now reached. Our existences are in truth, owing to heredity, as full of cabalistic ciphers, of horoscopic castings as if there really were sorcerers in the world. And just as there is a certain duration of life for humanity in general, so there is one for families in particular, that is to say, in any one family, for the members of it who resemble one another.) Swann was dressed with an elegance which, like that of his wife, associated with what he now was what he once had been. Buttoned up in a pearl-grey frockcoat which emphasised the tallness of his figure, slender, his white gloves stitched in black, he carried a grey tall hat of a specially wide shape which Delion had ceased now to make except for him, the Prince de Sagan, the Marquis de Mod\u00e8ne, M. Charles Haas and Comte Louis de Turenne. I was surprised at the charming smile and affectionate handclasp with which he replied to my greeting, for I had imagined that after so long an interval he would not recognise me at once; I told him of my astonishment; he received it with a shout of laughter, a trace of indignation and a further grip of my hand, as if it were throwing doubt on the soundness of his brain or the sincerity of his affection to suppose that he did not know me. And yet that was what had happened; he did not identify me, as I learned long afterwards, until several minutes later when he heard my name mentioned. But no change in his face, in his .speech, in the things he said to me betrayed the discovery which a chance word from M. de Guermantes had enabled him to make, with such mastery, with such absolute sureness did he play the social game. He brought to it, moreover, that spontaneity in manners and personal initiative, even in his style of dress, which characterised the Guermantes type. Thus it was that the greeting which the old clubman, without recognising me, had given me was not the cold and stiff greeting of the man of the world who was a pure formalist, but a greeting full of a real friendliness, of a true charm, such as the Duchesse de Guermantes, for instance, possessed (carrying it so far as to smile at you first, before you had bowed to her, if she met you in the street), in contrast to the more mechanical greeting customary among the ladies of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. In the same way, again, the hat which, in conformity with a custom that was beginning to disappear, he laid on the floor by his feet, was lined with green leather, a thing not usually done, because, according to him, this kept the hat much cleaner, in reality because it was highly becoming. \u201cNow, Charles, you\u2019re a great expert, come and see what I\u2019ve got to shew you, after which, my boys, I\u2019m going to ask your permission to leave you together for a moment while I go and change my clothes, besides, I expect Oriane won\u2019t be long now.\u201d And he shewed his \u2018Velazquez\u2019 to Swann. \u201cBut it seems to me that I know this,\u201d said Swann with the grimace of a sick man for whom the mere act of speaking requires an effort. \u201cYes,\u201d said the Duke, turned serious by the time which the expert took in expressing his admiration. \u201cYou have probably seen it at Gilbert\u2019s.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, of course, I remember.\u201d \u201cWhat do you suppose it is?\u201d \u201cOh, well, if it cornes from Gilbert\u2019s, it is probably one of your ancestors,\u201d said Swann with a blend of irony and deference towards a form of greatness which he would have felt it impolite and absurd to despise, but to which for reasons of good taste he preferred to make only a playful reference\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo be sure, it is,\u201d said the Duke bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s Boson, the I forget how manieth de Guermantes. Not that I care a damn about that. You know I\u2019m not as feudal as my cousin. I\u2019ve heard the names mentioned of Rigaud, Mignard, Velazquez even!\u201d he went on, fastening on Swann the gaze of an inquisitor and executioner in an attempt at once to read into his mind and to influence his response. \u201cWell,\u201d he concluded, for when he was led to provoke artificially an opinion which he desired to hear, he had the faculty, after a few moments, of believing that it had been spontaneously uttered; \u201ccome, now, none of your flattery, do you think it\u2019s by one of those big masters I\u2019ve mentioned?\u201d \u201cNnnnno,\u201d said Swann. \u201cBut after all, I know nothing about these things, it\u2019s not for me to decide who daubed the canvas. But you\u2019re a dilettante, a master of the subject, to whom do you attribute it? You\u2019re enough of an expert to have some idea. What would you put it down as?\u201d Swann hesitated for a moment before the picture, which obviously he thought atrocious. \u201cA bad joke!\u201d he replied with a smile at the Duke who could not check an impulsive movement of rage. When this had subsided: \u201cBe good fellows, both of you, wait a moment for Oriane, I must go and put on my swallow-tails and then I\u2019ll join you. I shall send word to my good woman that you\u2019re both waiting for her.\u201d I talked for a minute or two with Swann about the Dreyfus case, and asked him how it was that all the Guermantes were anti-Dreyfusards. \u201cIn the first place because at heart all these people are anti-Semites,\u201d replied Swann, who, all the same, knew very well from experience that certain of them were not, but, like everyone who supports any cause with ardour, preferred, to explain the fact that other people did not share his opinion, to suppose in them a preconceived reason, a prejudice against which there was nothing to be done, rather than reasons which might permit of discussion. Besides, having come to the premature term of his life, like a weary animal that is goaded on, he cried out against these persecutions and was returning to the spiritual fold of his fathers. \u201cYes, the Prince de Guermantes,\u201d I said, \u201cit is true, I\u2019ve heard that he was anti-semitic.\u201d \u201cOh, that fellow! I wasn\u2019t even thinking about him. He carries it to such a point that when he was in the army and had a frightful toothache he preferred to grin and bear it rather than go to the only dentist in the district, who happened to be a Jew, and later on he allowed a wing of his castle which had caught fire to be burned to the ground, because he would have had to send for extinguishers to the place next door, which belongs to the Rothschilds.\u201d \u201cAre you going to be there this evening, by any chance?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Swann replied, \u201calthough I am far too tired. But he sent me a wire to tell me that he has something to say to me. I feel that I shall be too unwell in the next few days to go there or to see him at home; it would upset me, so I prefer to get it over at once.\u201d \u201cBut the Duc de Guermantes is not anti-semitic?\u201d \u201cYou can see quite well that he is, since he\u2019s an anti-Dreyfusard,\u201d replied Swann, without noticing the logical fallacy. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t prevent my being very sorry that I disappointed the man \u2014 what am I saying? The Duke, I mean \u2014 by not admiring his Mignard or whatever he calls it.\u201d \u201cBut at any rate,\u201d I went on, reverting to the Dreyfus case, \u201cthe Duchess, she, now, is intelligent.\u201d \u201cYes, she is charming. To my mind, however, she was even more charming when she was still known as the Princesse des Laumes. Her mind has become somehow more angular, it was all much softer in the juvenile great lady, but after all, young or old, men or women, what can you expect, all these people belong to a different race, one can\u2019t have a thousand years of feudalism in one\u2019s blood with impunity. Naturally they imagine that it counts for nothing in their opinions.\u201d \u201cAll the same, Robert de Saint-Loup is a Dreyfusard.\u201d \u201cAh! So much the better, all the more as you know that his mother is extremely \u2018and.\u2019 I had heard that he was, but I wasn\u2019t certain of it. That gives me a great deal of pleasure. It doesn\u2019t surprise me, he\u2019s highly intelligent. It\u2019s a great thing, that is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dreyfusism had brought to Swann an extraordinary simplicity of mind and had imparted to his way of looking at things an impulsiveness, an inconsistency more noticeable even than had been the similar effects of his marriage to Odette; this new loss of caste would have been better described as a recasting, and was entirely to his credit, since it made him return to the ways in which his forebears had trodden and from which he had turned aside to mix with the aristocracy. But Swann, just at the very moment when with such lucidity it had been granted to him, thanks to the gifts he had inherited from his race, to perceive a truth that was still hidden from people of fashion, shewed himself nevertheless quite comically blind. He subjected afresh all his admirations and all his contempts to the test of a new criterion, Dreyfusism. That the anti-Dreyfusism of Mme. Bontemps should have made him think her a fool was no more astonishing than that, when he was first married, he should have thought her intelligent. It was not very serious either that the new wave reached also his political judgments and made him lose all memory of having treated as a man with a price, a British spy (this latter was an absurdity of the Guermantes set), Clemenceau, whom he declared now to have always stood up for conscience, to be a man of iron, like Comely. \u201cNo, no, I never told you anything of the sort. You\u2019re thinking of some one else.\u201d But, sweeping past his political judgments, the wave overthrew in Swann his literary judgments also, and even affected his way of pronouncing them. Barr\u00e9s had lost all his talent, and even the books of his early days were feeble, one could hardly read them again. \u201cYou try, you\u2019ll find you can\u2019t struggle to the end. What a difference from Clemenceau! Personally, I am not anticlerical, but when you compare them together you must see that Barr\u00e9s is invertebrate. He\u2019s a very great fellow, is old Clemenceau. How he knows the language!\u201d However, the anti-Dreyfusards were in no position to criticise these follies. They explained that one was a Dreyfusard by one\u2019s being of Jewish origin. If a practising Catholic like Saniette stood out also for a fresh trial, that was because he was buttonholed by Mme. Verdurin, who behaved like a wild Radical. She was out above all things against the \u2018frocks.\u2019 Saniette was more fool than knave, and had no idea of the harm that the Mistress was doing him. If you pointed out that Brichot was equally a friend of Mme. Verdurin and was a member of the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, that was because he was more intelligent. \u201cYou see him occasionally?\u201d I asked Swann, referring to Saint-Loup. \u201cNo, never. He wrote to me the other day hoping that I would ask the Duc de Mouchy and various other people to vote for him at the Jockey, where for that matter he got through like a letter through the post.\u201d \u201cIn spite of the Case!\u201d \u201cThe question was never raised. However I must tell you that since all this business began I never set foot in the place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes returned, and was presently joined by his wife, all ready now for the evening, tall and proud in a gown of red satin the skirt of which was bordered with spangles. She had in her hair a long ostrich feather dyed purple, and over her shoulders a tulle scarf of the same red as her dress. \u201cHow nice it is to have one\u2019s hat lined with leather,\u201d said the Duchess, whom nothing escaped. \u201cHowever, with you, Charles, everything is always charming, whether it\u2019s what you wear or what you say what you read or what you do.\u201d Swann meanwhile, without apparently listening, was considering the Duchess as he would have studied the canvas of a master, and then sought her gaze, making with his lips the grimace which implies: \u2018The devil!\u2019 Mme. de Guermantes rippled with laughter. \u201cSo my clothes please you? I\u2019m delighted. But I must say that they don\u2019t please me much,\u201d she went on with a sulking air. \u201cGood Lord, what a bore it is to have to dress up and go out when one would ever so much rather stay at home!\u201d \u201cWhat magnificent rubies!\u201d \u201cAh! my dear Charles, at least one can see that you know what you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019re not like that brute Monserfeuil who asked me if they were real. I must say that I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like them. They were a present from the Grand Duchess. They\u2019re a little too large for my liking, a little too like claret glasses filled to the brim, but I\u2019ve put them on because we shall be seeing the Grand Duchess this evening at Marie-Gilbert\u2019s,\u201d added Mme. de Guermantes, never suspecting that this assertion destroyed the force of those previously made by the Duke. \u201cWhat\u2019s on at the Princess\u2019s?\u201d inquired Swann. \u201cPractically nothing,\u201d the Duke hastened to reply, the question having made him think that Swann was not invited. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Basin? When all the highways and hedgerows have been scoured? It will be a deathly crush. What will be pretty, though,\u201d she went on, looking wistfully at Swann, \u201cif the storm I can feel in the air now doesn\u2019t break, will be those marvellous gardens. You know them, of course. I was there a month ago, at the time when the lilacs were in flower, you can\u2019t have any idea how lovely they were. And then the fountain, really, it\u2019s Versailles in Paris.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of person is the Princess?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy, you know quite well, you\u2019ve seen her here, she\u2019s as beautiful as the day, also rather an idiot. Very nice, in spite of all her Germanic high-and-mightiness, full of good nature and stupid mistakes.\u201d Swann was too subtle not to perceive that the Duchess, in this speech, was trying to shew the \u2018Guermantes wit,\u2019 and at no great cost to herself, for she was only serving up in a less perfect form an old saying of her own. Nevertheless, to prove to the Duchess that he appreciated her intention to be, and as though she had really succeeded in being, funny, he smiled with a slightly forced air, causing me by this particular form of insincerity the same feeling of awkwardness that used to disturb me long ago when I heard my parents discussing with M. Vinteuil the corruption of certain sections of society (when they knew very well that a corruption far greater sat enthroned at Montjouvain), Legrandin colouring his utterances for the benefit of fools, choosing delicate epithets which he knew perfectly well would not be understood by a rich or smart but illiterate public. \u201cCome now, Oriane, what on earth are you saying?\u201d broke in M. de Guermantes. \u201cMarie a fool? Why, she has read everything, she\u2019s as musical as a fiddle.\u201d \u201cBut, my poor little Basin, you\u2019re as innocent as a new-born babe. As if one could not be all that, and rather an idiot as well. Idiot is too strong a word; no, she\u2019s in the clouds, she\u2019s Hesse-Darmstadt, Holy Roman Empire, and! wa-wa-wa. Her pronunciation alone makes me tired. But I quite admit that she\u2019s a charming loony. Simply the idea of stepping down from her German throne to go and marry, in the most middle-class way, a private citizen. It is true that she chose him! Yes, it\u2019s quite true,\u201d she went on, turning to me, \u201cyou don\u2019t know Gilbert. Let me give you an idea of him, he took to his bed once because I had left a card on Mme. Carnot. But, my little Charles,\u201d said the Duchess, changing the conversation when she saw that the story of the card left on the Carnots appeared to irritate M. de Guermantes, \u201cyou know, you\u2019ve never sent me that photograph of our Knights of Rhodes, whom I\u2019ve learned to love through you, and I am so anxious to make their acquaintance.\u201d The Duke meanwhile had not taken his eyes from his wife\u2019s face. \u201cOriane, you might at least tell the story properly and not cut out half. I ought to explain,\u201d he corrected, addressing Swann, \u201cthat the British Ambassadress at that time, who was a very worthy woman, but lived rather in the moon and was in the habit of making up these odd combinations, conceived the distinctly quaint idea of inviting us with the President and his wife. We were \u2014 Oriane herself was rather surprised, especially as the Ambassadress knew quite enough of the people we knew not to invite us, of all things, to so ill-assorted a gathering. There was a Minister there who is a swindler, however I pass over all that, we had not been warned in time, were caught in the trap, and, I\u2019m bound to admit, all these people behaved most civilly to us. Only, once was enough. Mme. de Guermantes, who does not often do me the honour of consulting me, felt it incumbent upon her to leave a card in the course of the following week at the Elys\u00e9e. Gilbert may perhaps have gone rather far in regarding it as a stain upon our name. But it must not be forgotten that, politics apart, M. Carnot, who for that matter filled his post quite adequately, was the grandson of a member of the Revolutionary Tribunal which caused the death of eleven of our people in a single day.\u201d \u201cIn that case, Basin, why did you go every week to dine at Chantilly? The Due d\u2019Aumale was just as much the grandson of a member of the Revolutionary Tribunal, with this difference, that Carnot was a brave man and Philippe Egalit\u00e9 a wretched scoundrel.\u201d \u201cExcuse my interrupting you to explain that I did send the photograph,\u201d said Swann. \u201cI can\u2019t understand how it hasn\u2019t reached you.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t altogether surprise me,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cmy servants tell me only what they think fit. They probably do not approve of the Order of Saint John.\u201d And she rang the bell. \u201cYou, know, Oriane, that when I used to go to Chantilly it was without enthusiasm.\u201d \u201cWithout enthusiasm, but with a nightshirt in a bag, in case the Prince asked you to stay, which for that matter he very rarely did, being a perfect cad like all the Orl\u00e9ans lot. Do you know who else are to be dining at Mme. de Saint-Euverte\u2019s?\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked her husband. \u201cBesides the people you know already, she\u2019s asked at the last moment King Theodosius\u2019s brother.\u201d At these tidings the Duchess\u2019s features breathed contentment and her speech boredom. \u201cOh, good heavens, more princes!\u201d \u201cBut that one is well-mannered and intelligent,\u201d Swann suggested. \u201cNot altogether, though,\u201d replied the Duchess, apparently seeking for words that would give more novelty to the thought expressed. \u201cHave you ever noticed with princes that the best-mannered among them are not really well-mannered? They must always have an opinion about everything. Then, as they have none of their own, they spend the first half of their lives asking us ours and the other half serving it up to us secondhand. They positively must be able to say that one piece has been well played and the next not so well. When there is no difference. Listen, this little Theodosius junior (I forget his name) asked me what one called an orchestral motif. I replied,\u201d said the Duchess, her eyes sparkling while a laugh broke from her beautiful red lips: \u201c\u2018One calls it an orchestral motif.\u2019 I don\u2019t think he was any too well pleased, really. Oh, my dear Charles,\u201d she went on, \u201cwhat a bore it can be, dining out. There are evenings when one would sooner die! It is true that dying may be perhaps just as great a bore, because we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u201d A servant appeared. It was the young lover who used to have trouble with the porter, until the Duchess, in her kindness of heart, brought about an apparent peace between them. \u201cAm I to go up this evening to inquire for M. le Marquis d\u2019Osmond?\u201d he asked. \u201cMost certainly not, nothing before to-morrow morning. In fact I don\u2019t want you to remain in the house to-night. The only thing that will happen will be that his footman, who knows you, will come to you with the latest report and send you out after us. Get off, go anywhere you like, have a woman, sleep out, but I don\u2019t want to see you here before to-morrow morning.\u201d An immense joy overflowed from the footman\u2019s face. He would at last be able to spend long hours with his ladylove, whom he had practically ceased to see ever since, after a final scene with the porter, the Duchess had considerately explained to him that it would be better, to avoid further conflicts, if he did not go out at all. He floated, at the thought of having an evening free at last, in a happiness which the Duchess saw and guessed its reason. She felt, so to speak, a tightening of the heart and an itching in all her limbs at the sight of this happiness which an amorous couple were snatching behind her back, concealing themselves from her, which left her irritated and jealous. \u201cNo, Basin, let him stay here; I say, he\u2019s not to stir out of the house.\u201d \u201cBut, Oriane, that\u2019s absurd, the house is crammed with servants, and you have the costumier\u2019s people coming as well at twelve to dress us for this show. There\u2019s absolutely nothing for him to do, and he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s a friend of Mama\u2019s footman; I would a thousand times rather get him right away from the house.\u201d \u201cListen, Basin, let me do what I want, I shall have a message for him to take in the evening, as it happens, I can\u2019t tell yet at what time. In any case you\u2019re not to go out of the house for a single instant, do you hear?\u201d she said to the despairing footman. If there were continual quarrels, and if servants did not stay long with the Duchess, the person to whose charge this guerrilla warfare was to be laid was indeed irremovable, but it was not the porter; no doubt for the rougher tasks, for the martyrdoms that it was more tiring to inflict, for the quarrels which ended in blows, the Duchess entrusted the heavier instruments to him; but even then he played his part without the least suspicion that he had been cast for it. Like the household servants, he admired the Duchess for her kindness of heart; and footmen of little discernment who came back, after leaving her service, to visit Fran\u00e7oise used to say that the Duke\u2019s house would have been the finest \u2018place\u2019 in Paris if it had not been for the porter\u2019s lodge. The Duchess \u2018played\u2019 the lodge on them, just as at different times clericalism, freemasonry, the Jewish peril have been played on the public. Another footman came into the room. \u201cWhy have not they brought up the package that M. Swann sent here? And, by the way (you\u2019ve heard, Charles, that Mama is seriously ill?), Jules went up to inquire for news of M. le Marquis d\u2019Osmond: has he come back yet?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s just come this instant, M. le Duc. They\u2019re waiting from one moment to the next for M. le Marquis to pass away.\u201d \u201cAh! He\u2019s alive!\u201d exclaimed the Duke with a sigh of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, that\u2019s all right: sold again, Satan! While there\u2019s life there\u2019s hope,\u201d the Duke announced to us with a joyful air. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about him as though he were dead and buried. In a week from now he\u2019ll be fitter than I am.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the Doctors who said that he wouldn\u2019t last out the evening. One of them wanted to call again during the night. The head one said it was no use. M. le Marquis would be dead by then; they\u2019ve only kept him alive by injecting him with camphorated oil.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, you damned fool,\u201d cried the Duke in a paroxysm of rage. \u201cWho the devil asked you to say all that? You haven\u2019t understood a word of what they told you.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me they told, it was Jules.\u201d \u201cWill you hold your tongue!\u201d roared the Duke, and, turning to Swann, \u201cWhat a blessing he\u2019s still alive! He will regain his strength gradually, don\u2019t you know. Still alive, after being in such a critical state, that in itself is an excellent sign. One mustn\u2019t expect everything at once. It can\u2019t be at all unpleasant, a little injection of camphorated oil.\u201d He rubbed his hands. \u201cHe\u2019s alive; what more could anyone want? After going through all that he\u2019s gone through, it\u2019s a great step forward. Upon my word, I envy him having such a temperament. Ah! these invalids, you know, people do all sorts of little things for them that they don\u2019t do for us. Now to-day there was a devil of a cook who sent me up a leg of mutton with b\u00e9arnaise sauce \u2014 it was done to a turn, I must admit, but just for that very reason I took so much of it that it\u2019s still lying on my stomach. However, that doesn\u2019t make people come to inquire for me as they do for dear Amanien. We do too much inquiring. It only tires him. We must let him have room to breathe. They\u2019re killing the poor fellow by sending round to him all the time.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said the Duchess to the footman as he was leaving the room, \u201cI gave orders for the envelope containing a photograph which M. Swann sent me to be brought up here.\u201d \u201cMadame la Duchesse, it is so large that I didn\u2019t know if I could get it through the door. We have left it in the hall. Does Madame la Duchesse wish me to bring it up?\u201d \u201cOh, in that case, no; they ought to have told me, but if it\u2019s so big I shall see it in a moment when I come downstairs.\u201d \u201cI forgot to tell Mme. la Duchesse that Mme. la Comtesse Mole left a card this morning for Mme. la Duchesse.\u201d \u201cWhat, this morning?\u201d said the Duchess with an air of disapproval, feeling that so young a woman ought not to take the liberty of leaving cards in the morning. \u201cAbout ten o\u2019clock, Madame la Duchesse.\u201d \u201cShew me the cards.\u201d \u201cIn any case, Oriane, when you say that it was a funny idea on Marie\u2019s part to marry Gilbert,\u201d went on the Duke, reverting to the original topic of conversation, \u201cit is you who have an odd way of writing history. If either of them was a fool, it was Gilbert, for having married of all people a woman so closely related to the King of the Belgians, who has usurped the name of Brabant which belongs to us. To put it briefly, we are of the same blood as the Hesses, and of the elder branch. It is always stupid to talk about oneself,\u201d he apologised to me, \u201cbut after all, whenever we have been not only at Darmstadt, but even at Cassel and all over Electoral Hesse, the Landgraves have always, all of them, been most courteous in giving us precedence as being of the elder branch.\u201d \u201cBut really, Basin, you don\u2019t mean to tell me that a person who was a Major in every regiment in her country, who had been engaged to the King of Sweden . . . \u201d \u201cOriane, that is too much; anyone would think that you didn\u2019t know that the King of Sweden\u2019s grandfather was tilling the soil at Pau when we had been ruling the roost for nine hundred years throughout the whole of Europe.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t alter the fact that if somebody were to say in the street: \u2018Hallo, there\u2019s the King of Sweden,\u2019 everyone would at once rush to see him as far as the Place de la Concorde, and if he said: \u2018There\u2019s M. de Guermantes,\u2019 nobody would know who M. de Guermantes was.\u201d \u201cWhat an argument!\u201d \u201cBesides, I never can understand how, once the title of Duke of Brabant has passed to the Belgian Royal Family, you can continue to claim it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The footman returned with the Comtesse Mole\u2019s card, or rather what she had left in place of a card. Alleging that she had none on her, she had taken from her pocket a letter addressed to herself, and keeping the contents had handed in the envelope which bore the inscription: \u2018La Comtesse Mole.\u2019 As the envelope was rather large, following the fashion in notepaper which prevailed that year, this manuscript \u2018card\u2019 was almost twice the size of an ordinary visiting card. \u201cThat is what people call Mme. Mole\u2019s \u2018simplicity,\u2019\u201d said the Duchess ironically. \u201cShe wants to make us think that she had no cards on her, and to shew her originality. But we know all about that, don\u2019t we, my little Charles, we are quite old enough and quite original enough ourselves to see through the tricks of a little lady who has only been going about for four years. She is charming, but she doesn\u2019t seem to me, all the same, to be quite \u2018big\u2019 enough to imagine that she can take the world by surprise with so little effort as merely leaving an envelope instead of a card and leaving it at ten o\u2019clock in the morning. Her old mother mouse will shew her that she knows a thing or two about that.\u201d Swann could not help smiling at the thought that the Duchess, who was, incidentally, a trifle jealous of Mme. Mole\u2019s success, would find it quite in accordance with the \u2018Guermantes wit\u2019 to make some impertinent retort to her visitor. \u201cSo far as the title of Duc de Brabant is concerned, I\u2019ve told you a hundred times, Oriane . . . \u201d the Duke continued, but the Duchess, without listening, cut him short. \u201cBut, my little Charles, I\u2019m longing to see your photograph.\u201d \u201cAh! Extinctor draconis latrator Anubis,\u201d said Swann. \u201cYes, it was so charming what you said about that when you were comparing the Saint George at Venice. But I don\u2019t understand: why Anubis?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the one like who was an ancestor of Babal?\u201d asked M. de Guermantes. \u201cYou want to see his bauble?\u201d retorted his wife, dryly, to shew she herself scorned the pun. \u201cI want to see them all,\u201d she added. \u201cListen, Charles, let us wait downstairs till the carriage comes,\u201d said the Duke; \u201cyou can pay your call on us in the hall, because my wife won\u2019t let us have any peace until she\u2019s seen your photograph. I am less impatient, I must say,\u201d he added with a satisfied air. \u201cI am not easily moved myself, but she would see us all dead rather than miss it.\u201d \u201cI am entirely of your opinion, Basin,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201clet us go into the hall; we shall at least know why we have come down from your study, while we shall never know how we have come down from the Counts of Brabant.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve told you a hundred times how the title came into the House of Hesse,\u201d said the Duke (while we were going downstairs to look at the photograph, and I thought of those that Swann used to bring me at Combray), \u201cthrough the marriage of a Brabant in 1241 with the daughter of the last Landgrave of Thuringia and Hesse, so that really it is the title of Prince of Hesse that came to the House of Brabant rather than that of Duke of Brabant to the House of Hesse. You will remember that our battle-cry was that of the Dukes of Brabant: \u2018Limbourg to her conqueror!\u2019 until we exchanged the arms of Brabant for those of Guermantes, in which I think myself that we were wrong, and the example of the Gramonts will not make me change my opinion.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cas it is the King of the Belgians who is the conqueror . . . Besides the Belgian Crown Prince calls himself Duc de Brabant.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear child, your argument will not hold water for a moment. You know as well as I do that there are titles of pretension which can perfectly well exist even if the territory is occupied by usurpers. For instance, the King of Spain describes himself equally as Duke of Brabant, claiming in virtue of a possession less ancient than ours, but more ancient than that of the King of the Belgians. He calls himself also Duke of Burgundy, King of the Indies Occidental and Oriental, and Duke of Milan. Well, he is no more in possession of Burgundy, the Indies or Brabant than I possess Brabant myself, or the Prince of Hesse either, for that matter. The King of Spain likewise proclaims himself King of Jerusalem, as does the Austrian Emperor, and Jerusalem belongs to neither one nor the other.\u201d He stopped for a moment with an awkward feeling that the mention of Jerusalem might have embarrassed Swann, in view of \u2018current events,\u2019 but only went on more rapidly: \u201cWhat you said just now might be said of anyone. We were at one time Dukes of Aumale, a duchy that has passed as regularly to the House of France as Joinville and Chevreuse have to the House of Albert. We make no more claim to those titles than to that of Marquis de Noirmoutiers, which was at one time ours, and became perfectly regularly the appanage of the House of La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, but because certain cessions are valid, it does not follow that they all are. For instance,\u201d he went on, turning to me, \u201cmy sister-in-law\u2019s son bears the title of Prince d\u2019Agrigente, which comes to us from Joan the Mad, as that of Prince de Tarente comes to the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles. Well, Napoleon went and gave this title of Tarente to a soldier, who may have been admirable in the ranks, but in doing so the Emperor was disposing of what belonged to him even less than Napoleon III when he created a Duc de Montmorency, since P\u00e9rigord had at least a mother who was a Montmorency, while the Tarente of Napoleon I had no more Tarente about him than Napoleon\u2019s wish that he should become so. That did not prevent Chaix d\u2019Est-Ange, alluding to our uncle Cond\u00e9, from asking the Procurer Imp\u00e9rial if he had picked up the title of Duc de Montmorency in the moat of Vincennes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, Basin, I ask for nothing better than to follow you to the ditches of Vincennes, or even to Tarante. And that reminds me, Charles, of what I was going to say to you when you were telling me about your Saint George at Venice. We have an idea, Basin and I, of spending next spring in Italy and Sicily. If you were to come with us, just think what a difference it would make! I\u2019m not thinking only of the pleasure of seeing you, but imagine, after all you\u2019ve told me so often about the remains of the Norman Conquest and of ancient history, imagine what a trip like that would become if you came with us! I mean to say that even Basin \u2014 what am I saying, Gilbert \u2014 would benefit by it, because I feel that even his claims to the throne of Naples and all that sort of thing would interest me if they were explained by you in old romanesque churches in little villages perched on hills like primitive paintings. But now we\u2019re going to look at your photograph. Open the envelope,\u201d said the Duchess to a footman. \u201cPlease, Oriane, not this evening; you can look at it to-morrow,\u201d implored the Duke, who had already been making signs of alarm to me on seeing the huge size of the photograph. \u201cBut I like to look at it with Charles,\u201d said the Duchess, with a smile at once artificially concupiscent and psychologically subtle, for in her desire to be friendly to Swann she spoke of the pleasure which she would have in looking at the photograph as though it were the pleasure an invalid feels he would find in eating an orange, or as though she had managed to combine an escapade with her friends with giving information to a biographer as to some of her favourite pursuits. \u201cAll right, he will come again to see you, on purpose,\u201d declared the Duke, to whom his wife was obliged to yield. \u201cYou can spend three hours in front of it, if that amuses you,\u201d he added ironically. \u201cBut where are you going to stick a toy of those dimensions?\u201d \u201cWhy, in my room, of course. I like to have it before my eyes.\u201d \u201cOh, just as you please; if it\u2019s in your room, probably I shall never see it,\u201d said the Duke, without thinking of the revelation he was thus blindly making of the negative character of his conjugal relations. \u201cVery well, you will undo it with the greatest care,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes told the servant, multiplying her instructions out of politeness to Swann. \u201cAnd see that you don\u2019t crumple the envelope, either.\u201d \u201cSo even the envelope has got to be respected!\u201d the Duke murmured to me, raising his eyes to the ceiling. \u201cBut, Swann,\u201d he added, \u201cI, who am only a poor married man and thoroughly prosaic, what I wonder at is how on earth you managed to find an envelope that size. Where did you pick it up?\u201d \u201cOh, at the photographer\u2019s; they\u2019re always sending out things like that. But the man is a fool, for I see he\u2019s written on it \u2018The Duchesse de Guermantes,\u2019 without putting \u2018Madame.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll forgive him for that,\u201d said the Duchess carelessly; then, seeming to be struck by a sudden idea which enlivened her, checked a faint smile; but at once returning to Swann: \u201cWell, you don\u2019t say whether you\u2019re coming to Italy with us?\u201d \u201cMadame, I am really afraid that it will not be possible.\u201d \u201cIndeed! Mme. de Montmorency is more fortunate. You went with her to Venice and Vicenza. She told me that with you one saw things one would never see otherwise, things no one had ever thought of mentioning before, that you shewed her things she had never dreamed of, and that even in the well-known things she had been able to appreciate details which without you she might have passed by a dozen times without ever noticing. Obviously, she has been more highly favoured than we are to be. . . . You will take the big envelope from M. Swann\u2019s photograph,\u201d she said to the servant, \u201cand you will hand it in, from me, this evening at half past ten at Mme. la Comtesse Mole\u2019s.\u201d Swann laughed. \u201cI should like to know, all the same,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked him, \u201chow, ten months before the time, you can tell that a thing will be impossible.\u201d \u201cMy dear Duchess, I will tell you if you insist upon it, but, first of all, you can see that I am very ill.\u201d \u201cYes, my little Charles, I don\u2019t think you look at all well. I\u2019m not pleased with your colour, but I\u2019m not asking you to come with me next week, I ask you to come in ten months. In ten months one has time to get oneself cured, you know.\u201d At this point a footman came in to say that the carriage was at the door. \u201cCome, Oriane, to horse,\u201d said the Duke, already pawing the ground with impatience as though he were himself one of the horses that stood waiting outside. \u201cVery well, give me in one word the reason why you can\u2019t come to Italy,\u201d the Duchess put it to Swann as she rose to say good-bye to us. \u201cBut, my dear friend, it\u2019s because I shall then have been dead for several months. According to the doctors I consulted last winter, the thing I\u2019ve got \u2014 which may, for that matter, carry me off at any moment \u2014 won\u2019t in any case leave me more than three or four months to live, and even that is a generous estimate,\u201d replied Swann with a smile, while the footman opened the glazed door of the hall to let the Duchess out. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you say?\u201d cried the Duchess, stopping for a moment on her way to the carriage, and raising her fine eyes, their melancholy blue clouded by uncertainty. Placed for the first time in her life between two duties as incompatible as getting into her carriage to go out to dinner and shewing pity for a man who was about to die, she could find nothing in the code of conventions that indicated the right line to follow, and, not knowing which to choose, felt it better to make a show of not believing that the latter alternative need be seriously considered, so as to follow the first, which demanded of her at the moment less effort, and thought that the best way of settling the conflict would be to deny that any existed. \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d she said to Swann. \u201cIt would be a joke in charming taste,\u201d replied he ironically. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am telling you this; I have never said a word to you before about my illness. But as you asked me, and as now I may die at any moment . . . But whatever I do I mustn\u2019t make you late; you\u2019re dining out, remember,\u201d he added, because he knew that for other people their own social obligations took precedence of the death of a friend, and could put himself in her place by dint of his instinctive politeness. But that of the Duchess enabled her also to perceive in a vague way that the dinner to which she was going must count for less to Swann than his own death. And so, while continuing on her way towards the carriage, she let her shoulders droop, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about our dinner. It\u2019s not of any importance!\u201d But this put the Duke in a bad humour, who exclaimed: \u201cCome, Oriane, don\u2019t stop there chattering like that and exchanging your jeremiads with Swann; you know very well that Mme. de Saint-Euverte insists on sitting down to table at eight o\u2019clock sharp. We must know what you propose to do; the horses have been waiting for a good five minutes. I beg your pardon, Charles,\u201d he went on, turning to Swann, \u201cbut it\u2019s ten minutes to eight already. Oriane is always late, and it will take us more than five minutes to get to old Saint-Euverte\u2019s.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes advanced resolutely towards the carriage and uttered a last farewell to Swann. \u201cYou know, we can talk about that another time; I don\u2019t believe a word you\u2019ve been saying, but we must discuss it quietly. I expect they gave you a dreadful fright, come to luncheon, whatever day you like\u201d (with Mme. de Guermantes things always resolved themselves into luncheons), \u201cyou will let me know your day and time,\u201d and, lifting her red skirt, she set her foot on the step. She was just getting into the carriage when, seeing this foot exposed, the Duke cried in a terrifying voice: \u201cOriane, what have you been thinking of, you wretch? You\u2019ve kept on your black shoes! With a red dress! Go upstairs quick and put on red shoes, or rather,\u201d he said to the footman, \u201ctell the lady\u2019s maid at once to bring down a pair of red shoes.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear,\u201d replied the Duchess gently, annoyed to see that Swann, who was leaving the house with me but had stood back to allow the carriage to pass out in front of us, could hear, \u201csince we are late.\u201d \u201cNo, no, we have plenty of time. It is only ten to; it won\u2019t take us ten minutes to get to the Parc Monceau. And, after all, what would it matter? If we turned up at half past eight they\u2019d have to wait for us, but you can\u2019t possibly go there in a red dress and black shoes. Besides, we shan\u2019t be the last, I can tell you; the Sassenages are coming, and you know they never arrive before twenty to nine.\u201d The Duchess went up to her room. \u201cWell,\u201d said M. de Guermantes to Swann and myself, \u201cwe poor, down-trodden husbands, people laugh at us, but we are of some use all the same. But for me, Oriane would have been going out to dinner in black shoes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not unbecoming,\u201d said Swann, \u201cI noticed the black shoes and they didn\u2019t offend me in the least.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t say you\u2019re wrong,\u201d replied the Duke, \u201cbut it looks better to have them to match the dress. Besides, you needn\u2019t worry, she would no sooner have got there than she\u2019d have noticed them, and I should have been obliged to come home and fetch the others. I should have had my dinner at nine o\u2019clock. Good-bye, my children,\u201d he said, thrusting us gently from the door, \u201cget away, before Oriane comes down again. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t like seeing you both. On the contrary, she\u2019s too fond of your company. If she finds you still here she will start talking again, she is tired out already, she\u2019ll reach the dinner-table quite dead. Besides, I tell you frankly, I\u2019m dying of hunger. I had a wretched luncheon this morning when I came from the train. There was the devil of a b\u00e9arnaise sauce, I admit, but in spite of that I shan\u2019t be at all sorry, not at all sorry to sit down to dinner. Five minutes to eight! Oh, women, women! She\u2019ll give us both indigestion before to-morrow. She is not nearly as strong as people think.\u201d The Duke felt no compunction at speaking thus of his wife\u2019s ailments and his own to a dying man, for the former interested him more, appeared to him more important.

for we must deem the mode\nIn which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose\nThrough the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,\nA thing to counterbalance human woes:\nFor ever since immortal man hath glow'd\nWith all kinds of mechanics, and full soon\nSteam-engines will conduct him to the moon.\nAnd wherefore this exordium?\u2014Why, just now,\nIn taking up this paltry sheet of paper,\nMy bosom underwent a glorious glow,\nAnd my internal spirit cut a caper:\nAnd though so much inferior, as I know,\nTo those who, by the dint of glass and vapour,\nDiscover stars and sail in the wind's eye,\nI wish to do as much by poesy.\n\nIn the wind's eye I have sail'd, and sail; but for\nThe stars, I own my telescope is dim:\nBut at least I have shunn'd the common shore,\nAnd leaving land far out of sight, would skim\nThe ocean of eternity: the roar\nOf breakers has not daunted my slight, trim,\nBut still sea-worthy skiff; and she may float\nWhere ships have founder'd, as doth many a boat.\n\nWe left our hero, Juan, in the bloom\nOf favouritism, but not yet in the blush;\nAnd far be it from my Muses to presume\n(For I have more than one Muse at a push)\nTo follow him beyond the drawing-room:\nIt is enough that Fortune found him flush\nOf youth, and vigour, beauty, and those things\nWhich for an instant clip enjoyment's wings.\nBut soon they grow again and leave their nest.\n'Oh!' saith the Psalmist, 'that I had a dove's\nPinions to flee away, and be at rest!'\nAnd who that recollects young years and loves,\u2014\nThough hoary now, and with a withering breast,\nAnd palsied fancy, which no longer roves\nBeyond its dimm'd eye's sphere,\u2014but would much rather\nSigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?\n\nBut sighs subside, and tears (even widows') shrink,\nLike Arno in the summer, to a shallow,\nSo narrow as to shame their wintry brink,\nWhich threatens inundations deep and yellow!\nSuch difference doth a few months make. You 'd think\nGrief a rich field which never would lie fallow;\nNo more it doth, its ploughs but change their boys,\nWho furrow some new soil to sow for joys.\n\nBut coughs will come when sighs depart\u2014and now\nAnd then before sighs cease; for oft the one\nWill bring the other, ere the lake-like brow\nIs ruffled by a wrinkle, or the sun\nOf life reach'd ten o'clock: and while a glow,\nHectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,\nO'erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,\nThousands blaze, love, hope, die,\u2014how happy they!\nBut Juan was not meant to die so soon.\nWe left him in the focus of such glory\nAs may be won by favour of the moon\nOr ladies' fancies\u2014rather transitory\nPerhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,\nBecause December, with his breath so hoary,\nMust come? Much rather should he court the ray,\nTo hoard up warmth against a wintry day.\n\nBesides, he had some qualities which fix\nMiddle-aged ladies even more than young:\nThe former know what 's what; while new-fledged chicks\nKnow little more of love than what is sung\nIn rhymes, or dreamt (for fancy will play tricks)\nIn visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.\nSome reckon women by their suns or years,\nI rather think the moon should date the dears.\n\nAnd why? because she 's changeable and chaste.\nI know no other reason, whatsoe'er\nSuspicious people, who find fault in haste,\nMay choose to tax me with; which is not fair,\nNor flattering to 'their temper or their taste,'\nAs my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:\nHowever, I forgive him, and I trust\nHe will forgive himself;\u2014if not, I must.\n\nOld enemies who have become new friends\nShould so continue\u2014't is a point of honour;\nAnd I know nothing which could make amends\nFor a return to hatred: I would shun her\nLike garlic, howsoever she extends\nHer hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.\nOld flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes\u2014\nConverted foes should scorn to join with those.\n\nThis were the worst desertion:\u2014renegadoes,\nEven shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,\nWould scarcely join again the 'reformadoes,'\nWhom he forsook to fill the laureate's sty:\nAnd honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,\nWhether in Caledon or Italy,\nShould not veer round with every breath, nor seize\nTo pain, the moment when you cease to please.\n\nThe lawyer and the critic but behold\nThe baser sides of literature and life,\nAnd nought remains unseen, but much untold,\nBy those who scour those double vales of strife.\nWhile common men grow ignorantly old,\nThe lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,\nDissecting the whole inside of a question,\nAnd with it all the process of digestion.\n\nA legal broom 's a moral chimney-sweeper,\nAnd that 's the reason he himself 's so dirty;\nThe endless soot bestows a tint far deeper\nThan can be hid by altering his shirt; he\nRetains the sable stains of the dark creeper,\nAt least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,\nIn all their habits;\u2014not so you, I own;\nAs Caesar wore his robe you wear your gown.\n\nAnd all our little feuds, at least all mine,\nDear Jefferson, once my most redoubted foe\n(As far as rhyme and criticism combine\nTo make such puppets of us things below),\nAre over: Here 's a health to 'Auld Lang Syne!'\nI do not know you, and may never know\nYour face\u2014but you have acted on the whole\nMost nobly, and I own it from my soul.\n\nAnd when I use the phrase of 'Auld Lang Syne!'\n'T is not address'd to you\u2014the more 's the pity\nFor me, for I would rather take my wine\nWith you, than aught (save Scott) in your proud city.\nBut somehow,\u2014it may seem a schoolboy's whine,\nAnd yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,\nBut I am half a Scot by birth, and bred\nA whole one, and my heart flies to my head,\u2014\n\nAs 'Auld Lang Syne' brings Scotland, one and all,\nScotch plaids, Scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams,\nThe Dee, the Don, Balgounie's brig's black wall,\nAll my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams\nOf what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall,\nLike Banquo's offspring;\u2014floating past me seems\nMy childhood in this childishness of mine:\nI care not\u2014't is a glimpse of 'Auld Lang Syne.'\n\nAnd though, as you remember, in a fit\nOf wrath and rhyme, when juvenile and curly,\nI rail'd at Scots to show my wrath and wit,\nWhich must be own'd was sensitive and surly,\nYet 't is in vain such sallies to permit,\nThey cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:\nI 'scotch'd not kill'd' the Scotchman in my blood,\nAnd love the land of 'mountain and of flood.'\n\nDon Juan, who was real, or ideal,\u2014\nFor both are much the same, since what men think\nExists when the once thinkers are less real\nThan what they thought, for mind can never sink,\nAnd 'gainst the body makes a strong appeal;\nAnd yet 't is very puzzling on the brink\nOf what is call'd eternity, to stare,\nAnd know no more of what is here, than there;\u2014\n\nDon Juan grew a very polish'd Russian\u2014\nHow we won't mention, why we need not say:\nFew youthful minds can stand the strong concussion\nOf any slight temptation in their way;\nBut his just now were spread as is a cushion\nSmooth'd for a monarch's seat of honour; gay\nDamsels, and dances, revels, ready money,\nMade ice seem paradise, and winter sunny.\n\nThe favour of the empress was agreeable;\nAnd though the duty wax'd a little hard,\nYoung people at his time of life should be able\nTo come off handsomely in that regard.\nHe was now growing up like a green tree, able\nFor love, war, or ambition, which reward\nTheir luckier votaries, till old age's tedium\nMake some prefer the circulating medium.\n\nAbout this time, as might have been anticipated,\nSeduced by youth and dangerous examples,\nDon Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;\nWhich is a sad thing, and not only tramples\nOn our fresh feelings, but\u2014as being participated\nWith all kinds of incorrigible samples\nOf frail humanity\u2014must make us selfish,\nAnd shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.\n\nThis we pass over. We will also pass\nThe usual progress of intrigues between\nUnequal matches, such as are, alas!\nA young lieutenant's with a not old queen,\nBut one who is not so youthful as she was\nIn all the royalty of sweet seventeen.\nSovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,\n\nAnd Death, the sovereign's sovereign, though the great\nGracchus of all mortality, who levels\nWith his Agrarian laws the high estate\nOf him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,\nTo one small grass-grown patch (which must await\nCorruption for its crop) with the poor devils\nWho never had a foot of land till now,\u2014\nDeath 's a reformer, all men must allow.\n\nHe lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry\nOf waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,\nIn this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry\u2014\nWhich (though I hate to say a thing that 's bitter)\nPeep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,\nThrough all the 'purple and fine linen,' fitter\nFor Babylon's than Russia's royal harlot\u2014\nAnd neutralize her outward show of scarlet.\n\nAnd this same state we won't describe: we would\nPerhaps from hearsay, or from recollection;\nBut getting nigh grim Dante's 'obscure wood,'\nThat horrid equinox, that hateful section\nOf human years, that half-way house, that rude\nHut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection\nLife's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier\nOf age, and looking back to youth, give one tear;\u2014\n\nI won't describe,\u2014that is, if I can help\nDescription; and I won't reflect,\u2014that is,\nIf I can stave off thought, which\u2014as a whelp\nClings to its teat\u2014sticks to me through the abyss\nOf this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp\nHolds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss\nDrains its first draught of lips:\u2014but, as I said,\nI won't philosophise, and will be read.\n\nJuan, instead of courting courts, was courted,\u2014\nA thing which happens rarely: this he owed\nMuch to his youth, and much to his reported\nValour; much also to the blood he show'd,\nLike a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,\nWhich set the beauty off in which he glow'd,\nAs purple clouds befringe the sun; but most\nHe owed to an old woman and his post.\n\nHe wrote to Spain:\u2014and all his near relations,\nPerceiving fie was in a handsome way\nOf getting on himself, and finding stations\nFor cousins also, answer'd the same day.\nSeveral prepared themselves for emigrations;\nAnd eating ices, were o'erheard to say,\nThat with the addition of a slight pelisse,\nMadrid's and Moscow's climes were of a piece.\n\nHis mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,\nThat in the lieu of drawing on his banker,\nWhere his assets were waxing rather few,\nHe had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,\u2014\nReplied, 'that she was glad to see him through\nThose pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;\nAs the sole sign of man's being in his senses\nIs, learning to reduce his past expenses.\n\n'She also recommended him to God,\nAnd no less to God's Son, as well as Mother,\nWarn'd him against Greek worship, which looks odd\nIn Catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother\nOutward dislike, which don't look well abroad;\nInform'd him that he had a little brother\nBorn in a second wedlock; and above\nAll, praised the empress's maternal love.\n\n'She could not too much give her approbation\nUnto an empress, who preferr'd young men\nWhose age, and what was better still, whose nation\nAnd climate, stopp'd all scandal (now and then):\u2014\nAt home it might have given her some vexation;\nBut where thermometers sunk down to ten,\nOr five, or one, or zero, she could never\nBelieve that virtue thaw'd before the river.'\n\nO for a forty-parson power to chant\nThy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn\nLoud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,\nNot practise! Oh for trumps of cherubim!\nOr the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,\nWho, though her spectacles at last grew dim,\nDrew quiet consolation through its hint,\nWhen she no more could read the pious print.\n\nShe was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,\nBut went to heaven in as sincere a way\nAs any body on the elected roll,\nWhich portions out upon the judgment day\nHeaven's freeholds, in a sort of doomsday scroll,\nSuch as the conqueror William did repay\nHis knights with, lotting others' properties\nInto some sixty thousand new knights' fees.\n\nI can't complain, whose ancestors are there,\nErneis, Radulphus\u2014eight-and-forty manors\n(If that my memory doth not greatly err)\nWere their reward for following Billy's banners:\nAnd though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair\nTo strip the Saxons of their hydes, like tanners;\nYet as they founded churches with the produce,\nYou 'll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use.\n\nThe gentle Juan flourish'd, though at times\nHe felt like other plants called sensitive,\nWhich shrink from touch, as monarchs do from rhymes,\nSave such as Southey can afford to give.\nPerhaps he long'd in bitter frosts for climes\nIn which the Neva's ice would cease to live\nBefore May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,\nIn royalty's vast arms he sigh d for beauty:\n\nPerhaps\u2014but, sans perhaps, we need not seek\nFor causes young or old: the canker-worm\nWill feed upon the fairest, freshest cheek,\nAs well as further drain the wither'd form:\nCare, like a housekeeper, brings every week\nHis bills in, and however we may storm,\nThey must be paid: though six days smoothly run,\nThe seventh will bring blue devils or a dun.\n\nI don't know how it was, but he grew sick:\nThe empress was alarm'd, and her physician\n(The same who physick'd Peter) found the tick\nOf his fierce pulse betoken a condition\nWhich augur'd of the dead, however quick\nItself, and show'd a feverish disposition;\nAt which the whole court was extremely troubled,\nThe sovereign shock'd, and all his medicines doubled.\n\nLow were the whispers, manifold the rumours:\nSome said he had been poison'd by Potemkin;\nOthers talk'd learnedly of certain tumours,\nExhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;\nSome said 't was a concoction of the humours,\nWhich with the blood too readily will claim kin;\nOthers again were ready to maintain,\n''T was only the fatigue of last campaign.'\n\nBut here is one prescription out of many:\n'Sodae sulphat. 3vj. 3fs. Mannae optim.\nAq. fervent. f. 3ifs. 3ij. tinct. Sennae\nHaustus' (And here the surgeon came and cupp'd him)\n'Rx Pulv Com gr. iij. Ipecacuanhae'\n(With more beside if Juan had not stopp'd 'em).\n'Bolus Potassae Sulphuret. sumendus,\nEt haustus ter in die capiendus.'\n\nThis is the way physicians mend or end us,\nSecundum artem: but although we sneer\nIn health\u2014when ill, we call them to attend us,\nWithout the least propensity to jeer:\nWhile that 'hiatus maxime deflendus'\nTo be fill'd up by spade or mattock's near,\nInstead of gliding graciously down Lethe,\nWe tease mild Baillie, or soft Abernethy.\n\nJuan demurr'd at this first notice to\nQuit; and though death had threaten'd an ejection,\nHis youth and constitution bore him through,\nAnd sent the doctors in a new direction.\nBut still his state was delicate: the hue\nOf health but flicker'd with a faint reflection\nAlong his wasted cheek, and seem'd to gravel\nThe faculty\u2014who said that he must travel.\n\nThe climate was too cold, they said, for him,\nMeridian-born, to bloom in. This opinion\nMade the chaste Catherine look a little grim,\nWho did not like at first to lose her minion:\nBut when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,\nAnd drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,\nShe then resolved to send him on a mission,\nBut in a style becoming his condition.\n\nThere was just then a kind of a discussion,\nA sort of treaty or negotiation\nBetween the British cabinet and Russian,\nMaintain'd with all the due prevarication\nWith which great states such things are apt to push on;\nSomething about the Baltic's navigation,\nHides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,\nWhich Britons deem their 'uti possidetis.'\n\nSo Catherine, who had a handsome way\nOf fitting out her favourites, conferr'd\nThis secret charge on Juan, to display\nAt once her royal splendour, and reward\nHis services. He kiss'd hands the next day,\nReceived instructions how to play his card,\nWas laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,\nWhich show'd what great discernment was the donor's.\n\nBut she was lucky, and luck 's all. Your queens\nAre generally prosperous in reigning;\nWhich puzzles us to know what Fortune means.\nBut to continue: though her years were waning\nHer climacteric teased her like her teens;\nAnd though her dignity brook'd no complaining,\nSo much did Juan's setting off distress her,\nShe could not find at first a fit successor.\n\nBut time, the comforter, will come at last;\nAnd four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number\nOf candidates requesting to be placed,\nMade Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:\u2014\nNot that she meant to fix again in haste,\nNor did she find the quantity encumber,\nBut always choosing with deliberation,\nKept the place open for their emulation.\n\nWhile this high post of honour 's in abeyance,\nFor one or two days, reader, we request\nYou 'll mount with our young hero the conveyance\nWhich wafted him from Petersburgh: the best\nBarouche, which had the glory to display once\nThe fair czarina's autocratic crest,\nWhen, a new lphigene, she went to Tauris,\nWas given to her favourite, and now bore his.\n\nA bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,\nAll private favourites of Don Juan;\u2014for\n(Let deeper sages the true cause determine)\nHe had a kind of inclination, or\nWeakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,\nLive animals: an old maid of threescore\nFor cats and birds more penchant ne'er display'd,\nAlthough he was not old, nor even a maid;\u2014\n\nThe animals aforesaid occupied\nTheir station: there were valets, secretaries,\nIn other vehicles; but at his side\nSat little Leila, who survived the parries\nHe made 'gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide\nSlaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies\nHer note, she don't forget the infant girl\nWhom he preserved, a pure and living pearl\n\nPoor little thing! She was as fair as docile,\nAnd with that gentle, serious character,\nAs rare in living beings as a fossile\nMan, 'midst thy mouldy mammoths, 'grand Cuvier!'\nIll fitted was her ignorance to jostle\nWith this o'erwhelming world, where all must err:\nBut she was yet but ten years old, and therefore\nWas tranquil, though she knew not why or wherefore.\n\nDon Juan loved her, and she loved him, as\nNor brother, father, sister, daughter love.\nI cannot tell exactly what it was;\nHe was not yet quite old enough to prove\nParental feelings, and the other class,\nCall'd brotherly affection, could not move\nHis bosom,\u2014for he never had a sister:\nAh! if he had, how much he would have miss'd her!\n\nAnd still less was it sensual; for besides\nThat he was not an ancient debauchee\n(Who like sour fruit, to stir their veins' salt tides,\nAs acids rouse a dormant alkali),\nAlthough ('t will happen as our planet guides)\nHis youth was not the chastest that might be,\nThere was the purest Platonism at bottom\nOf all his feelings\u2014only he forgot 'em.\n\nJust now there was no peril of temptation;\nHe loved the infant orphan he had saved,\nAs patriots (now and then) may love a nation;\nHis pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved\nOwing to him;\u2014as also her salvation\nThrough his means and the church's might be paved.\nBut one thing 's odd, which here must be inserted,\nThe little Turk refused to be converted.\n\n'T was strange enough she should retain the impression\nThrough such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;\nBut though three bishops told her the transgression,\nShe show'd a great dislike to holy water:\nShe also had no passion for confession;\nPerhaps she had nothing to confess:\u2014no matter,\nWhate'er the cause, the church made little of it\u2014\nShe still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.\n\nIn fact, the only Christian she could bear\nWas Juan; whom she seem'd to have selected\nIn place of what her home and friends once were.\nHe naturally loved what he protected:\nAnd thus they form'd a rather curious pair,\nA guardian green in years, a ward connected\nIn neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;\nAnd yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.\n\nThey journey'd on through Poland and through Warsaw,\nFamous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:\nThrough Courland also, which that famous farce saw\nWhich gave her dukes the graceless name of 'Biron.'\n'T is the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,\nWho march'd to Moscow, led by Fame, the siren!\nTo lose by one month's frost some twenty years\nOf conquest, and his guard of grenadiers.\n\nLet this not seem an anti-climax:\u2014'Oh!\nMy guard! my old guard exclaim'd!' exclaim'd that god of day.\nThink of the Thunderer's falling down below\nCarotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh!\nAlas, that glory should be chill'd by snow!\nBut should we wish to warm us on our way\nThrough Poland, there is Kosciusko's name\nMight scatter fire through ice, like Hecla's flame.\n\nFrom Poland they came on through Prussia Proper,\nAnd Konigsberg the capital, whose vaunt,\nBesides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,\nHas lately been the great Professor Kant.\nJuan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper\nAbout philosophy, pursued his jaunt\nTo Germany, whose somewhat tardy millions\nHave princes who spur more than their postilions.\n\nAnd thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,\nUntil he reach'd the castellated Rhine:\u2014\nYe glorious Gothic scenes! how much ye strike\nAll phantasies, not even excepting mine;\nA grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,\nMake my soul pass the equinoctial line\nBetween the present and past worlds, and hover\nUpon their airy confine, half-seas-over.\n\nBut Juan posted on through Manheim, Bonn,\nWhich Drachenfels frowns over like a spectre\nOf the good feudal times forever gone,\nOn which I have not time just now to lecture.\nFrom thence he was drawn onwards to Cologne,\nA city which presents to the inspector\nEleven thousand maidenheads of bone,\nThe greatest number flesh hath ever known.\n\nFrom thence to Holland's Hague and Helvoetsluys,\nThat water-land of Dutchmen and of ditches,\nWhere juniper expresses its best juice,\nThe poor man's sparkling substitute for riches.\nSenates and sages have condemn'd its use\u2014\nBut to deny the mob a cordial, which is\nToo often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,\nGood government has left them, seems but cruel.\n\nHere he embark'd, and with a flowing sail\nWent bounding for the island of the free,\nTowards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;\nHigh dash'd the spray, the bows dipp'd in the sea,\nAnd sea-sick passengers turn'd somewhat pale;\nBut Juan, season'd, as he well might be,\nBy former voyages, stood to watch the skiffs\nWhich pass'd, or catch the first glimpse of the cliffs.\n\nAt length they rose, like a white wall along\nThe blue sea's border; and I Don Juan felt\u2014\nWhat even young strangers feel a little strong\nAt the first sight of Albion's chalky belt\u2014\nA kind of pride that he should be among\nThose haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt\nTheir goods and edicts out from pole to pole,\nAnd made the very billows pay them toll.\n\nI 've no great cause to love that spot of earth,\nWhich holds what might have been the noblest nation;\nBut though I owe it little but my birth,\nI feel a mix'd regret and veneration\nFor its decaying fame and former worth.\nSeven years (the usual term of transportation)\nOf absence lay one's old resentments level,\nWhen a man's country 's going to the devil.\n\nAlas! could she but fully, truly, know\nHow her great name is now throughout abhorr'd:\nHow eager all the earth is for the blow\nWhich shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;\nHow all the nations deem her their worst foe,\nThat worse than worst of foes, the once adored\nFalse friend, who held out freedom to mankind,\nAnd now would chain them, to the very mind:\u2014\n\nWould she be proud, or boast herself the free,\nWho is but first of slaves? The nations are\nIn prison,\u2014but the gaoler, what is he?\nNo less a victim to the bolt and bar.\nIs the poor privilege to turn the key\nUpon the captive, freedom? He 's as far\nFrom the enjoyment of the earth and air\nWho watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.\n\nDon Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,\nThy cliffs, dear Dover! harbour, and hotel;\nThy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;\nThy waiters running mucks at every bell;\nThy packets, all whose passengers are booties\nTo those who upon land or water dwell;\nAnd last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,\nThy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.\n\nJuan, though careless, young, and magnifique,\nAnd rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,\nWho did not limit much his bills per week,\nYet stared at this a little, though he paid it\n(His Maggior Duomo, a smart, subtle Greek,\nBefore him summ'd the awful scroll and read it);\nBut doubtless as the air, though seldom sunny,\nIs free, the respiration's worth the money.\n\nOn with the horses! Off to Canterbury!\nTramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;\nHurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!\nNot like slow Germany, wherein they muddle\nAlong the road, as if they went to bury\nTheir fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle\nWith 'schnapps'\u2014sad dogs! whom 'Hundsfot,' or 'Verflucter,'\nAffect no more than lightning a conductor.\n\nNow there is nothing gives a man such spirits,\nLeavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,\nAs going at full speed\u2014no matter where its\nDirection be, so 't is but in a hurry,\nAnd merely for the sake of its own merits;\nFor the less cause there is for all this flurry,\nThe greater is the pleasure in arriving\nAt the great end of travel\u2014which is driving.\n\nThey saw at Canterbury the cathedral;\nBlack Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,\nWere pointed out as usual by the bedral,\nIn the same quaint, uninterested tone:\u2014\nThere 's glory again for you, gentle reader! All\nEnds in a rusty casque and dubious bone,\nHalf-solved into these sodas or magnesias;\nWhich form that bitter draught, the human species.\n\nThe effect on Juan was of course sublime:\nHe breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw\nThat casque, which never stoop'd except to Time.\nEven the bold Churchman's tomb excited awe,\nWho died in the then great attempt to climb\nO'er kings, who now at least must talk of law\nBefore they butcher. Little Leila gazed,\nAnd ask'd why such a structure had been raised:\n\nAnd being told it was 'God's house,' she said\nHe was well lodged, but only wonder'd how\nHe suffer'd Infidels in his homestead,\nThe cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low\nHis holy temples in the lands which bred\nThe True Believers:\u2014and her infant brow\nWas bent with grief that Mahomet should resign\nA mosque so noble, flung like pearls to swine.\n\nO! oh! through meadows managed like a garden,\nA paradise of hops and high production;\nFor after years of travel by a bard in\nCountries of greater heat, but lesser suction,\nA green field is a sight which makes him pardon\nThe absence of that more sublime construction,\nWhich mixes up vines, olives, precipices,\nGlaciers, volcanos, oranges, and ices.\n\nAnd when I think upon a pot of beer\u2014\nBut I won't weep!\u2014and so drive on, postilions!\nAs the smart boys spurr'd fast in their career,\nJuan admired these highways of free millions;\nA country in all senses the most dear\nTo foreigner or native, save some silly ones,\nWho 'kick against the pricks' just at this juncture,\nAnd for their pains get only a fresh puncture.\n\nWhat a delightful thing 's a turnpike road!\nSo smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving\nThe earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad\nAir can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.\nHad such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god\nHad told his son to satisfy his craving\nWith the York mail;\u2014but onward as we roll,\n'Surgit amari aliquid'\u2014the toll\n\nAlas, how deeply painful is all payment!\nTake lives, take wives, take aught except men's purses:\nAs Machiavel shows those in purple raiment,\nSuch is the shortest way to general curses.\nThey hate a murderer much less than a claimant\nOn that sweet ore which every body nurses;\u2014\nKill a man's family, and he may brook it,\nBut keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket.\n\nSo said the Florentine: ye monarchs, hearken\nTo your instructor. Juan now was borne,\nJust as the day began to wane and darken,\nO'er the high hill, which looks with pride or scorn\nToward the great city.\u2014Ye who have a spark in\nYour veins of Cockney spirit, smile or mourn\nAccording as you take things well or ill;\u2014\nBold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!\n\nThe sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from\nA half-unquench'd volcano, o'er a space\nWhich well beseem'd the 'Devil's drawing-room,'\nAs some have qualified that wondrous place:\nBut Juan felt, though not approaching home,\nAs one who, though he were not of the race,\nRevered the soil, of those true sons the mother,\nWho butcher'd half the earth, and bullied t' other.\n\nA mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,\nDirty and dusky, but as wide as eye\nCould reach, with here and there a sail just skipping\nIn sight, then lost amidst the forestry\nOf masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping\nOn tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;\nA huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown\nOn a fool's head\u2014and there is London Town!\n\nBut Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke\nAppear'd to him but as the magic vapour\nOf some alchymic furnace, from whence broke\nThe wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):\nThe gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke\nAre bow'd, and put the sun out like a taper,\nWere nothing but the natural atmosphere,\nExtremely wholesome, though but rarely clear.\n\nHe paused\u2014and so will I; as doth a crew\nBefore they give their broadside. By and by,\nMy gentle countrymen, we will renew\nOur old acquaintance; and at least I 'll try\nTo tell you truths you will not take as true,\nBecause they are so;\u2014a male Mrs. Fry,\nWith a soft besom will I sweep your halls,\nAnd brush a web or two from off the walls.\n\nO Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why\nPreach to poor rogues? And wherefore not begin\nWith Carlton, or with other houses? Try\nYour head at harden'd and imperial sin.\nTo mend the people 's an absurdity,\nA jargon, a mere philanthropic din,\nUnless you make their betters better:\u2014Fy!\nI thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.\n\nTeach them the decencies of good threescore;\nCure them of tours, hussar and highland dresses;\nTell them that youth once gone returns no more,\nThat hired huzzas redeem no land's distresses;\nTell them Sir William Curtis is a bore,\nToo dull even for the dullest of excesses,\nThe witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,\nA fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.\n\nTell them, though it may be perhaps too late,\nOn life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,\nTo set up vain pretence of being great,\n'T is not so to be good; and be it stated,\nThe worthiest kings have ever loved least state;\nAnd tell them\u2014But you won't, and I have prated\nJust now enough; but by and by I 'll prattle\nLike Roland's horn in Roncesvalles' battle.Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

ecstasy of excitement, my burning cheek pressed against the impeccable linen of the pillow and the pounding of my heart mimicking that of the great pistons ceaselessly thrusting the train that bore me through the night, away from Paris, away from girlhood, away from the white, enclosed quietude of my mother's apartment, into the unguessable country of marriage.\n\nAnd I remember I tenderly imagined how, at this very moment, my mother would be moving slowly about the narrow bedroom I had left behind for ever, folding up and putting away all my little relics, the tumbled garments I would not need any more, the scores for which there had been no room in my trunks, the concert programmes I'd abandoned; she would linger over this torn ribbon and that faded photograph with all the half-joyous, half-sorrowful emotions of a woman on her daughter's wedding day. And, in the midst of my bridal triumph, I felt a pang of loss as if, when he put the gold band on my finger, I had, in some way, ceased to be her child in becoming his wife.\n\nAre you sure, she'd said when they delivered the gigantic box that held the wedding dress he'd bought me, wrapped up in tissue paper and red ribbon like a Christmas gift of crystallized fruit. Are you sure you love him? There was a dress for her, too; black silk, with the dull, prismatic sheen of oil on water, finer than anything she'd worn since that adventurous girlhood in Indo-China, daughter of a rich tea planter. My eagle-featured, indomitable mother; what other student at the Conservatoire could boast that her mother had outfaced a junkful of Chinese pirates, nursed a village through a visitation of the plague, shot a man-eating tiger with her own hand and all before she was as old as I?\n\n'Are you sure you love him?'\n\n'I'm sure I want to marry him,' I said.\n\nAnd would say no more. She sighed, as if it was with reluctance that she might at last banish the spectre of poverty from its habitual place at our meagre table. For my mother herself had gladly, scandalously, defiantly beggared herself for love; and, one fine day, her gallant soldier never returned from the wars, leaving his wife and child a legacy of tears that never quite dried, a cigar box full of medals and the antique service revolver that my mother, grown magnificently eccentric in hardship, kept always in her reticule, in case--how I teased her--she was surprised by footpads on her way home from the grocer's shop.\nNow and then a starburst of lights spattered the drawn blinds as if the railway company had lit up all the stations through which we passed in celebration of the bride. My satin nightdress had just been shaken from its wrappings; it had slipped over my young girl's pointed breasts and shoulders, supple as a garment of heavy water, and now teasingly caressed me, egregious, insinuating, nudging between my thighs as I shifted restlessly in my narrow berth. His kiss, his kiss with tongue and teeth in it and a rasp of beard, had hinted to me, though with the same exquisite tact as this nightdress he'd given me, of the wedding night, which would be voluptuously deferred until we lay in his great ancestral bed in the sea-girt, pinnacled domain that lay, still, beyond the grasp of my imagination ... that magic place, the fairy castle whose walls were made of foam, that legendary habitation in which he had been born. To which, one day, I might bear an heir. Our destination, my destiny.\n\nAbove the syncopated roar of the train, I could hear his even, steady breathing. Only the communicating door kept me from my husband and it stood open. If I rose up on my elbow, I could see the dark, leonine shape of his head and my nostrils caught a whiff of the opulent male scent of leather and spices that always accompanied him and sometimes, during his courtship, had been the only hint he gave me that he had come into my mother's sitting room, for, though he was a big man, he moved as softly as if all his shoes had soles of velvet, as if his footfall turned the carpet into snow.\n\nHe had loved to surprise me in my abstracted solitude at the piano. He would tell them not to announce him, then soundlessly open the door and softly creep up behind me with his bouquet of hot-house flowers or his box of marrons glac\u00e9s, lay his offering upon the keys and clasp his hands over my eyes as I was lost in a Debussy prelude. But that perfume of spiced leather always betrayed him; after my first shock, I was forced always to mimic surprise, so that he would not be disappointed.\n\nHe was older than I. He was much older than I; there were streaks of pure silver in his dark mane. But his strange, heavy, almost waxen face was not lined by experience. Rather, experience seemed to have washed it perfectly smooth, like a stone on a beach whose fissures have been eroded by successive tides. And sometimes that face, in stillness when he listened to me playing, with the heavy eyelids folded over eyes that always disturbed me by their absolute absence of light, seemed to me like a mask, as if his real face, the face that truly reflected all the life he had led in the world before he met me, before, even, I was born, as though that face lay underneath this mask. Or else, elsewhere. As though he had laid by the face in which he had lived for so long in order to offer my youth a face unsigned by the years.\n\nAnd, elsewhere, I might see him plain. Elsewhere. But, where?\n\nIn, perhaps, that castle to which the train now took us, that marvellous castle in which he had been born.\n\nEven when he asked me to marry him, and I said: 'Yes,' still he did not lose that heavy, fleshy composure of his. I know it must seem a curious analogy, a man with a flower, but sometimes he seemed to me like a lily. Yes. A lily. Possessed of that strange, ominous calm of a sentient vegetable, like one of those cobra-headed, funereal lilies whose white sheaths are curled out of a flesh as thick and tensely yielding to the touch as vellum. When I said that I would marry him, not one muscle in his face stirred, but he let out a long, extinguished sigh. I thought: Oh! how he must want me! And it was as though the imponderable weight of his desire was a force I might not withstand, not by virtue of its violence but because of its very gravity.\n\nHe had the ring ready in a leather box lined with crimson velvet, a fire opal the size of a pigeon's egg set in a complicated circle of dark antique gold. My old nurse, who still lived with my mother and me, squinted at the ring askance: opals are bad luck, she said. But this opal had been his own mother's ring, and his grandmother's, and her mother's before that, given to an ancestor by Catherine de Medici ... every bride that came to the castle wore it, time out of mind. And did he give it to his other wives and have it back from them? asked the old woman rudely; yet she was a snob. She hid her incredulous joy at my marital coup--her little Marquise--behind a fa\u00e7ade of fault-finding. But, here, she touched me. I shrugged and turned my back pettishly on her. I did not want to remember how he had loved other women before me, but the knowledge often teased me in the threadbare self-confidence of the small hours.\n\nI was seventeen and knew nothing of the world; my Marquis had been married before, more than once, and I remained a little bemused that, after those others, he should now have chosen me. Indeed, was he not still in mourning for his last wife? Tsk, tsk, went my old nurse.\n\nAnd even my mother had been reluctant to see her girl whisked off by a man so recently bereaved. A Romanian countess, a lady of high fashion. Dead just three short months before I met him, a boating accident, at his home, in Brittany. They never found her body but I rummaged through the back copies of the society magazines my old nanny kept in a trunk under her bed and tracked down her photograph. The sharp muzzle of a pretty, witty, naughty monkey; such potent and bizarre charm, of a dark, bright, wild yet worldly thing whose natural habitat must have been some luxurious interior decorator's jungle filled with potted palms and tame, squawking parakeets.\n\nBefore that? Her face is common property; everyone painted her but the Redon engraving I liked best, The Evening Star Walking on the Rim of Night. To see her skeletal, enigmatic grace, you would never think she had been a barmaid in a caf\u00e9 in Montmartre until Puvis de Chavannes saw her and had her expose her flat breasts and elongated thighs to his brush. And yet it was the absinthe doomed her, or so they said.\n\nThe first of all his ladies? That sumptuous diva; I had heard her sing Isolde, precociously musical child that I was, taken to the opera for a birthday treat. My first opera; I had heard her sing Isolde. With what white-hot passion had she burned from the stage! So that you could tell she would die young. We sat high up, halfway to heaven in the gods, yet she half-blinded me. And my father, still alive (oh, so long ago), took hold of my sticky little hand, to comfort me, in the last act, yet all I heard was the glory of her voice.\n\nMarried three times within my own brief lifetime to three different graces, now, as if to demonstrate the eclecticism of his taste, he had invited me to join this gallery of beautiful women, I, the poor widow's child with my mouse-coloured hair that still bore the kinks of the plaits from which it had so recently been freed, my bony hips, my nervous, pianist's fingers.\nHe was rich as Croesus. The night before our wedding--a simple affair, at the Mairie, because his countess was so recently gone--he took my mother and me, curious coincidence, to see Tristan. And, do you know, my heart swelled and ached so during the Liebestod that I thought I must truly love him. Yes. I did. On his arm, all eyes were upon me. The whispering crowd in the foyer parted like the Red Sea to let us through. My skin crisped at his touch.\n\nHow my circumstances had changed since the first time I heard those voluptuous chords that carry such a charge of deathly passion in them! Now, we sat in a loge, in red velvet armchairs, and a braided, bewigged flunkey brought us a silver bucket of iced champagne in the interval. The froth spilled over the rim of my glass and drenched my hands, I thought: My cup runneth over. And I had on a Poiret dress. He had prevailed upon my reluctant mother to let him buy my trousseau; what would I have gone to him in, otherwise? Twice-darned underwear, faded gingham, serge skirts, hand-me-downs. So, for the opera, I wore a sinuous shift of white muslin tied with a silk string under the breasts. And everyone stared at me. And at his wedding gift.\n\nHis wedding gift, clasped round my throat. A choker of rubies, two inches wide, like an extraordinarily precious slit throat.\n\nAfter the Terror, in the early days of the Directory, the aristos who'd escaped the guillotine had an ironic fad of tying a red ribbon round their necks at just the point where the blade would have sliced it through, a red ribbon like the memory of a wound. And his grandmother, taken with the notion, had her ribbon made up in rubies; such a gesture of luxurious defiance! That night at the opera comes back to me even now ... the white dress; the frail child within it; and the flashing crimson jewels round her throat, bright as arterial blood.\n\nI saw him watching me in the gilded mirrors with the assessing eye of a connoisseur inspecting horseflesh, or even of a housewife in the market, inspecting cuts on the slab. I'd never seen, or else had never acknowledged, that regard of his before, the sheer carnal avarice of it; and it was strangely magnified by the monocle lodged in his left eye. When I saw him look at me with lust, I dropped my eyes but, in glancing away from him, I caught sight of myself in the mirror. And I saw myself, suddenly, as he saw me, my pale face, the way the muscles in my neck stuck out like thin wire. I saw how much that cruel necklace became me. And, for the first time in my innocent and confined life, I sensed in myself a potentiality for corruption that took my breath away.\n\nThe next day, we were married.\n\nThe train slowed, shuddered to a halt. Lights; clank of metal; a voice declaring the name of an unknown, never-to-be visited station; silence of the night; the rhythm of his breathing, that I should sleep with, now, for the rest of my life. And I could not sleep. I stealthily sat up, raised the blind a little and huddled against the cold window that misted over with the warmth of my breathing, gazing out at the dark platform towards those rectangles of domestic lamplight that promised warmth, company, a supper of sausages hissing in a pan on the stove for the station master, his children tucked up in bed asleep in the brick house with the painted shutters ... all the paraphernalia of the everyday world from which I, with my stunning marriage, had exiled myself.\n\nInto marriage, into exile; I sensed it, I knew it--that, henceforth, I would always be lonely. Yet that was part of the already familiar weight of the fire opal that glimmered like a gypsy's magic ball, so that I could not take my eyes off it when I played the piano. This ring, the bloody bandage of rubies, the wardrobe of clothes from Poiret and Worth, his scent of Russian leather--all had conspired to seduce me so utterly that I could not say I felt one single twinge of regret for the world of tar-tines and maman that now receded from me as if drawn away on a string, like a child's toy, as the train began to throb again as if in delighted anticipation of the distance it would take me.\n\nThe first grey streamers of the dawn now flew in the sky and an eldritch half-light seeped into the railway carriage. I heard no change in his breathing but my heightened, excited senses told me he was awake and gazing at me. A huge man, an enormous man, and his eyes, dark and motionless as those eyes the ancient Egyptians painted upon their sarcophagi, fixed upon me. I felt a certain tension in the pit of my stomach, to be so watched, in such silence. A match struck. He was igniting a Romeo y Julieta fat as a baby's arm.\n\n'Soon,' he said in his resonant voice that was like the tolling of a bell and I felt, all at once, a sharp premonition of dread that lasted only as long as the match flared and I could see his white, broad face as if it were hovering, disembodied, above the sheets, illuminated from below like a grotesque carnival head. Then the flame died, the cigar glowed and filled the compartment with a remembered fragrance that made me think of my father, how he would hug me in a warm fug of Havana, when I was a little girl, before he kissed me and left me and died.\n\nAs soon as my husband handed me down from the high step of the train, I smelled the amniotic salinity of the ocean. It was November; the trees, stunted by the Atlantic gales, were bare and the lonely halt was deserted but for his leather-gaitered chauffeur waiting meekly beside the sleek black motor car. It was cold; I drew my furs about me, a wrap of white and black, broad stripes of ermine and sable, with a collar from which my head rose like the calyx of a wildflower. (I swear to you, I had never been vain until I met him.) The bell clanged; the straining train leapt its leash and left us at that lonely wayside halt where only he and I had descended. Oh, the wonder of it; how all that might of iron and steam had paused only to suit his convenience. The richest man in France.\n\n'Madame.'\n\nThe chauffeur eyed me; was he comparing me, invidiously, to the countess, the artist's model, the opera singer? I hid behind my furs as if they were a system of soft shields. My husband liked me to wear my opal over my kid glove, a showy, theatrical trick--but the moment the ironic chauffeur glimpsed its simmering flash he smiled, as though it was proof positive I was his master's wife. And we drove towards the widening dawn, that now streaked half the sky with a wintry bouquet of pink of roses, orange of tiger-lilies, as if my husband had ordered me a sky from a florist. The day broke around me like a cool dream.\nSea; sand; a sky that melts into the sea--a landscape of misty pastels with a look about it of being continuously on the point of melting. A landscape with all the deliquescent harmonies of Debussy, of the \u00e9tudes I played for him, the reverie I'd been playing that afternoon in the salon of the princess where I'd first met him, among the teacups and the little cakes, I, the orphan, hired out of charity to give them their digestive of music.\n\nAnd, ah! his castle. The faery solitude of the place; with its turrets of misty blue, its courtyard, its spiked gate, his castle that lay on the very bosom of the sea with seabirds mewing about its attics, the casements opening on to the green and purple, evanescent departures of the ocean, cut off by the tide from land for half a day ... that castle, at home neither on the land nor on the water, a mysterious, amphibious place, contravening the materiality of both earth and the waves, with the melancholy of a mermaiden who perches on her rock and waits, endlessly, for a lover who had drowned far away, long ago. That lovely, sad, sea-siren of a place!\n\nThe tide was low; at this hour, so early in the morning, the causeway rose up out of the sea. As the car turned on to the wet cobbles between the slow margins of water, he reached out for my hand that had his sultry, witchy ring on it, pressed my fingers, kissed my palm with extraordinary tenderness. His face was as still as ever I'd seen it, still as a pond iced thickly over, yet his lips, that always looked so strangely red and naked between the black fringes of his beard, now curved a little. He smiled; he welcomed his bride home.\n\nNo room, no corridor that did not rustle with the sound of the sea and all the ceilings, the walls on which his ancestors in the stern regalia of rank lined up with their dark eyes and white faces, were stippled with refracted light from the waves which were always in motion; that luminous, murmurous castle of which I was the chatelaine, I, the little music student whose mother had sold all her jewellery, even her wedding ring, to pay the fees at the Conservatoire.\n\nFirst of all, there was the small ordeal of my initial interview with the housekeeper, who kept this extraordinary machine, this anchored, castellated ocean liner, in smooth running order no matter who stood on the bridge; how tenuous, I thought, might be my authority here! She had a bland, pale, impassive, dislikeable face beneath the impeccably starched white linen head-dress of the region. Her greeting, correct but lifeless, chilled me; daydreaming, I dared presume too much on my status ... briefly wondered how I might install my old nurse, so much loved, however cosily incompetent, in her place. Ill-considered schemings! He told me this one had been his foster mother; was bound to his family in the utmost feudal complicity, 'as much part of the house as I am, my dear'. Now her thin lips offered me a proud little smile. She would be my ally as long as I was his. And with that, I must be content.\n\nBut, here, it would be easy to be content. In the turret suite he had given me for my very own, I could gaze out over the tumultuous Atlantic and imagine myself the Queen of the Sea. There was a Bechstein for me in the music room and, on the wall, another wedding present--an early Flemish primitive of Saint Cecilia at her celestial organ. In the prim charm of this saint, with her plump, sallow cheeks and crinkled brown hair, I saw myself as I could have wished to be. I warmed to a loving sensitivity I had not hitherto suspected in him. Then he led me up a delicate spiral staircase to my bedroom; before she discreetly vanished, the housekeeper set him chuckling with some, I dare say, lewd blessing for newlyweds in her native Breton. That I did not understand. That he, smiling, refused to interpret.\n\nAnd there lay the grand, hereditary matrimonial bed, itself the size, almost, of my little room at home, with the gargoyles carved on its surfaces of ebony, vermilion lacquer, gold leaf; and its white gauze curtains, billowing in the sea breeze. Our bed. And surrounded by so many mirrors! Mirrors on all the walls, in stately frames of contorted gold, that reflected more white lilies than I'd ever seen in my life before. He'd filled the room with them, to greet the bride, the young bride. The young bride, who had become that multitude of girls I saw in the mirrors, identical in their chic navy blue tailor-mades, for travelling, madame, or walking. A maid had dealt with the furs. Henceforth, a maid would deal with everything.\n\n'See,' he said, gesturing towards those elegant girls. 'I have acquired a whole harem for myself!'\n\nI found that I was trembling. My breath came thickly. I could not meet his eye and turned my head away, out of pride, out of shyness, and watched a dozen husbands approach me in a dozen mirrors and slowly, methodically, teasingly, unfasten the buttons of my jacket and slip it from my shoulders. Enough! No; more! Off comes the skirt; and, next, the blouse of apricot linen that cost more than the dress I had for first communion. The play of the waves outside in the cold sun glittered on his monocle; his movements seemed to me deliberately coarse, vulgar. The blood rushed to my face again, and stayed there.\n\nAnd yet, you see, I guessed it might be so--that we should have a formal disrobing of the bride, a ritual from the brothel. Sheltered as my life had been, how could I have failed, even in the world of prim bohemia in which I lived, to have heard hints of his world?\n\nHe stripped me, gourmand that he was, as if he were stripping the leaves off an artichoke--but do not imagine much finesse about it; this artichoke was no particular treat for the diner nor was he yet in any greedy haste. He approached his familiar treat with a weary appetite. And when nothing but my scarlet, palpitating core remained, I saw, in the mirror, the living image of an etching by Rops from the collection he had shown me when our engagement permitted us to be alone together ... the child with her sticklike limbs, naked but for her button boots, her gloves, shielding her face with her hand as though her face were the last repository of her modesty; and the old, monocled lecher who examined her, limb by limb. He in his London tailoring; she, bare as a lamb chop. Most pornographic of all confrontations. And so my purchaser unwrapped his bargain. And, as at the opera, when I had first seen my flesh in his eyes, I was aghast to feel myself stirring.\n\nAt once he closed my legs like a book and I saw again the rare movement of his lips that meant he smiled.\n\nNot yet. Later. Anticipation is the greater part of pleasure, my little love.\n\nAnd I began to shudder, like a racehorse before a race, yet also with a kind of fear, for I felt both a strange, impersonal arousal at the thought of love and at the same time a repugnance I could not stifle for his white, heavy flesh that had too much in common with the armfuls of arum lilies that filled my bedroom in great glass jars, those undertakers' lilies with the heavy pollen that powders your fingers as if you had dipped them in turmeric. The lilies I always associate with him; that are white. And stain you.\n\nThis scene from a voluptuary's life was now abruptly terminated. It turns out he has business to attend to; his estates, his companies--even on your honeymoon? Even then, said the red lips that kissed me before he left me alone with my bewildered senses--a wet, silken brush from his beard; a hint of the pointed tip of the tongue. Disgruntled, I wrapped a neglige of antique lace around me to sip the little breakfast of hot chocolate the maid brought me; after that, since it was second nature to me, there was nowhere to go but the music room and soon I settled down at my piano.\n\nYet only a series of subtle discords flowed from beneath my fingers: out of tune ... only a little out of tune; but I'd been blessed with perfect pitch and could not bear to play any more. Sea breezes are bad for pianos; we shall need a resident piano-tuner on the premises if I'm to continue with my studies! I flung down the lid in a little fury of disappointment; what should I do now, how shall I pass the long, sea-lit hours until my husband beds me?\n\nI shivered to think of that.\n\nHis library seemed the source of his habitual odour of Russian leather. Row upon row of calf-bound volumes, brown and olive, with gilt lettering on their spines, the octavo in brilliant scarlet morocco. A deep-buttoned leather sofa to recline on. A lectern, carved like a spread eagle, that held open upon it an edition of Huysmans's L\u00e0-bas, from some over-exquisite private press; it had been bound like a missal, in brass, with gems of coloured glass. The rugs on the floor, deep, pulsing blues of heaven and red of the heart's dearest blood, came from Isfahan and Bokhara; the dark panelling gleamed; there was the lulling music of the sea and a fire of apple logs. The flames flickered along the spines inside a glass-fronted case that held books still crisp and new. Eliphas Levy; the name meant nothing to me. I squinted at a title or two: The Initiation, The Key of Mysteries, The Secret of Pandora's Box, and yawned. Nothing, here, to detain a seventeen-year-old girl waiting for her first embrace. I should have liked, best of all, a novel in yellow paper; I wanted to curl up on the rug before the blazing fire, lose myself in a cheap novel, munch sticky liqueur chocolates. If I rang for them, a maid would bring me chocolates.\n\nNevertheless, I opened the doors of that bookcase idly to browse. And I think I knew, I knew by some tingling of the fingertips, even before I opened that slim volume with no title at all on the spine, what I should find inside it. When he showed me the Rops, newly bought, dearly prized, had he not hinted that he was a connoisseur of such things? Yet I had not bargained for this, the girl with tears hanging on her cheeks like stuck pearls, her cunt a split fig below the great globes of her buttocks on which the knotted tails of the cat were about to descend, while a man in a black mask fingered with his free hand his prick, that curved upwards like the scimitar he held. The picture had a caption: 'Reproof of curiosity'. My mother, with all the precision of her eccentricity, had told me what it was that lovers did; I was innocent but not na\u00efve. The Adventures of Eulalie at the Harem of the Grand Turk had been printed, according to the flyleaf, in Amsterdam in 1748, a rare collector's piece. Had some ancestor brought it back himself from that northern city? Or had my husband bought it for himself, from one of those dusty little bookshops on the Left Bank where an old man peers at you through spectacles an inch thick, daring you to inspect his wares ... I turned the pages in the anticipation of fear; the print was rusty. Here was another steel engraving: 'Immolation of the wives of the Sultan'. I knew enough for what I saw in that book to make me gasp.\n\nThere was a pungent intensification of the odour of leather that suffused his library; his shadow fell across the massacre.\n\n'My little nun has found the prayerbooks, has she?' he demanded, with a curious mixture of mockery and relish; then, seeing my painful, furious bewilderment, he laughed at me aloud, snatched the book from my hands and put it down on the sofa.\n\n'Have the nasty pictures scared Baby? Baby mustn't play with grownups' toys until she's learned how to handle them, must she?'\n\nThen he kissed me. And with, this time, no reticence. He kissed me and laid his hand imperatively upon my breast, beneath the sheath of ancient lace. I stumbled on the winding stair that led to the bedroom, to the carved, gilded bed on which he had been conceived. I stammered foolishly: We've not taken luncheon yet; and, besides, it is broad daylight...\n\nAll the better to see you.\n\nHe made me put on my choker, the family heirloom of one woman who had escaped the blade. With trembling fingers, I fastened the thing about my neck. It was cold as ice and chilled me. He twined my hair into a rope and lifted it off my shoulders so that he could the better kiss the downy furrows below my ears; that made me shudder. And he kissed those blazing rubies, too. He kissed them before he kissed my mouth. Rapt, he intoned:' Of her apparel she retains/Only her sonorous jewellery.'\n\nA dozen husbands impaled a dozen brides while the mewing gulls swung on invisible trapezes in the empty air outside.\n\nI was brought to my senses by the insistent shrilling of the telephone. He lay beside me, felled like an oak, breathing stertorously, as if he had been fighting with me. In the course of that one-sided struggle, I had seen his deathly composure shatter like a porcelain vase flung against a wall; I had heard him shriek and blaspheme at the orgasm; I had bled. And perhaps I had seen his face without its mask; and perhaps I had not. Yet I had been infinitely dishevelled by the loss of my virginity.\n\nI gathered myself together, reached into the cloisonne cupboard beside the bed that concealed the telephone and addressed the mouthpiece. His agent in New York. Urgent.\n\nI shook him awake and rolled over on my side, cradling my spent body in my arms. His voice buzzed like a hive of distant bees. My husband. My husband, who, with so much love, filled my bedroom with lilies until it looked like an embalming parlour. Those somnolent lilies, that wave their heavy heads, distributing their lush, insolent incense reminiscent of pampered flesh.\n\nWhen he'd finished with the agent, he turned to me and stroked the ruby necklace that bit into my neck, but with such tenderness now, that I ceased flinching and he caressed my breasts. My dear one, my little love, my child, did it hurt her? He's so sorry for it, such impetuousness, he could not help himself; you see, he loves her so ... and this lover's recitative of his brought my tears in a flood. I clung to him as though only the one who had inflicted the pain could comfort me for suffering it. For a while, he murmured to me in a voice I'd never heard before, a voice like the soft consolations of the sea. But then he unwound the tendrils of my hair from the buttons of his smoking jacket, kissed my cheek briskly and told me the agent from New York had called with such urgent business that he must leave as soon as the tide was low enough. Leave the castle? Leave France! And would be away for at least six weeks.\n\n'But it is our honeymoon!'\n\nA deal, an enterprise of hazard and chance involving several millions, lay in the balance, he said. He drew away from me into that waxworks stillness of his; I was only a little girl, I did not understand. And, he said unspoken to my wounded vanity, I have had too many honeymoons to find them in the least pressing commitments. I know quite well that this child I've bought with a handful of coloured stones and the pelts of dead beasts won't run away. But, after he'd called his Paris agent to book a passage for the States next day--just one tiny call, my little one--we should have time for dinner together.\n\nAnd I had to be content with that,\n\nA Mexican dish of pheasant with hazelnuts and chocolate; salad; white, voluptuous cheese; a sorbet of muscat grapes and Asti spumante. A celebration of Krug exploded festively. And then acrid black coffee in precious little cups so fine it shadowed the birds with which they were painted. I had Cointreau, he had cognac in the library, with the purple velvet curtains drawn against the night, where he took me to perch on his knee in a leather armchair beside the flickering log fire. He had made me change into that chaste little Poiret shift of white muslin; he seemed especially fond of it, my breasts showed through the flimsy stuff, he said, like little soft white doves that sleep, each one, with a pink eye open. But he would not let me take off my ruby choker, although it was growing very uncomfortable, nor fasten up my descending hair, the sign of a virginity so recently ruptured that still remained a wounded presence between us. He twined his fingers in my hair until I winced; I said, I remember, very little.\n\n'The maid will have changed our sheets already,' he said. 'We do not hang the bloody sheets out of the window to prove to the whole of Brittany you are a virgin, not in these civilized times. But I should tell you it would have been the first time in all my married lives I could have shown my interested tenants such a flag.'\n\nThen I realized, with a shock of surprise, how it must have been my innocence that captivated him--the silent music, he said, of my unknowingness, like La Terrasse des audiences au clair de lune played upon a piano with keys of ether. You must remember how ill at ease I was in that luxurious place, how unease had been my constant companion during the whole length of my courtship by this grave satyr who now gently martyrized my hair. To know that my naivety gave him some pleasure made me take heart. Courage! I shall act the fine lady to the manner born one day, if only by virtue of default.\n\nThen, slowly yet teasingly, as if he were giving a child a great, mysterious treat, he took out a bunch of keys from some interior hidey-hole in his jacket--key after key, a key, he said, for every lock in the house. Keys of all kinds--huge, ancient things of black iron; others slender, delicate, almost baroque; wafer-thin Yale keys for safes and boxes. And, during his absence, it was I who must take care of them all.\n\nI eyed the heavy bunch with circumspection. Until that moment, I had not given a single thought to the practical aspects of marriage with a great house, great wealth, a great man, whose key ring was as crowded as that of a prison warder. Here were the clumsy and archaic keys for the dungeons, for dungeons we had in plenty although they had been converted to cellars for his wines; the dusty bottles inhabited in racks all those deep holes of pain in the rock on which the castle was built. These are the keys to the kitchens, this is the key to the picture gallery, a treasure house filled by five centuries of avid collectors--ah! he foresaw I would spend hours there.\n\nHe had amply indulged his taste for the Symbolists, he told me with a glint of greed. There was Moreau's great portrait of his first wife, the famous Sacrificial Victim with the imprint of the lacelike chains on her pellucid skin. Did I know the story of the painting of that picture? How, when she took off her clothes for him for the first time, she fresh from her bar in Montmartre, she had robed herself involuntarily in a blush that reddened her breasts, her shoulders, her arms, her whole body? He had thought of that story, of that dear girl, when first he had undressed me ... Ensor, the great Ensor, his monolithic canvas: The Foolish Virgins. Two or three late Gauguins, his special favourite the one of the tranced brown girl in the deserted house which was called: Out of the Night We Come, Into the Night We Go. And, besides the additions he had made himself, his marvellous inheritance of Watteaus, Poussins and a pair of very special Fragonards, commissioned for a licentious ancestor who, it was said, had posed for the master's brush himself with his own two daughters ... He broke off his catalogue of treasures abruptly.\n\nYour thin white face, ch\u00e9rie; he said, as if he saw it for the first time. Your thin white face, with its promise of debauchery only a connoisseur could detect.\n\nA log fell in the fire, instigating a shower of sparks; the opal on my finger spurted green flame. I felt as giddy as if I were on the edge of a precipice; I was afraid, not so much of him, of his monstrous presence, heavy as if he had been gifted at birth with more specific gravity than the rest of us, the presence that, even when I thought myself most in love with him, always subtly oppressed me ... No. I was not afraid of him; but of myself. I seemed reborn in his unreflective eyes, reborn in unfamiliar shapes. I hardly recognized myself from his descriptions of me and yet, and yet--might there not be a grain of beastly truth hi them? And, in the red firelight, I blushed again, unnoticed, to think he might have chosen me because, in my innocence, he sensed a rare talent for corruption.\n\nHere is the key to the china cabinet--don't laugh, my darling; there's a king's ransom in S\u00e8vres in that closet, and a queen's ransom in Limoges. And a key to the locked, barred room where five generations of plate were kept.\n\nKeys, keys, keys. He would trust me with the keys to his office, although I was only a baby; and the keys to his safes, where he kept the jewels I should wear, he promised me, when we returned to Paris. Such jewels! Why, I would be able to change my earrings and necklaces three times a day, just as the Empress Josephine used to change her underwear. He doubted, he said, with that hollow, knocking sound that served him for a chuckle, I would be quite so interested in his share certificates although they, of course, were worth infinitely more.\n\nOutside our firelit privacy, I could hear the sound of the tide drawing back from the pebbles of the foreshore; it was nearly time for him to leave me. One single key remained unaccounted for on the ring and he hesitated over it; for a moment, I thought he was going to unfasten it from its brothers, slip it back into his pocket and take it away with him.\n\n'What is that key?' I demanded, for his chaffing had made me bold. 'The key to your heart? Give it me!'\n\nHe dangled the key tantalizingly above my head, out of reach of my straining fingers; those bare red lips of his cracked sidelong in a smile.\n\n'Ah, no,' he said. 'Not the key to my heart. Rather, the key to my enfer.'\n\nHe left it on the ring, fastened the ring together, shook it musically, like a carillon. Then threw the keys in a jingling heap in my lap. I could feel the cold metal chilling my thighs through my thin muslin frock. He bent over me to drop a beard-masked kiss on my forehead.\n\n'Every man must have one secret, even if only one, from his wife,' he said. 'Promise me this, my whey-faced piano-player; promise me you'll use all the keys on the ring except that last little one I showed you. Play with anything you find, jewels, silver plate; make toy boats of my share certificates, if it pleases you, and send them sailing off to America after me. All is yours, everywhere is open to you--except the lock that this single key fits. Yet all it is is the key to a little room at the foot of the west tower, behind the still-room, at the end of a dark little corridor full of horrid cobwebs that would get into your hair and frighten you if you ventured there. Oh, and you'd find it such a dull little room! But you must promise me, if you love me, to leave it well alone. It is only a private study, a hideaway, a \"den\", as the English say, where I can go, sometimes, on those infrequent yet inevitable occasions when the yoke of marriage seems to weigh too heavily on my shoulders. There I can go, you understand, to savour the rare pleasure of imagining myself wifeless.'\n\nThere was a little thin starlight in the courtyard as, wrapped in my furs, I saw him to his car. His last words were, that he had telephoned the mainland and taken a piano-tuner on to the staff; this man would arrive to take up his duties the next day. He pressed me to his vicu\u00f1a breast, once, and then drove away.\n\nI had drowsed away that afternoon and now I could not sleep. I lay tossing and turning in his ancestral bed until another daybreak discoloured the dozen mirrors that were iridescent with the reflections of the sea. The perfume of the lilies weighed on my senses; when I thought that, henceforth, I would always share these sheets with a man whose skin, as theirs did, contained that toad-like, clammy hint of moisture, I felt a vague desolation that within me, now my female wound had healed, there had awoken a certain queasy craving like the cravings of pregnant women for the taste of coal or chalk or tainted food, for the renewal of his caresses. Had he not hinted to me, in his flesh as in his speech and looks, of the thousand, thousand baroque intersections of flesh upon flesh? I lay in our wide bed accompanied by, a sleepless companion, my dark newborn curiosity.\n\nI lay in bed alone. And I longed for him. And he disgusted me.\n\nWere there jewels enough in all his safes to recompense me for this predicament? Did all that castle hold enough riches to recompense me for the company of the libertine with whom I must share it? And what, precisely, was the nature of my desirous dread for this mysterious being who, to show his mastery over me, had abandoned me on my wedding night?\n\nThen I sat straight up in bed, under the sardonic masks of the gargoyles carved above me, riven by a wild surmise. Might he have left me, not for Wall Street but for an importunate mistress tucked away God knows where who knew how to pleasure him far better than a girl whose fingers had been exercised, hitherto, only by the practice of scales and arpeggios? And, slowly, soothed, I sank back on to the heaping pillows; I acknowledged that the jealous scare I'd just given myself was not unmixed with a little tincture of relief.\n\nAt last I drifted into slumber, as daylight filled the room and chased bad dreams away. But the last thing I remembered, before I slept, was the tall jar of lilies beside the bed, how the thick glass distorted their fat stems so they looked like arms, dismembered arms, drifting drowned in greenish water.\n\nCoffee and croissants to console this bridal, solitary waking. Delicious. Honey, too, in a section of comb on a glass saucer. The maid squeezed the aromatic juice from an orange into a chilled goblet while I watched her as I lay in the lazy, midday bed of the rich. Yet nothing, this morning, gave me more than a fleeting pleasure except to hear that the piano-tuner had been at work already. When the maid told me that, I sprang out of bed and pulled on my old serge skirt and flannel blouse, costume of a student, in which I felt far more at ease with myself than in any of my fine new clothes.\n\nAfter my three hours of practice, I called the piano-tuner in, to thank him. He was blind, of course; but young, with a gentle mouth and grey eyes that fixed upon me although they could not see me. He was a blacksmith's son from the village across the causeway; a chorister in the church whom the good priest had taught a trade so that he could make a living. All most satisfactory. Yes. He thought he would be happy here. And if, he added shyly, he might sometimes be allowed to hear me play ... for, you see, he loved music. Yes. Of course, I said. Certainly. He seemed to know that I had smiled.\n\nAfter I dismissed him, even though I'd woken so late, it was still barely time for my 'five o'clock'. The housekeeper, who, thoughtfully forewarned by my husband, had restrained herself from interrupting my music, now made me a solemn visitation with a lengthy menu for a late luncheon. When I told her I did not need it, she looked at me obliquely, along her nose. I understood at once that one of my principal functions as chatelaine was to provide work for the staff. But, all the same, I asserted myself and said I would wait until dinner-time, although I looked forward nervously to the solitary meal. Then I found I had to tell her what I would like to have prepared for me; my imagination, still that of a schoolgirl, ran riot. A fowl in cream--or should I anticipate Christmas with a varnished turkey? No; I have decided. Avocado and shrimp, lots of it, followed by no entr\u00e9e at all. But surprise me for dessert with every ice-cream in the ice box. She noted all down but sniffed; I'd shocked her. Such tastes! Child that I was, I giggled when she left me.\n\nBut, now ... what shall I do, now?\n\nI could have spent a happy hour unpacking the trunks that contained my trousseau but the maid had done that already, the dresses, the tailor-mades hung in the wardrobe in my dressing room, the hats on wooden heads to keep their shape, the shoes on wooden feet as if all these inanimate objects were imitating the appearance of life, to mock me. I did not like to linger in my overcrowded dressing room, nor in my lugubriously lily-scented bedroom. How shall I pass the time?\n\nI shall take a bath in my own bathroom! And found the taps were little dolphins made of gold, with chips of turquoise for eyes. And there was a tank of goldfish, who swam in and out of moving fronds of weeds, as bored, I thought, as I was. How I wished he had not left me. How I wished it were possible to chat with, say, a maid; or, the piano-tuner ... but I knew already my new rank forbade overtures of friendship to the staff.\n\nI had been hoping to defer the call as long as I could, so that I should have something to look forward to in the dead waste of time I foresaw before me, after my dinner was done with, but, at a quarter before seven, when darkness already surrounded the castle, I could contain myself no longer. I telephoned my mother. And astonished myself by bursting into tears when I heard her voice.\n\nNo, nothing was the matter. Mother, I have gold bath taps.\n\nI said, gold bath taps!\n\nNo; I suppose that's nothing to cry about, Mother.\n\nThe line was bad, I could hardly make out her congratulations, her questions, her concern, but I was a little comforted when I put the receiver down.\n\nYet there still remained one whole hour to dinner and the whole, unimaginable desert of the rest of the evening.\n\nThe bunch of keys lay, where he had left them, on the rug before the library fire which had warmed their metal so that they no longer felt cold to the touch but warm, almost, as my own skin. How careless I was; a maid, tending the logs, eyed me reproachfully as if I'd set a trap for her as I picked up the clinking bundle of keys, the keys to the interior doors of this lovely prison of which I was both the inmate and the mistress and had scarcely seen. When I remembered that, I felt the exhilaration of the explorer.\n\nLights! More lights!\n\nAt the touch of a switch, the dreaming library was brilliantly illuminated. I ran crazily about the castle, switching on every light I could find--I ordered the servants to light up all their quarters, too, so the castle would shine like a seaborne birthday cake lit with a thousand candles, one for every year of its life, and everybody on shore would wonder at it. When everything was lit as brightly as the caf\u00e9 in the Gare du Nord, the significance of the possessions implied by that bunch of keys no longer intimidated me, for I was determined, now, to search through them all for evidence of my husband's true nature. His office first, evidently.\n\nA mahogany desk half a mile wide, with an impeccable blotter and a bank of telephones. I allowed myself the luxury of opening the safe that contained the jewellery and delved sufficiently among the leather boxes to find out how my marriage had given me access to a jinn's treasury--parures, bracelets, rings ... While I was thus surrounded by diamonds, a maid knocked on the door and entered before I spoke; a subtle discourtesy. I would speak to my husband about it. She eyed my serge skirt superciliously; did madame plan to dress for dinner?\n\nShe made a moue of disdain when I laughed to hear that, she was far more the lady than I. But, imagine--to dress up in one of my Poiret extravaganzas, with the jewelled turban and aigrette on my head, roped with pearl to the navel, to sit down all alone in the baronial dining hall at the head of that massive board at which King Mark was reputed to have fed his knights ... I grew calmer under the cold eye of her disapproval. I adopted the crisp inflections of an officer's daughter. No, I would not dress for dinner. Furthermore, I was not hungry enough for dinner itself. She must tell the housekeeper to cancel the dormitory feast I'd ordered. Could they leave me sandwiches and a flask of coffee in my music room? And would they all dismiss for the night?\n\nMais oui, madame.\n\nI knew by her bereft intonation I had let them down again but I did not care; I was armed against them by the brilliance of his hoard. But I would not find his heart amongst the glittering stones; as soon as she had gone, I began a systematic search of the drawers of his desk.\n\nAll was in order, so I found nothing. Not a random doodle on an old envelope, nor the faded photograph of a woman. Only the files of business correspondence, the bills from the home farms, the invoices from tailors, the billets-doux from international financiers. Nothing. And this absence of the evidence of his real life began to impress me strangely; there must, I thought, be a great deal to conceal if he takes such pains to hide it.\n\nHis office was a singularly impersonal room, facing inwards, on to the courtyard, as though he wanted to turn his back on the siren sea in order to keep a clear head while he bankrupted a small businessman in Amsterdam or--I noticed with a thrill of distaste--engaged in some business in Laos that must, from certain cryptic references to his amateur botanist's enthusiasm for rare poppies, be to do with opium. Was he not rich enough to do without crime? Or was the crime itself his profit? And yet I saw enough to appreciate his zeal for secrecy.\n\nNow I had ransacked his desk, I must spend a cool-headed quarter of an hour putting every last letter back where I had found it, and, as I covered the traces of my visit, by some chance, as I reached inside a little drawer that had stuck fast, I must have touched a hidden spring, for a secret drawer flew open within that drawer itself; and this secret drawer contained--at last!--a file marked: Personal.\n\nI was alone, but for my reflection in the uncurtained window.\n\nI had the brief notion that his heart, pressed flat as a flower, crimson and thin as tissue paper, lay in this file. It was a very thin one.\n\nI could have wished, perhaps, I had not found that touching, ill-spelt note, on a paper napkin marked La Coupole, that began: 'My darling, I cannot wait for the moment when you may make me yours completely.' The diva had sent him a page of the score of Tristan, the Liebestod, with the single, cryptic word: 'Until...' scrawled across it. But the strangest of all these love letters was a postcard with a view of a village graveyard, among mountains, where some black-coated ghoul enthusiastically dug at a grave; this little scene, executed with the lurid exuberance of Grand Guignol, was captioned: 'Typical Transylvanian Scene--Midnight, All Hallows.' And, on the other side, the message: 'On the occasion of this marriage to the descendant of Dracula--always remember, \"the supreme and unique pleasure of love is the certainty that one is doing evil\". Toutes amiti\u00e9s, C.'\n\nA joke. A joke in the worst possible taste; for had he not been married to a Romanian countess? And then I remembered her pretty, witty face, and her name--Carmilla. My most recent predecessor in this castle had been, it would seem, the most sophisticated.\n\nI put away the file, sobered. Nothing in my life of family love and music had prepared me for these grown-up games and yet these were clues to his self that showed me, at least, how much he had been loved, even if they did not reveal any good reason for it. But I wanted to know still more; and, as I closed the office door and locked it, the means to discover more fell in my way.\n\nFell, indeed; and with the clatter of a dropped canteen of cutlery, for, as I turned the slick Yale lock, I contrived, somehow, to open up the key ring itself, so that all the keys tumbled loose on the floor. And the very first key I picked out of that pile was, as luck or ill fortune had it, the key to the room he had forbidden me, the room he would keep for his own so that he could go there when he wished to feel himself once more a bachelor.\n\nI made my decision to explore it before I felt a faint resurgence of my ill-defined fear of his waxen stillness. Perhaps I half-imagined, then, that I might find his real self in his den, waiting there to see if indeed I had obeyed him; that he had sent a moving figure of himself to New York, the enigmatic, self-sustaining carapace of his public person, while the real man, whose face I had glimpsed in the storm of orgasm, occupied himself with pressing private business in the study at the foot of the west tower, behind the still-room. Yet, if that were so, it was imperative that I should find him, should know him; and I was too deluded by his apparent taste for me to think my disobedience might truly offend him.\n\nI took the forbidden key from the heap and left the others lying there.\n\nIt was now very late and the castle was adrift, as far as it could go from the land, in the middle of the silent ocean where, at my orders, it floated, like a garland of light. And all silent, all still, but for the murmuring of the waves.\n\nI felt no fear, no intimation of dread. Now I walked as firmly as I had done in my mother's house.\n\nNot a narrow, dusty little passage at all; why had he lied to me? But an ill-lit one, certainly; the electricity, for some reason, did not extend here, so I retreated to the still-room and found a bundle of waxed tapers in a cupboard, stored there with matches to light the oak board at grand dinners. I put a match to my little taper and advanced with it in my hand, like a penitent, along the corridor hung with heavy, I think Venetian, tapestries. The flame picked out, here, the head of a man, there, the rich breast of a woman spilling through a rent in her dress--the Rape of the Sabines, perhaps? The naked swords and immolated horses suggested some grisly mythological subject. The corridor wound downwards; there was an almost imperceptible ramp to the thickly carpeted floor. The heavy hangings on the wall muffled my footsteps, even my breathing. For some reason, it grew very warm; the sweat sprang out in beads on my brow. I could no longer hear the sound of the sea.\n\nA long, a winding corridor, as if I were in the viscera of the castle; and this corridor led to a door of worm-eaten oak, low, round-topped, barred with black iron.\n\nAnd still I felt no fear, no raising of the hairs on the back of the neck, no prickling of the thumbs.\n\nThe key slid into the new lock as easily as a hot knife into butter.\n\nNo fear; but a hesitation, a holding of the spiritual breath.\n\nIf I had found some traces of his heart in a file marked: Personal, perhaps, here, in his subterranean privacy, I might find a little of his soul. It was the consciousness of the possibility of such a discovery, of its possible strangeness, that kept me for a moment motionless, before, in the foolhardiness of my already subtly tainted innocence, I turned the key and the door creaked slowly back.\n\n'There is a striking resemblance between the act of love and the ministrations of a torturer,' opined my husband's favourite poet; I had learned something of the nature of that similarity on my marriage bed. And now my taper showed me the outlines of a rack. There was also a great wheel, like the ones I had seen in woodcuts of the martyrdoms of the saints, in my old nurse's little store of holy books. And--just one glimpse of it before my little flame caved in and I was left in absolute darkness--a metal figure, hinged at the side, which I knew to be spiked on the inside and to have the name: the Iron Maiden.\n\nAbsolute darkness. And, about me, the instruments of mutilation.\n\nUntil that moment, this spoiled child did not know she had inherited nerves and a will from the mother who had defied the yellow outlaws of Indo-China; My mother's spirit drove me on, into that dreadful place, in a cold ecstasy to know the very worst. I fumbled for the matches in my pocket; what a dim, lugubrious light they gave! And yet, enough, oh, more than enough, to see a room designed for desecration and some dark night of unimaginable lovers whose embraces were annihilation.\n\nThe walls of this stark torture chamber were the naked rock; they gleamed as if they were sweating with fright. At the four corners of the room were funerary urns, of great antiquity, Etruscan, perhaps, and, on three-legged ebony stands, the bowls of incense he had left burning which filled the room with a sacerdotal reek. Wheel, rack and Iron Maiden were, I saw, displayed as grandly as if they were items of statuary and I was almost consoled, then, and almost persuaded myself that I might have stumbled only upon a little museum of his perversity, that he had installed these monstrous items here only for contemplation.\n\nYet at the centre of the room lay a catafalque, a doomed, ominous bier of Renaissance workmanship, surrounded by long white candles and, at its foot, an armful of the same lilies with which he had filled my bedroom, stowed in a four-foot-high jar glazed with a sombre Chinese red. I scarcely dared examine this catafalque and its occupant more closely; yet I knew I must.\n\nEach time I struck a match to light those candles round her bed, it seemed a garment of that innocence of mine for which he had lusted fell away from me.\n\nThe opera singer lay, quite naked, under a thin sheet of very rare and precious linen, such as the princes of Italy used to shroud those whom they had poisoned. I touched her, very gently, on the white breast; she was cool, he had embalmed her. On her throat I could see the blue imprint of his strangler's fingers. The cool, sad flame of the candles flickered on her white, closed eyelids. The worst thing was, the dead lips smiled.\n\nBeyond the catafalque, in the middle of the shadows, a white, nacreous glimmer; as my eyes accustomed themselves to the gathering darkness, I at last--oh, horrors!--made out a skull; yes, a skull, so utterly denuded, now, of flesh, that it scarcely seemed possible the stark bone had once been richly upholstered with life. And this skull was strung up by a system of unseen cords, so that it appeared to hang, disembodied, in the still, heavy air, and it had been crowned with a wreath of white roses, and a veil of lace, the final image of his bride.\n\nYet the skull was still so beautiful, had shaped with its sheer planes so imperiously the face that had once existed above it, that I recognized her the moment I saw her; face of the evening star walking on the rim of night. One false step, oh, my poor, dear girl, next in the fated sisterhood of his wives; one false step and into the abyss of the dark you stumbled.\n\nAnd where was she, the latest dead, the Romanian countess who might have thought her blood would survive his depredations? I knew she must be here, in the place that had wound me through the castle towards it on a spool of inexorability. But, at first, I could see no sign of her. Then, for some reason--perhaps some change of atmosphere wrought by my presence--the metal shell of the Iron Maiden emitted a ghostly twang; my feverish imagination might have guessed its occupant was trying to clamber out, though, even in the midst of my rising hysteria, I knew she must be dead to find a home there.\n\nWith trembling fingers, I prised open the front of the upright coffin, with its sculpted face caught in a rictus of pain. Then, overcome, I dropped the key I still held in my other hand. It dropped into the forming pool of her blood.\n\nShe was pierced, not by one but by a hundred spikes, this child of the land of the vampires who seemed so newly dead, so full of blood ... oh God! how recently had he become a widower? How long had he kept her in this obscene cell? Had it been all the time he had courted me, in the clear light of Paris?\n\nI closed the lid of her coffin very gently and burst into a tumult of sobbing that contained both pity for his other victims and also a dreadful anguish to know I, too, was one of them.\n\nThe candles flared, as if in a draught from a door to elsewhere. The light caught the fire opal on my hand so that it flashed, once, with a baleful light, as if to tell me the eye of God--his eye--was upon me. My first thought, when I saw the ring for which I had sold myself to this fate, was, how to escape it.\n\nI retained sufficient presence of mind to snuff out the candles round the bier with my fingers, to gather up my taper, to look around, although shuddering, to ensure I had left behind me no traces of my visit.\n\nI retrieved the key from the pool of blood, wrapped it in my handkerchief to keep my hands clean, and fled the room, slamming the door behind me. It crashed to with a juddering reverberation, like the door of hell.\n\nI could not take refuge in my bedroom, for that retained the memory of his presence trapped in the fathomless silvering of his mirrors. My music room seemed the safest place, although I looked at the picture of Saint Cecilia with a faint dread; what had been the nature of her martyrdom? My mind was in a tumult; schemes for flight jostled with one another ... as soon as the tide receded from the causeway, I would make for the mainland--on foot, running, stumbling; I did not trust that leather-clad chauffeur, nor the well-behaved housekeeper, and I dared not take any of the pale, ghostly maids into my confidence, either, since they were his creatures, all. Once at the village, I would fling myself directly on the mercy of the gendarmerie.\n\nBut--could I trust them, either? His forefathers had ruled this coast for eight centuries, from this castle whose moat was the Atlantic. Might not the police, the advocates, even the judge, all be in his service, turning a common blind eye to his vices since he was milord whose word must be obeyed? Who, on this distant coast, would believe the white-faced girl from Paris who came running to them with a shuddering tale of blood, of fear, of the ogre murmuring in the shadows? Or, rather, they would immediately know it to be true. But were all honour-bound to let me carry it no further.\n\nAssistance. My mother. I ran to the telephone; and the line, of course, was dead.\n\nDead as his wives.\n\nA thick darkness, unlit by any star, still glazed the windows. Every lamp in my room burned, to keep the dark outside, yet it seemed still to encroach on me, to be present beside me but as if masked by my lights, the night like a permeable substance that could seep into my skin. I looked at the precious little clock made from hypocritically innocent flowers long ago, in Dresden; the hands had scarcely moved one single hour forward from when I first descended to that private slaughterhouse of his. Time was his servant, too; it would trap me, here, in a night that would last until he came back to me, like a black sun on a hopeless morning.\n\nAnd yet the time might still be my friend; at that hour, that very hour, he set sail for New York.\n\nTo know that, in a few moments, my husband would have left France calmed my agitation a little. My reason told me I had nothing to fear; the tide that would take him away to the New World would let me out of the imprisonment of the castle. Surely I could easily evade the servants. Anybody can buy a ticket at a railway station. Yet I was still rilled with unease. I opened the lid of the piano; perhaps I thought my own particular magic might help me, now, that I could create a pentacle out of music that would keep me from harm for, if my music had first ensnared him, then might it not also give me the power to free myself from him?\n\nMechanically, I began to play but my fingers were stiff and shaking. At first, I could manage nothing better than the exercises of Czerny but simply the act of playing soothed me and, for solace, for the sake of the harmonious rationality of its sublime mathematics, I searched among his scores until I found The Well-Tempered Clavier. I set myself the therapeutic task of playing all Bach's equations, every one, and, I told myself, if I played them all through without a single mistake--then the morning would find me once more a virgin.\n\nCrash of a dropped stick.\n\nHis silver-headed cane! What else? Sly, cunning, he had returned; he was waiting for me outside the door!\n\nI rose to my feet; fear gave me strength. I flung back my head defiantly.\n\n'Come in!' My voice astonished me by its firmness, its clarity.\n\nThe door slowly, nervously opened and I saw, not the massive, irredeemable bulk of my husband but the slight, stooping figure of the piano-tuner, and he looked far more terrified of me than my mother's daughter would have been of the Devil himself. In the torture chamber, it seemed to me that I would never laugh again; now, helplessly, laugh I did, with relief, and, after a moment's hesitation, the boy's face softened and he smiled a little, almost in shame. Though they were blind, his eyes were singularly sweet.\n\n'Forgive me,' said Jean-Yves. 'I know I've given you grounds for dismissing me, that I should be crouching outside your door at midnight ... but I heard you walking about, up and down--I sleep in a room at the foot of the west tower--and some intuition told me you could not sleep and might, perhaps, pass the insomniac hours at your piano. And I could not resist that. Besides, I stumbled over these--'\n\nAnd he displayed the ring of keys I'd dropped outside my husband's office door, the ring from which one key was missing. I took them from him, looked round for a place to stow them, fixed on the piano stool as if to hide them would protect me. Still he stood smiling at me. How hard it was to make everyday conversation.\n\n'It's perfect,' I said. 'The piano. Perfectly in tune.'\n\nBut he was full of the loquacity of embarrassment, as though I would only forgive him for his impudence if he explained the cause of it thoroughly.\n\n'When I heard you play this afternoon, I thought I'd never heard such a touch. Such technique. A treat for me, to hear a virtuoso! So I crept up to your door now, humbly as a little dog might, madame, and put my ear to the keyhole and listened, and listened--until my stick fell to the floor through a momentary clumsiness of mine, and I was discovered.'\n\nHe had the most touchingly ingenuous smile.\n\n'Perfectly in tune,' I repeated. To my surprise, now I had said it, I found I could not say anything else. I could only repeat: 'In tune ... perfect ... in tune,' over and over again. I saw a dawning surprise in his face. My head throbbed. To see him, in his lovely, blind humanity, seemed to hurt me very piercingly, somewhere inside my breast; his figure blurred, the room swayed about me. After the dreadful revelation of that bloody chamber, it was his tender look that made me faint.\n\nWhen I recovered consciousness, I found I was lying in the piano-tuner's arms and he was tucking the satin cushion from the piano-stool under my head.\n\n'You are in some great distress,' he said. 'No bride should suffer so much, so early in her marriage.'\n\nHis speech had the rhythms of the countryside, the rhythms of the tides.\n\n'Any bride brought to this castle should come ready dressed in mourning, should bring a priest and a coffin with her,' I said.\n\n'What's this?'\n\nIt was too late to keep silent; and if he, too, were one of my husband's creatures, then at least he had been kind to me. So I told him everything, the keys, the interdiction, my disobedience, the room, the rack, the skull, the corpses, the blood.\n\n'I can scarcely believe it,' he said, wondering. 'That man ... so rich; so well-born.'\n\n'Here's proof,' I said and tumbled the fatal key out of my handkerchief on to the silken rug.\n\n'Oh God,' he said. 'I can smell the blood.'\n\nHe took my hand; he pressed his arms about me. Although he was scarcely more than a boy, I felt a great strength flow into me from his touch.\n\n'We whisper all manner of strange tales up and down the coast,' he said.' There was a Marquis, once, who used to hunt young girls on the mainland; he hunted them with dogs, as though they were foxes. My grandfather had it from his grandfather, how the Marquis pulled a head out of his saddle bag and showed it to the blacksmith while the man was shoeing his horse. \"A fine specimen of the genus, brunette, eh, Guillaume?\" And it was the head of the blacksmith's wife.'\n\nBut, in these more democratic times, my husband must travel as far as Paris to do his hunting in the salons. Jean-Yves knew the moment I shuddered.\n\n'Oh, madame! I thought all these were old wives' tales, chattering of fools, spooks to scare bad children into good behaviour! Yet how could you know, a stranger, that the old name for this place is the Castle of Murder?'\n\nHow could I know, indeed? Except that, in my heart, I'd always known its lord would be the death of me.\n\n'Hark!' said my friend suddenly. 'The sea has changed key; it must be near morning, the tide is going down.'\n\nHe helped me up. I looked from the window, towards the mainland, along the causeway where the stones gleamed wetly in the thin light of the end of the night and, with an almost unimaginable horror, a horror the intensity of which I cannot transmit to you, I saw, in the distance, still far away yet drawing moment by moment inexorably nearer, the twin headlamps of his great black car, gouging tunnels through the shifting mist.\n\nMy husband had indeed returned; this time, it was no fancy.\n\n'The key!' said Jean-Yves. 'It must go back on the ring, with the others. As though nothing had happened.'\n\nBut the key was still caked with wet blood and I ran to my bathroom and held it under the hot tap. Crimson water swirled down the basin but, as if the key itself were hurt, the bloody token stuck. The turquoise eyes of the dolphin taps winked at me derisively; they knew my husband had been too clever for me! I scrubbed the stain with my nail brush but still it would not budge. I thought how the car would be rolling silently towards the closed courtyard gate; the more I scrubbed the key, the more vivid grew the stain.\n\nThe bell in the gatehouse would jangle. The porter's drowsy son would push back the patchwork quilt, yawning, pull the shirt over his head, thrust his feet into his sabots ... slowly, slowly; open the door for your master as slowly as you can ...\n\nAnd still the bloodstain mocked the fresh water that spilled from the mouth of the leering dolphin.\n\n'You have no more time,' said Jean-Yves. 'He is here. I know it. I must stay with you.'\n\n'You shall not!' I said. 'Go back to your room, now. Please.'\n\nHe hesitated. I put an edge of steel in my voice, for I knew I must meet my lord alone.\n\n'Leave me!'\n\nAs soon as he had gone, I dealt with the keys and went to my bedroom. The causeway was empty; Jean-Yves was correct, my husband had already entered the castle. I pulled the curtains close, stripped off my clothes and pulled the bedcurtains round me as a pungent aroma of Russian leather assured me my husband was once again beside me.\n\n'Dearest!'\n\nWith the most treacherous, lascivious tenderness, he kissed my eyes, and, mimicking the new bride newly wakened, I flung my arms around him, for on my seeming acquiescence depended my salvation.\n\n'Da Silva of Rio outwitted me,' he said wryly.' My New York agent telegraphed Le Havre and saved me a wasted journey. So we may resume our interrupted pleasures, my love.'\n\nI did not believe one word of it. I knew I had behaved exactly according to his desires; had he not bought me so that I should do so? I had been tricked into my own betrayal to that illimitable darkness whose source I had been compelled to seek in his absence and, now that I had met that shadowed reality of his that came to life only in the presence of its own atrocities, I must pay the price of my new knowledge. The secret of Pandora's box; but he had given me the box, himself, knowing I must learn the secret. I had played a game in which every move was governed by a destiny as oppressive and omnipotent as himself, since that destiny was himself; and I had lost. Lost at that charade of innocence and vice in which he had engaged me. Lost, as the victim loses to the executioner.\n\nHis hand brushed my breast, beneath the sheet. I strained my nerves yet could not help but flinch from the intimate touch, for it made me think of the piercing embrace of the Iron Maiden and of his lost lovers in the vault. When he saw my reluctance, his eyes veiled over and yet his appetite did not diminish. His tongue ran over red lips already wet. Silent, mysterious, he moved away from me to draw off his jacket. He took the gold watch from his waistcoat and laid it on the dressing table, like a good bourgeois; scooped out his raiding loose change and now--oh God!--makes a great play of patting his pockets officiously, puzzled lips pursed, searching for something that has been mislaid. Then turns to me with a ghastly, a triumphant smile.\n\n'But of course! I gave the keys to you!'\n\n'Your keys? Why, of course. Here, they're under the pillow; wait a moment--what--Ah! No ... now, where can I have left them? I was whiling away the evening without you at the piano, I remember. Of course! The music room!'\n\nBrusquely he flung my n\u00e9glig\u00e9 of antique lace on the bed.\n\n'Go and get them.'\n\n'Now? This moment? Can't it wait until morning, my darling?'\n\nI forced myself to be seductive. I saw myself, pale, pliant as a plant that begs to be trampled underfoot, a dozen vulnerable, appealing girls reflected in as many mirrors, and I saw how he almost failed to resist me. If he had come to me in bed, I would have strangled him, then.\n\nBut he half-snarled: 'No. It won't wait. Now.'\n\nThe unearthly light of dawn filled the room; had only one previous dawn broken upon me in that vile place? And there was nothing for it but to go and fetch the keys from the music stool and pray he would not examine them too closely, pray to God his eyes would fail him, that he might be struck blind.\n\nWhen I came back into the bedroom carrying the bunch of keys that jangled at every step like a curious musical instrument, he was sitting on the bed in his immaculate shirtsleeves, his head sunk in his hands.\n\nAnd it seemed to me he was in despair.\n\nStrange. In spite of my fear of him, that made me whiter than my wrap, I felt there emanate from him, at that moment, a stench of absolute despair, rank and ghastly, as if the lilies that surrounded him had all at once begun to fester, or the Russian leather of his scent were reverting to the elements of flayed hide and excrement of which it was composed. The chthonic gravity of his presence exerted a tremendous pressure on the room, so that the blood pounded in my ears as if we had been precipitated to the bottom of the sea, beneath the waves that pounded against the shore.\n\nI held my life in my hands amongst those keys and, in a moment, would place it between his well-manicured fingers. The evidence of that bloody chamber had showed me I could expect no mercy. Yet, when he raised his head and stared at me with his blind, shuttered eyes as though he did not recognize me, I felt a terrified pity for him, for this man who lived in such strange, secret places that, if I loved him enough to follow him, I should have to die.\n\nThe atrocious loneliness of that monster!\n\nThe monocle had fallen from his face. His curling mane was disordered, as if he had run his hands through it in his distraction. I saw how he had lost his impassivity and was now filled with suppressed excitement. The hand he stretched out for those counters in his game of love and death shook a little; the face that turned towards me contained a sombre delirium that seemed to me compounded of a ghastly, yes, shame but also of a terrible, guilty joy as he slowly ascertained how I had sinned.\n\nThat tell-tale stain had resolved itself into a mark the shape and brilliance of the heart on a playing card. He disengaged the key from the ring and looked at it for a while, solitary, brooding.\n\n'It is the key that leads to the kingdom of the unimaginable,' he said. His voice was low and had in it the timbre of certain great cathedral organs that seem, when they are played, to be conversing with God.\n\nI could not restrain a sob.\n\n'Oh, my love, my little love who brought me a white gift of music,' he said, almost as if grieving. 'My little love, you'll never know how much I hate daylight!\"\n\nThen he sharply ordered: 'Kneel!'\n\nI knelt before him and he pressed the key lightly to my forehead, held it there for a moment. I felt a faint tingling of the skin and, when I involuntarily glanced at myself in the mirror, I saw the heart-shaped stain had transferred itself to my forehead, to the space between the eyebrows, like the caste mark of a brahmin woman. Or the mark of Cain. And now the key gleamed as freshly as if it had just been cut. He clipped it back on the ring, emitting that same, heavy sigh as he had done when I said that I would marry him.\n\n'My virgin of the arpeggios, prepare yourself for martyrdom.'\n\n'What form shall it take?' I said.\n\n'Decapitation,' he whispered, almost voluptuously. 'Go and bathe yourself; put on that white dress you wore to hear Tristan and the necklace that prefigures your end. And I shall take myself off to the armoury, my dear, to sharpen my great-grandfather's ceremonial sword.'\n\n'The servants?'\n\n'We shall have absolute privacy for our last rites; I have already dismissed them. If you look out of the window you can see them going to the mainland.'\n\nIt was now the full, pale light of morning; the weather was grey, indeterminate, the sea had an oily, sinister look, a gloomy day on which to die. Along the causeway I could see trouping every maid and scullion, every pot-boy and pan-scourer, valet, laundress and vassal who worked in that great house, most on foot, a few on bicycles. The faceless housekeeper trudged along with a great basket in which, I guessed, she'd stowed as much as she could ransack from the larder. The Marquis must have given the chauffeur leave to borrow the motor for the day, for it went last of all, at a stately pace, as though the procession were a cortege and the car already bore my coffin to the mainland for. burial.\n\nBut I knew no good Breton earth would cover me, like a last, faithful lover; I had another fate.\n\n'I have given them all a day's holiday, to celebrate our wedding,' he said. And smiled.\n\nHowever hard I stared at the receding company, I could see no sign of Jean-Yves, our latest servant, hired but the preceding morning.\n\n'Go, now. Bathe yourself; dress yourself. The lustratory ritual and the ceremonial robing; after that, the sacrifice. Wait in the music room until I telephone for you. No, my dear!' And he smiled, as I started, recalling the line was dead.' One may call inside the castle just as much as one pleases; but, outside--never.'\n\nI scrubbed my forehead with the nail brush as I had scrubbed the key but this red mark would not go away, either, no matter what I did, and I knew I should wear it until I died, though that would not be long. Then I went to my dressing room and put on that white muslin shift, costume of a victim of an auto-da-f\u00e9, he had bought me to listen to the Liebestod in. Twelve young women combed out twelve listless sheaves of brown hair in the mirrors; soon, there would be none. The mass of lilies that surrounded me exhaled, now, the odour of their withering. They looked like the trumpets of the angels of death.\n\nOn the dressing table, coiled like a snake about to strike, lay the ruby choker.\n\nAlready almost lifeless, cold at heart, I descended the spiral staircase to the music room but there I found I had not been abandoned.\n\n'I can be of some comfort to you,' the boy said.' Though not much use.'\n\nWe pushed the piano stool in front of the open window so that, for as long as I could, I would be able to smell the ancient, reconciling smell of the sea that, in time, will cleanse everything, scour the old bones white, wash away all the stains. The last little chambermaid had trotted along the causeway long ago and now the tide, fated as I, came tumbling in, the crisp wavelets splashing on the old stones.\n\n'You do not deserve this,' he said.\n\n'Who can say what I deserve or no?' I said. 'I've done nothing; but that may be sufficient reason for condemning me.'\n\n'You disobeyed him,' he said. 'That is sufficient reason for him to punish you.'\n\n'I only did what he knew I would.'\n\n'Like Eve,' he said.\n\nThe telephone rang a shrill imperative. Let it ring. But my lover lifted me up and set me on my feet; I knew I must answer it. The receiver felt heavy as earth.\n\n'The courtyard. Immediately.'\n\nMy lover kissed me, he took my hand. He would come with me if I would lead him. Courage. When I thought of courage, I thought of my mother. Then I saw a muscle in my lover's face quiver.\n\n'Hoofbeats!' he said.\n\nI cast one last, desperate glance from the window and, like a miracle, I saw a horse and rider galloping at a vertiginous speed along the causeway, though the waves crashed, now, high as the horse's fetlocks. A rider, her black skirts tucked up around her waist so she could ride hard and fast, a crazy, magnificent horsewoman in widow's weeds.\n\nAs the telephone rang again.\n\n'Am I to wait all morning?'\n\nEvery moment, my mother drew nearer.\n\n'She will be too late,' Jean-Yves said and yet he could not restrain a note of hope that, though it must be so, yet it might not be so.\n\nThe third, intransigent call.\n\n'Shall I come up to heaven to fetch you down, Saint Cecilia? You wicked woman, do you wish me to compound my crimes by desecrating the marriage bed?'\n\nSo I must go to the courtyard where my husband waited in his London-tailored trousers and the shirt from Turnbull and Asser, beside the mounting block, with, in his hand, the sword which his great-grandfather had presented to the little corporal, in token of surrender to the Republic, before he shot himself. The heavy sword, unsheathed, grey as that November morning, sharp as childbirth, mortal.\n\nWhen my husband saw my companion, he observed: 'Let the blind lead the blind, eh? But does even a youth as besotted as you are think she was truly blind to her own desires when she took my ring? Give it me back, whore.'\n\nThe fires in the opal had all died down. I gladly slipped it from my finger and, even in that dolorous place, my heart was lighter for the lack of it. My husband took it lovingly and lodged it on the tip of his little finger; it would go no further.\n\n'It will serve me for a dozen more fianc\u00e9es,' he said. 'To the block, woman. No--leave the boy; I shall deal with him later, utilizing a less exalted instrument than the one with which I do my wife the honour of her immolation, for do not fear that in death you will be divided.'\n\nSlowly, slowly, one foot before the other, I crossed the cobbles. The longer I dawdled over my execution, the more time it gave the avenging angel to descend ...\n\n'Don't loiter, girl! Do you think I shall lose appetite for the meal if you are so long about serving it? No; I shall grow hungrier, more ravenous with each moment, more cruel ... Run to me, run! I have a place prepared for your exquisite corpse in my display of flesh!'\n\nHe raised the sword and cut bright segments from the air with it, but still I lingered although my hopes, so recently raised, now began to flag. If she is not here by now, her horse must have stumbled on the causeway, have plunged into the sea ... One thing only made me glad; that my lover would not see me die.\n\nMy husband laid my branded forehead on the stone and, as he had done once before, twisted my hair into a rope and drew it away from my neck.\n\n'Such a pretty neck,' he said with what seemed to be a genuine, retrospective tenderness. 'A neck like the stem of a young plant.'\n\nI felt the silken bristle of his beard and the wet touch of his lips as he kissed my nape. And, once again, of my apparel I must retain only my gems; the sharp blade ripped my dress in two and it fell from me. A little green moss, growing in the crevices of the mounting block, would be the last thing I should see in all the world.\n\nThe whizz of that heavy sword.\n\nAnd--a great battering and pounding at the gate, the jangling of the bell, the frenzied neighing of a horse! The unholy silence of the place shattered in an instant. The blade did not descend, the necklace did not sever, my head did not roll. For, for an instant, the beast wavered in his stroke, a sufficient split second of astonished indecision to let me spring upright and dart to the assistance of my lover as he struggled sightlessly with the great bolts that kept her out.\n\nThe Marquis stood transfixed, utterly dazed, at a loss. It must have been as if he had been watching his beloved Tristan for the twelfth, the thirteenth time and Tristan stirred, then leapt from his bier in the last act, announced in a jaunty aria interposed from Verdi that bygones were bygones, crying over spilt milk did nobody any good and, as for himself, he proposed to live happily ever after. The puppet master, open-mouthed, wide-eyed, impotent at the last, saw his dolls break free of their strings, abandon the rituals he had ordained for them since time began and start to live for themselves; the king, aghast, witnesses the revolt of his pawns.\n\nYou never saw such a wild thing as my mother, her hat seized by the winds and blown out to sea so that her hair was her white mane, her black lisle legs exposed to the thigh, her skirts tucked round her waist, one hand on the reins of the rearing horse while the other clasped my father's service revolver and, behind her, the breakers of the savage, indifferent sea, like the witnesses of a furious justice. And my husband stood stock-still, as if she had been Medusa, the sword still raised over his head as in those clockwork tableaux of Bluebeard that you see in glass cases at fairs.\n\nAnd then it was as though a curious child pushed his centime into the slot and set all in motion. The heavy, bearded figure roared out aloud, braying with fury, and, wielding the honourable sword as if it were a matter of death or glory, charged us, all three.\n\nOn her eighteenth birthday, my mother had disposed of a man-eating tiger that had ravaged the villages in the hills north of Hanoi. Now, without a moment's hesitation, she raised my father's gun, took aim and put a single, irreproachable bullet through my husband's head.\n\nWe lead a quiet life, the three of us. I inherited, of course, enormous wealth but we have given most of it away to various charities. The castle is now a school for the blind, though I pray that the children who live there are not haunted by any sad ghosts looking for, crying for, the husband who will never return to the bloody chamber, the contents of which are buried or burned, the door sealed.\n\nI felt I had a right to retain sufficient funds to start a little music school here, on the outskirts of Paris, and we do well enough. Sometimes we can even afford to go to the Op\u00e9ra, though never to sit in a box, of course. We know we are the source of many whisperings and much gossip but the three of us know the truth of it and mere chatter can never harm us. I can only bless the--what shall I call it?--the maternal telepathy that sent my mother running headlong from the telephone to the station after I had called her, that night. I never heard you cry before, she said, by way of explanation. Not when you were happy. And who ever cried because of gold bath taps?\n\nThe night train, the one I had taken; she lay in her berth, sleepless as I had been. When she could not find a taxi at that lonely halt, she borrowed old Dobbin from a bemused farmer, for some internal urgency told her that she must reach me before the incoming tide sealed me away from her for ever. My poor old nurse, left scandalized at home--what? interrupt milord on his honeymoon?--she died soon after. She had taken so much secret pleasure in the fact that her little girl had become a marquise; and now here I was, scarcely a penny the richer, widowed at seventeen in the most dubious circumstances and busily engaged in setting up house with a piano-tuner. Poor thing, she passed away in a sorry state of disillusion! But I do believe my mother loves him as much as I do.\n\nNo paint nor powder, no matter how thick or white, can mask that red mark on my forehead; I am glad he cannot see it--not for fear of his revulsion, since I know he sees me clearly with his heart--but, because it spares my shame.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/605842", "artist_names": "Ray Dalio", "full_title": "Principles by\u00a0Ray\u00a0Dalio", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "id": 605842, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 616558, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1417710608, "path": "/Ray-dalio-principles-annotated", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Ray-dalio-principles-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "song_art_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Principles", "title_with_featured": "Principles", "updated_by_human_at": 1417710608, "url": "https://genius.com/Ray-dalio-principles-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/280827", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "id": 280827, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Ray Dalio", "slug": "Ray-dalio", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Ray-dalio"}, "artist": "Ray Dalio", "lyrics": "Principles LyricsWhat follows are three distinct parts that can be read either independently or as a connected whole. Part 1 is about the purpose and importance of having principles in general, having nothing to do with mine. Part 2 explains my most fundamental life principles that apply to everything I do. Part 3, explains my management principles as they are being lived out at Bridgewater. Since my management principles are simply my most fundamental life principles applied to management, reading Part 2 will help you to better understand Part 3, but it\u2019s not required\u2014you can go directly to Part 3 to see what my management principles are and how Bridgewater has been run. One day I\u2019d like to write a Part 4 on my investment principles. If you are looking to get the most bang for your buck (i.e., understanding for the effort), I suggest that you read Parts 1 and 2, and the beginning of Part 3 (through the Summary and Table of Principles) which will give you nearly the whole picture. It\u2019s only about 55 pages of a normal size book.\n\nAbove all else, I want you to think for yourself\u2014to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true and 3) what to do about it. I want you to do that in a clear-headed thoughtful way, so that you get what you want. I wrote this book to help you do that. I am going to ask only two things of you\u20141) that you be open-minded and 2) that you honestly answer some questions about what you want, what is true and what you want to do about it. If you do these things, I believe that you will get a lot out of this book. If you can\u2019t do these things, you should reflect on why that is, because you probably have discovered one of your greatest impediments to getting what you want out of life.\n\nIntroduction ...... 2\nPart 1: The Importance of Principles ...... 4\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles ...... 6 Part 3: My Management Principles ...... 38\n\nIntroduction\nPrinciples are concepts that can be applied over and over again in similar circumstances as distinct from narrow answers to specific questions. Every game has principles that successful players master to achieve winning results. So does life. Principles are ways of successfully dealing with the laws of nature or the laws of life. Those who understand more of them and understand them well know how to interact with the world more effectively than those who know fewer of them or know them less well. Different principles apply to different aspects of life\u2014e.g., there are \u201cskiing principles\u201d for skiing, \u201cparenting principles\u201d for parenting, \u201cmanagement principles\u201d for managing, \u201cinvestment principles\u201d for investing, etc\u2014and there are over-arching \u201clife principles\u201d that influence our approaches to all things. And, of course, different people subscribe to different principles that they believe work best.\nI am confident that whatever success Bridgewater and I have had has resulted from our operating by certain principles. Creating a great culture, finding the right people, managing them to do great things and solving problems creatively and systematically are challenges faced by all organizations. What differentiates them is how they approach these challenges. The principles laid out in the pages that follow convey our unique ways of doing these things, which are the reasons for our unique results. Bridgewater\u2019s success has resulted from talented people operating by the principles set out here, and it will continue if these or other talented people continue to operate by them. Like getting fit, virtually anyone can do it if they are willing to do what it takes.\n\nWhat is written here is just my understanding of what it takes: my most fundamental life principles, my approach to getting what I want, and my \u201cmanagement principles,\u201d which are based on those foundations. Taken together, these principles are meant to paint a picture of a process for the systematic pursuit of truth and excellence and for the rewards that accompany this pursuit. I put them in writing for people to consider in order to help Bridgewater and the people I care about most.\n\nUntil recently, I didn\u2019t write out these principles because I felt that it was presumptuous for me to tell others what would work best for them. But over time, I saw the people who I cared about most struggling with problems and wanted to help them; I also found that their problems were almost always the result of violating one or more of these principles, and that their problems could be solved by applying these principles. So I began writing down the types of problems and the broken principles that caused them. When I began, I didn\u2019t know how many principles I would end up with but, through this process, I discovered that about 200 principles pretty much cover all the problems.1 I\u2019m sure that I will come up with more as I learn more.\n\nWhen I say that these are my principles, I don\u2019t mean that in a possessive or egotistical way. I just mean that they are explanations of what I personally believe. I believe that the people I work with and care about must think for themselves. I set these principles out and explained the logic behind them so that we can together explore their merits and stress test them. While I am confident that these principles work well because I have thought hard about them, they have worked well for me for many years, and they have stood up to the scrutiny of the hundreds of smart, skeptical people, I also believe that nothing is certain. I believe that the best we can hope for is highly probable. By putting them out there and stress testing them, the probabilities of their being right will increase.\n\n1 Since I learned these principles by encountering reality and reflecting on my encounters, and I am still doing these things, I expect there are more principles to come. So I am still creating this document by throwing various thoughts down when they occur to me, trying to put them in some sensible order and trying to smooth over the bumps. Organizing these principles into a sensible order is a challenge since they relate to each other more like a matrix than as a sequence. To help guide you, I\u2019ve tried to organize them around large themes like building a great culture, managing people well, and creative problem-solving. I will continue these things, so this is an evolving document.\nIntroduction\n\nI also believe that those principles that are most valuable to each of us come from our own encounters with reality and our reflections on these encounters \u2013 not from being taught and simply accepting someone else\u2019s principles. So, I put these out there for you to reflect on when you are encountering your realities, and not for you to blindly follow. What I hope for most is that you and others will carefully consider them and try operating by them as part of your process for discovering what works best for you. Through this exploration, and with their increased usage, not only will they be understood, but they will evolve from \u201cRay\u2019s principles\u201d to \u201cour principles,\u201d and Ray will fade out of the picture in much the same way as memories of one\u2019s ski or tennis instructor fade and people only pay attention to what works.2 So, when digesting each principle, please......ask yourself: \u201cIs it true?\u201d\n\nBefore I discuss the management principles themselves, it\u2019s important for me to articulate my own most fundamental life principles because my management principles are an extension of them.\n\nIn Part 1, I explain what I mean by principles, why I believe they are important, and how they are essential for getting what you want out of life.\n\nPart 2 explains my most fundamental life principles. I describe what I believe are the best ways of interacting with reality to learn what it\u2019s like, and how to most effectively deal with it to get what you want. I also discuss what I believe are the most common traps that people fall into that prevent them from getting what they want, and how people\u2019s lives can be radically better by avoiding them. I wrote this so you can better understand why my other principles are what they are, though you don\u2019t need to read this part to understand the others.\n\nPart 3 is about my management principles. As I have run Bridgewater for more than 35 years, it explains Bridgewater\u2019s approach up till now. It begins at the big-picture, conceptual level, with an explanation of why I believe that any company\u2019s results are primarily determined by its people and its culture. It then drills down into what I believe are the important principles behind creating a great culture, hiring the right people, managing them to achieve excellence, solving problems systematically and making good decisions.\n\nThere are of course lots of other types of principles. For example, I hope to one day write about my investment principles. However, management principles are now what we need most, so here are the ones that I think make sense and have worked for me.\n\nIntroduction\n\ufffc2 While this particular document will always express just what I believe, others will certainly have their own principles, and possibly even their own principles documents, and future managers of Bridgewater will work in their own ways to determine what principles Bridgewater will operate by. At most, this will remain as one reference of principles for people to consider when they are deciding what\u2019s important and how to behave.\nPart 1: The Importance of Principles\nI believe that having principles that work is essential for getting what we want out of life. I also believe that to understand each other we have to understand each other\u2019s principles.3 That is why I believe we need to talk about them.\n\nWe will begin by examining the following questions:\nWhat are principles?\nWhy are principles important?\nWhere do principles come from?\nDo you have principles that you live your life by? What are they? How well do you think they will work, and why?\n\nAnswer all questions with complete honesty, without worrying what I or others might think. That honesty will allow you to be comfortable living with your own principles, and to judge yourself by how consistently you operate by them. If you don\u2019t have many well-thought-out principles, don\u2019t worry. We will get there together, if we remain open-minded.\n\n1) What are principles?\nYour values are what you consider important, literally what you \u201cvalue.\u201d Principles are what allow you to live a life consistent with those values. Principles connect your values to your actions; they are beacons that guide your actions, and help you successfully deal with the laws of reality. It is to your principles that you turn when you face hard choices.\n\n2) Why are principles important?\nAll successful people operate by principles that help them be successful. Without principles, you would be forced to react to circumstances that come at you without considering what you value most and how to make choices to get what you want. This would prevent you from making the most of your life. While operating without principles is bad for individuals, it is even worse for groups of individuals (such as companies) because it leads to people randomly bumping into each other without understanding their own values and how to behave in order to be consistent with those values.\n\n3) Where do principles come from?\nSometimes we forge our own principles and sometimes we accept others\u2019 principles, or holistic packages of principles, such as religion and legal systems. While it isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing to use others\u2019 principles\u2014it\u2019s difficult to come up with your own, and often much wisdom has gone into those already created\u2014adopting pre-packaged principles without much thought exposes you to the risk of inconsistency with your true values. Holding incompatible principles can lead to conflict between values and actions\u2014like the hypocrite who has claims to be of a religion yet behaves counter to its teachings. Your principles need to reflect values you really believe in.\n\nI wish everyone wrote down their principles. I wish I could read and compare the principles of all the people I\u2019m interested in\u2014 Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, people running for political office, people I share my life with, etc. I'd love to know what they value most and what principles they use to get what they want. Imagine how great that would be\u2014e.g. imagine how much valuable fundamental thinking could be harnessed. I hope that my doing this will encourage others to do the same.\nPart 1: The Importance of Principles\n\n4) Do you have principles that you live your life by? What are they?\nYour principles will determine your standards of behavior. When you enter into relationships with other people, your and their principles will determine how you interact. People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don\u2019t will suffer through constant misunderstandings and conflict with one another. Too often in relationships, people\u2019s principles are unclear. Think about the people with whom you are closest. Are their values aligned with yours?\n5) How well do you think they will work, and why?\nThose principles that are most valuable come from our own experiences and our reflections on those experiences. Every time we face hard choices, we refine our principles by asking ourselves difficult questions. For example, when our representatives in Washington are investigating whether various segments of society are behaving ethically, they are simultaneously grappling with questions such as, \u201cShould the government punish people for bad ethics, or should it just write and enforce the laws?\u201d Questions of this kind\u2014in this case, about the nature of government\u2014prompt thoughtful assessments of alternative approaches. These assessments in turn lead to principles that can be applied to similar occasions in the future. As another example, \u201cI won\u2019t steal\u201d can be a principle to which you refer when the choice of whether or not to steal arises. But to be most effective, each principle must be consistent with your values, and this consistency demands that you ask: Why? Is the reason you won\u2019t steal because you feel empathy for your potential victim? Is it because you fear getting caught? By asking such questions, we refine our understanding, and the development of our principles becomes better aligned with our core values. To be successful, you must make correct, tough choices. You must be able to \u201ccut off a leg to save a life,\u201d both on an individual level and, if you lead people, on a group level. And to be a great leader, it is important to remember that you will have to make these choices by understanding and caring for your people, not by following them.\n\nYou have to answer these questions for yourself. What I hope for most is that you will carefully consider the principles we will be exploring in this document and try operating by them, as part of the process of discovering what works best for you. In time, the answers to these questions will evolve from \u201cRay\u2019s principles\u201d to \u201cmy principles,\u201d and \u201cRay\u201d will fade from the picture in much the same way as memories of your ski instructor or basketball coach fade after you have mastered the sport.\n\nSo, as I believe that adopting pre-packaged principles without much thought is risky, I am asking you to join me in thoughtfully discussing the principles that guide how we act. When considering each principle, please ask yourself, \u201cIs it true?\u201d While this particular document will always express just what I believe, other people will certainly have their own principles, and possibly even their own principles documents, and future managers of Bridgewater will work in their own ways to determine what principles Bridgewater will operate by. At most, this will remain as one reference of principles for people to consider when they are deciding what\u2019s important and how to behave.\n\nWhat do you value most deeply?\n\nTime is like a river that will take you forward into encounters with reality that will require you to make decisions. You can\u2019t stop the movement down this river, and you can\u2019t avoid the encounters. You can only approach these encounters in the best way possible.\nThat is what this part is all about.\n\nWhere I\u2019m Coming From\nSince we are all products of our genes and our environments and approach the world with biases, I think it is relevant for me to tell you a bit of my background so that you can know where I\u2019m coming from.\n\nI grew up in a middle-class neighborhood on Long Island, the only son of a jazz musician and a stay-at- home mom. I was a very ordinary kid, and a less-than-ordinary student. I liked playing with my friends\u2014 for example, touch football in the street\u2014and I didn't like the school part of school, partly because I had, and still have, a bad rote memory4 and partly because I couldn\u2019t get excited about forcing myself to remember what others wanted me to remember without understanding what all this work was going to get me. In order to be motivated, I needed to work for what I wanted, not for what other people wanted me to do. And in order to be successful, I needed to figure out for myself how to get what I wanted, not remember the facts I was being told to remember.\n\nOne thing I wanted was spending money. So I had a newspaper route, I mowed lawns, I shoveled the snow off driveways, I washed dishes in a restaurant, and, starting when I was 12 years old, I caddied.\n\nIt was the 1960s. At the time the stock market was booming and everyone was talking about it, especially the people I caddied for. So I started to invest. The first stock I bought was a company called Northeast Airlines, and the only reason I bought it was that it was the only company I had heard of that was trading for less than $5 per share, so I could buy more shares, which I figured was a good thing. It went up a lot. It was about to go broke but another company acquired it, so it tripled. I made money because I was lucky, though I didn\u2019t see it that way then. I figured that this game was easy. After all, with thousands of companies listed in the newspaper, how difficult could it be to find at least one that would go up? By comparison to my other jobs, this way of making money seemed much more fun, a lot easier, and much more lucrative. Of course, it didn\u2019t take me long to lose money in the markets and learn about how difficult it is to be right and the costs of being wrong.\n\nSo what I really wanted to do now was beat the market. I just had to figure out how to do it. The pursuit of this goal taught me:\n1) It isn't easy for me to be confident that my opinions are right. In the markets, you can do a huge amount of work and still be wrong.\n\nRote memory is memory for things that don\u2019t have an intrinsic logic for being what they are, like a random series of numbers, words in a foreign language and people\u2019s names (all of which I have trouble with). On the other hand, I have a great memory for things that make sense in a context. For example, I can tell you what happened in every year in the economy and markets since the mid-1960s and how many things work.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\n2) Bad opinions can be very costly. Most people come up with opinions and there\u2019s no cost to them. Not so in the market. This is why I have learned to be cautious. No matter how hard I work, I really can\u2019t be sure.\n\n3) The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker. To make any money, you have to be right when they\u2019re wrong.\nSo\n1) I worked for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do. For that reason, I never felt that I had to do anything. All the work I ever did was just what I needed to do to get what I wanted. Since I always had the prerogative to not strive for what I wanted, I never felt forced to do anything.\n2) I came up with the best independent opinions I could muster to get what I wanted. For example, when I wanted to make money in the markets, I knew that I had to learn about companies to assess the attractiveness of their stocks. At the time, Fortune magazine had a little tear-out coupon that you could mail in to get the annual reports of any companies on the Fortune 500, for free. So I ordered all the annual reports and worked my way through the most interesting ones and formed opinions5 about which companies were exciting.\n3) I stress-tested my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong.6 I never cared much about others\u2019 conclusions\u2014only for the reasoning that led to these conclusions. That reasoning had to make sense to me. Through this process, I improved my chances of being right, and I learned a lot from a lot of great people.\n4) I remained wary about being overconfident, and I figured out how to effectively deal with my not knowing. I dealt with my not knowing by either continuing to gather information until I reached the point that I could be confident or by eliminating my exposure to the risks of not knowing.7\n5) I wrestled with my realities, reflected on the consequences of my decisions, and learned and improved from this process.\n\nBy doing these things, I learned how important and how liberating it is to think for myself.\nIn a nutshell, this is the whole approach that I believe will work best for you\u2014the best summary of what I want the people who are working with me to do in order to accomplish great things. I want you to work for yourself, to come up with independent opinions, to stress-test them, to be wary about being overconfident, and to reflect on the consequences of your decisions and constantly improve.\n\nAfter I graduated from high school, I went to a local college that I barely got in to. I loved it, unlike high school, because I could learn about things that interested me; I studied because I enjoyed it, not because I had to.\n\n5 The way I learn is to immerse myself in something, which prompts questions, which I answer, prompting more questions, until I reach a conclusion.\n6 This included my retail stockbroker, the people I was caddying for, even my local barber, who was equally engrossed in the stock market. (It wasn\u2019t as precocious as it sounds. At the time, instead of talking about the Yankees, everyone was talking about stocks. That was the world I grew up in.)\n7 Sometimes when I know that I don\u2019t know which way the coin is going to flip, I try to position myself so that it won\u2019t have an impact on me either way. In other words, I don\u2019t make an inadvertent bet. I try to limit my bets to the limited number of things I am confident in.\n\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\nAt that time the Beatles had made a trip to India to learn how to meditate, which triggered my interest, so I learned how to meditate. It helped me think more clearly and creatively, so I\u2019m sure that enhanced my enjoyment of, and success at, learning.8 Unlike in high school, in college I did very well.\n\nAnd of course I continued to trade markets. Around this time I became interested in trading commodities futures, though virtually nobody traded them back then. I was attracted to trading them just because they had low margin requirements so I figured I could make more money by being right (which I planned to be).\n\nBy the time I graduated college, in 1971, I had been admitted to Harvard Business School, where I would go in the fall. That summer between college and HBS I clerked on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. This was the summer of the breakdown of the global monetary system (i.e., the Bretton Woods system). It was one of the most dramatic economic events ever and I was at the epicenter of it, so it thrilled me. It was a currency crisis that drove all market behaviors, so I delved into understanding the currency markets. The currency markets would be important to me for the rest of my life.\n\nThat fall I went to Harvard Business School, which I was excited about because I felt that I had climbed to the top and would be with the best of the best. Despite these high expectations, the place was even better than I expected because the case study method allowed open-ended figuring things out and debating with others to get at the best answers, rather than memorizing facts. I loved the work-hard, play- hard environment.\n\nIn the summer between my two years at HBS, I pursued my interest in trading commodities futures by convincing the Director of Commodities for Merrill Lynch to give me a job as his assistant. At the time, commodities trading was still an obscure thing to do.\n\nIn the fall I went back to HBS, and in that academic year, 1972-73, trading commodities futures became a hot thing to do. That is because the monetary system\u2019s breakdown that occurred in 1971 led to an inflationary surge that sent commodity prices higher. As a result of this, the first oil shock occurred in 1973. As inflation started to surge, the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy to fight it, so stocks went down in the worst bear market since the Great Depression. So, commodities futures trading was hot and stock market investing was not. Naturally, brokerage houses that didn\u2019t have commodities trading departments wanted them, and there was a shortage of people who knew anything about it. Virtually nobody in the commodities futures business had the type of Harvard Business School background that I had. So I was hired as Director of Commodities at a moderate-size brokerage and given an old salt who had lots of commodities brokerage experience to help me set up a commodities division. The bad stock market environment ended up taking this brokerage house down before we could get the commodities futures trading going. I went to a bigger, more successful brokerage, where I was in charge of its institutional/hedging business. But I didn\u2019t fit into the organization well, so I was fired essentially for insubordination.\n\nSo in 1975, after a quick two-year stint on Wall Street after school, I started Bridgewater. Soon after, I got married and began my family.\n\nThrough this time and till now I followed the same basic approach I used as a 12-year-old caddie trying to beat the market, i.e., by 1) working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do; 2) coming up with the best independent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals; 3) stress- testing my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong; 4) being wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing; and 5) wrestling with reality, experiencing the results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could improve.\n8 By the way, I still meditate and I still find it helpful.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\nSince I started Bridgewater, I have gained a lot more experience that taught me a lot more, mostly by making mistakes and learning from them. Most importantly:\n\nI learned that failure is by and large due to not accepting and successfully dealing with the realities of life, and that achieving success is simply a matter of accepting and successfully dealing with all my realities.\n\nI learned that finding out what is true, regardless of what that is, including all the stuff most people think is bad\u2014like mistakes and personal weaknesses\u2014is good because I can then deal with these things so that they don\u2019t stand in my way.\n\nI learned that there is nothing to fear from truth. While some truths can be scary\u2014for example, finding out that you have a deadly disease\u2014knowing them allows us to deal with them better. Being truthful, and letting others be completely truthful, allows me and others to fully explore our thoughts and exposes us to the feedback that is essential for our learning.\n\nI learned that being truthful was an extension of my freedom to be me. I believe that people who are one way on the inside and believe that they need to be another way outside to please others become conflicted and often lose touch with what they really think and feel. It\u2019s difficult for them to be happy and almost impossible for them to be at their best. I know that\u2019s true for me.\n\nI learned that I want the people I deal with to say what they really believe and to listen to what others say in reply, in order to find out what is true. I learned that one of the greatest sources of problems in our society arises from people having loads of wrong theories in their heads\u2014often theories that are critical of others\u2014that they won\u2019t test by speaking to the relevant people about them. Instead, they talk behind people\u2019s backs, which leads to pervasive misinformation. I learned to hate this because I could see that making judgments about people so that they are tried and sentenced in your head, without asking them for their perspective, is both unethical and unproductive.9 So I learned to love real integrity (saying the same things as one believes)10 and to despise the lack of it.11\n\nI learned that everyone makes mistakes and has weaknesses and that one of the most important things that differentiates people is their approach to handling them. I learned that there is an incredible beauty to mistakes, because embedded in each mistake is a puzzle, and a gem that I could get if I solved it, i.e., a principle that I could use to reduce my mistakes in the future. I learned that each mistake was probably a reflection of something that I was (or others were) doing wrong, so if I could figure out what that was, I could learn how to be more effective. I learned that wrestling with my problems, mistakes, and weaknesses was the training that strengthened me. Also, I learned that it was the pain of this wrestling that made me and those around me appreciate our successes.12\n\n9 It is unethical because a basic principle of justice is that everyone has the right to face his accuser. And it is unproductive because it does not lead to the exploration of \u201cIs it true?\u201d which can lead to understanding and improvement.\n10 I do not mean that you should say everything you think, just that what you do say matches your thoughts.\n11 The word \u201cintegrity\u201d is from the Latin root \u201cinteger,\u201d which means \u201cone\u201d i.e., that you are the same inside and out. Most people would be insulted if you told them that they don't have integrity\u2014but how many people do you know who tell people what they really think?\n12 I believe that our society's \u201cmistakephobia\u201d is crippling, a problem that begins in most elementary schools, where we learn to learn what we are taught rather than to form our own goals and to figure out how to achieve them. We are fed with facts and tested and those who make the fewest mistakes are considered to be the smart ones, so we learn that it is embarrassing to not know and to make mistakes. Our education system spends virtually no time on how to learn from mistakes, yet this is critical to real learning. As a result, school typically doesn\u2019t prepare young people for real life\u2014unless their lives are spent following instructions and pleasing others. In my opinion, that\u2019s why so many students who succeed in school fail in life.\n\nI learned that the popular picture of success\u2014which is like a glossy photo of an ideal man or woman out of a Ralph Lauren catalog, with a bio attached listing all of their accomplishments like going to the best prep schools and an Ivy League college, and getting all the answers right on tests\u2014is an inaccurate picture of the typical successful person. I met a number of great people and learned that none of them were born great\u2014they all made lots of mistakes and had lots weaknesses\u2014and that great people become great by looking at their mistakes and weaknesses and figuring out how to get around them. So I learned that the people who make the most of the process of encountering reality, especially the painful obstacles, learn the most and get what they want faster than people who do not. I learned that they are the great ones\u2014the ones I wanted to have around me.\n\nIn short, I learned that being totally truthful, especially about mistakes and weaknesses, led to a rapid rate of improvement and movement toward what I wanted.\n\nWhile this approach worked great for me, I found it more opposite than similar to most others\u2019 approaches, which has produced communications challenges.\n\nSpecifically, I found that:\nWhile most others seem to believe that learning what we are taught is the path to success, I believe that figuring out for yourself what you want and how to get it is a better path.13\nWhile most others seem to believe that having answers is better than having questions, I believe that having questions is better than having answers because it leads to more learning.14\nWhile most others seem to believe that mistakes are bad things, I believe mistakes are good things because I believe that most learning comes via making mistakes and reflecting on them.\nWhile most others seem to believe that finding out about one\u2019s weaknesses is a bad thing, I believe that it is a good thing because it is the first step toward finding out what to do about them and not letting them stand in your way.\nWhile most others seem to believe that pain is bad, I believe that pain is required to become stronger.15\n\nOne of the advantages of my being over 60 years old\u2014and there aren\u2019t many\u2014is that we can look back on my story to see how I came by these beliefs and how they have worked for me. It is now more than 35 years after I started Bridgewater and about the same number of years since I got married and began my family. I am obviously not your Ralph Lauren poster child for success, yet I\u2019ve had a lot of successes, though they\u2019re probably not what you\u2019re thinking.\n\nYes, I started Bridgewater from scratch, and now it\u2019s a uniquely successful company and I am on the Forbes 400 list. But these results were never my goals\u2014they were just residual outcomes\u2014so my getting them can\u2019t be indications of my success. And, quite frankly, I never found them very rewarding.16\n\n13 After all, isn\u2019t the point of learning to help you get what you want? So don\u2019t you have to start with what you want and figure out what you have to learn in order to get it?\n14 In fact I believe that most people who are quick to come up with answers simply haven\u2019t thought about all the ways that they can be wrong.\n15 I don\u2019t mean that the more pain the better. I believe that too much pain can break someone and that the absence of pain typically prevents growth so that one should accept the amount of pain that is consistent with achieving one\u2019s objectives.\n16 I have been very lucky because I have had the opportunity to see what it\u2019s like to have little or no money and what it\u2019s like to have a lot of it. I\u2019m lucky because people make such a big deal of it and, if I didn\u2019t experience both, I wouldn\u2019t be able to know how important it really is for me. I can\u2019t comment on what having a lot of money means to others, but I do know that for me, having a lot more money isn\u2019t a lot better than having enough to cover the basics. That\u2019s because, for me, the best things in life\u2014meaningful work, meaningful relationships, interesting experiences, good food, sleep, music, ideas, sex, and other basic needs and pleasures\u2014 are not, past a certain point, materially improved upon by having a lot of money. For me, money has always been very important to\n\nWhat I wanted was to have an interesting, diverse life filled with lots of learning\u2014and especially meaningful work and meaningful relationships. I feel that I have gotten these in abundance and I am happy. And I feel that I got what I wanted by following the same basic approach I used as a 12-year-old caddie trying to beat the market, i.e., by 1) working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do; 2) coming up with the best independent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals; 3) stress- testing my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong; 4) being wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing; and 5) wrestling with reality, experiencing the results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could improve. I believe that by following this approach I moved faster to my goals by learning a lot more than if I hadn\u2019t followed it.\n\nHere are the most important principles that I learned along the way.\n\nMy Most Fundamental Principles\nIn pursuing my goals I encountered realities, often in the form of problems, and I had to make decisions. I found that if I accepted the realities rather than wished that they didn\u2019t exist and if I learned how to work with them rather than fight them, I could figure out how to get to my goals. It might take repeated tries, and seeking the input of others, but I could eventually get there. As a result, I have become someone who believes that we need to deeply understand, accept, and work with reality in order to get what we want out of life. Whether it is knowing how people really think and behave when dealing with them, or how things really work on a material level\u2014so that if we do X then Y will happen\u2014understanding reality gives us the power to get what we want out of life, or at least to dramatically improve our odds of success. In other words, I have become a \u201chyperrealist.\u201d\n\nWhen I say I\u2019m a hyperrealist, people sometimes think I don\u2019t believe in making dreams happen. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. In fact, I believe that without pursuing dreams, life is mundane. I am just saying that I believe hyperrealism is the best way to choose and achieve one\u2019s dreams. The people who really change the world are the ones who see what\u2019s possible and figure out how to make that happen. I believe that dreamers who simply imagine things that would be nice but are not possible don\u2019t sufficiently appreciate the laws of the universe to understand the true implications of their desires, much less how to achieve them.\n\nLet me explain what I mean.\nI believe there are an infinite number of laws of the universe and that all progress or dreams achieved come from operating in a way that\u2019s consistent with them. These laws and the principles of how to operate in harmony with them have always existed. We were given these laws by nature. Man didn\u2019t and can\u2019t make them up. He can only hope to understand them and use them to get what he wants. For example, the ability to fly or to send cellular phone signals imperceptibly and instantaneously around the world or any other new and beneficial developments resulted from understanding and using previously existing laws of the universe. These inventions did not come from people who were not well-grounded in the point that I could have these basics covered and never very important beyond that. That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t think that having more is good\u2013it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. So, while I spend money on some very expensive things that cost multiples relative to the more fundamental things, these expensive things have never brought me much enjoyment relative to the much cheaper, more fundamental things. They were just like cherries on the cake. For my tastes, if I had to choose, I\u2019d rather be a backpacker who is exploring the world with little money than a big income earner who is in a job I don\u2019t enjoy. (Though being in a job that provides me with what I want is best of all, for me). Also, from having come from having next-to-nothing to having a lot, I have developed a strong belief that, all things being equal, offering equal opportunity is fundamental to being good, while handing out money to capable people that weakens their need to get stronger and contribute to society is bad.\n\nreality.17 The same is true for economic, political, and social systems that work. Success is achieved by people who deeply understand reality and know how to use it to get what they want. The converse is also true: idealists who are not well-grounded in reality create problems, not progress. For example, communism was a system created by people with good intentions who failed to recognize that their idealistic system was inconsistent with human nature. As a result, they caused more harm than good.\n\nThis brings me to my most fundamental principle:\nTruth\n\u2014more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality\u2014 is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.\n\nWhile I spend the most time studying how the realities that affect me most work\u2014i.e., those that drive the markets and the people I deal with\u2014I also love to study nature to try to figure out how it works because, to me, nature is both beautiful and practical.\n\nIts perfection and brilliance staggers me. When I think about all the flying machines, swimming machines, and billions of other systems that nature created, from the microscopic level to the cosmic level, and how they interact with one another to make a workable whole that evolves through time and through multi- dimensions, my breath is taken away. It seems to me that, in relation to nature, man has the intelligence of a mold growing on an apple\u2014man can\u2019t even make a mosquito, let alone scratch the surface of understanding the universe.\n\nThough how nature works is way beyond man\u2019s ability to comprehend, I have found that observing how nature works offers innumerable lessons that can help us understand the realities that affect us. That is because, though man is unique, he is part of nature and subject to most of the same laws of nature that affect other species.\n\nFor example, I have found that by looking at what is rewarded and punished, and why, universally\u2014i.e., in nature as well as in humanity\u2014I have been able to learn more about what is \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d than by listening to most people\u2019s views about good and bad. It seems to me that what most people call \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d typically reflects their particular group\u2019s preferences: the Taliban\u2019s definitions are different than Americans\u2019, which are different than others\u2019\u2014and within each group there are differences and they are intended to paint a picture of the world the way they\u2019d like it to be rather than the way it really is. So there are many different takes on what is good and bad that each group uses to call others \u201cbad\u201d and themselves \u201cgood,\u201d some of which are practical and others of which are impractical. Yet all of them, and everything else, are subject to the same laws of nature\u2013i.e., I believe that we all get rewarded and punished according to whether we operate in harmony or in conflict with nature\u2019s laws, and that all societies will succeed or fail in the degrees that they operate consistently with these laws.\n\nThis perspective gives me a non-traditional sense of good and bad: \u201cgood,\u201d to me, means operating consistently with the natural laws, while \u201cbad\u201d means operating inconsistently with these laws. In other words, for something to be \u201cgood\u201d it must be grounded in reality. And if something is in conflict with reality\u2014for example, if morality is in conflict with reality\u2014it is \u201cbad,\u201d i.e., it will not produce good outcomes.\n\nIn other words, I believe that understanding what is good is obtained by looking at the way the world works and figuring out how to operate in harmony with it to help it (and yourself) evolve. But it is not obvious, and it is sometimes difficult to accept.\n\n17 I recognize that sometimes a discovery is made by accident, but the discovery is of some basic underlying principle that creates understanding of a cause-effect relationship that leads to a desired result.\n\nFor example, when a pack of hyenas takes down a young wildebeest, is this good or bad? At face value, this seems terrible; the poor wildebeest suffers and dies. Some people might even say that the hyenas are evil. Yet this type of apparently evil behavior exists throughout nature through all species and was created by nature, which is much smarter than I am, so before I jump to pronouncing it evil, I need to try to see if it might be good. When I think about it, like death itself, this behavior is integral to the enormously complex and efficient system that has worked for as long as there has been life. And when I think of the second- and third-order consequences, it becomes obvious that this behavior is good for both the hyenas, who are operating in their self-interest, and in the interests of the greater system, which includes the wildebeest, because killing and eating the wildebeest fosters evolution, i.e., the natural process of improvement. In fact, if I changed anything about the way that dynamic works, the overall outcome would be worse.\n\nI believe that evolution, which is the natural movement toward better adaptation, is the greatest single force in the universe, and that it is good.18 It affects the changes of everything from all species to the entire solar system. It is good because evolution is the process of adaptation that leads to improvement. So, based on how I observe both nature and humanity working, I believe that what is bad and most punished are those things that don\u2019t work because they are at odds with the laws of the universe and they impede evolution.\n\nI believe that the desire to evolve, i.e., to get better, is probably humanity\u2019s most pervasive driving force. Enjoying your job, a craft, or your favorite sport comes from the innate satisfaction of getting better. Though most people typically think that they are striving to get things (e.g., toys, better houses, money, status, etc.) that will make them happy, that is not usually the case. Instead, when we get the things we are striving for, we rarely remain satisfied.19 It is natural for us to seek other things or to seek to make the things we have better. In the process of this seeking, we continue to evolve and we contribute to the evolution of all that we have contact with. The things we are striving for are just the bait to get us to chase after them in order to make us evolve, and it is the evolution and not the reward itself that matters to us and those around us.\n\nIt is natural that it should be this way\u2014i.e., that our lives are not satisfied by obtaining our goals rather than by striving for them\u2014because of the law of diminishing returns.20 For example, suppose making a lot of money is your goal and suppose you make enough so that making more has no marginal utility. Then it would be foolish to continue to have making money be your goal. People who acquire things beyond their usefulness not only will derive little or no marginal gains from these acquisitions, but they also will experience negative consequences, as with any form of gluttony. So, because of the law of diminishing returns, it is only natural that seeking something new, or seeking new depths of something old, is required to bring us satisfaction.\n\nIn other words, the sequence of 1) seeking new things (goals); 2) working and learning in the process of pursuing these goals; 3) obtaining these goals; and 4) then doing this over and over again is the personal evolutionary process that fulfills most of us and moves society forward.\n\nI believe that pursuing self-interest in harmony with the laws of the universe and contributing to evolution is universally rewarded, and what I call \u201cgood.\u201d Look at all species in action: they are constantly pursuing their own interests and helping evolution in a symbiotic way, with most of them not even knowing that their self-serving behaviors are contributing to evolution. Like the hyenas attacking the wildebeest, successful people might not even know if or how their pursuit of self-interest helps evolution, but it typically does.21\n\n18 In fact, it appears to me that everything other than evolution eventually disintegrates and that we all are, and everything else is, vehicles for evolution.\n19 Of course, we are often satisfied with the same things \u2013 relationships, careers, etc.\u2014but when that is the case, it is typically because we are getting new enjoyments from the new dimensions of these things.\n20 The marginal benefits of moving from a shortage to an abundance of anything decline. 21 When pursuing self-interest is in conflict with evolution, it is typically punished.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\nSelf-interest and society\u2019s interests are generally symbiotic: more than anything else, it is pursuit of self- interest that motivates people to push themselves to do the difficult things that benefit them and that contribute to society. In return, society rewards those who give it what it wants. That is why how much money people have earned is a rough measure of how much they gave society what it wanted\u2014NOT how much they desired to make money. Look at what caused people to make a lot of money and you will see that usually it is in proportion to their production of what the society wanted and largely unrelated to their desire to make money. There are many people who have made a lot of money who never made making a lot of money their primary goal. Instead, they simply engaged in the work that they were doing, produced what society wanted, and got rich doing it.22 And there are many people who really wanted to make a lot of money but never produced what the society wanted and they didn\u2019t make a lot of money. In other words, there is an excellent correlation between giving society what it wants and making money, and almost no correlation between the desire to make money and how much money one makes. I know that this is true for me\u2014i.e., I never worked to make a lot of money, and if I had I would have stopped ages ago because of the law of diminishing returns. I know that the same is true for all the successful, healthy (i.e., non-obsessed) people I know.23\n\nThis process of productive adaptation\u2014i.e., the process of seeking, obtaining, and pursuing new goals\u2014 does not just pertain to how individuals and society move forward. It is equally relevant when dealing with setbacks, which are inevitable. That is why many people who have had setbacks that seemed devastating at the time ended up as happy as (or even happier than) they were before, once they successfully adapted to them. The faster that one appropriately adapts, the better. As Darwin described, adaptation\u2014i.e., adjusting appropriately to changes in one\u2019s circumstances\u2014is a big part of the evolutionary process, and it is rewarded.24 That is why some of the most successful people are typically those who see the changing landscape and identify how to best adapt to it.25\n\nSo, it seems to me that desires to evolve are universal and so are symbiotic relationships that lead to the evolution of the whole to occur via the pursuit of individuals\u2019 self-interests. However, what differentiates man from other species is man\u2019s greater ability to learn. Because we can learn, we can evolve more and faster than other species.\n\nI also believe that all things in nature have innate attributes that are both good and bad, with their goodness and their badness depending on what they are used for. For example, the thorns on a rose bush, the stinger on a bee, the aggressiveness of a lion, the timidity of a gazelle are all both good and bad, depending on their applications. Over time, nature evolves toward the right balance through the process of natural selection\u2014e.g., an overly aggressive animal will die prematurely, as will an overly timid animal. However, because man has the ability to look at himself and direct his own change, individuals have the capacity to evolve.\n\nMost of us are born with attributes that both help us and hurt us, depending on their applications, and the more extreme the attribute, the more extreme the potential good and bad outcomes these attributes are likely to produce. For example, highly creative, goal-oriented people who are good at imagining the big picture often can easily get tripped up on the details of daily life, while highly pragmatic, task-oriented people who are great with the details might not be creative. That is because the ways their minds work make it difficult for them to see both ways of thinking. In nature everything was made for a purpose, and so too were these different ways of thinking. They just have different purposes. It is extremely important\n\n22 Of course, there are many people who give society what it wants but are paid poorly. This is explained by the law of supply and demand.\n23 I do know some successful people who are obsessed with making money despite making money having little or no marginal benefit for them.\n24 Darwin is reported to have said, \u201cIt is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.\u201d\n25 Your ability to see the changing landscape and adapt is more a function of your perceptive and reasoning abilities than your ability to learn and process quickly.\n\nto one\u2019s happiness and success to know oneself\u2014most importantly to understand one\u2019s own values and abilities\u2014and then to find the right fits. We all have things that we value that we want and we all have strengths and weaknesses that affect our paths for getting them. The most important quality that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful people is our capacity to learn and adapt to these things.\n\nUnlike any other species, man is capable of reflecting on himself and the things around him to learn and adapt in order to improve. He has this capability because, in the evolution of species man\u2019s brain developed a part that no other species has\u2014the prefrontal cortex. It is the part of the human brain that gives us the ability to reflect and conduct other cognitive thinking. Because of this, people who can objectively reflect on themselves and others \u2014most importantly on their weaknesses are\u2014can figure out how to get around these weaknesses, can evolve fastest and come closer to realizing their potentials than those who can\u2019t.\n\nHowever, typically defensive, emotional reactions\u2014i.e., ego barriers\u2014stand in the way of this progress. These reactions take place in the part of the brain called the amygdala. As a result of them, most people don\u2019t like reflecting on their weaknesses even though recognizing them is an essential step toward preventing them from causing them problems. Most people especially dislike others exploring their weaknesses because it makes them feel attacked, which produces fight or flight reactions; however, having others help one find one\u2019s weaknesses is essential because it\u2019s very difficult to identify one\u2019s own. Most people don\u2019t like helping others explore their weaknesses, even though they are willing to talk about them behind their backs. For these reasons most people don\u2019t do a good job of understanding themselves and adapting in order to get what they want most out of life. In my opinion, that is the biggest single problem of mankind because it, more than anything else, impedes people\u2019s abilities to address all other problems and it is probably the greatest source of pain for most people.\n\nSome people get over the ego barrier and others don\u2019t. Which path they choose, more than anything else, determines how good their outcomes are. Aristotle defined tragedy as a bad outcome for a person because of a fatal flaw that he can\u2019t get around. So it is tragic when people let ego barriers lead them to experience bad outcomes.\n\nThe Personal Evolutionary Process\nAs I mentioned before, I believe that life consists of an enormous number of choices that come at us and that each decision we make has consequences, so the quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make.\n\nWe aren\u2019t born with the ability to make good decisions; we learn it.26 We all start off as children with others, typically parents, directing us. But, as we get older, we increasingly make our own choices. We choose what we are going after (i.e., our goals), which influences our directions. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you go to med school; if you want to have a family, you find a mate; and so on. As we move toward our goals, we encounter problems, make mistakes, and run into personal weaknesses. Above all else, how we choose to approach these impediments determines how fast we move toward our goals.\n\nI believe that the way we make our dreams into reality is by constantly engaging with reality in pursuit of our dreams and by using these encounters to learn more about reality itself and how to interact with it in\n\n26 Of course it is true that people are born with differences in their various innate abilities. However, judgment is primarily learned.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\norder to get what we want\u2014and that if we do this with determination, we almost certainly will be successful. In short:\n\nReality\n+ Dreams\n+ Determination =\nA Successful Life\n\nSo what is success? I believe that it is nothing more than getting what you want\u2014and that it is up to you to decide what that is for you. I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s being a master of the universe, a couch potato, or anything else\u2014I really don\u2019t. What is essential is that you are clear about what you want and that you figure out how to get it.\n\nHowever, there are a few common things that most people want.\nAs I mentioned, for most people success is evolving as effectively as possible, i.e., learning about oneself and one\u2019s environment and then changing to improve. Personally, I believe that personal evolution is both the greatest accomplishment and the greatest reward.\n\nAlso, for most people happiness is much more determined by how things turn out relative to their expectations rather than the absolute level of their conditions. For example, if a billionaire loses $200 million he will probably be unhappy, while if someone who is worth $10 thousand unexpectedly gets another $2 thousand, he will probably be happy. This basic principle suggests that you can follow one of two paths to happiness: 1) have high expectations and strive to exceed them, or 2) lower your expectations so that they are at or below your conditions. Most of us choose the first path, which means that to be happy we have to keep evolving.\n\nAnother principle to keep in mind is that people need meaningful work and meaningful relationships in order to be fulfilled.27 I have observed this to be true for virtually everyone, and I know that it\u2019s true for me.28\n\nRegardless of others\u2019 principles, you will need to decide for yourself what you want and go after it in the best way for you.\n\nYour Most Important Choices\nAs I mentioned, as we head toward our goals we encounter an enormous number of choices that come at us, and each decision we make has consequences. So, the quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make. We literally make millions of decisions that add up to the consequences that are our lives.\n\nOf these millions, I believe that there are five big types of choices that we continually must make that radically affect the quality of our lives and the rates at which we move toward what we want. Choosing\n\n27 As Freud put it, \u201cLove and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.\u201d\n28 The work doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a job, though I believe it\u2019s generally better if it is a job. It can be any kind of long-term challenge that leads to personal improvement. As you might have guessed, I believe that the need to have meaningful work is connected to man\u2019s innate desire to improve. And relationships are the natural connections to others that make us relevant to society.\n\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\nwell is not dependent on our innate abilities such as intelligence or creativity, but more on what I think of as character. For this reason, I believe that most people can make the right choices.\nThe following five decision trees show these choices. I believe that those who don\u2019t move effectively to their goals do the things on the top branches, and those who do move to them most quickly do the things on the bottom branches.\nFirst:\nIt is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one\u2019s limits, which is painful, in order to gain strength\u2014whether it\u2019s in the form of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in any other way. Nature gave us pain as a messaging device to tell us that we are approaching, or that we have exceeded, our limits in some way. At the same time, nature made the process of getting stronger require us to push our limits. Gaining strength is the adaptation process of the body and the mind to encountering one\u2019s limits, which is painful. In other words, both pain and strength typically result from encountering one\u2019s barriers. When we encounter pain, we are at an important juncture in our decision- making process.\nMost people react to pain badly. They have \u201cfight or flight\u201d reactions to it: they either strike out at whatever brought them the pain or they try to run away from it. As a result, they don\u2019t learn to find ways around their barriers, so they encounter them over and over again and make little or no progress toward what they want.29\nThose who react well to pain that stands in the way of getting to their goals\u2014those who understand what is causing it and how to deal with it so that it can be disposed of as a barrier\u2014gain strength and satisfaction. This is because most learning comes from making mistakes, reflecting on the causes of the mistakes, and learning what to do differently in the future. Believe it or not, you are lucky to feel the pain if you approach it correctly, because it will signal that you need to find solutions and to progress. Since the only way you are going to find solutions to painful problems is by thinking deeply about them\u2014i.e., reflecting30\u2014if you can develop a knee-jerk reaction to pain that is to reflect rather than to fight or flee, it will lead to your rapid learning/evolving.31\n29 There are literally two different parts of each person\u2019s brain that influence these reactions: the pre-frontal cortex and the amygdala. They work as though they were two different brains that fight for control of decision-making. The pre-frontal cortex is the logical part of the brain that evaluates choices logically and the amygdala is the \u201canimal instinct\u201d part of the brain that triggers emotional reactions like the instinct to fight or flee. When faced with an obstacle or threat, an emotional reaction (e.g. pain) can be triggered that can lead to a fight or flight reaction that \u201chijacks\u201d decision making away from the pre-frontal cortex, where the rational choices are being made. This can result in our making decisions that produce consequences that we do not want. This typically causes really big problems.\n30 Your very unique power of reflectiveness\u2014i.e., your ability to look at yourself, the world around you, and the relationship between you and the world\u2014means that you can think deeply and weigh subtle things to come up with learning and wise choices. Asking other believable people about the root causes of your pain in order to enhance your reflections is also typically very helpful\u2014 especially others who have opposing views and who share your interest in finding the truth rather than being proven right.\n31 If you can reflect deeply about your problems, they almost always shrink or disappear, because you almost always find a better way of dealing with them than if you don\u2019t face them head on. The more difficult the problem, the more important it is that you think\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\nSo, please remember that:\nSecond:\nPain + Reflection = Progress\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow big of an impediment is psychological pain to your progress?\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcPeople who confuse what they wish were true with what is really true create distorted pictures of reality that make it impossible for them to make the best choices. They typically do this because facing \u201charsh realities\u201d can be very difficult. However, by not facing these harsh realities, they don\u2019t find ways of properly dealing with them. And because their decisions are not based in reality, they can\u2019t anticipate the consequences of their decisions.32\nIn contrast, people who know that understanding what is real is the first step toward optimally dealing with it make better decisions.\nSo, remember...\n...because knowing what is true is good.\nAsk yourself, \u201cIs it true?\u201d\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow much do you let what you wish to be true stand in the way of seeing what is really true?\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffchard about it and deal with it. After seeing how effectively facing reality\u2014especially your problems, mistakes and weaknesses\u2014 works, I believe you will become comfortable with it and won\u2019t want to operate any other way.\n32 An example of this is what discussed earlier: wanting to save the wildebeest from the hyenas. When you don\u2019t want to face what\u2019s really happening, you can\u2019t make sound decisions.\n\nThird:\nPeople who worry about looking good typically hide what they don\u2019t know and hide their weaknesses, so they never learn how to properly deal with them and these weaknesses remain impediments in the future.33 These people typically try to prove that they have the answers, even when they really don\u2019t. Why do they behave in this unproductive way? They typically believe the senseless but common view that great people are those who have the answers in their heads and don\u2019t have weaknesses. Not only does this view not square with reality, but it also stands in the way of progress.\nI have never met a great person who did not earn and learn their greatness.34 They have weaknesses like everyone else\u2014they have just learned how to deal with them so that they aren\u2019t impediments to getting what they want. In addition, the amounts of knowledge and the capabilities that anyone does not have, and that could be used to make the best possible decisions, are vastly greater than that which anyone (no matter how great) could have within them.35\nThis explains why people who are interested in making the best possible decisions rarely are confident that they have the best possible answers. So they seek to learn more (often by exploring the thinking of other believable people, especially those who disagree with them) and they are eager to identify their weaknesses so that they don\u2019t let these weaknesses stand in the way of them achieving their goals.\nSo, what are your biggest weaknesses? Think honestly about them because if you can identify them, you are on the first step toward accelerating your movement forward. So think about them, write them down, and look at them frequently.\nOne of my biggest weaknesses is my poor rote memory: I have trouble remembering things that don\u2019t have reasons for being what they are, such as names, phone numbers, spelling, and addresses. Also, I am terrible at doing tasks that require little or no logic, especially if I have to do them repeatedly. On the other hand, I have a great contextual memory and good logic, and I can devote myself to things that interest me for untold hours. I don\u2019t know how much of what I am bad at is just the other side of what I am good at\u2014i.e., how much of what I am good at is due to my brain working in a certain way that, when applied to certain tasks, does well and when applied to others does poorly\u2014and how much of what I am good at was developed in order to help compensate for what I am bad at. But I do know that I have created compensating approaches so that what I am bad at doesn\u2019t hurt me much; e.g., I surround myself\n33 For example, if you are dumb or ugly, you are unlikely to acknowledge it, even though doing so would help you better deal with that reality. Recognizing such \u201charsh realities\u201d is both very painful and very productive.\n34 I am not saying that we all have the same potential, just that to get the most of your potential\u2014whatever that is\u2014you must learn and earn.\n35 As I mentioned in the first chapter, you don\u2019t have to know everything to get what you want. You just have to be honest with yourself about what you don\u2019t know and know who to ask for help.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\nwith people who have good rote memories who do the things that I am bad at, and I carry around tools like my BlackBerry.\nFourth:\nPeople who overweigh the first-order consequences of their decisions and ignore the effects that the second- and subsequent-order consequences will have on their goals rarely reach their goals.36 This is because first-order consequences often have opposite desirabilities from second-order consequences, resulting in big mistakes in decision-making. For example, the first-order consequences of exercise (pain and time-sink) are commonly considered undesirable, while the second-order consequences (better health and more attractive appearance) are desirable. Similarly, food that tastes good is often bad for you and vice versa, etc. If your goal is to get physically fit and you don\u2019t ignore the first-order consequences of exercise and good-tasting but unhealthy food and connect your decisions with their second- and third-order consequences, you will not reach your goal.\nQuite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and sometimes they are barriers that stand in our way of getting what we want. It\u2019s almost as though the natural selection process sorts us by throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and penalizing the dummies who make their decisions just on the basis of the first-order consequences alone.\nBy contrast, people who choose what they really want, and avoid the temptations and get over the pains that drive them away from what they really want, are much more likely to have successful lives.\nFifth:\n36 Sometimes it can be difficult to anticipate the 2nd or 3rd order consequences of a decision, such as one that involves using complex technology like X-Rays or DDT, where either things are not what they seem to be or there are too many unknown variables to make a sound decision. For more on the probabilities of personal decision-making, please refer to the \u201cTo Make Decisions Effectively\u201d section at the end of Part 3.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow much do you worry about looking good relative to actually being good?\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow much do you respond to 1st order consequences at the expense of 2nd and 3rd order consequences?\n\nPeople who blame bad outcomes on anyone or anything other than themselves are behaving in a way that is at variance with reality, and subversive to their progress.\nBlaming bad outcomes on anyone or anything other than one\u2019s self is essentially wishing that reality is different than it is, which is silly.37 And it is subversive because it diverts one\u2019s attention away from mustering up the personal strength and other qualities that are required to produce the best possible outcomes.\nSuccessful people understand that bad things come at everyone and that it is their responsibility to make their lives what they want them to be by successfully dealing with whatever challenges they face.38 Successful people know that nature is testing them, and that it is not sympathetic.39\nIn summary, I believe that you can probably get what you want out of life if you can suspend your ego and take a no-excuses approach to achieving your goals with open-mindedness, determination, and courage, especially if you rely on the help of people who are strong in areas that you are weak.\nIf I had to pick just one quality that those who make the right choices have, it is character. Character is the ability to get one\u2019s self to do the difficult things that produce the desired results. In other words, I believe that for the most part, achieving success\u2014whatever that is for you\u2014is mostly a matter of personal choice and that, initially, making the right choices can be difficult. However, because of the law of nature that pushing your boundaries will make you stronger, which will lead to improved results that will motivate you, the more you operate in your \u201cstretch zone,\u201d the more you adapt and the less character it takes to operate at the higher level of performance. So, if you don\u2019t let up on yourself, i.e., if you operate with the same level of \u201cpain,\u201d you will naturally evolve at an accelerating pace. Because I believe this, I believe that whether or not I achieve my goals is a test of what I am made of. It is a game that I play, but this game is for real. In the next part I explain how I go about playing it.\n37 Blaming others is NOT the same thing as holding others accountable, which we will discuss in my Management Principles.\n38 Luck\u2014both good and bad\u2014is a reality. But it is not a reason for an excuse. In life, we have a large number of choices, and luck can play a dominant role in the outcomes of our choices. But if you have a large enough sample size\u2014if you have large number of decisions (if you are playing a lot of poker hands, for example)\u2014over time, luck will cancel out and skill will have a dominant role in determining outcomes. A superior decision-maker will produce superior outcomes. That does not mean there won\u2019t be certain bad- (or good-) luck events that are life changing: a friend of mine dove into a swimming pool and became a quadriplegic. But he approached his situation well and became as happy as anybody else, because there are many paths to happiness. What happens to a lot of people is that they don\u2019t take personal responsibility for their outcomes, and as a result fail to make the best possible decisions.\n39 As I mentioned earlier, I believe that nature is symbiotic\u2014and that we must give to it for it to give back.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow much do you let yourself off the hook rather than hold yourself accountable for your success?\n\nIn summary, I don\u2019t believe that limited abilities are an insurmountable barrier to achieving your goals, if you do the other things right.\nAs always, it is up to you to ask yourself if what I am saying is true. As the next part delves into this concept more, you might want to reserve your judgment until after you have read it.\nYour Two Yous and Your Machine\nThose who are most successful are capable of \u201chigher level thinking\u201d \u2014i.e., they are able to step back and design a \u201cmachine\u201d consisting of the right people doing the right things to get what they want. They are able to assess and improve how their \u201cmachine\u201d works by comparing the outcomes that the machine is producing with the goals. Schematically, the process is as shown in the diagram below. It is a feedback loop:\nThat schematic is meant to convey that your goals will determine the \u201cmachine\u201d that you create to achieve them; that machine will produce outcomes that you should compare with your goals to judge how your machine is working. Your \u201cmachine\u201d will consist of the design and people you choose to achieve the goals. For example, if you want to take a hill from an enemy you will need to figure out how to do that\u2014 e.g., your design might need two scouts, two snipers, four infantrymen, one person to deliver the food, etc. While having the right design is essential, it is only half the battle. It is equally important to put the right people in each of these positions. They need different qualities to play their positions well\u2014e.g., the scouts must be fast runners, the snipers must be precise shots, etc. If your outcomes are inconsistent with your goals (e.g., if you are having problems), you need to modify your \u201cmachine,\u201d which means that you either have to modify your design/culture or modify your people. Do this often and well and your improvement process will look like the one on the left and do it poorly and it will look like the one on the right, or worse:\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\nI call it \u201chigher level thinking\u201d because your perspective is of one who is looking down on at your machine and yourself objectively, using the feedback loop as I previously described. In other words, your most important role is to step back and design, operate and improve your \u201cmachine\u201d to get what you want.\nThink of it as though there are two yous\u2014you as the designer and overseer of the plan to achieve your goals (let\u2019s call that one you(1)) and you as one of the participants in pursuing that mission (which we will call you(2)). You(2) are a resource that you(1) have to get what you(1) want, but by no means your only resource. To be successful you(1) have to be objective about you(2).\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that your goal is to have a winning basketball team. Wouldn\u2019t it be silly to put yourself in a position that you don\u2019t play well? If you did, you wouldn\u2019t get what you want. Whatever your goals are, achieving them works the same way.\nIf you(1) see that you(2) are not capable of doing something, it is only sensible for you(1) to have someone else do it. In other words, you(1) should look down on you(2) and all the other resources at your(1) disposal and create a \u201cmachine\u201d to achieve your(1) goals, remembering that you(1) don\u2019t necessarily need to do anything other than to design and manage the machine to get what you(1) want. If you(1) find that you(2) can\u2019t do something well fire yourself(2) and get a good replacement! You shouldn\u2019t be upset that you found out that you(2) are bad at that\u2014you(1) should be happy because you(1) have improved your(1) chances of getting what you(1) want. If you(1) are disappointed because you(2) can\u2019t be the best person to do everything, you(1) are terribly nai\u0308ve because nobody can do everything well.\nThe biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objectively. If they could just get around this, they could live up to their potentials.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow much do you intellectually agree with what I just said?\nHow good are you in approaching life as a \u201chigher level thinker\u201d rather than as a doer? How much would you like to get better at this?\nHow much do you think that reading this is a waste of time?\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcMy5-StepProcesstoGettingWhatYou40 WantOutofLife\nThere are five things that you have to do to get what you want out of life. First, you have to choose your goals, which will determine your direction. Then you have to design a plan to achieve your goals. On the way to your goals, you will encounter problems. As I mentioned, these problems typically cause pain. The most common source of pain is in exploring your mistakes and weaknesses. You will either react badly to the pain or react like a master problem solver. That is your choice. To figure out how to get around these problems you must be calm and analytical to accurately diagnose your problems. Only after you have an accurate diagnosis of them can you design a plan that will get you around your problems. Then you have to do the tasks specified in the plan. Through this process of encountering problems and figuring out how to get around them, you will become progressively more capable and achieve your goals more easily. Then you will set bigger, more challenging goals, in the same way that someone who works with weights naturally increases the poundage. This is the process of personal evolution, which I call my 5-Step Process.\nIn other words, \u201cThe Process\u201d consists of five distinct steps:\nHave clear goals.\nIdentify and don\u2019t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of achieving your goals. Accurately diagnose these problems.\n40 The you I am referring to here is the strategic you \u2013 the one who is deciding on what you want and how best to get it, previously referred to as you (1).\n\nDesign plans that explicitly lay out tasks that will get you around your problems and on to your goals.\nImplement these plans\u2014i.e., do these tasks.\nYou need to do all of these steps well in order to be successful.\nBefore discussing these individual steps in more detail, I want to make a few general points about the process.\n1) You must approach these as distinct steps rather than blur them together. For example, when setting goals, just set goals (don\u2019t think how you will achieve them or the other steps); when diagnosing problems, just diagnose problems (don\u2019t think about how you will solve them or the other steps). Blurring the steps leads to suboptimal outcomes because it creates confusion and short-changes the individual steps. Doing each step thoroughly will provide information that will help you do the other steps well, since the process is iterative.\n2) Each of these five steps requires different talents and disciplines. Most probably, you have lots of some of these and inadequate amounts of others. If you are missing any of the required talents and disciplines, that is not an insurmountable problem because you can acquire them, supplement them, or compensate for not having them, if you recognize your weaknesses and design around them. So you must be honestly self-reflective.\n3) It is essential to approach this process in a very clear-headed, rational way rather than emotionally. Figure out what techniques work best for you; e.g., if emotions are getting the better of you, take time out until you can reflect unemotionally, seek the guidance of calm, thoughtful others, etc.\nTo help you do these things well\u2014and stay centered and effective rather than stressed and thrown off by your emotions\u2014try this technique for reducing the pressure: treat your life like a game or a martial art. Your mission is to figure out how to get around your challenges to get to your goals. In the process of playing the game or practicing this martial art, you will become more skilled. As you get better, you will progress to ever-higher levels of the game that will require\u2014and teach you\u2014greater skills. I will explain what these skills are in the next section. However, the big and really great news is that you don\u2019t need to have all of these skills to succeed! You just have to 1) know they are needed; 2) know you don\u2019t have some of them; and 3) figure out how to get them (i.e., either learn them or work with others who have them).\nThis particular game\u2014i.e., your life\u2014will challenge you in ways that will be uncomfortable at times. But if you work through this discomfort and reflect on it in order to learn, you will significantly improve your chances of getting what you want out of life. By and large, life will give you what you deserve and it doesn\u2019t give a damn what you \u201clike.\u201d So it is up to you to take full responsibility to connect what you want with what you need to do to get it, and then to do those things\u2014which often are difficult but produce good results\u2014so that you\u2019ll then deserve to get what you want.\nThat\u2019s just the way it is, so you might as well accept it. Once you accept that playing the game will be uncomfortable, and you do it for a while, it will become much easier (like it does when getting fit). When you excel at it, you will find your ability to get what you want thrilling. You\u2019ll see that excuses like \u201cThat\u2019s not easy\u201d are of no value and that it pays to \u201cpush through it\u201d at a pace you can handle. Like getting physically fit, the most important thing is that you keep moving forward at whatever pace you choose, recognizing the consequences of your actions. When you think that it\u2019s too hard, remember that in the long run, doing the things that will make you successful is a lot easier than being unsuccessful. The first- order consequences of escaping life\u2019s challenges may seem pleasurable in the moment, but the second- and third-order consequences of this approach are your life and, over time, will be painful. With practice, you will eventually play this game like a ninja, with skill and a calm centeredness in the face of adversity that will let you handle most of your numerous challenges well.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\nHowever, you will never handle them all well: mistakes are inevitable, and it\u2019s important to recognize and accept this fact of life. The good news, as I have mentioned, is that most learning comes through making mistakes\u2014so there is no end to learning how to play the game better. You will have an enormous number of decisions to make, so no matter how many mistakes you make, there will be plenty of opportunities to build a track record of success.\nThat\u2019s basically the whole concept.\nLet\u2019s pause and reflect on this before moving on.\nIf you can\u2019t work through your doubts alone, speak to me or to others about it, but PLEASE do not proceed until you agree with the basic logic behind the 5-Step Process. Either you will get comfortable with it and internalize it or you will point out something that is wrong and the process will get better.\nWhat follows now is a closer examination of each of the five steps.\nThe 5 Steps Close-Up\n1) Setting Goals\nYou can have virtually anything you want, but you can\u2019t have everything you want.\nThe first, most important, and typically most difficult step in the 5-Step Process is setting goals, because it forces you to decide what you really want and therefore what you can possibly get out of life. This is the step where you face the fundamental limit: life is like a giant smorgasbord of more delicious alternatives than you can ever hope to taste. So you have to reject having some things you want in order to get other things you want more.\nSome people fail at this point, afraid to reject a good alternative for fear that the loss will deprive them of some essential ingredient to their personal happiness. As a result, they pursue too many goals at the same time, achieving few or none of them.\nSo it\u2019s important to remember: it doesn\u2019t really matter if some things are unavailable to you, because the selection of what IS available is so great. (That is why many people who had major losses\u2014e.g., who lost their ability to walk, to see, etc.\u2014and who didn\u2019t narrow-mindedly obsess about their loss but rather open- mindedly accepted and enjoyed what remained, had equally happy lives as those who didn\u2019t ever have these losses.)\nIn other words, you can have an enormous amount: much, much more than what you need to have for a happy life. So don\u2019t get discouraged by not being able to have everything you want, and for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t be paralyzed by the choices. That\u2019s nonsensical and unproductive. Get on with making your choices.\nPut another way, to achieve your goals you have to prioritize, and that includes rejecting good alternatives (so that you have the time and resources to pursue even better ones\u2014time being probably your greatest limiting factor, though, through leverage, you can substantially reduce time\u2019s constraints).\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcDoes what I am saying make sense to you? Do you agree that it is true?\nIf not, why not?\n\nIt is important not to confuse \u201cgoals\u201d and \u201cdesires.\u201d\nGoals are the things that you really want to achieve, while desires are things you want that can prevent you from reaching your goals\u2014as I previously explained, desires are typically first-order consequences. For example, a goal might be physical fitness, while a desire is the urge to eat good-tasting, unhealthy food (i.e., a first-order consequence) that could undermine you obtaining your fitness goal. So, in terms of the consequences they produce, goals are good and desires are bad.41\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; I believe you can choose to pursue any goal you want as long as you consider the consequences. So, staying with this example, I think it is perfectly OK for you to make your goal to enjoy eating good-tasting, unhealthy food if that choice will bring you what you really want. As I said earlier, if you want to be a couch potato, that\u2019s fine with me\u2014seriously. But if that\u2019s not what you want, you better not open that bag of chips. In other words, failing to make the distinction between goals and desires will lead you in the wrong direction, because you will be inclined to pursue things you want that will undermine your ability to get things you want more. In short, you can pursue anything you desire\u2014just make sure that you know the consequences of what you are doing.\nAnother common reason people fail at this stage is that they lose sight of their goals, getting caught up in day-to-day tasks.\nAvoid setting goals based on what you think you can achieve.\nAs I said before, do each step separately and distinctly without regard to the others. In this case, that means don\u2019t rule out a goal due to a superficial assessment of its attainability. Once you commit to a goal, it might take lots of thinking and many revisions to your plan over a considerable time period in order to finalize the design and do the tasks to achieve it. So you need to set goals without yet assessing whether or not you can achieve them.\nThis requires some faith that you really can achieve virtually anything,42 even if you don\u2019t know how you will do it at that moment. Initially you have to have faith that this is true, but after following this process and succeeding at achieving your goals, you will gain confidence. If you like, you can start with more modest goals and, when you build up the track record to give you faith, increase your aspirations.\nEvery time I set goals, I don\u2019t yet have any idea how I am going to achieve them because I haven\u2019t yet gone through the process of thinking through them. But I have learned that I can achieve them if I think creatively and work hard.43\nI also know that I can \u201ccheat.\u201d Unlike in school, in life you don\u2019t have to come up with all the right answers. You can ask the people around you for help\u2014or even ask them to do the things you don\u2019t do well.\nIn other words, there is almost no reason not to succeed if you take the attitude of 1) total flexibility\u2014good answers can come from anyone or anywhere (and in fact, as I have mentioned, there are far more good answers \u201cout there\u201d than there are in you) and 2) total accountability: regardless of where the good answers come from, it\u2019s your job to find them.\n41 Some societies define evil to be the desires that can take you away from your goals, which I think is a good way of seeing the difference between goals and desires. That doesn\u2019t mean I think that there isn\u2019t room for a little \u201cbad\u201d, but I do think that desires that fundamentally divert you from your goals should be avoided at all cost.\n42 This might sound inconsistent with the previous point that you can\u2019t have everything. It\u2019s not. I am saying that, at this stage of goal-setting, don\u2019t set your goals based on what you think you can achieve. In the process of doing the other four steps (especially designing) you will thoroughly think through what is possible. Then you will circle back and enter the goal-setting mode again. As I mentioned, this five-step process is iterative, but it must be pursued one step at a time in order to do each step excellently.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc43 The more creative I am, the less hard I have to work.\n\nThis no-excuses approach helps me do whatever it takes to get whatever I want most. Not all goals are achievable, of course. There are some impossibilities or near-impossibilities, such as living forever, or flying with just the power of your arms. But it\u2019s been my experience that if I commit to bringing creativity, flexibility, and determination to the pursuit of my goals, I will figure out some way to get them, i.e., almost all goals are attainable. And as I don\u2019t limit my goals to what seems attainable at the moment I set them, the goals I set tend to be higher than they would otherwise be. Since trying to achieve high goals makes me stronger, I become increasingly capable of achieving more. Great expectations create great capabilities, in other words. And if I fail to achieve my goal, it just tells me that I have not been creative or flexible or determined enough to do what it takes, and I circle back and figure out what I need to do about this situation.\nAchieving your goals isn\u2019t just about moving forward.\nInevitably, you must deal with setbacks. So goals aren\u2019t just those things that you want and don\u2019t have. They might also be keeping what you do have, minimizing your rate of loss, or dealing with irrevocable loss. Life will throw you challenges, some of which will seem devastating at the time. Your goal is always to make the best possible choices, knowing that you will be rewarded if you do. It\u2019s like playing golf: sometimes you will be in the fairway and sometimes you will be in the rough, so you have to know how to play it as it lies.\nGenerally speaking, goal-setting is best done by those who are good at big-picture conceptual thinking, synthesizing, visualizing, and prioritizing. But whatever your strengths and weaknesses are, don\u2019t forget the big and really great news here: it is not essential that you have all of these qualities yourself, because you can supplement them with the help of others.\nIn summary, in order to get what you want, the first step is to really know what you want, without confusing goals with desires, and without limiting yourself because of some imagined impediments that you haven\u2019t thoroughly analyzed.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow well do you know what you want most out of life?\nWhat are your most important goals?\nAre you good at setting your goals?\nHow confident are you that your assessment of you ability to set goals is right?\nIf you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. because you have a demonstrated track-record, because many believable people have told you, etc)?\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc2) Identifying and Not Tolerating Problems\nAfter you set your goals, you must come up with a plan or a design to achieve them and then you must execute that plan by doing the tasks. On the way to achieving your goals and executing your design, you will encounter problems that have to be diagnosed, so that the design can be modified to get around these obstacles. That\u2019s why you need to identify and not tolerate problems.\nMost problems are potential improvements screaming at you.\n\nWhenever a problem surfaces, you have in front of you an opportunity to improve. The more painful the problem, the louder it is screaming.44 In order to be successful, you have to 1) perceive problems and 2) not tolerate them.\nIf you don\u2019t identify your problems, you won\u2019t solve them, so you won\u2019t move forward toward achieving your goals. As a result, it is essential to bring problems to the surface.\nMost people don\u2019t like to do this. But most successful people know that they have to do this.\nThe most common reasons people don\u2019t successfully identify their problems are generally rooted either in a lack of will or in a lack of talent or skill:\n\u2022 They can be \u201charsh realities\u201d that are unpleasant to look at, so people often subconsciously put them \u201cout of sight\u201d so they will be \u201cout of mind.\u201d\n\u2022 Thinking about problems that are difficult to solve can produce anxiety that stands in the way of progress.\n\u2022 People often worry more about appearing to not have problems than about achieving their desired results, and therefore avoid recognizing that their own mistakes and/or weaknesses are causing the problems. This aversion to seeing one\u2019s own mistakes and weaknesses typically occurs because they\u2019re viewed as deficiencies you\u2019re stuck with rather than as essential parts of the personal evolution process.\n\u2022 Sometimes people are simply not perceptive enough to see the problems.\n\u2022 Some people are unable to distinguish big problems from small ones. Since nothing is\nperfect, it is possible to identify an infinite number of problems everywhere. If you are unable to distinguish the big problems from the little ones, you can\u2019t \u201csuccessfully\u201d (i.e., in a practical way) identify problems.\nRemember, you don\u2019t have to be good at any of the five steps (in this case, identifying problems) to be successful if you get help from others. So push through the pain of facing your problems, knowing you will end up in a much better place.\nWhen identifying problems, it is important to remain centered and logical.\nWhile it can be tempting to react emotionally to problems and seek sympathy or blame others, this accomplishes nothing.45 Whatever the reasons, you have to get over the impediments to succeed. Remember that the pains you are feeling are \u201cgrowing pains\u201d that will test your character and reward you if you push through them. Try to look at your problems as a detached observer would. Remember that identifying problems is like finding gems embedded in puzzles; if you solve the puzzles you will get the gems that will make your life much better. Doing this continuously will lead to your rapid evolution. So, if you\u2019re logical, you really should get excited about finding problems because identifying them will bring you closer to your goals.\n44 Though I\u2019ve said it before, it\u2019s worth saying again: I understand that recognizing harsh realities can be extremely painful. But I\u2019ve learned that if you can stare hard at your problems, they almost always shrink or disappear, because you almost always find a better way of dealing with them than if you don\u2019t face them head on. The more difficult the problem, the more important it is that you stare at it and deal with it. After seeing how effectively facing reality \u2013 especially your problems, mistakes and weaknesses \u2013 works, you will become comfortable with it and won\u2019t want to operate any other way. I also believe that one of the best ways of getting at truth is reflecting with others who have opposing views and who share your interest in finding the truth rather than being proven right.\n45 This is typically because they let their emotions control their behavior and/or they haven\u2019t learned how to deal with their problems e.g., the amygdala is \u201chijacking\u201d decision-making away from the pre-frontal cortex.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow good are you at perceiving problems?\nHow confident are you that your assessment of your ability to perceive problems is right?\n\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcIf you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. because you have a demonstrated track-record, because many believable people have told you, etc)?\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcBe very precise in specifying your problems.\nIt is essential to identify your problems with precision, for different problems have different solutions. For example, if your impediments are due largely to issues of will\u2014to your unwillingness to confront what is really happening\u2014you have to strengthen your will, for example by starting small and building up your confidence.\nIf your problems are related to lack of skill or innate talent, the most powerful antidote is to have others point things out to you and objectively consider whether what they identify is true. Problems due to inadequate skill might then be solved with training, whereas those arising from innate weaknesses might be overcome with assistance or role changes. It doesn\u2019t matter which is the case; it only matters that the true cause is identified and appropriately addressed.46\nThe more precise you are, the easier it will be to come up with accurate diagnoses and successful solutions. For example, rather than saying something like \u201cPeople don\u2019t like me,\u201d it is better to specify which people don\u2019t like you and under what circumstances.\nDon\u2019t confuse problems with causes.\n\u201cI can\u2019t get enough sleep\u201d is not a problem; it is a cause of some problem. What exactly is that problem? To avoid confusing the problem with its causes, try to identify the suboptimal outcome, e.g., \u201cI am performing badly in my job because I am tired.\u201d\nOnce you identify your problems, you must not tolerate them.\nTolerating problems has the same result as not identifying them (i.e., both stand in the way of getting past the problem), but the root causes are different. Tolerating problems might be due to not thinking that they can be solved, or not caring enough about solving them.47 People who tolerate problems are the worse off because, without the motivation to move on, they cannot succeed. In other words, if you are motivated, you can succeed even if you don\u2019t have the abilities (i.e., talents and skills) because you can get the help from others. But if you\u2019re not motivated to succeed, if you don\u2019t have the will to succeed, the situation is hopeless.\nPeople who are good at this step\u2014identifying and not tolerating problems\u2014tend to have strong abilities to perceive and synthesize a clear and accurate picture, as well as demonstrate a fierce intolerance of badness (regardless of the severity).\nRemember that you need to do each step independently from the other steps before moving on.\n46 There are also other antidotes that we will delve into in the next book.\n47 Not caring to solve problems often occurs when the expected reward is less than the expected cost. For example, when someone is working toward someone else\u2019s goals without being appropriately supervised, rewarded or punished.\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow much do you tolerate problems?\nHow confident are you that your assessment of how much you tolerate problems is right?\nIf you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. because you have a demonstrated track-record, because many believable people have told you, etc)?\n\nCan you comfortably identify your problems without thinking about how to solve them? It is a good exercise to just make a list of them, without possible solutions. Only after you have created a clear picture of your problems should you go to the next step.\nFor a more detailed explanation of identifying and not tolerating problems, please read My Management Principles.\n3) Diagnosing the Problems\nYou will be much more effective if you focus on diagnosis and design rather than jumping to solutions.\nIt is a very common mistake for people to move directly from identifying a tough problem to a proposed solution in a nanosecond without spending the hours required to properly diagnose and design a solution. This typically yields bad decisions that don\u2019t alleviate the problem. Diagnosing and designing are what spark strategic thinking.\nYou must be calm and logical.\nWhen diagnosing problems, as when identifying problems, reacting emotionally, though sometimes difficult to avoid, can undermine your effectiveness as a decision-maker. By contrast, staying rational will serve you well. So if you are finding yourself shaken by your problems, do what you can to get yourself centered before moving forward.\nYou must get at the root causes.\nRoot causes, like principles, are things that manifest themselves over and over again as the deep-seated reasons behind the actions that cause problems. So you will get many everlasting dividends if you can find them and properly deal with them.\nIt is important to distinguish root causes from proximate causes. Proximate causes typically are the actions or lack of actions that lead to problems\u2014e.g., \u201cI missed the train because I didn\u2019t check the train schedule.\u201d So proximate causes are typically described via verbs. Root causes are the deeper reasons behind the proximate cause: \u201cI didn\u2019t check the schedule because I am forgetful\u201d\u2014a root cause. Root causes are typically described with adjectives, usually characteristics about what the person is like that lead them to an action or an inaction.\nIdentifying the real root causes of your problems is essential because you can eliminate your problems only by removing their root causes. In other words, you must understand, accept, and successfully deal with reality in order to move toward your goals.\nRecognizing and learning from one\u2019s mistakes and the mistakes of others who affect outcomes is critical to eliminating problems.\nMany problems are caused by people\u2019s mistakes. But people often find it difficult to identify and accept their own mistakes. Sometimes it\u2019s because they\u2019re blind to them, but more often it\u2019s because ego and shortsightedness make discovering their mistakes and weaknesses painful. Because people are often upset when their mistakes are pointed out to them, most people are reluctant to point out mistakes in others. As a result, an objective diagnosis of problems arising from people\u2019s mistakes is often missing and personal evolution is stunted. (As I mentioned in the last chapter, most learning comes from making mistakes and experiencing the pain of them\u2014e.g., putting your hand on a hot stove\u2014and adapting.) It is at this stage that most people fail to progress. More than anything else, what differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don\u2019t is a willingness to look at themselves and others objectively.\n\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\nI call the pain that comes from looking at yourself and others objectively \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d because it is the pain that accompanies personal growth. No pain, no gain. Of course, anyone who really understands that no one is perfect and that these discoveries are essential for personal growth finds that these discoveries elicit \u201cgrowing pleasures.\u201d But it seems to be in our nature to overly focus on short-term gratification rather than long-term satisfaction\u2014on first-order rather than second- or third-order consequences\u2014so the connection between this behavior and the rewards it brings doesn\u2019t come naturally. However, if you can make this connection, such moments will begin to elicit pleasure rather than pain. It is similar to how exercise eventually becomes pleasurable for people who hardwire the connection between exercise and its benefits.\nRemember that:\nPain + Reflection = Progress\nMuch as you might wish this were not so, this is a reality that you should just accept and deal with. There is no getting around the fact that achieving success requires getting at the root causes of all important problems, and people\u2019s mistakes and weaknesses are sometimes the root causes. So to be successful, you must be willing to look at your own behavior and the behavior of others as possible causes of problems.\nOf course, some problems aren\u2019t caused by people making mistakes. For example, if lightning strikes, it causes problems that have nothing to do with human error. All problems need to be well-diagnosed before you decide what to do about them.\nThe most important qualities for successfully diagnosing problems are logic, the ability to see multiple possibilities, and the willingness to touch people\u2019s nerves to overcome the ego barriers that stand in the way of truth.\nFor a more detailed explanation of diagnosing problems, please read My Management Principles.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcIn diagnosing problems, how willing are you to \u201ctouch the nerve\u201d (i.e., discuss your and others possible mistakes and weaknesses with them)?\nAre you willing to get at root causes, like what people are like?\nAre you good at seeing the patterns and synthesizing them into diagnoses of root causes? How confident are you that your assessment of your ability to diagnose is accurate?\nIf you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. because you have a demonstrated track-record, because many believable people have told you, etc)?\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc4) Designing the Plan (Determining the Solutions)\nIn some cases, you might go from setting goals to designing the plans that will get you to these goals; while in other cases, you will encounter problems on the way to your goals and have to design your way around them. So design will occur at both stages of the process, though it will occur much more often in figuring out how to get around problems. In other words, most of the movement toward your goals comes from designing how to remove the root causes of your problems. Problems are great because they are very specific impediments, so you know that you will move forward if you can identify and eliminate their root causes.\nCreating a design is like writing a movie script in that you visualize who will do what through time in order to achieve the goal.\n\nVisualize the goal or problem standing in your way, and then visualize practical solutions. When designing solutions, the objective is to change how you do things so that problems don\u2019t recur\u2014or recur so often. Think about each problem individually, and as the product of root causes\u2014like the outcomes produced by a machine. Then think about how the machine should be changed to produce good outcomes rather than bad ones. There are typically many paths toward achieving your goals, and you need to find only one of them that works, so it\u2019s almost always doable.\nBut an effective design requires thinking things through and visualizing how things will come together and unfold over time. It\u2019s essential to visualize the story of where you have been (or what you have done) that has led you to where you are now and what will happen sequentially in the future to lead you to your goals. You should visualize this plan through time, like watching a movie that connects your past, present, and future.\nThen write down the plan so you don\u2019t lose sight of it, and include who needs to do what and when. The list of tasks falls out from this story (i.e., the plan), but they are not the same. The story, or plan, is what connects your goals to the tasks. For you to succeed, you must not lose sight of the goals or the story while focusing on the tasks; you must constantly refer back and forth. In My Management Principles (Part 3), you can see one such plan.\nWhen designing your plan, think about the timelines of various interconnected tasks. Sketch them out loosely and then refine them with the specific tasks. This is an iterative process, alternating between sketching out your broad steps (e.g., hire great people) and filling these in with more specific tasks with estimated timelines (e.g., in the next two weeks choose the headhunters to find the great people) that will have implications (e.g., costs, time, etc.). These will lead you to modify your design sketch until the design and tasks work well together. Being as specific as possible (e.g., specifying who will do what and when) allows you to visualize how the design will work at both a big-picture level and in detail. It will also give you and others the to-do lists and target dates that will help direct you.\nOf course, not all plans will accomplish everything you want in the desired time frame. In such cases, it is essential that you look at what won\u2019t be accomplished and ask yourself if the consequences are acceptable or unacceptable. This is where perspective is required, and discussing it with others can be critical. If the plan will not achieve what\u2019s necessary in the required time, so that the consequences have an unacceptably high probability of preventing you from achieving your goal, you have to either think harder (probably with the advice of other believable people) to make the plan do what is required or reduce your goals.\nIt doesn\u2019t take much time to design a good plan\u2014literally just hours spread out over days or weeks\u2014and whatever amount of time you spend designing it will be only a small fraction of the time you spend executing it. But designing is very important because it determines what you will have to do to be effective. Most people make the very big mistake of spending virtually no time on this step because they are too preoccupied with execution. This process is explained in detail in My Management Principles.\nPeople successful with this stage have an ability to visualize and a practical understanding of how things really work. Remember, you don\u2019t have to possess all these qualities if you have someone to help you with the ones you are missing.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow good is your ability to visualize?\nHow confident are you that your assessment of your ability to visualize is accurate?\nIf you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. do have an excellent track record of visualizing and making what you visualized happen, have other believable parties told you that you are good at this)?\n\nRemember: Designing precedes doing! The design will give you your to-do list (i.e., the tasks). 5) Doing the Tasks\nNext, you and the others you need to rely on have to do the tasks that will get you to your goals. Great planners who don\u2019t carry out their plans go nowhere. You need to \u201cpush through\u201d to accomplish the goals. This requires the self-discipline to follow the script that is your design. I believe the importance of good work habits is vastly underrated. There are lots of books written about good work habits, so I won\u2019t digress into what I believe is effective. However, it is critical to know each day what you need to do and have the discipline to do it. People with good work habits have to-do lists that are reasonably prioritized, and they make themselves do what needs to be done. By contrast, people with poor work habits almost randomly react to the stuff that comes at them, or they can\u2019t bring themselves to do the things they need to do but don\u2019t like to do (or are unable to do). There are lots of tools that can help (e.g., thank God for my BlackBerry!)\nYou need to know whether you (and others) are following the plan, so you should establish clear benchmarks. Ideally you should have someone other than yourself objectively measure if you (and others) are doing what you planned. If not, you need to diagnose why and resolve the problem.\nPeople who are good at this stage can reliably execute a plan. They tend to be self-disciplined and proactive rather than reactive to the blizzard of daily tasks that can divert them from execution. They are results-oriented: they love to push themselves over the finish line to achieve the goal. If they see that daily tasks are taking them away from executing the plan (i.e., they identify this problem), they diagnose it and design how they can deal with both the daily tasks and moving forward with the plan.\nAs with the other steps, if you aren\u2019t good at this step, get help. There are many successful, creative people who are good at the other steps but who would have failed because they aren\u2019t good at execution. But they succeeded nonetheless because of great symbiotic relationships with highly reliable task-doers.\nFor a more detailed explanation of doing what you set out to do, please see My Management Principles.\nThe Relationships between These Steps\nDesigns and tasks have no purpose other than to achieve your goals. Said differently, goals are the sole purpose of designs and tasks. So you mustn\u2019t forget how they\u2019re related. Frequently I see people feel great about doing their tasks while forgetting the goals they were designed to achieve, resulting in the failure to achieve their goals. This doesn\u2019t make any sense, because the only purpose of tasks is to achieve goals. In order to be successful, your goals must be riveted in your mind: they are the things you MUST do. To remember the connections between the tasks and the goals that they are meant to achieve, you just have to ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d It is good to connect tasks to goals this way (with the \u201cWhy?\u201d), because losing sight of the connections will prevent you from succeeding.\nAgain, this 5-Step Process is iterative. This means that after completing one of the steps you will probably have acquired relevant information that leads you to modify the other steps.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow good are you at pushing through?\nHow confident are you that your assessment of your ability to push through is accurate?\nIf you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. because you have a demonstrated track-record, because many believable people have told you, etc)?\n\nIf this process is working, goals will change much more slowly than designs, which will change more slowly than tasks. Designs and tasks can be modified or changed often (because you might want to reassess how to achieve the goal), but changing goals frequently is usually a problem because achieving them requires a consistent effort. I often find that people who have problems reaching their goals handle these steps backwards; that is, they stick too rigidly to specified tasks and are not committed enough to achieving their goals (often because they lose sight of them).\nWeaknesses Don\u2019t Matter if You Find Solutions\nTo repeat, the best advice I can give you is to ask yourself what you want, then ask \u2018what is true,\u2019 and then ask yourself \u2018what should be done about it.\u2019 If you honestly ask and answer these questions you will move much faster towards what you want to get out of life than if you don\u2019t!\nMost importantly, ask yourself what is your biggest weakness that stands in the way of what you want.\nAs I mentioned before, everyone has weaknesses. The main difference between unsuccessful and successful people is that unsuccessful people don\u2019t find and address them, and successful people do.\nIt is difficult to see one\u2019s own blind spots for two reasons:\n1) Most people don\u2019t go looking for their weaknesses because of \u201cego barriers\u201d\u2014they find having weaknesses painful because society has taught them that having weaknesses is bad. As I said early on, I believe that we would have a radically more effective and much happier society if we taught the truth, which is that everyone has weaknesses, and knowing about them and how to deal with them is how people learn and succeed.\n2) Having a weakness is like missing a sense\u2014if you can\u2019t visualize what it is, it\u2019s hard to perceive not having it.\nFor these two reasons, having people show you what you are missing can be painful, though its essential for your progress. When you encounter that pain, try to remember that you can get what you want out of life if you can open-mindedly reflect, with the help of others, on what is standing in your way and then deal with it.\nPeople who don\u2019t get what they want out of life fail at one or more of the five steps. But being weak at any one of these steps is not a problem if you understand what you are weak at and successfully compensate for that weakness by seeking help. For example, a good goal-setter who is bad at doing tasks might work well with a bad goal-setter who is great at doing tasks\u2014i.e., they will be much more successful working together. It is easy to find out what weaknesses are standing in your way by 1) identifying which steps you are failing at and 2) getting the feedback of people who are successful at doing what you are having problems with.\nBecause I believe that you will achieve your goals if you do these five steps well, it follows that if you are not achieving your goals you can use the 5-Step Process as a diagnostic tool. You would do this by 1) identifying the step(s) that you are failing at; 2) noting the qualities required to succeed at that step; and 3) identifying which of these qualities you are missing.\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcWhat do you think is the biggest weakness you have that stands in the way of what you want \u2013 the one that you repeatedly run into?\n\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\nTo repeat, the five steps and the qualities that I believe are required to be good at them are as follows:\nIn a nutshell, my 5-Step process for achieving what you want is:\nValues\u2192 1) Goals \u2192 2) Problems \u2192 3) Diagnoses \u2192 4) Designs \u2192 5) Tasks\nYour values determine what you want, i.e., your goals. In trying to achieve your goals, you will encounter problems that have to be diagnosed. Only after determining the real root causes of these problems can you design a plan to get around them. Once you have a good plan, you have to muster the self-discipline to do what is required to make the plan succeed. Note that this process starts with your values, but it requires that you succeed at all five steps. While these steps require different abilities, you don\u2019t have to be good at all of them. If you aren\u2019t good at all of them (which is true for almost everyone), you need to know what you are bad at and how to compensate for your weaknesses. This requires you to put your ego aside, objectively reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, and seek the help from others.\nAs you design and implement your plan to achieve your goals, you may find it helpful to consider that:\n\u2022 Life is like a game where you seek to overcome the obstacles that stand in the way of achieving your goals;\n\u2022 You get better at this game through practice;\n\u2022 The game consists of a series of choices that have consequences;\n\u2022 You can\u2019t stop the problems and choices from coming at you, so it\u2019s better to learn how to deal\nwith them;\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcAt which step do you have the most problem?\nWhich qualities needed do you wish you had more of?\n\n\u2022 You have the freedom to make whatever choices you want, though it\u2019s best to be mindful of their consequences;\n\u2022 The pain of problems is a call to find solutions rather than a reason for unhappiness and inaction, so it\u2019s silly, pointless, and harmful to be upset at the problems and choices that come at you (though it\u2019s understandable);\n\u2022 We all evolve at different paces, and it\u2019s up to you to decide the pace at which you want to evolve;48\n\u2022 The process goes better if you are as accurate as possible in all respects, including assessing your strengths and weaknesses and adapting to them.\nWhile all this may sound very theoretical, it is integral to how we operate every day. For example, my management principles, which are explained in the next section, are based on the principles that I described in this section. So, Bridgewater is based on the core belief that everyone here is evolving together. How well and how quickly we do that will have a huge effect on our well-being and the well- being of all the people we have contact with (e.g., our clients, our families, etc.). These two things are inextricably linked. Bridgewater is also based on the belief that to be successful and happy, not only do we have to be excellent, we have to continue to improve at a surprisingly fast rate. Bridgewater operates consistently with the belief that to be excellent and improve at a fast rate, we must be hyperrealistic and hypertruthful. We therefore need to overcome any impediments to being realistic and truthful, and the biggest impediment is people\u2019s reluctance to face their own mistakes and weaknesses and those of others. Bridgewater is based on the belief that both meaningful work and meaningful relationships are required to be happy and successful. So, our relationships, like our work, must be excellent; as a result, we expect people to be extremely considerate and caring with each other. This does not mean being soft on each other, especially if that means avoiding harsh realities to avoid causing discomfort. It means true caring, which requires recognizing and successfully dealing with our realities, whatever they are.\nThe management principles that follow reflect these core values and the specific ways that they are lived out at Bridgewater.\nPart 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles\n\ufffc48 The organization Outward Bound has a concept that is helpful in thinking about the optimal pace of personal evolution. They speak of a comfort zone, a stretch zone and a panic zone. It\u2019s best to spend most of your time in the stretch zone.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles\nIn Part 1 I explained why I believe having principles is important and that I believe that it is up to each person to decide what principles are best for them. In Part 2 I explained my most fundamental principles. In this part I explain my management principles. Naturally, my management principles reflect the principles I believe are best throughout my life. But before I get into my particular management principles, I\u2019d like to touch on management principles in general.\nIf you read any of the earlier parts you know that I believe that having principles is essential for getting what you want out of life. That is as true for groups of people (e.g., companies, schools, governments, foundations, etc.) as it is for individuals. While individuals operating individually can choose whatever values and principles they like, when working in a group the people must agree on the group\u2019s values and principles. If the group is not clear about them, confusion and eventually gravitation toward the population\u2019s averages will result. If the group\u2019s values and principles are clear, their way of being (i.e., their culture) will permeate everything they do. It will drive how the people in the group set goals, identify problems, diagnose problems, design solutions and make sure that these designs are implemented. So I believe this relationship looks like this:\nPart 3: My Management Principles\n\ufffc\ufffcWhile having a clearly conveyed great culture is important, that\u2019s only half of the magic formula. The other half is having great people\u2014i.e., people who have the values, abilities, skills that fit the organization\u2019s culture.\nIn other words, I believe that to have a great company you have to make two things great \u2014the culture and the people. If these two things are great your organization can navigate the twists and turns to get you where you want to go.\nOf course, you have to know where you want to go. Organizations, like individuals, have to choose what they are going after (i.e., their goals), which influences their directions. As they move toward their goals, they encounter problems, make mistakes and discover weaknesses. Above all else, how they choose to approach these impediments determines how fast they move toward their goals.\nEvery organization works like a machine to achieve its goals. This machine produces outcomes. By comparing the outcomes to the goals, those running the machine can see how well the machine is working. This is the feedback loop that those who are responsible for the machine need to run well in order to improve the machine. Based on the feedback, the machine can be adjusted to improve. The machine consists of two big parts\u2014the culture and the people. If the outcomes are inconsistent with the goals, something must be wrong with the machine, which means that something must be wrong with the culture and/or the people. By diagnosing what is wrong, designing improvements and implementing those improvements, the machine will evolve. In short, the evolutionary process is as follows. Take a minute to look it over and see what you think.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles\n\ufffcThe more frequently and effectively those in the machine go through this process, the more rapidly they and the machine will evolve. An effective evolutionary process looks like this\u2014i.e., lots of quality feedback loops produces a steep upward trajectory.\nAn ineffective evolutionary process\u2014i.e., one in which mistakes are infrequently looked at and weaknesses are not well identified\u2014looks like that shown below, i.e., fewer and/or less effective feedback loops produces a slower upward trajectory. In fact, if there are two few and/or bad quality feedback loops, there will be a decline because you won\u2019t identify and deal with the problems that will kill you.\nI believe that this is equally true for individuals and organizations. I also believe that the most important difference between great organizations and bad ones is in how well they manage their feedback loops.\n\nBridgewater\u2019s Culture and People\nNaturally, the culture and people that I have chosen for Bridgewater are extensions the principles that I believe work best, which I explained in Part 2. Most importantly I value meaningful work and meaningful relationships that are obtained by striving for truth and excellence with great people. I am confident that through this constant striving, we will evolve rapidly together.\nAs you might have guessed from reading Part 2, I want Bridgewater to be a company in which people collectively...\n...1) work for what they want and not for what others want of them.\n...2) come up with the best independent opinions they can muster to move toward their goals,\n...3) stress-test their opinions by having the smartest people they can find to challenge them so they can find out where they are wrong,\n...4) are wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing\n...5) wrestle with reality, experiencing the results of their decisions, and reflecting on what they did to produce them so that they can improve.\nAnd when faced with difficult choices, I want them to see the choices as follows.\nPart 3: My Management Principles\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcWhile I recognize that being this way is challenging, I am also confident that it is what is required to get the most out of out of life. I am confident for two reasons. First, it is logical that the cause-effect relationships are such that being this way produces good results. Second, this theory has been tested over the last 40 years and has worked. While 40 years ago being this way seemed logical, back then that was an untested theory. Now that we have 40 years of testing to look back on, we can see that the results verify the theory.\nFleshing Out This Way of Being\nThe best advice I can give you is to ask yourself what do you want, then ask \u2018what is true\u2019\u2014and then ask yourself \u2018what should be done about it.\u2019 I believe that if you do this you will move much faster towards what you want to get out of life than if you don\u2019t!\n\nBecause what I have said is pretty abstract, I need to spell out exactly what it means to run a company this way. I need to get very specific. Over time I have built a collection of principles that encompasses almost all aspects of managing because I have collected and refined so many over time. I believe that virtually all problems you might encounter are addressed by one or more of the principles that follow.\nThere are too many to read as a book. What follows is not a few rules to go by presented in an easily digestible form that\u2019s easy to remember. That wouldn\u2019t have been specific enough to be of much help to you. There are over 200 principles here that are well explained and are meant to be used more as a reference book than a book that is read from cover to cover.\nI\u2019ve created an outline that serves the purposes of being both a summary of my management principles and a table of contents for a more complete explanation of them.

Understanding, accepting, and knowing how to effectively deal with reality are crucial for achieving success. Having truth on your side is extremely powerful. While the truth itself may be scary\u2014you have a weakness, you have a deadly disease, etc.\u2014knowing the truth will allow you to deal with your situation better. Being truthful, and letting others be truthful with you, allows you to explore your own thoughts and exposes you to the feedback that is essential for your learning. Being truthful is an extension of your freedom to be you; people who are one way on the inside and another on the outside become conflicted and often lose touch with their own values. It\u2019s difficult for them to be happy, and almost impossible for them to be at their best. While the first-order effects of being radically truthful might not be desirable, the second- and third-order effects are great.\n... 3) Create an environment in which everyone has the right to understand what makes sense and no one has the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up about it.\n... 4) Be extremely open. Openness leads to truth and trust. Being open about what you dislike is especially important, because things you don\u2019t like need to be changed or resolved. Discuss your issues until you are in synch or until you understand each other\u2019s positions and can determine what should be done. As someone I worked with once explained, \u201cIt\u2019s simple - just don\u2019t filter.\u201d The main reason Bridgewater performs well is that all people here have the power to speak openly and equally and because their views are judged on the merits of what they are saying. Through that extreme openness and a meritocracy of thought, we identify and solve problems better. Since we know we can rely on honesty, we succeed more and we ultimately become closer, and since we succeed and are close, we are more committed to this mission and to each other. It is a self- reinforcing, virtuous cycle.\n... 5) Have integrity and demand it from others. Integrity comes from the Latin word integer, meaning \u201cone.\u201d People who are one way on the inside and another way outside lack integrity; they have duality.\nThe second- and third-order effects of having integrity and avoiding duality are great. Thinking solely about what\u2019s accurate instead of how it is perceived helps you to be more focused on important things. It helps you sort the people you are around and the environments you are in. It improves the organization\u2019s efficiency and camaraderie because the secret things that people think and don't say to each other drive resentment and key issues underground and don\u2019t lead to improvement. Having nothing to hide relieves stress. It also builds trust. For these reasons:\n5a) Never say anything about a person you wouldn\u2019t say to them directly, and don\u2019t try people without accusing them to their face. Badmouthing people behind their backs\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcDo you agree with this?\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcDo you agree with this?\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the Culture Right Trust in Truth\nshows a serious lack of integrity and is counterproductive. It doesn\u2019t yield any beneficial change, and it subverts both the people you are badmouthing and the environment as a whole. Next to being dishonest, it is the worst thing you can do at Bridgewater. Criticism is both welcomed and encouraged at Bridgewater, so there is no good reason to talk behind people\u2019s backs. You need to follow this policy to an extreme degree. For example, managers should not talk about people who work for them without those people being in the room. If you talk behind people\u2019s backs at Bridgewater you are called a slimy weasel.\n5b) Don\u2019t let \u201cloyalty\u201d stand in the way of truth and openness. In some companies, employees hide their employer\u2019s mistakes, and employers do the same in return. In these places, openly expressing your concerns is considered disloyal, and discouraged. Because it prevents people from bringing their mistakes and weaknesses to the surface and because it encourages deception and eliminates the subordinates\u2019 right of appeal, unhealthy loyalty stands in the way of improvement. I believe in a truer, healthier form of loyalty, which does the opposite. Healthy loyalty fosters improvement through openly addressing mistakes and weaknesses. The more people are open about their challenges, the more helpful others can be. In an environment in which mistakes and weaknesses are dealt with frankly, those who face their challenges have the most admirable character. By contrast, when mistakes and weaknesses are hidden, unhealthy character is legitimized.\n... 6) Be radically transparent. Provide people with as much exposure as possible to what\u2019s going on around them. Allowing people direct access lets them form their own views and greatly enhances accuracy and the pursuit of truth. Winston Churchill said, \u201cThere is no worse course in leadership than to hold out false hopes soon to be swept away.\u201d The candid question-and-answer process allows people to probe your thinking. You can then modify your thinking to get at the best possible answer, reinforcing your confidence that you\u2019re on the best possible path.\n6a) Record almost all meetings and share them with all relevant people. Provide tapes of all meetings that don\u2019t contain confidential information to enhance transparency. Of course, there are some times when privacy is required. If someone gives you confidential information, keep it confidential until you have permission to disclose it.\n... 7) Don\u2019t tolerate dishonesty. People typically aren\u2019t totally honest, which stands in the way of progress, so don\u2019t tolerate this. There\u2019s an adjustment process at Bridgewater in which one learns to be completely honest and expect the same from others. Increasingly you engage in logical, unemotional discussions in pursuit of truth in which criticisms are not viewed as attacks, but as explorations of possible sources of problems.\n7a) Don\u2019t believe it when someone caught being dishonest says they have seen the light and will never do that sort of thing again. Chances are they will. The cost of keeping someone around who has been dishonest is likely to be higher than any benefits.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the Culture Right Create a Culture in Which It Is OK to Make Mistakes but Unacceptable Not to Identify, Analyze, and Learn From Them\n8) Create a Culture in Which It Is OK to Make Mistakes but Unacceptable Not to Identify, Analyze, and Learn From Them\nSo...\n... 9) Recognize that effective, innovative thinkers are going to make mistakes49 and learn from them because it is a natural part of the innovation process. For every mistake that you learn from you will save thousands of similar mistakes in the future, so if you treat mistakes as learning opportunities that yield rapid improvements you should be excited by them. But if you treat them as bad things, you will make yourself and others miserable, and you won\u2019t grow. Your work environment will be marked by petty back-biting and malevolent barbs rather than by a healthy, honest search for truth that leads to evolution and improvement. Because of this, the more mistakes you make and the more quality, honest diagnoses you have, the more rapid your progress will be. That\u2019s not B.S. or just talk. That\u2019s the reality of learning.50\n... 10) Do not feel bad about your mistakes or those of others. Love them!\nRemember that 1) they are to be expected, 2) they\u2019re the first and most essential part of the learning process, and 3) feeling bad about them will prevent you from getting better. People typically feel bad about mistakes because they think in a short-sighted way that mistakes reflect their badness or because they\u2019re worried about being punished (or not being rewarded). People also tend to get angry at those who make mistakes because in a short-sighted way they focus on the bad outcome rather than the educational, evolutionary process they\u2019re a part of. That\u2019s a real tragedy.\nI once had a ski instructor who had taught Michael Jordan, the greatest basketball player of all time, how to ski. He explained that Jordan enjoyed his mistakes and got the most out of them. At the start of high school, Jordan was an unimpressive basketball player; he became a champion because he loved using his mistakes to improve. Yet despite Jordan\u2019s example and the example of countless other successful people, it is far more common for people to allow ego to stand in the way of learning. Perhaps it\u2019s because school learning overemphasizes the value of having the right answers and punishes wrong answers. Good school learners are often bad mistake-based learners because they are bothered by their mistakes. I particularly see this problem in recent graduates from the best colleges, who frequently shy away from exploring their own weaknesses. Remember that intelligent people who are open to recognizing and learning from their weaknesses substantially outperform people with the same abilities who aren\u2019t similarly open.\n... 11) Observe the patterns of mistakes to see if they are a product of weaknesses. Connect the dots without ego barriers. If there is a pattern of mistakes, it probably signifies a weakness. Everyone has weaknesses. The fastest path to success is to know what they are and how to deal with them so that they don\u2019t stand in your way. Weaknesses are due to deficiencies in learning or deficiencies in abilities. Deficiencies in learning can be rectified over\n49 Thomas Edison said about failure: \u201cI have not failed. I\u2019ve just found 10,000 ways that don\u2019t work.\u201d \u201cI am not discouraged, because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward.\u201d \u201cResults! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results. I know several thousand things that won\u2019t work.\u201d \u201cWhen I have fully decided that a result is worth getting I go ahead of it and make trial after trial until it comes.\u201d \u201cMany of life\u2019s failures are men who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.\u201d\n50 A good book about this is Einstein\u2019s Mistakes by Hans Ohanian.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the Culture Right Create a Culture in Which It Is OK to Make Mistakes but Unacceptable Not to Identify, Analyze, and Learn From Them\ntime, though usually not quickly, while deficiencies in abilities are virtually impossible to change. Neither is a meaningful impediment to getting what you want if you accept it as a problem that can be designed around.\n... 12) Do not feel bad about your weaknesses or those of others. They are opportunities to improve. If you can solve the puzzle of what is causing them, you will get a gem - i.e., the ability to stop making them in the future. Everyone has weaknesses and can benefit from knowing about them. Don\u2019t view explorations of weaknesses as attacks. A person who receives criticism - particularly if he tries to objectively consider if it\u2019s true - is someone to be admired.\n... 13) Don\u2019t worry about looking good - worry about achieving your goals. Put your insecurities away and get on with achieving your goals.\nTo test if you are worrying too much about looking good, observe how you feel when you find out you\u2019ve made a mistake or don\u2019t know something. If you find yourself feeling bad, reflect - remind yourself that the most valuable comments are accurate criticisms. Imagine how silly and unproductive it would be if you thought your ski instructor was blaming you when he told you that you fell because you didn\u2019t shift your weight properly. If a criticism is accurate, it is a good thing. You should appreciate it and try to learn from it.\n... 14) Get over \u201cblame\u201d and \u201ccredit\u201d and get on with \u201caccurate\u201d and \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\nWhen people hear, \u201cYou did XYZ wrong,\u201d they have an instinctual reaction to figure out possible consequences or punishments rather than to try to understand how to improve. Remember that what has happened lies in the past and no longer matters, except as a method for learning how to be better in the future. Create an environment in which people understand that remarks such as \u201cYou handled that badly\u201d are meant to be helpful (for the future) rather than punitive (for the past). While people typically feel unhappy about blame and good about credit, that attitude gets everything backwards and can cause major problems. Worrying about \u201cblame\u201d and \u201ccredit\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d feedback impedes the iterative process essential to learning.\n... 15) Don\u2019t depersonalize mistakes. Identifying who made mistakes is essential to learning. It is also a test of whether a person will put improvement ahead of ego and whether he will fit into the Bridgewater culture. A common error is to say, \u201cWe didn\u2019t handle this well\u201d rather than \u201cHarry didn\u2019t handle this well.\u201d This occurs when people are uncomfortable connecting specific mistakes to specific people because of ego sensitivities. This creates dysfunctional and dishonest organizations. Since individuals are the most important building blocks of any organization and since individuals are responsible for the ways things are done, the diagnosis must connect the mistake to the specific individual by name. Someone created the procedure that went wrong, or decided we should act according to that procedure, and ignoring that fact will slow our progress toward successfully dealing with the problem.\n... 16) Write down your weaknesses and the weaknesses of others to help remember and acknowledge them. It\u2019s unhealthy to hide them because if you hide them,\nit will slow your progress towards successfully dealing with them. Conversely, if you don\u2019t want them and you stare at them, you will inevitably evolve past them.\n... 17) When you experience pain, remember to reflect. You can convert the \u201cpain\u201d of seeing your mistakes and weaknesses into pleasure. If there is only one piece of advice I can get you to remember it is this one. Calm yourself down and think about what is causing your\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the Culture Right Create a Culture in Which It Is OK to Make Mistakes but Unacceptable Not to Identify, Analyze, and Learn From Them\npsychological pain. Ask other objective, believable parties for their help to figure it out. Find out what is true. Don\u2019t let ego barriers stand in your way. Remember that pains that come from seeing mistakes and weaknesses are \u201cgrowing pains\u201d that you learn from.51 Don\u2019t rush through them. Stay in them and explore them because that will help build the foundation for improvement. It is widely recognized that 1) changing your deep-seated, harmful behavior is very difficult yet necessary for improvement and 2) doing this generally requires a deeply felt recognition of the connection between your harmful behavior and the pain it causes. Psychologists call this \u201chitting bottom.\u201d Embracing your failures is the first step toward genuine improvement; it is also why \u201cconfession\u201d precedes forgiveness in many societies.52 If you keep doing this you will learn to improve and feel the pleasures of it.\n... 18) Be self-reflective and make sure your people are self-reflective. This quality differentiates those who evolve fast from those who don\u2019t. When there is pain, the animal instinct is \u2018fight or flight\u2019 (i.e., to either strike back or run away) - reflect instead. When you can calm yourself down, thinking about the dilemma that is causing you pain will bring you to a higher level and enlighten you, leading to progress. That is because the pain you are feeling is due to something being at odds - maybe it\u2019s you encountering reality, such as the death of a friend, and not being able to accept it. If when you are calm, you can think clearly about what things are at odds, you will learn more about what reality is like and how to better deal with it. It really will produce progress. If, on the other hand, the pain causes you to tense-up, not think, feel sorry for yourself, and blame others, it will be a very bad experience. So, when you are in pain, try to remember: Pain + Reflection = Progress. It\u2019s pretty easy to determine whether a person is reflective or deflective: self- reflective people openly and objectively look at themselves while deflective people don\u2019t.\n... 19) Teach and reinforce the merits of mistake-based learning. We must bring mistakes into the open and analyze them objectively, so managers need to foster a culture that makes this normal and penalizes suppressing or covering up mistakes. Probably the worst mistake anyone can make at Bridgewater is not facing up to mistakes - i.e., hiding rather than highlighting them. Highlighting them, diagnosing them, thinking about what should be done differently in the future, and then adding that new knowledge to the procedures manual are all essential to our improvement.\n19a) The most valuable tool we have for this is the issues log (explained fully later), which is aimed at identifying and learning from mistakes. Using this tool is mandatory because we believe that enforcing this behavior is far better than leaving it optional.\n\ufffc51 If you recognize short-term failure as a step toward long-term success, which it really is if you learn from it, you won\u2019t be afraid of it or made uncomfortable by it and you will approach all of your experiences as learning experiences, even the most difficult ones.\n52 Ego often stands in the way of acknowledging your weaknesses (which is the essential first step in overcoming them), like being afraid to ask a question because people might think you\u2019re stupid because you don\u2019t know something. Yet acknowledging those weaknesses (e.g., \u201cI know I\u2018m a dumb shit, but I\u2019d just like to know...\u201d) helps you move beyond ego toward learning and improving.\n\nSo...\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the Culture Right Constantly Get in Synch\n20) Constantly Get in Synch\n... 21) Constantly get in synch about what is true and what to do about it. Getting in synch helps you achieve better answers through considering alternative viewpoints. It can take the forms of asking, debating, discussing, and teaching how things should be done. Sometimes it is to make our views on our strengths, weaknesses, and values transparent in order to reach the understanding that helps us move forward. Sometimes it is to be clear about who will do what and the game plan for handling responsibilities. So this process can be both a means of finding the best answers and pushing them ahead. Quality conversations about what is true and what should be done will produce better outcomes and many fewer misunderstandings in the future.\n... 22) Talk about \u201cIs it true?\u201d and \u201cDoes it make sense?\u201d In a culture that values both independent thinking and innovation, each individual has both the right and the obligation to ensure that what they do, and what we collectively do, in pursuit of excellence, makes sense to them. So, get in synch about these things.\n... 23) Fight for right. Discuss or debate important issues with the right relevant parties in an open- minded way until the best answers are determined. This process will maximize learning and mutual understanding. Thrash it out to get to the best answer.\n... 24) Be assertive and open-minded at the same time. Just try to find out what is true. Don\u2019t try to \u2018win\u2019 the argument. Finding out that you are wrong is even more valuable than being right, because you are learning.\n24a) Ask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion. Opinions are easy to produce, so bad ones abound. Knowing that you don\u2019t know something is nearly as valuable as knowing it. The worst situation is thinking you know something when you don\u2019t.\n24b) Recognize that you always have the right to have and ask questions.\n24c) Distinguish open-minded people from closed-minded people. Open-minded people seek to learn by asking questions; they realize that what they know is little in relation to what there is to know and recognize that they might be wrong. Closed-minded people always tell you what they know, even if they know hardly anything about the subject being discussed. They are typically made uncomfortable by being around those who know a lot more about a subject, unlike open-minded people who are thrilled by such company.\n24d) Don\u2019t have anything to do with closed-minded, inexperienced people. They won\u2019t do you any good and there\u2019s no helping them until they open their minds, so they will waste your time in the meantime. If you must deal with them, the first thing you have to do is open their minds. Being open-minded is far more important than being bright or smart.\n24e) Be wary of the arrogant intellectual who comments from the stands without having played on the field. And avoid that trap yourself.\n24f) Watch out for people who think it\u2019s embarrassing not to know. They\u2019re dangerous.\n... 25) Make sure responsible parties are open-minded about the questions and comments of others. They are required to explain the thinking behind a decision openly and transparently so that all can understand and assess it. Further, in the event of disagreement, an\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the Culture Right Constantly Get in Synch\nappeal should be made to either the manager\u2019s boss or an agreed-upon, knowledgeable group of others, generally including people more believable than and senior to the decision-maker. The person(s) resolving the dispute must do this objectively and fairly; otherwise our system will fail at maintaining its meritocracy of ideas.\n... 26) Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are the means by which people determine whether their principles are\naligned and resolve their differences. I believe that in all relationships, including the most treasured ones, 1) there are principles and values each person has that must be in synch for the relationship to be successful and 2) there must be give and take. I believe there is always a kind of negotiation or debate between people based on principles and mutual consideration. What you learn about each other via that \u201cnegotiation\u201d either draws you together or drives you apart. If your principles are aligned and you can work out your differences via a process of give and take, you will draw closer together. If not, you will move apart. It is through such open discussion, especially when it comes to contentious issues, that people can make sure there are no misunderstandings. If that open discussion of differences doesn\u2019t happen on an ongoing basis, the gaps in perspectives will widen until inevitably there is a major clash. Ironically, people who suppress the mini-confrontations for fear of conflict tend to have huge conflicts later, which can lead to separation, precisely because they let minor problems fester. On the other hand, people who address the mini-conflicts head-on in order to straighten things out tend to have the great, long-lasting relationships. That\u2019s why I believe people should feel free to say whatever they really think.\n26a) Expect more open-minded disagreements at Bridgewater than at most other firms.\nThey fuel the learning that helps us be at our best. Sometimes when there are disagreements, people get angry. But you should remind them that the management at most other companies doesn\u2019t welcome disagreement or encourage open debate. As a result, there is less of both. So instead of getting angry, they should welcome the fact that disagreements and open debate are encouraged here.\n26b) There is giant untapped potential in disagreement, especially if the disagreement is between two or more thoughtful people - yet most people either avoid it or they make it an unproductive fight. That\u2019s tragic.53\n... 27) Know when to stop debating and move on to agreeing about what should be done. I have seen people who agree on the major issues waste hours arguing over details.\nIt\u2019s more important to do big things well than to do small things perfectly. Be wary of bogging down amid minor issues at the expense of time devoted to solidifying important agreements.\n27a) However, when people disagree on the importance of debating something, it should be debated. Operating otherwise would essentially give someone (typically the boss) a de facto veto right.\n27b) Recognize that \u201cthere are many good ways to skin a cat.\u201d Your assessment of how responsible parties are doing their jobs should not be based on whether they\u2019re doing it your\n53 Most people have a tough time disagreeing about the most trivial things, like whether they like the same restaurant, yet are happy to confidently express their opinions, however badly they are formed, if they get them out first. As a result, there is an overabundance of confident bad opinions around and very few thoughtful conclusions arising from learning from each other. It is common for conversations to be exchanges of sentences that begin \u201cI think...\u201d followed by their conclusions, and both parties believing that they had a good conversation and feeling good about each other, even though nothing was accomplished. If most people did the opposite\u2014i.e., if they sought out and open-mindedly explored their disagreements\u2014it would produce a radical increase in learning, and the world would be a much better place.\n\nway but whether they\u2019re doing it in a good way.\n27c) For disagreements to have a positive effect, people evaluating an individual decision or decision-maker must view the issue within a broader context. For example, if the responsible party being challenged has a vision, and the decision under disagreement involves a small detail, evaluate the decision within the context of the broader vision. The ensuing discussion resulting from challenging someone\u2019s decision will help people understand all the considerations behind it.\n27d) Distinguish between 1) idle complaints and 2) complaints that are meant to lead to improvement.\n... 28) Appreciate that open debate is not meant to create rule by referendum. It is meant to provide the decision-maker with alternative perspectives in anticipation of a better answer. It can also be used to enhance understanding of others\u2019 views and abilities and, over time, assess whether someone should be assigned a responsibility. It doesn\u2019t mean there can\u2019t be some designs in which a group oversees a person. But that\u2019s designed and embedded in the organizational structure, specifying the people responsible for oversight who are chosen because of their knowledge and judgment.\n... 29) Evaluate whether an issue calls for debate, discussion, or teaching. Debate, discussion, and teaching are all ways of getting in synch, but they work differently and the approach you choose should reflect your goal and the relative believability of the people involved. Debate is generally among approximate equals; discussion is open-minded exploration among people of various levels of understanding; and teaching is between people of different levels of understanding.\n29a) To avoid confusion, make clear which kind of conversation (debate, discussion, or teaching) you are having and recognize that the purpose is ultimately to get at truth, not to prove that someone is right or wrong.\n29b) Communication aimed at getting the best answer should involve the most relevant people. Not everyone should randomly probe everyone else, because that\u2019s an unproductive waste of time. People should consider their own levels of believability and understanding to assess if the probing makes sense. As a guide, the most relevant people are your managers, direct reports, and/or agreed experts. They are the most impacted by and most informed about the issues under discussion, and so they are the most important parties to be in synch with. If you can\u2019t get in synch, you should escalate the disagreement.\n29c) Communication aimed at educating or boosting cohesion should involve a broader set of people than would be needed if the aim were just getting the best answer. Less experienced, less believable people will be included. They may not be necessary to decide an issue, but if you aren\u2019t in synch with them, that lack of understanding will likely undermine morale and the organization\u2019s efficiency. In cases where you have people who are both not believable and highly opinionated (the worst combination), you will drive their uninformed opinions underground if you don\u2019t get in synch. Conversely, if you are willing to be challenged, and others behave the same way, you can demand that all critical communication be done openly.\nImagine if a group of us were trying to learn how to play golf with Tiger Woods, and he and a new golfer were debating how to swing the club. Would it be helpful or harmful to our progress to ignore their different track records and experience? Of course it would be harmful and plain silly to treat their points of view equally, because they have different levels of believability. It is better to listen to what Tiger Woods has to say, without constant interruptions by some know-nothing arguing with him. While I believe this is true, it would be\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the Culture Right Constantly Get in Synch\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the Culture Right Constantly Get in Synch\nmost productive if Tiger Woods gave his instructions and then answered questions. However, because I\u2019m pretty extreme in believing that it is important to obtain understanding rather than accepting doctrine at face value, I also think the new golfer shouldn\u2019t accept what Tiger Woods has to say as right only because he has won loads of tournaments and has years of experience playing golf. In other words, I believe the new golfer shouldn\u2019t stop questioning Tiger until he is confident he has found truth. At the same time, I also think the new golfer would be pretty dumb and arrogant to believe he\u2019s probably right and the champion golfer is wrong. So he should approach his questioning with that perspective rather than overblown confidence. It would be really bad for the group\u2019s learning if all the people in the group treated what the new golfer and Tiger Woods had to say as equally valuable. I feel exactly the same way about getting at truth at Bridgewater. While it\u2019s good to be open-minded and questioning, it\u2019s dumb to treat the views of people with great track records and experience the same as those without track records and experience.\n29d) Leverage your communication. While open communication is very important, the challenge is figuring out how to do it in a time-efficient way. It is helpful to use leveraging techniques like open e-mails posted on a FAQ board. If the reporting ratios are organized as described in the principles on organizational design, there should be ample time for this. The challenges become greater the higher you go in the reporting hierarchy because the number of people affected by your actions and who have opinions and/or questions grows larger than just two reporting levels down. In such cases, you will need even greater leverage and prioritization (e.g., having some of the questions answered by a well-equipped party who works for you, asking people to prioritize their questions by urgency or importance, etc).\n... 30) Don\u2019t treat all opinions as equally valuable. Almost everyone has an opinion, but many are worthless or harmful. The views of people without track records are not equal to the views of people with strong track records. Treating all people equally is more likely to lead away from truth than toward it. People without records of success who are nonetheless confident about how things should be done are either nai\u0308ve or arrogant. In either case, they\u2019re potentially dangerous to themselves and others. However, all views should be considered in an open-minded way, albeit placed in the proper context of experience and track record. Ultimately, the proof is in the pudding: can you handle your responsibilities well? As a general rule, if you can, then you can have an opinion of how to do it\u2014if you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t.\n30a) A hierarchy of merit is not only consistent with a meritocracy of ideas but essential for it. Not only is better decision-making enhanced, so is time management. It\u2019s not possible for everyone to debate everything all the time and still get work done effectively.\n... 31) Consider your own and others\u2019 \u201cbelievabilities.\u201d By believability, I mean the probability that a person\u2019s view will be right. While we can never know this precisely, we can roughly assess it according to the quality of a person\u2019s reasoning and their track record. Of course, different people will have different views of their own and other\u2019s believability, which is fine. Just recognize that this is a reality that is relevant in a number of ways. Ask, \u201cWhy should I believe you?\u201d and \u201cWhy should I believe myself?\u201d\n31a) Ask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion. As a general rule, if you have a demonstrated track record, then you can have an opinion of how to do it\u2014if you don\u2019t, you can\u2019t, though you can have theories and questions.\n31b) People who have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question and have great explanations when probed are most believable. Those with one of those two qualities are somewhat believable; people with neither are least believable.\nAt the same time, people\u2019s ideas should always be assessed on their merit in order to\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the Culture Right Constantly Get in Synch\nencourage them to always think in an open-minded way. I have seen that inexperienced people can have great ideas, sometimes far better than more experienced people, though often much worse. So we must be attuned to both the good and the bad and allow people to build their own track records and their own level of believability. Because of Bridgewater\u2019s radical openness, you can see how we make our assessments of that.\nSomeone new who doesn\u2019t know much, has little believability, or isn\u2019t confident in his views should ask questions. On the other hand, a highly believable person with experience and a good track record who is highly confident in his views should be assertive. Everyone should be upfront in expressing how confident they are in their thoughts. A suggestion should be called a suggestion; a firmly held conviction should be presented as such. Don\u2019t make the mistake of being a dumb shit with a confident opinion.\n31c) If someone asks you a question, think first whether you\u2019re the responsible party/right person to be answering the question.\n... 32) Spend lavishly on the time and energy you devote to \u201cgetting in synch\u201d because it\u2019s the best investment you can make. You will inevitably need to prioritize\nbecause of time constraints, but beware of the tremendous price of skimping on quality communication.\n... 33) If it is your meeting to run, manage the conversation. There are many reasons why meetings go poorly, but frequently it is because of a lack of clarity about the topic or the level at which things are being discussed (e.g., the principle/machine level, the case at hand level, or the specific fact level). To manage the meetings well:\n33a) Make it clear who the meeting is meant to serve and who is directing the meeting.\nEvery meeting is for the purpose of meeting someone\u2019s goals; that person is the responsible party for the meeting and decides what s/he wants to get out of it and how s/he will do so. Meetings without a clear responsible party run a high risk of being directionless and unproductive.\n33b) Make clear what type of communication you are going to have in light of the objectives and priorities. For example, if the goal of the meeting is to have people with different opinions work through their differences to try to get closer to what is true and what to do about it (i.e., open-minded debate), you will run it differently than if the meeting is meant to educate. Debating issues takes time. That time increases geometrically depending on the number of people participating in the discussion, so you have to carefully choose the right people in the right numbers to suit the decision that needs to be made. In any discussion try to limit the participation to those whom you value most in light of your objectives. The worst way to pick people is based on whether their conclusions align with yours.\n33c) Lead the discussion by being assertive and open-minded. Group-think and solo-think are both dangerous.\n33d) A small group (3 to 5) of smart, conceptual people seeking the right answers in an open-minded way will generally lead to the best answer. Next best is to have decisions made by a single smart, conceptual decision-maker, but this is a much worse choice than the former. The worst way to make decisions is via large groups without a smart, conceptual leader. Almost everyone thinks they\u2019re smart and conceptual, but only a small percentage of any group really is. Even when there is a large number of smart, conceptual leaders, more than five trying to make a decision is very inefficient and difficult. This is especially the case when people think they need to satisfy everyone.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the Culture Right Constantly Get in Synch\n33e) 1+1=3. Two people who collaborate well will be about three times as effective as the two of them operating independently because they will see what the other might miss, they can leverage each other, and they can hold each other to higher standards. This symbiotic relationship of adding people to a group will have incremental benefits (2+1=4.25) up to a point at which there are no incremental gains and beyond which adding people produces incremental losses in effectiveness. That is because 1) the marginal benefits diminish as the group gets larger\u2014e.g. two or three people might be able to cover most of the important perspectives so adding more people doesn't bring much more, and 2) larger group interactions are less efficient than smaller group interactions. Of course, what's best in practice is a function of 1) the quality of the people and the differences of the perspectives that they bring and 2) how well the group is managed. As noted before, each group should have someone who is responsible for managing the flow to get out of the meeting the most possible.\n33f) Navigate the levels of the conversation clearly. When considering an issue or situation, there should be two levels of discussion: the case at hand and the relevant principles that help you decide how the machine should work. Since the case at hand is a manifestation of one or more relevant principles, you need to clearly navigate between these levels in order to 1) handle the case well, 2) improve the machine so that future cases like this will be handled better in the future, and 3) test the effectiveness of your principles.\n33g) Watch out for \u201ctopic slip.\u201d Topic slip is the random and inconclusive drifting from topic to topic without achieving completion. Tip: Avoid topic slip by tracking the conversation on a whiteboard so everyone can see where you are.\n33h) Enforce the logic of conversations. There is a tendency for people\u2019s emotions to heat up when there is a disagreement, so focusing on the logic of your exchange will facilitate communication. If you are calm and analytical in listening to others\u2019 points of view, it is more difficult for them to shut down a logical exchange than if you get emotional or allow them to get emotional.\n33i) Worry about substance more than style. This is not to say that some styles aren\u2019t more effective than others with different people and in different circumstances, but don\u2019t let style or tone prevent you from getting in synch. I often see people complain about the delivery of a criticism in order to deflect from its substance. If you think someone\u2019s style is an issue, box it as a separate issue to get in synch about (start by asking whether it\u2019s true and whether it\u2019s important).\n33j) Achieve completion in conversations. The main purpose of discussion is to achieve completion and get in synch, which leads to decisions and or actions. Conversations often fail to reach completion. This amounts to a waste of time because they don\u2019t result in conclusions or productive actions. When there is an exchange of ideas, especially if there is a disagreement, it is important to end it by stating the conclusions. If there is agreement, say it; if not, say that. Where further action has been decided, get those tasks on a to-do list, assign people to do them, and specify due dates. Write down your conclusions, working theories, and to-do\u2019s in places that will lead to their being used as foundations for continued progress.\n33k) Have someone assigned to maintain notes in meetings and make sure follow-through happens. Generally speaking, to avoid distraction during the discussion itself, prioritizing follow-ups and assignments should be done afterwards.\n33l) Be careful not to lose personal responsibility via group decision-making. Too often groups will make a decision to do something without assigning personal responsibilities so it is not clear who is supposed to do what. Be clear in assigning personal responsibilities.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the Culture Right Constantly Get in Synch\n... 34) Make sure people don\u2019t confuse their right to complain, give advice, and debate with the right to make decisions. Discussion does not mean rule by referendum. While our culture is marked by extreme openness, some people mistakenly assume we have group decision-making in which all views are treated equally and consensus rules. Since not all views are equally valuable, I don\u2019t believe in consensus decision-making or referendums. We operate not only by open debate but also by clearly assigning personal responsibility to specific people. While these two values might seem at odds, personal responsibility and open debate work together to synthesize effective decision-making at Bridgewater. Everyone does not report to everyone here. Instead, responsibility and authority are assigned to individuals based on our assessment of their ability to handle them. I want the most capable individuals assigned to each job. We hold them accountable for their outcomes, but we also give them the authority to achieve those outcomes. It is perfectly okay for a responsible party to carry through a decision he thinks is best even when others who are knowledgeable disagree, although this disagreement should be considered and weighed seriously. We have, and should have, an explicit decision-making hierarchy, ideally based on merit.54\n... 35) Recognize that getting in synch is a two-way responsibility. In any conversation there is a responsibility to transmit and a responsibility to receive. Misinterpretations are going to take place. Often, difficulty in communication is due to people having different ways of thinking (e.g., left-brained thinkers talking to right-brained thinkers). The parties involved should 1) realize that what they might be transmitting or receiving might not be what was meant, 2) consider multiple possibilities, and 3) do a back and forth so that they can get in synch. People do the opposite \u2014 confidently thinking that they\u2019ve communicated their intent clearly, not considering multiple possibilities and then blaming the other parties for the misunderstanding. Learn lessons from your problems in communications to improve.\n... 36) Escalate if you can\u2019t get in synch. If you can\u2019t understand or reconcile points of view with someone else, agree on a third party to provide guidance. This person could be your manager or another agreed-upon, believable person or group who can resolve the conflict objectively, fairly, and sensibly. This mechanism is a key element of our culture and crucial for maintaining a meritocracy of ideas.\n\ufffc54 In fact, I once toyed with the possibility of developing a voting system based on a believability matrix. Though that might not be possible for practical reasons, it suggests the merit-based decision-making we aspire toward with our current process. The challenging and probing we encourage are not meant to second-guess every decision but to help us assess the quality of our work over time.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Recognize the Most Important Decisions You Make Are Who You Choose to Be Your Responsible Party\nTo Get the People Right...\n37) Recognize the Most Important Decisions You Make Are Who You Choose to Be Your Responsible Party\nSo...\n... 38) Remember that almost everything good comes from having great people operating in a great culture. I cannot emphasize strongly enough how important the selection, training, testing, evaluation, and sorting out of people is. If you put the goals and the tasks in the hands of people who can do them well, and if you make crystal clear that they are personally responsible for achieving the goals and doing the tasks, they should produce excellent results. This section is about the people part of the feedback loop process, diagramed below.\n... 39) First, match the person to the design. Understand what attributes matter most for a job, and then ascertain whether an individual has them. This matching process requires 1) visualizing the job and the qualities needed to do it well and then 2) ascertaining if the individual has those qualities.\nLook for believable responsible parties who love producing great results.55 Remember that values are most important\u2014e.g., if \u201cwork\u201d is what people have to do to make money, I don\u2019t want people to \u201cwork\u201d here. I only want people at Bridgewater who are joining us on an important, shared mission\n55 The thing that I like least (or dislike most) about my job is fighting to maintain standards, but it must be done. I know that the only way for me to succeed and to be happy is to have good people do it for me, which means that I have to hire, train, and sort out people. It is futile to give responsibilities to people who do not have the qualities required to succeed. It frustrates, and inevitably angers, all parties, which is subversive to the environment. So, hiring, training, and sorting out people so that responsibilities are placed in the hands of people who can be trusted to do an excellent job is the only viable path, and is extremely satisfying.\n\nto do great things.\n39a) Most importantly, find people who share your values. At Bridgewater, those key values are a drive for excellence, truth at all costs, a high sense of ownership, and strong character (by character, I mean the willingness to do the good but difficult things).\n39b) Look for people who are willing to look at themselves objectively and have character.\nThese are not natural talents\u2014they are qualities that anyone can acquire. They are also the qualities that have the biggest influence on whether or not I respect someone. They are essential for success.\n39c) Conceptual thinking and common sense are required in order to assign someone the responsibility for achieving goals (as distinct from tasks).\n... 40) Recognize that the inevitable responsible party is the person who bears the consequences of what is done. Because of this, the RP must choose wisely when\ndelegating responsibilities to others, and he must incentivize and manage them appropriately. There is no escaping that. For example, you are the inevitable RP for taking care of your health because you\u2019re the one who inevitably bears the consequences. If you\u2019re sick, you might choose to delegate the responsibility of figuring out what do to about it to a doctor. However, it is your responsibility to pick the right doctor because you will bear the consequences of that decision. While it is, of course, also the doctor\u2019s responsibility to handle the responsibilities that you delegate to him, you still need to make sure that his incentives are aligned with his responsibilities and that he is doing his job well. The inevitable responsible party can\u2019t delegate all his responsibilities away and expect good outcomes, even in cases in which he has no expertise. So you can\u2019t escape hiring and managing properly.\n... 41) By and large, you will get what you deserve over time. The results that you end up with will reflect how you and your people learn to handle things. So take control of your situation and hold yourself and others accountable for producing great results. People who wish for a great result but are unwilling to do what it takes to get there will fail.\n... 42) The most important responsible parties are those who are most responsible for the goals, outcomes, and machines (they are those higher in the\npyramid). Give me someone who can effectively be responsible for an area\u2014i.e., who can design, hire, and sort to achieve the goal, and I can be comfortable about all that is in that area. Therefore, they are the most important people to choose and manage well.\n... 43) Choose those who understand the difference between goals and tasks to run things. Otherwise you will have to do their jobs for them. The ability to see and value goals\nis largely innate, though it improves with experience. It can be tested for, though no tests are perfect.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Recognize the Most Important Decisions You Make Are Who You Choose to Be Your Responsible Party\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Recognize that People Are Built Very Differently\n44) Recognize that People Are Built Very Differently\nSo...\n... 45) Think about their very different values, abilities, and skills. Values are the deep- seated beliefs that motivate behaviors; people will fight for their values, and values determine people\u2019s compatibility with others. Abilities are ways of thinking and behaving. Some people are great learners and fast processors; others possess common sense; still others think creatively or logically or with supreme organization, etc. Skills are learned tools, such as being able to speak a foreign language or write computer code.\nWhile values and abilities are unlikely to change much, most skills can be acquired in a limited amount of time (e.g., most master\u2019s degrees can be acquired in two years) and often change in worth (e.g., today\u2019s best programming language can be obsolete in a few years).\nIt is important for you to know what mix of qualities is important to fit each role and, more broadly, with whom you can have successful relationships. In picking people for long-term relationships, values are most important, abilities come next, and skills are the least important.\n... 46) Understand what each person who works for you is like so that you know what to expect from them.\n... 47) Recognize that the type of person you fit in the job must match the requirements for that job.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Recognize that People Are Built Very Differently\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow People\u2019s Thinking Abilities Differ\nIn my many years of running Bridgewater I have learned that people\u2019s thinking abilities differ and that it is important to understand these differences so that they are appropriately considered when assigning people to roles. I have tried to find experts who understood these differences to help me better understand and test for them. I have found a few truly insightful people amid a mass of mediocrity.56 I have also found that there are all sorts of theories from all sorts of people about how people think and why, so very little should be treated as fact. It seems that \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and the reluctance to objectively discuss differences in innate abilities have stood in the way of forthright and thoughtful research on this important subject. While the search for good advice and tests has been challenging, it has also been invaluable. What follows is a mix of my theories based on my personal observations and a collection of valuable things I have learned from others.57 I know I have only scratched the surface of learning about how people think, why they think differently, and how to test for these different thinking abilities, so I am excited about the potential of learning more.\nI believe, but am not certain about, the following:\n\u2022 There are two big differences in how people think that are due to the brain\u2019s coming in two big halves and different people relying differently on them.58 This was explained by Caltech Professor Roger Sperry, who won a Nobel Prize in medicine for attributing these two ways of thinking to different reliances on the two hemispheres. As a result of this discovery, these two ways of thinking are called \u201cleft-brained\u201d and \u201cright-brained.\u201d Professor Sperry helped us understand that:\no The left hemisphere reasons sequentially, analyzes details, and excels at linear analysis. Left-brained thinkers do these things well. They are also called linear thinkers. When they excel at this type of thinking they are called \u201cbright.\u201d59\no The right hemisphere reasons holistically, recognizes themes, and synthesizes the big picture. Right-brained thinkers do these things well. People who think this way are also called lateral thinkers. Those who excel at this kind of thinking are called \u201csmart.\u201d60\nLong before I knew that there was a Professor Sperry I saw these differences. I bet you\u2019ve seen them too.\n\ufffc56 I have particularly valued psychologist Bob Eichinger.\n57 I am convinced that we are just scratching the surface of understanding differences in how people think and how to test for it, so there is great potential for others to follow this path. Unfortunately, most of the world\u2019s experts I have met are more theoretical than practical.\n58 A good book on this is A Whole New Mind by Daniel H. Pink, and a good article on the science of this is \u201cA Wandering Mind Heads Straight Toward Insight\u201d by Robert Lee Hotz from The Wall Street Journal.\n59 \u201cBright\u201d people have high IQs, are highly analytical thinkers, and can solve complex mental problems.\n60 \u201cSmart\u201d people have common sense, are good at synthesizing, and can imagine what is possible.\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcOn a scale of -5 to +5 \u2013 left-brained to right-brained \u2013 where do you think you fall? How confident are you that your self-assessment is right?\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Recognize that People Are Built Very Differently\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u2022 Some people see details (trees), and others see big pictures (forests). Those who \u201csee trees\u201d see the parts most vividly and don\u2019t readily relate the parts to each other in order to see the big picture\u2014e.g., they might prefer more literal, precise paintings. They are typically left-brained. Others connect the dots to pictures. In fact, they typically don\u2019t even see the dots; they just see the pictures. They are typically right-brained. You can detect which type people are by observing what they focus on. Detailed thinkers can lose sight of the big picture and are more likely to focus in on a part than to go to the higher level and see the relationship between parts. For example, a person who focuses on details can be thrown off by word mistakes like \u201cthere\u201c instead of \u201ctheir,\u201d while big-picture thinkers won\u2019t even notice the mistake. Similarly, big-picture thinkers can often understand the meaning of sentences even when key words are reversed\u2014e.g., when \u201cup\u201d is mistakenly used instead of \u201cdown,\u201d they understand that the person speaking couldn\u2019t have meant \u201cup\u201d in that context. That is because their attention is focused on the context first and the details second. When describing the same meeting, these two different types will frequently focus on completely different things and disagree on their interpretations. In discussions, they can frustrate each other and discount what the other is saying. Similarly, a person of one type interviewing another type will usually yield an unsatisfactory result.\n\u2022 Some people rely more on remembering what they were taught when making decisions, and others rely more on their independent reasoning. Let\u2019s call the first group memory-based learners and the second group reasoning-based thinkers. When using the word \u201clearning\u201d I intend to convey \u201cacquiring knowledge by being taught,\u201d and when using the word \u201cthinking\u201d I mean \u201cfiguring it out for oneself.\u201d Memory-based learners approach decision-making by remembering what they were taught. They draw on their memory banks and follow the instructions stored there. They are typically left-brained. Reasoning-based thinkers pay more attention to the principles behind what happens. They are typically right-brained. You can tell the difference when what is learned (e.g., CAPM) conflicts with what is logical (e.g., All Weather). People who rely on memory-based learning will typically be more skeptical of unconventional ideas because their process is to more readily accept what they have been told and because they are less able to assess it for themselves. Those who rely on more on reasoning won\u2019t care much about convention and will assess ideas on their merits. Those who rely on memory-based learning also tend to align themselves with the consensus more than people who rely on reasoning. Memory- based learners are more willing to accept the status quo, while reasoning-based thinkers are less biased by it. They are more likely to be innovative, while those who rely on learning are likelier to be cautious. Performance in school will correlate well with the quality of one\u2019s learning-based thinking, but will not reliably correlate with one\u2019s reasoning-based thinking. The most able learners are easily found, since they are, or were, the best students from the best schools. The best thinkers are tougher to find, as there are no obvious funnels through which they pass, especially before they develop track records in the \u201creal world.\u201d\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcOn a scale of -5 to +5 \u2013 \u201cdetailed\u201d to \u201cbig picture \u2013 where do you think you fall?

How confident are you that your self-assessment is right?\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Recognize that People Are Built Very Differently\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u2022 Some people are focused on daily tasks, and others are focused on their goals and how to achieve them. Those who \u201cvisualize\u201d best can see the pictures (rather than the dots) over time. They have a strong capacity to visualize and will be more likely to make meaningful changes and anticipate future events. They are the most suitable for creating new things (organizations, projects, etc.) and managing organizations that have lots of change. We call them \u201ccreators.\u201d They are typically right-brained thinkers. By contrast, those who are focused on the daily tasks are better at managing things that don\u2019t change much or require repetitive processes done reliably, and are typically best at doing clearly specified tasks. They see things much more literally and tend to make incremental changes that reference what already exists. They are slower to depart from the status quo and more likely to be blindsided by sudden events. They are typically left-brained thinkers.\n\u2022 Some people are \u201cplanners,\u201d and others are \u201cperceivers.\u201d Planners like to focus on a plan and stick with it, while perceivers are prone to focus on what\u2019s happening around them and more readily adapt to it. Perceivers see things happening and work backward to understand the cause and how to respond; they work from the outside in; they also see many more possibilities that they compare and choose from; often they see so many that they are confused by them. In contrast, planners work from the inside out, figuring out first what they want to achieve and then how things should unfold. Planners and perceivers have trouble appreciating each other. While a perceiver likes to see new things and change directions often, this is discomforting to planners, who prefer to stick to a plan. Planners weigh precedent much more heavily in their decision- making, and assume that if it was done before in a certain way, it should be done again in the same way, while perceivers tend to optimize on the spot. Planners are typically left-brained, and perceivers are typically right-brained.\n\u2022 Some people are driven more by their emotions, and others are driven more by their intellect. We all have emotions and intellect. When they conflict, some people will give in to their emotions, while others maintain control of their emotions and are driven by their intellect. I am told this is more due to relative reliance on the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, but I\u2019m not sure. Once again, these two different types typically can\u2019t understand and typically frustrate each other.\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcOn a scale of -5 to +5\u2014\u201ctasks\u201d to \u201cgoals\u201d\u2014where do you think you fall?

How confident are you that your self-assessment is right?\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcOn a scale of -5 to +5\u2014\u201cintrovert\u201d to \u201cextrovert\u201d\u2014where do you think you fall? How confident are you that your self-assessment is right?\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Recognize that People Are Built Very Differently\n... 48) Use personality assessment tests and quality reflections on experiences to help you identify these differences. These should be done openly so that these important differences are embraced and considered in our interactions.\n... 49) Understand that different ways of seeing and thinking make people suitable for different jobs. Since nature created different ways of thinking and since nature never creates anything without a purpose,61 each way of thinking has purposes. Often, thinking well for some purposes necessitates thinking poorly for others. It is highly desirable to understand one\u2019s own ways, and others\u2019 ways, of thinking, and their best applications. While there is no best quality, there are certainly some qualities that are more suitable for some jobs (e.g., being a math wiz is important for a job that requires a math wiz). So don\u2019t treat everyone the same.\nSometimes I see people dealing with each other, especially in groups, without regard for these differences. This is nonsensical. Both people expressing their own views and those considering others\u2019 views need to take into account their differences. These differences are real, so it\u2019s dumb to pretend they don\u2019t exist.\n49a) People are best at the jobs that require what they do well.\n49b) If you\u2019re not naturally good at one type of thinking, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re precluded from paths that require that type of thinking, but it does require that you either work with someone who has that required way of thinking (which works best) or learn to think differently (which is very difficult and sometimes impossible).\n... 50) Don\u2019t hide these differences. Explore them openly with the goal of figuring out how you and your people are built so you can put the right people in the\nright jobs and clearly assign responsibilities. This is good for both your team and for Bridgewater as a whole.\n... 51) Remember that people who see things and think one way often have difficulty communicating and relating to people who see things and think\nanother way. Keep in mind how difficult it is to convey what it means to think in an alternative way for the same reason it would be difficult to convey what the sense of smell is to someone who doesn\u2019t have the ability to smell.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Hire Right, Because the Penalties of Hiring Wrong Are Huge\n52) Hire Right, Because the Penalties of Hiring Wrong Are Huge\nSo...\n... 53) Think through what values, abilities, and skills you are looking for. A lot of time and effort is put into hiring a person, and substantial time and resources are invested in new employees\u2019 development before finding out whether they are succeeding. Getting rid of employees who aren\u2019t succeeding is also difficult, so it pays to be as sure as possible in hiring. Refer to our diagram that shows how to achieve your goals by comparing them with the outcomes you\u2019re getting, and think of the people part as shown below. By constantly comparing the picture of what the people are like with the qualities needed, you will hire better and evolve faster.\n... 54) Weigh values and abilities more heavily than skills in deciding whom to hire. Avoid the temptation to think narrowly about filling a job with a specific skill.62 While having that skill might be important, what\u2019s most important is determining whether you and they are working toward the same goals and can work in the same ways and share the same values.\n... 55) Write the profile of the person you are looking for into the job description.\n... 56) Select the appropriate people and tests for assessing each of these qualities and compare the results of those assessments to what you\u2019ve decided is needed for the job. Synthesize the results of those tests to see if there is a \u201cclick.\u201d\n56a) Remember that people tend to pick people like themselves, so pick interviewers who can identify what you are looking for. For example, if you\u2019re looking for a visionary, pick a visionary to do the interview where you test for vision. If there is a mix of qualities you\u2019re looking for, put together a group of interviewers who embody all of these qualities collectively. Don\u2019t choose interviewers whose judgment you don\u2019t trust (in other words, choose believable interviewers).\n56b) Understand how to use and interpret personality assessments. These can be a fantastic tool in your arsenal for quickly getting a picture of what people are like\u2014abilities, preferences, and style.\n62 The importance of a skill will vary according to the job. The more knowledge-dependent and independent in nature the job is (e.g., a programmer or lawyer whose job isn\u2019t to think about the direction of the company), the more relevant the required skills are.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Hire Right, Because the Penalties of Hiring Wrong Are Huge\nThey are often much more objective and reliable than interviews.\n56c) Pay attention to people\u2019s track records.\n56d) Dig deeply to discover why people did what they did. Knowing what they did is valuable only in helping you figure out what they are like. Understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d behind people\u2019s actions will tell you about their qualities and as a result, what you can probably expect from them.\n56e) Recognize that performance in school, while of some value in making assessments, doesn\u2019t tell you much about whether the person has the values and abilities you are looking for. Memory and processing speed tend to be the abilities that determine success in school (largely because they\u2019re easier to measure and grade) and are most valued, so school performance is an excellent gauge of these. School performance is also a good gauge for measuring willingness and ability to follow directions as well as determination. However, school is of limited value for teaching and testing common sense, vision, creativity, or decision-making.63 Since those traits all outweigh memory, processing speed, and the ability to follow directions in most jobs, you must look beyond school to ascertain whether the applicant has the qualities you\u2019re looking for.\n56f) Ask for past reviews. Don\u2019t rely exclusively on the candidate for information about their track record; instead, talk to people who know them (believable people are best), and look for documented evidence.\n56g) Check references.\n... 57) Look for people who have lots of great questions. These are even more important than\ngreat answers.\n... 58) Make sure candidates interview you and Bridgewater. Show them the real picture. For example, share these principles with them to show how we operate and why. Have them listen to the tapes to see the reality.\n... 59) Don\u2019t hire people just to fit the first job they will do at Bridgewater; hire people you want to share your life with. The best relationships are long term and based on shared\nmissions and values. Also, turnover is generally inefficient because of the long time it requires for people to get to know each other and Bridgewater. Both the people you work with and the company itself will evolve in ways you can\u2019t anticipate. So hire the kind of people you want to be with on this long-term mission.\n... 60) Look for people who sparkle, not just \u201canother one of those.\u201d I have too often seen people hired who don\u2019t sparkle, just because they have clearly demonstrated they were \u201cone of those.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for a plumber you might be inclined to fill the job with someone who has years of experience, without confirming whether he has demonstrated the qualities of an outstanding plumber. Yet the difference between hiring an ordinary versus an extraordinary plumber (or any other expert) is huge. So when reviewing a candidate\u2019s background, you must identify how this person has demonstrated himself to be outstanding. The most obvious demonstration is outstanding performance within an outstanding peer group. If you\u2019re less than excited to hire someone for a particular job, don\u2019t do it. The two of you will probably make each other miserable.\n63 Consider how few important decisions you make as a student from first grade through college. Other than deciding which college to attend in the senior year of high school and which major to pursue in the sophomore year of college, most people normally just do what they are told to do.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Hire Right, Because the Penalties of Hiring Wrong Are Huge\n... 61) Hear the click: Find the right fit between the role and the person. Remember that your goal is to put the right people in the right design. First understand the responsibilities of the role, then what qualities are needed to fulfill them excellently, and then ascertain whether an individual has them. This matching process requires 1) visualizing the job and the qualities needed to do it well and 2) ascertaining if the individual has those qualities. I describe this process as \u201chearing the click,\u201d because that\u2019s the sound of finding the right fit between the role and the individual.\n... 62) Pay for the person, not for the job. Look at what they were paid before and what people with comparable credentials get paid and pay some premium to that, but don\u2019t pay based on the job title.\n... 63) Recognize that no matter how good you are at hiring, there is a high probability that the person you hire will not be the great person you need for the job. Continue the \u201cinterviewing\u201d process as intensely after they are on the job as before, and don\u2019t settle.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and Operating a Machine to Achieve the Goal\n64) Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and Operating a Machine to Achieve the Goal\nSo...\n... 65) Understand the differences between managing, micromanaging, and not managing. Micromanaging is telling the people who work for you exactly what tasks to do and/or doing\ntheir tasks for them. Not managing is having them do their jobs without your oversight and involvement. Managing means: 1) understanding how well your people and designs are operating to achieve your goals and 2) constantly improving them. To be successful, you need to manage.\n65a) Managing the people who report to you should feel like \u201cskiing together.\u201d Like a ski instructor, you need to have close contact with your people on the slopes so that you can assess their strengths and weaknesses as they are doing their jobs. There should be a good back and forth with trial and error. With time you will be able to decide what they can and can\u2019t effectively handle on their own.\n65b) An excellent skier is probably going to be more critical and a better critic of another skier than a novice skier. A student probably thinks his ski instructor is fabulous, while an Olympic skier looking at the same ski instructor would assess him to be at a much lower level.\n... 66) Constantly compare your outcomes to your goals. Identify problems and diagnose whether the problems are with the way the organization is designed or with the way the people are handling their responsibilities. So remember how the following feedback loop to rapid improvement works.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and Operating a Machine to Achieve the Goal\nAnd remember to do this constantly so you have a large sample size. You want to have a large sample size because 1) any one problem can either be a one-off imperfection or symptomatic of root causes that will show up as problems repeatedly; and 2) looking at a large sample size of problems will make clear which it is. Also, the larger your sample size, the clearer the root causes of your problems, and the more obvious your solutions, will be.\nIf you do this constantly in this way, your evolutionary process should look like this:\n... 67) Look down on your machine and yourself within it from the higher level. Higher-level thinking doesn\u2019t mean the thinking done by higher-level beings. It means seeing things from a top-down perspective\u2014like looking at a photo of Earth from outer space, which shows you the relationships between the continents, counties, and seas, and then going down to a photo of your country, then down to your neighborhood, then down to your family. If you just saw your family without the perspective of seeing that there are millions of other families, and there have been many millions of other families over thousands of years, and observing how your family compares and how families evolve, you would just be dealing with the items that are coming at you as they transpire without the perspective.\n... 68) Connect the case at hand to your principles for handling cases of that type.\nRemember that every problem and task is just another \u201cone of those\u201d\u2014i.e., another one of a certain type. Figuring out what type it is and reflecting on principles for handling that type of issue will help you do a better job. Whether or not you use the principles written here, you still must decide on a course of action and what guiding principles will be effective. Through this process you will improve your principles as well as handle your issues better.\n... 69) Conduct the discussion at two levels when a problem occurs: 1) the \u201cmachine\u201d level discussion of why the machine produced that outcome and 2) the \u201ccase at hand\u201d discussion of what to do now about the problem. Don\u2019t make the mistake of just\nhaving the task-level discussion, because then you are micromanaging\u2014i.e., you are doing your managee\u2019s thinking for him and your managee will mistake your doing this as being OK, when that\u2019s not OK (because you will be micromanaging). When having the machine-level discussion, think clearly how things should have gone and explore why they didn\u2019t go that way. If you are in a rush to determine what to do and you have to tell the person who works for you what to do, point out that you are having to do this, make clear that you are having to do this and that is what you are doing, and make it a training experience\u2014i.e., explain what you are doing and why.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and Operating a Machine to Achieve the Goal\n... 70) Don\u2019t try to be followed; try to be understood and to understand others. Your goal is to understand what is true and improve together. If you want to be followed, either for an egotistical reason or because you believe it more expedient to operate that way, you will pay a heavy price in the long run. If you are the only one thinking, the results will suffer.\n70a) Don\u2019t try to control people by giving them orders. They will likely resent the orders, and when you aren\u2019t looking, defy them. An authoritarian approach also means you aren\u2019t developing your employees, and over time they will become increasingly dependent on you, which damages all parties. Instead, the greatest power you have over intelligent people\u2014and the greatest influence they will have on you\u2014comes from constantly getting in synch about what is true and what is best so that they and you want the same things. People must desire to do the right things, and this desire must come from them. You can, however, show them the connection between fulfilling their responsibilities and their own well-being. Reaching agreement will come only from radically open discussions in which you are fair, reasonable, and open-minded.\n70b) Communicate the logic and welcome feedback. When making rules or changes, explain the principles behind the decision. We want reasonable thinkers to operate sensibly. We achieve this through principles that are sound and well understood, applied and tested through open discussion. It is each person\u2019s job to 1) evaluate whether he agrees with a decision, and if not, explain why; and 2) hold each other accountable for operating consistently within the organization\u2019s principles. We want people who understand the principles that allow our community to succeed and possess strong ethics that motivate them to work by our rules, rather than to sneak around them. We want people who know that if the community works well, it will be good for them. We don\u2019t want people who need to be ordered and threatened. We don\u2019t want people who just follow orders.\n... 71) Clearly assign responsibilities. Eliminate any confusion about expectations and ensure that people view the failure to achieve their goals and do their tasks as personal failures.64The most important person is the one who is given the overall responsibility for accomplishing the mission and has both the vision to see what should be done and the discipline to make sure it\u2019s accomplished by the people who do the tasks.\n... 72) Hold people accountable and appreciate them holding you accountable. It\u2019s better for them, for you, and for the community. Slacker standards don\u2019t do anyone any good. People can resent being held accountable, however, and you don\u2019t want to have to tell them what to do all the time. Instead, reason with them, so that they understand the value and importance of being held accountable. Hold them accountable on a daily basis. Constant examination of problems builds a sample size that helps point the way to a resolution and is a good way to detect problems early on before they become critical. Avoiding these daily conflicts produces huge costs in the end.\n72a) Distinguish between failures where someone broke their \u201ccontract\u201d from ones where there was no contract to begin with. If you didn\u2019t make the expectation clear, you generally can\u2019t hold people accountable for it being fulfilled (with the exception of common sense\u2014which isn\u2019t all that common). If you find that a responsibility fell through the cracks because there was no contract, think about whether you need to edit the design of your machine.\n64 You learn principles by experiencing the rewards and punishments of your actions interacting with reality. The clearer the relationship is between cause and effect, the better it is for learning and evolving. So clearly designated responsibilities enhance the feedback and learning process. For example, if you are in the woods and have to survive on your own, the connection between your actions and their results is clearer and is all that matters. Blame doesn\u2019t enter into it as it gets you nothing. All that you focus on are the interactions between your actions and their results.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and Operating a Machine to Achieve the Goal\n... 73) Avoid the \u201csucked down\u201d phenomenon. This occurs when a manager is pulled down to do the tasks of a subordinate without acknowledging the problem. The sucked down phenomenon bears some resemblance to job slip, since it involves the manager\u2019s responsibilities slipping into areas that should be left to others. Both situations represent the reality of a job diverging from the ideal of that job. However, the sucked down phenomenon is typically the manager\u2019s response to subordinates\u2019 inabilities to do certain tasks or the manager\u2019s failure to properly redesign how the responsibilities should be handled in light of changed circumstances. You can tell this problem exists when the manager focuses more on getting tasks done than on operating his machine.\n73a) Watch out for people who confuse goals and tasks, because you can\u2019t trust people with responsibilities if they don\u2019t understand the goals.\nOne way to test this: if you ask a high-level question like, \u201cHow is goal XYZ going?\u201d a good answer will provide a synthesis upfront (of how XYZ is in fact going overall), and then support that assessment with the tasks done to achieve the goal. People who see the tasks and lose sight of the goals will just explain the tasks that were done and not make the connection to how those tasks relate to the machine that produces outcomes and achieves goals.\n... 74) Think like an owner, and expect the people you work with to do the same. You must act in the interest of our community and recognize that your well-being is directly connected to the well- being of Bridgewater. For example, spend money like it\u2019s your own.\n... 75) Force yourself and the people who work for you to do difficult things. It\u2019s usually easy to make things go well if you\u2019re willing to do difficult things. We must act as trainers in gyms act in order to keep each other fit. That\u2019s what\u2019s required to produce the excellence that benefits everyone. It is a law of nature that you must do difficult things to gain strength and power. As with working out, after a while you make the connection between doing difficult things and the benefits you get from doing them, and you come to look forward to doing these difficult things.\n75a) Hold yourself and others accountable. It is unacceptable for you to say you won\u2019t fight for quality and truth because it makes you or other people uncomfortable. Character is the ability to get yourself to do the difficult but right things. Get over the discomfort, and force yourself to hold people accountable. The choice is between doing that properly or letting our community down by behaving in a way that isn\u2019t good for you or the people you are \u201cprobing\u201d and coaching.\n... 76) Don\u2019t worry if your people like you; worry about whether you are helping your people and Bridgewater to be great. One of the most essential and difficult things you have to do\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and Operating a Machine to Achieve the Goal\nis make sure the people who work for you do their jobs excellently. That requires constantly challenging them and doing things they don\u2019t like you to do, such as probing them. Even your best people, whom you regularly praise and reward, must be challenged and probed. You shouldn\u2019t be a manager if you have problems confronting people or if you put being liked above ensuring your people succeed.\n... 77) Know what you want and stick to it if you believe it\u2019s right, even if others want to take you in another direction.\n... 78) Communicate the plan clearly. People should know the plans and designs within their departments. When you decide to divert from an agreed-upon path, be sure to communicate your thoughts to the relevant parties and get their views so that you are all clear about taking the new path.\n78a) Have agreed-upon goals and tasks that everyone knows (from the people in the departments to the people outside the departments who oversee them). This is important to ensure clarity on what the goals are, what the plan is, and who is responsible to do what in order to achieve the goals. It allows people to buy into the plan or to express their lack of confidence and suggest changes. It also makes clear who is keeping up his end of the bargain and who is falling short. These stated goals, tasks, and assigned responsibilities should be shown at department meetings at least once a quarter, perhaps as often as once a month.\n78b) Watch out for the unfocused and unproductive \u201cwe should ... (do something).\u201d Remember that to really accomplish things we need believable responsible parties who should determine, in an open-minded way, what should be done; so it is important to identify who these people are by their names rather than with a vague \u201cwe,\u201d and to recognize that it is their responsibility to determine what should be done. So it is silly for a group of people who are not responsible to say things like \u201cwe should...\u201d to each other. On the other hand, it can be desirable to speak to the responsible party about what should be done.\n... 79) Constantly get in synch with your people. Being out of synch leads to confused and inefficient decision-making. It can also lead you in conflicting directions either because 1) you are not clear with each other, which often generates wildly differing assumptions, or 2) you have unresolved differences in your views of how things should proceed and why. Getting in synch by discussing who will do what and why is essential for mutual progress. It doesn\u2019t necessarily entail reaching a consensus. Often there will be irreconcilable differences about what should be done, but a decision still needs to be made, which is fine. The process of getting in synch will make it clear what is to be done and why, even if it cannot eliminate difference. One of the most difficult and most important things you must do, and have others do, is bring forth disagreement and work through it together to achieve a resolution. Recognize that this process takes time. It can happen any way people prefer: discussion, e-mail, etc. You must have a workable process for making decisions even when disagreements remain. I discuss such a process in the earlier section on getting in synch.\n... 80) Get a \u201cthreshold level of understanding\u201d\u2014i.e., a rich enough understanding of the people, processes and problems around you to make well-informed decisions.\n... 81) Avoid staying too distant. You need to know your people extremely well, provide and receive regular feedback, and have quality discussions. Your job design needs to build in the time to do these things.\n81a) Tool: Use daily updates as a tool for staying on top of what your people are doing and thinking. Daily updates are brief descriptions of what the person did that day, what they are planning to do the next day, their problems, their questions, and their observations. They typically take about five minutes to write and do wonders for staying in touch.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and Operating a Machine to Achieve the Goal\n... 82) Learn confidence in your people\u2014don\u2019t presume it. It takes time to learn about people and what confidences can be placed in them. Sometimes new people are offended we don\u2019t yet have confidence in how they are handling their responsibilities. They think it\u2019s a criticism of their abilities when in fact it\u2019s a realistic recognition that we simply haven\u2019t had enough time or direct experience with them to form a point of view. No manager (including myself) should delegate responsibilities to people we don\u2019t yet know well enough to have confidence in. And new people shouldn\u2019t be offended if we haven\u2019t yet formed that confidence.\n... 83) Vary your involvement based on your confidence. Management largely consists of scanning and probing everything for which you are responsible to identify suspicious signs. Based on what you see, you should vary your degree of digging, doing more of it for people and areas that look more suspicious, and less of it where probing instills you with confidence. With the right tools in place and performing well, your scanning will include both reviewing the output of these tools (e.g., \u201cissues log,\u201d \u201cmetrics,\u201d \u201cdaily updates,\u201d and \u201cchecklists\u201d) and spot-checking.\n... 84) Avoid the \u201ctheoretical should.\u201d The theoretical should occurs when a manager theorizes that people should be able to do something when they can\u2019t or without actually knowing whether they can do it.\n... 85) Care about the people who work for you. If you are not working with people you care about and respect, this whole thing ain\u2019t worth it. If you don\u2019t believe that, you probably shouldn\u2019t work at Bridgewater. While it\u2019s desirable to convey these feelings, having them is more important. It is good to share your lives together, but not required. Be there for weddings, births, and funerals. This is something that I try to do but fail to do enough because of the numbers, so I convey that I will be there for anyone who really needs me. Personal contact at the time of personal difficulty is a must.\n... 86) Logic, reason, and common sense must trump everything else in decision- making.\n... 87) While logic drives our decisions, feelings are very relevant. A feeling is a reality\u2014and a good reality\u2014and it\u2019s up to management to deal with all realities sensibly. Good emotions are important. In fact, they are probably most important since they are the reasons behind the good things we do, e.g., satisfaction with a job wonderfully done and love of others. Emotions are bad only if they cloud judgment and take us away from what we want.\n... 88) Escalate when you can\u2019t adequately handle your responsibilities, and make sure that the people who work for you do the same. Escalating means saying that you don\u2019t believe that you can successfully handle a situation and that you are passing the \u201cresponsible party\u201d (RP) job to someone else. The person you are escalating to\u2014the person to whom you report\u2014can then decide whether to coach you through it, take control, have someone else handle it, or do something else. However, the boss should avoid being drawn into doing the job of the person who is failing without exploring why the job has not been done successfully without help. It\u2019s very important to get an accurate assessment of what each person can and can\u2019t do and why. If the boss just does the job for the person, even if it produces good results, we will lack the right attribution of success and failure. Remember that an important goal is to learn about what a person is like from testing, and that we want to get that information without crashing the car. So, the RP must either say that he can handle his job or that he cannot. And it is the responsibility of the boss to make the assessment of whether to remove the RP from the driver\u2019s seat because he might crash. We learn from mistakes by seeing our failures, feeling the pain of them, and reflecting and gaining insight. If the boss and the RP don\u2019t recognize the RP\u2019s failures to fix things, and the RP lacks the ability to do the job, trouble will result. Remember that life is the best teacher\u2014\u201cthe proof is in the pudding.\u201d So going through this process is essential to real learning.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and Operating a Machine to Achieve the Goal\n88a) Make sure your people know to be proactive. Demand that they speak up when they won\u2019t meet agreed-upon deliverables or deadlines. This communication is essential to getting in synch on both a project level and on a personal level.\n88b) Tool: An escalation button. Because there is confusion at times about whether responsible parties are conveying to their managers their problems or whether they are escalating, use an escalation button. This is a tool that makes clear to the manager that the managee is escalating.\n... 89) Involve the person who is the point of the pyramid when encountering material cross-departmental or cross sub-departmental issues. Imagine an organizational chart as a pyramid that consists of numerous pyramids, so:\nWhen issues involve parties that are not in the same part of the pyramid, it is generally desirable to involve the person who is at the point of the pyramid. The individual at the point has the perspective and knowledge to weigh the trade-offs properly and make an informed decision. Not involving the person at the point of the pyramid will likely cause problems. In the diagram above, if persons G and H are having an issue, who is the point of the pyramid? If persons F and I are having an issue, who is the point of the pyramid?65\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Probe Deep and Hard to Learn What to Expect from Your \u201cMachine\u201d\n90) Probe Deep and Hard to Learn What to Expect from Your \u201cMachine\u201d\nSo...\n... 91) Know what your people are like, and make sure they do their jobs excellently. This requires constantly challenging them and probing them. That\u2019s true even if your people are doing their jobs well, even though those people can be given more leeway.\n... 92) Constantly probe the people who report to you, and encourage them to probe you. Managers are much less able to discover the right things to do than most people assume. I know\nthat\u2019s true for me. The people who work for you should constantly challenge you, in order for you to become as good as you can be. Also, inviting criticism brings to the surface any subterranean discontent and makes the people working for you responsible for helping to find solutions. It\u2019s much easier for people to remain spectators offering unchallenged comments from the stands than to become players on the field. Forcing people onto the field strengthens the whole team. Communication is a two-way responsibility.\n92a) Remind the people you are probing that problems and mistakes are fuel for improvement.\nThey ought to understand that probing is good for them and everyone else. The main reason Bridgewater has improved at a much faster rate than most other companies over the past 30 years is that we seek out problems and find systematic ways of eliminating them. This approach has given us an unlimited supply of practical ways to improve.\n... 93) Probe to the level below the people who work for you. You can\u2019t understand how the person who reports to you manages others unless you know their direct reports and can observe how they behave with them. Also encourage the people who work two levels below you to bring their disagreements with their bosses to you.\n... 94) Remember that few people see themselves objectively, so it\u2019s important to welcome probing and to probe others.\n... 95) Probe so that you have a good enough understanding of whether problems are likely to occur before they actually do. If problems take you by surprise, it is probably because\nyou are either too far removed from your people and processes or you haven\u2019t adequately thought through how the people and processes might lead to various outcomes.\n95a) When a crisis appears to be brewing, contact should be so close that it\u2019s extremely unlikely that there will be any surprises.\n95b) Investigate and let people know you are going to investigate so there are no surprises and they don\u2019t take it personally.\n... 96) Don\u2019t \u201cpick your battles.\u201d Fight them all. If you see something wrong, even something small, deal with it. Because 1) small badnesses can be symptomatic of serious underlying problems; 2) resolving small differences of perception may prevent more serious divergences of views; and 3) in trying to help to train people, constant reinforcement of desired behavior is helpful. The more battles you fight, the more opportunities you will have to get to know each other and the faster the evolutionary process will occur.\n... 97) Don\u2019t let people off the hook. Ask the important, difficult questions, and independently audit.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Probe Deep and Hard to Learn What to Expect from Your \u201cMachine\u201d\n... 98) Don\u2019t assume that people\u2019s answers are correct. They could be erroneous theories or \u201cspin,\u201d so you need to occasionally double check them, especially when they sound questionable. Some managers are reluctant to do this, feeling as though it is the equivalent of saying they don\u2019t trust them. These managers need to understand and convey that trust in the accuracy of people\u2019s statements is gained or lost through this process. People will learn to be much more accurate in what they say to you if they understand this\u2014and increasingly, you will learn who and what you can rely on.\n... 99) Make the probing transparent rather than private. That will help to assure the quality of the probing (because others can make their own assessments), and it will reinforce the culture of transparency and freedom to find truth.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Evaluate People Accurately, Not \u201cKindly\u201d\n100) Evaluate People Accurately, Not \u201cKindly\u201d\nSo...\n... 101) Make accurate assessments. Since truth is the foundation of excellence and people are your most important resource, make the most precise personnel evaluations possible. This accuracy takes time and considerable back-and-forth. Your assessment of how responsible parties are performing should be based not on whether they\u2019re doing it your way but on whether they\u2019re doing it in a good way. Speak frankly, listen with an open mind, consider the views of other believable and honest people, and try to get in synch about what\u2019s going on with the person and why. Remember not to be overconfident in your assessments as it\u2019s possible you are wrong.\n101a) Use evaluation tools such as performance surveys, metrics, and formal reviews to document all aspects of a person\u2019s performance. These will help clarify assessments and communication surrounding them.\n101b) Maintain \u201cbaseball cards\u201d and/or \u201cbelievability matrixes\u201d for your people. Imagine if you had baseball cards that showed all the performance stats for your people: batting averages, home runs, errors, ERAs, win/loss records. You could see what they did well and poorly and call on the right people to play the right positions in a very transparent way. These would also simplify discussions about compensation, incentives, moving players up to first string, or cutting them from the team. You can and should keep such records of your people. Create your baseball cards to achieve your goals of conveying what the person is like. I use ratings, forced rankings, metrics, results, and credentials. Baseball cards can be passed to potential new managers as they consider candidates for assignments.\n... 102) Evaluate employees with the same rigor as you evaluate job candidates. Ask yourself: \u201cWould I hire this person knowing what I now know about them?\u201d I find it odd and silly that interviewers often freely and confidently criticize job candidates despite not knowing them well, yet they won\u2019t criticize employees for similar weaknesses even though they have more evidence. That is because some people view criticism as harmful and feel less protective of an outsider than they do of a fellow employee. If you believe accuracy is best for everyone, then you should see why this is a mistake and why frank evaluations must be ongoing.\n... 103) Know what makes your people tick, because people are your most important resource. Develop a full profile of each person\u2019s values, abilities, and skills. These qualities are the real\ndrivers of behavior, and knowing them in detail will tell you which jobs a person can and cannot do well, which ones they should avoid, and how the person should be trained. I have often seen people struggling in a job and their manager trying for months to find the right response because the manager overlooked the person\u2019s \u201cpackage.\u201dThese profiles should change as the people change.\n... 104) Recognize that while most people prefer compliments over criticisms, there is nothing more valuable than accurate criticisms. While it is important to be clear about what\npeople are doing well, there should not be a reluctance to profile people in a way that describes their weaknesses. It is vital that you be accurate.\n... 105) Make this discovery process open, evolutionary, and iterative. Articulate your theory of a person\u2019s values, abilities, and skills upfront and share this with him; listen to his and others\u2019 response to your description; organize a plan for training and testing; and reassess your theory based on the performance you observe. Do this on an ongoing basis. After several months of discussions and real-world tests, you and he should have a pretty good idea of what he is like. Over time this exercise will crystallize suitable roles and appropriate training, or it will reveal that it\u2019s time for the person to leave Bridgewater.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Evaluate People Accurately, Not \u201cKindly\u201d\n... 106) Provide constant, clear, and honest feedback, and encourage discussion of this feedback. Don\u2019t hesitate to be both critical and complimentary\u2014and be sure to be open-minded.\nTraining and assessing will be better if you frequently explain your observations. Providing this feedback constantly is the most effective way to train.66\n106a) Put your compliments and criticisms into perspective. I find that many people tend to blow evaluations out of proportion, so it helps to clarify that the weakness or mistake under discussion is not indicative of your total evaluation. Example: One day I told one of the new research people what a good job I thought he was doing and how strong his thinking was. It was a very positive initial evaluation. A few days later I heard him chatting away for hours about stuff that wasn\u2019t related to work, so I spoke to him about the cost to his and our development if he regularly wasted time. Afterward I learned he took away from that encounter the idea that I thought he was doing a horrible job and that he was on the brink of being fired. But my comment about his need for focus had nothing to do with my overall evaluation of him. If I had explained myself when we sat down that second time, he could have better put my comments in perspective.\n106b) Remember that convincing people of their strengths is generally much easier than convincing them of their weaknesses. People don\u2019t like to face their weaknesses. At Bridgewater, because we always seek excellence, more time is spent discussing weaknesses. Similarly, problems require more time than things that are going well. Problems must be figured out and worked on, while things that are running smoothly require less attention. So we spend a lot of time focusing on people\u2019s weaknesses and problems. This is great because we focus on improving, not celebrating how great we are, which is in fact how we get to be great. For people who don\u2019t understand this fact, the environment can be difficult. It\u2019s therefore important to 1) clarify and draw attention to people\u2019s strengths and what\u2019s being done well; and2) constantly remind them of the healthy motive behind this process of exploring weaknesses. Aim for complete accuracy in your assessments. Don\u2019t feel you have to find an equal number of \u201cgood and bad\u201d qualities in a person. Just describe the person or the circumstances as accurately as possible, celebrating what is good and noting what is bad.\n106c) Encourage objective reflection\u2014lots and lots of it.\n106d) Employee reviews: While feedback should be constant, reviews are periodic. The purpose of a review is to review the employee's performance and to state what the person is like as it pertains to their doing their job.\nA job review should have little surprises in it\u2014this is because throughout the year, if you can\u2019t make sense of how the person is doing their job or if you think it\u2019s being done badly, you should probe them to seek understanding of root causes of their performance. Because it is very difficult for people to identify their own weaknesses, they need the appropriate probing (not nitpicking) of specific cases by others to get at the truth of what they are like and how they are fitting into their jobs.\nFrom examining these specific cases and getting in synch about them, agreed-upon patterns will emerge. As successes and failures will occur in everyone (every batter strikes out a lot), in reviewing someone the goal is see the patterns and to understand the whole picture rather than to assume that one or a few failures or successes is representative of the person. You have to understand the person\u2019s modus operandi and that to be successful, they can\u2019t be successful in all ways\u2014e.g., to be meticulous they might not be able to be fast (and vice versa). Steve Jobs has been criticized as being autocratic and impersonal, but his modus operandi might require him being that way, so the real choice in assessing his fit for his job is to have him the way he is or not at all: that assessment must\n66 Child psychologists, dog trainers, and other behavior modification specialists will tell you that constant, no-exception feedback is fundamental to good training.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Evaluate People Accurately, Not \u201cKindly\u201d\nbe made in the review, not just a theoretical assessment that he should do what he is doing and be less autocratic.\nIn some cases it won\u2019t take long to see what a person is like\u2014e.g., it doesn\u2019t take long to hear if a person can sing. In other cases it takes a significant number of samples and time to reflect on them. Over time and with a large sample size you should be able to see what people are like, and their track records (i.e., the level and the steepness up or down in the trajectories that they are responsible for, rather than the wiggles in these) paint a very clear picture of what you can expect from them.\nIf there are performance problems, it is either because of design problems (e.g., the person has too many responsibilities) or fit/abilities problems. If the problems are due to the person\u2019s inabilities, these inabilities are either because of the person\u2019s innate weaknesses in doing that job (e.g., with a height of 5-foot-2, the person probably shouldn\u2019t be a center on the basketball team) or because of inadequate training to do the job. A good review, and getting in synch throughout the year, should get at these things.\nThe goal of a review is to be clear about what the person can and can\u2019t be trusted to do based on what the person is like. From there, \u201cwhat to do about it\u201d (i.e., how these qualities fit into the job requirement) can be determined.\n... 107) Understand that you and the people you manage will go through a process of personal evolution. Personal evolution occurs first by identifying your strengths and weaknesses, and\nthen by changing your weaknesses (e.g., through training) or changing jobs to play to strengths and preferences. This process, while generally difficult for both managers and their subordinates, has made people happier and Bridgewater more successful. Remember that most people are happiest when they are improving and doing things that help them advance most rapidly, so learning your people\u2019s weaknesses is just as valuable for them and for you as learning their strengths.\n... 108) Recognize that your evolution at Bridgewater should be relatively rapid and a natural consequence of discovering your strengths and weaknesses; as a result,\nyour career path is not planned at the outset. Your career path isn\u2019t planned because the evolutionary process is about discovering your likes and dislikes as well as your strengths and weaknesses. The best career path for anyone is based on this information. In other words, each person\u2019s career direction will evolve differently based on what we all learn. This process occurs by putting people into jobs that they are likely to succeed at, but that they have to stretch themselves to do well. They should be given enough freedom to learn and think for themselves while being coached so they can be taught and prevented from making unacceptable mistakes. During this process they should receive constant feedback. They should reflect on whether their problems can be resolved by additional learning or stem from innate qualities that can\u2019t be changed. Typically it takes six to 12 months to get to know a person in a by-and-large sort of way and about 18 months to change behavior (depending on the job and the person). During this time there should be periodic mini-reviews and several major ones. Following each of these assessments, new assignments should be made to continue to train and test them. They should be tailored to what was learned about the person\u2019s likes and dislikes and strengths and weaknesses. This is an iterative process in which these cumulative experiences of training, testing, and adjusting direct the person to ever more suitable roles and responsibilities. It benefits the individual by providing better self-understanding and greater familiarity with various jobs at Bridgewater. This is typically both a challenging and rewarding process. When it results in a parting of ways, it\u2019s usually because people find they cannot be excellent and happy in any job at Bridgewater or they refuse to go through this process.\n... 109) Remember that the only purpose of looking at what people did is to learn what they are like. Knowing what they are like will tell you how you can expect them to handle their responsibilities in the future. Intent matters, and the same actions can stem from different causes.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Evaluate People Accurately, Not \u201cKindly\u201d\n109a) Look at patterns of behaviors and don\u2019t read too much into any one event. Since there is no such thing as perfection, even excellent managers, companies, and decisions will have problems. It\u2019s easy, though often not worth much, to identify and dwell on tiny mistakes. In fact, this can be a problem if you get bogged down pinpointing and analyzing an infinite number of imperfections. At the same time, minor mistakes can sometimes be manifestations of serious root causes that could cause major mistakes down the road, so they can be quite valuable to diagnose. When assessing mistakes it is important to 1) ask whether these mistakes are manifestations of something serious or unimportant and 2) reflect on the frequency of them. An excellent decision-maker and a bad decision- maker will both make mistakes. The difference is what causes them to make mistakes and the frequency of their mistakes.\nThere is also a difference between \u201cI believe you made a bad decision\u201d and \u201cI believe you are a bad decision-maker,\u201d which can be ascertained only by seeing the pattern. Any one event has many different possible explanations, whereas a pattern of behavior can tell you a lot about root causes. There are many qualities that make up a person. To understand each requires 1) a reliable sample size and 2) getting in synch (i.e., asking the person why and giving feedback). Some qualities don\u2019t require a large sample size\u2014e.g., it takes only one data point to know if a person can sing\u2014and others take multiple observations (five to 10). The number of observations needed to detect a pattern largely depends on how well you get in synch after each observation. A quality discussion of how and why a person behaved a certain way should help you quickly understand the larger picture.\n109b) Don\u2019t believe that being good or bad at some things means that the person is good or bad at everything. Realize that all people have strengths and weaknesses.\n... 110) If someone is doing their job poorly, consider whether this is due to inadequate learning (i.e., training/experience) or inadequate ability. A weakness due to a lack of experience or training or due to inadequate time can be fixed. A lack of inherent ability cannot. Failing to distinguish between these causes is a common mistake among managers, because managers are often reluctant to appear unkind or judgmental by saying someone lacks ability. They also know people assessed this way tend to push back hard against accepting a permanent weakness. Managers need to get beyond this reluctance. In our diagram of thinking through the machine that will produce outcomes, think about...\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Evaluate People Accurately, Not \u201cKindly\u201d\n... 111) Remember that when it comes to assessing people, the two biggest mistakes are being overconfident in your assessment and failing to get in synch on that assessment. Don\u2019t make those mistakes.\n111a) Get in synch in a non-hierarchical way regarding assessments. The greatest single discrepancy between a manager and a managee is how well each performs his job. In most organizations, evaluations run in only one direction, with the manager assessing the managee. The managee typically disagrees with the assessment, especially if it is worse than the employee\u2019s self- assessment, because most people believe themselves to be better than they really are. Managees also have opinions of managers that in most companies they wouldn\u2019t dare bring up, so misunderstandings and resentments fester. This perverse behavior undermines the effectiveness of the environment and the relationships between people. It can be avoided by getting in synch in a high-quality way.\n111b) Learn about your people and have them learn about you with very frank conversations about mistakes and their root causes. You need to be clear in conveying your assessments and be open-minded in listening to people\u2019s replies. This is so they can understand your thinking and you can open-mindedly consider their perspectives. So together you can work on setting their training and career paths. Recognizing and communicating people\u2019s weakness is one of the most difficult things managers have to do. Good managers recognize that while it is difficult in the short term, it actually makes things easier in the long term, because the costs of having people in jobs where they can\u2019t excel are huge. Most managers at other companies dodge being as open with assessments as we insist on; more typically, managers elsewhere tend to be less frank in conveying their views, which is neither fair nor effective.\n... 112) Help people through the pain that comes with exploring their weaknesses.\nEmotions tend to heat up during most disagreements, especially about someone\u2019s possible weaknesses. Speak in a calm, slow, and analytical manner to facilitate communication. If you are calm and open to others\u2019 views, they are less likely to shut down logical exchanges than if you behave emotionally. Put things in perspective by reminding them that their pain is the pain that comes with learning and personal evolution\u2014they\u2019re going to be in a much better place by getting to truth. Consider asking them to go away and reflect when they are calm, and have a follow-up conversation in a few days.\n... 113) Recognize that when you are really in synch with people about weaknesses, whether yours or theirs, they are probably true. Getting to this point is a great achievement.\nWhen you reach an agreement, it\u2019s a good sign you\u2019re there. This is one of the main reasons why the person being evaluated needs to be an equal participant in the process of finding truth. So when you do agree, write it down on the relevant baseball card. This information will be a critical building block for future success.\n... 114) Remember that you don\u2019t need to get to the point of \u201cbeyond a shadow of a doubt\u201d when judging people. Instead, work toward developing a mutually agreed \u201cby-and-large\u201d understanding of someone that has a high level of confidence behind it. When necessary, take the time to enrich this understanding. That said, you should not aim for perfect understanding. Perfect understanding isn\u2019t possible, and trying to get it will waste time and stall progress.\n... 115) Understand that you should be able to learn the most about what a person is like and whether they are a \u201cclick\u201d for the job in their first year. You should be able to roughly assess someone\u2019s abilities after six to 12 months of close contact and numerous tests and getting in synch about them. A more confident assessment so that you can make a more confident role assignment will probably take about 18 months. This timeline will of course depend on the job, the person, the amount of contact with that person, and how well you do it. As I explain in the section on design, the ratio of senior managers to junior managers as well as the ratio of managers to the number of people who work two levels\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Evaluate People Accurately, Not \u201cKindly\u201d\nbelow them should be small enough to ensure quality communication and mutual understanding. Generally, that ratio should not be more than 1:10, preferably more like 1:5.\n... 116) Continue assessing people throughout their time at Bridgewater. You will get to know them better, it will help you train and direct them, and you won\u2019t be stuck with an obsolete picture. Most importantly, assess what your people\u2019s core values and abilities are and make sure they complement Bridgewater\u2019s. Since core values and abilities are more permanent than skills, they are more important to ascertain, especially at Bridgewater. As mentioned, you should be able to roughly assess people\u2019s abilities after six to 12 months of close contact and confidently assess them after 18 months.\nDon\u2019t rest with that evaluation, however. Always ask yourself if you would have hired them for that job knowing what you now know. If not, get them out of the job.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Train and Test People Through Experiences\n117) Train and Test People Through Experiences\nSo...\n... 118) Understand that training is really guiding the process of personal evolution. It requires the trainee to be open-minded, to suspend ego in order to find out what he is doing well and poorly, and to decide what to do about it. It also requires the trainer to be open-minded (and to do the other things previously mentioned). It would be best if at least two believable trainers work with each trainee in order to triangulate views about what the trainee is like. As previously explained, the training should be through shared experiences like that of a ski instructor skiing with his student\u2014i.e., it should be an apprentice relationship.\n... 119) Know that experience creates internalization. A huge difference exists between memory- based \u201cbook\u201d learning and hands-on, internalized learning. A medical student who has \u201clearned\u201d to perform an operation in his medical school class has not learned it in the same way as a doctor who has already conducted several operations. In the first case, the learning is stored in the conscious mind, and the medical student draws on his memory bank to remember what he has learned. In the second case, what the doctor has learned through hands-on experience is stored in the subconscious mind and pops up without his consciously recalling it from the memory bank. People who excel at book learning tend to call up from memory what they have learned in order to follow stored instructions. Others who are better at internalized learning use the thoughts that flow from their subconscious. The experienced skier doesn\u2019t recite instructions on how to ski and then execute them; rather, he does it well \u201cwithout thinking,\u201d in the same way he breathes without thinking. Understanding these differences is essential.67Remember that experience creates internalization. Doing things repeatedly leads to internalization, which produces a quality of understanding that is generally vastly superior to intellectualized learning.\n... 120) Provide constant feedback to put the learning in perspective. Most training comes from doing and getting in synch about performance. Feedback should include reviews of what is succeeding and what is not in proportion to the actual situation rather than in an attempt to balance compliments and criticisms. You are a manager, and you want your machine to function as intended. For it do so, employees must meet expectations, and only you can help them to understand where they are in relation to expectations. As strengths and weaknesses become clearer, responsibilities can be more appropriately tailored to make the machine work better and to facilitate personal evolution. The more intensely this is done, the more rapid the evolutionary process will be. So you must constantly get in synch about employee performance.\n... 121) Remember that everything is a case study. Think about what it is a case of and what principles apply.\n... 122) Teach your people to fish rather than give them fish. It is a bad sign when you tell people what they should do because that behavior typically reflects micromanagement or inability on the part of the person being managed. Instead, you should be training and testing. So give people your thoughts on how they might approach their decisions or how and why you would operate in their shoes, but don\u2019t dictate to them. Almost all that you will be doing is constantly getting in synch about how they are doing things and exploring why.\n67 I believe that school overrates the importance of intellectualized learning. People who were terrific in school and very good at this type of learning tend to overvalue it, or at least fail to distinguish it from the experiential/internalized kind of learning. This lack of differentiation can become a great peril later in life. Many people who have had great academic success need to be mindful of this challenge, especially if their success has been in the \u201csciences,\u201d such as math and engineering. I also believe this is why hands-on experience is particularly valuable for these types of people.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Train and Test People Through Experiences\n... 123) Recognize that sometimes it is better to let people make mistakes so that they can learn from them rather than tell them the better decision. However, since the\nconnections between cause and effect can be misunderstood, providing feedback for these people is essential to the learning process.\n123a) When criticizing, try to make helpful suggestions. Your goal is to help your people understand and improve, so your suggestions are important. Offering suggestions also helps those being criticized to understand that your goal is to help them and Bridgewater, not to hurt them.\n123b) Learn from success as well as from failure. Point out examples of jobs that are well done and the causes of success. This reinforces good behavior and creates role models for those who are learning.\n... 124) Know what types of mistakes are acceptable and unacceptable, and don\u2019t allow the people who work for you to make the unacceptable ones. When considering what\nfailures you are willing to allow in order to promote learning through trial-and-error, weigh the potential damage of a mistake against the benefit of incremental learning. In defining what latitude I\u2019m willing to give people, I say, \u201cI\u2019m willing to let you scratch or dent the car, but I won\u2019t put you in a position where I think there\u2019s a significant risk you could total it.\u201d\n... 125) Recognize that behavior modification typically takes about 18 months of constant reinforcement. The first step is intellectualizing the best way of doing things. If you\u2019re out of\nshape you must understand that you are out of shape, you must want to get in shape, and you must understand the way to get in shape: \u201cI want to be fit by eating well and exercising.\u201d Then the intellect will fight with desires and emotions. With determination, the intellect will overcome the impediments to doing what\u2019s necessary to achieve the goal, and the desired behavior will occur. After doing that consistently for 18 months, the new behavior will be internalized.\n... 126) Train people; don\u2019t rehabilitate them. Training is part of the plan to develop people\u2019s skills and to help them evolve. Rehabilitation is the process of trying to create significant change in people\u2019s values and/or abilities. Since values and abilities are difficult to change, rehabilitation typically takes too long and is too improbable to do at Bridgewater. If attempted, it is generally best directed by professionals over extended periods of time. People with inappropriate values and inadequate abilities to meet their job requirements have devastating impacts on the organization. They should be properly sorted (see the principles section on sorting).\n126a) A common mistake: training and testing a poor performer to see if he or she can acquire the required skills without simultaneously trying to assess their abilities. Skills are readily testable, so they should be easy to determine. Knowing them is less important than knowing people\u2019s abilities. That makes picking people with the right skills relatively easy. Abilities, especially right-brained abilities, are more difficult to assess. When thinking about why someone is a poor performer, openly consider whether it is a problem with their abilities. Values are the toughest and take the longest to assess.\n... 127) After you decide \u201cwhat\u2019s true\u201d (i.e., after you figure out what your people are like), think carefully about \u201cwhat to do about it.\u201dAs mentioned before, it\u2019s important to\nseparate thinking about \u201cwhat\u2019s true\u201d and thinking about \u201cwhat to do about it.\u201d Figuring out what\u2019s true takes time\u2014often several months filled with a large sample size. Figuring out what to do about it (i.e., designing) is much faster\u2014typically hours or days\u2014but it isn\u2019t instantaneous. Too often people either jump to decisions or don\u2019t make them.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Get the People Right Sort People into Other Jobs at Bridgewater, or Remove Them from Bridgewater\n128) Sort People into Other Jobs at Bridgewater, or Remove Them from Bridgewater\nSo...\n... 129) When you find that someone is not a good \u201cclick\u201d for a job, get them out of it ASAP. If you are expecting/wishing people to be much better in the near future than they have been in\nthe past, you are making a serious mistake\u2014instead, sort the people. People who repeatedly operated in a certain way probably will continue to operate that way because that behavior reflects what they\u2019re like. Since people generally change slowly (at best), you should expect slow improvement (at best), so instead of hoping for improvement, you need to sort the people or change the design to supplement them. Since changing the design to accommodate people\u2019s weaknesses is generally a bad idea, it is generally better to sort the people.\nSometimes good people \u201close their boxes\u201d because they can\u2019t evolve into responsible parties soon enough. Either there is a problem with their qualities or it will take too long to train them well. Some of these people might be good at another position within Bridgewater. Remember that identifying failure and learning from it are part of the evolutionary process. Make sure you record the reasons on the relevant \u201cbaseball card\u201d and think about what a good next step would be for that individual.\n... 130) Know that it is much worse to keep someone in a job who is not suited for it than it is to fire someone. Don\u2019t collect people. Firing people is not a big deal\u2014certainly nowhere near as\nbig a deal as keeping badly performing people, because keeping a person in a job they are not suited for is terrible both for the person (because it prevents personal evolution) and our community (because we all bear the consequences and it erodes meritocracy). Consider the enormous costs of not firing someone unsuited for a job: the costs of bad performance over a long time; the negative effect on the environment; the time and effort wasted trying to train the person; and the greater pain of separation involved with someone who\u2019s been here awhile (say, five years or more) compared with someone let go after just a year.\n... 131) When people are \u201cwithout a box,\u201d consider whether there is an open box at Bridgewater that would be a better fit. If not, fire them. Remember that we hire people not\nto fill their first job at Bridgewater nor primarily for their skills. We are trying to select people with whom we\u2019d like to share our lives. We expect everyone to evolve here. Because managers have a better idea of people\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and their fit within our culture than what emerges from the interview process, you have invaluable information for assessing them for another role at Bridgewater.\n... 132) Do not lower the bar. If a person can\u2019t operate consistently with our requirements of excellence and radical truth and can\u2019t get to the bar in an acceptable time frame, they have to leave. We want to neither lower the bar nor enter into a long-term rehabilitation program.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Know How to Perceive Problems Effectively\nTo Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems...\n133) Know How to Perceive Problems Effectively\nSo...\n... 134) Keep in mind the 5-Step Process explained in Part 2.\n... 135) Recognize that perceiving problems is the first essential step toward great management. As in nature, if you can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening around you, you will deteriorate and\neventually die off. People who can 1) perceive problems; 2) decide what to do about them; and 3) get these things done can be great managers.\n... 136) Understand that problems are the fuel for improvement. Problems are like wood thrown into a locomotive engine, because burning them up\u2014i.e., inventing and implementing solutions\u2014propels us forward. Problems are typically manifestations of root causes, so they provide clues for getting better. Most of the movement toward excellence comes from eliminating problems by getting at their root causes and making the changes that pay off repeatedly in the future. So finding problems should get you excited because you have found an opportunity to get better.\n... 137) You need to be able to perceive if things are above the bar (i.e., good enough) or below the bar (i.e., not good enough), and you need to make sure your people can as well. That requires the ability to synthesize.\n... 138) Don\u2019t tolerate badness. Too often I observe people who observe badness and tolerate it. Sometimes it is because they don\u2019t have the courage to make the needed changes, and sometimes it is because they don\u2019t know how to fix it. Both are very bad. If they\u2019re stuck, they need to seek the advice of believable people to make the needed changes, and if that doesn\u2019t work, they need to escalate.\n... 139) \u201cTaste the soup.\u201d A good restaurateur constantly tastes the food that is coming out of his kitchen and judges it against his vision of what is excellent. A good manager needs to do the same.\n... 140) Have as many eyes looking for problems as possible. Encourage people to bring problems to you and look into them carefully. If everyone in your area feels responsible for the well-being of that area and feels comfortable speaking up about problems, your risks of overlooking them will be much less than if you are the only one doing this. This will help you perceive problems, gain the best ideas, and keep you and your people in synch.\n140a) \u201cPop the cork.\u201d It\u2019s your responsibility to make sure that communications from your people are flowing freely.\n140b) Hold people accountable for raising their complaints. Ask yourself: 1) does someone think there\u2019s something wrong; 2) did this lead to a proper discussion; and 3) if they felt raising the issue didn\u2019t lead to the proper response, did they escalate it? That\u2019s how it should be.\n140c) The leader must encourage disagreement and be either impartial or open-minded.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Know How to Perceive Problems Effectively\n140d) The people closest to certain jobs probably know them best, or at least have perspectives you need to understand, so those people are essential for creating improvement.\n... 141) To perceive problems, compare how the movie is unfolding relative to your script\u2014i.e., compare the actual operating of the machine and the outcomes it is producing to your\nvisualization of how it should operate and the outcomes you expected. As long as you have the visualization of your expectations in mind to compare with the actual results, you will note the deviations so you can deal with them. For example, if you expect improvement to be within a specific range...\n... and it ends up looking like this...\n... you will know you need to get at the root cause to deal with it. If you don\u2019t, the trajectory will probably continue.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Know How to Perceive Problems Effectively\n... 142) Don\u2019t use the anonymous \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cthey,\u201d because that masks personal responsibility\u2014use specific names. For example, don\u2019t say \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cthey\u201d handled it badly. Also avoid: \u201cWe should...\u201d or \u201cWe are...\u201dWho is \u201cwe\u201d? Exactly who should, who made a mistake, or who did a great job? Use specific names. Don\u2019t undermine personal accountability with vagueness. When naming names, it\u2019s also good to remind people of related principles like \u201cmistakes are good if they result in learning.\u201d\n... 143) Be very specific about problems; don\u2019t start with generalizations. For example, don\u2019t say, \u201cClient advisors aren\u2019t communicating well with the analysts.\u201dBe specific: name which client advisors aren\u2019t doing this well and in which ways. Start with the specifics and then observe patterns.\n... 144) Tool: Use the following tools to catch problems: issues logs, metrics, surveys, checklists, outside consultants, and internal auditors.\n1) Issues log: A problem or \u201cissue\u201d that should be logged is easy to identify: anything that went wrong. The issues log acts like a water filter that catches garbage. By examining the garbage and determining where it came from, you can determine how to eliminate it at the source. You diagnose root causes for the issues log the same way as for a drilldown (explained below) in that the log must include a frank assessment of individual contributions to the problems alongside their strengths and weaknesses. As you come up with the changes that will reduce or eliminate the garbage, the water will become cleaner. In addition to using issues logs to catch problems, you can use them to measure the numbers and types of problems, and they can therefore be effective metrics of performance. A common challenge to getting people to use issues logs is that they are sometimes viewed as vehicles for blaming people. You have to encourage use by making clear how necessary they are, rewarding active usage, and punishing non-use. If, for example, something goes wrong and it\u2019s not in the issues log, the relevant people should be in big trouble. But if something goes wrong and it\u2019s there (and, ideally, properly diagnosed), the relevant people will probably be rewarded or praised. But there must be personal accountability.\n2) Metrics: Detailed metrics measure individual, group, and system performance. Make sure these metrics aren\u2019t being \u201cgamed\u201d so that they cease to convey a real picture. If your metrics are good enough, you can gain such a complete and accurate view of what your people are doing and how well they are doing it that you can nearly manage via the metrics. However, don\u2019t even think of taking the use of metrics that far! Instead, use the metrics to ask questions and explore. Remember that any single metric can mislead. You need enough evidence to establish patterns. Metrics and 360 reviews reveal patterns that make it easier to achieve agreement on employees\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. Of course, the people providing the information for metrics must deliver accurate assessments. There are various ways to facilitate this accuracy. A reluctance to be critical can be detected by looking at the average grade each grader gives; those giving much higher average grades might be the easy graders. Similarly helpful are \u201cforced rankings,\u201d in which people must rank coworker performance from best to worst. Forced rankings are essentially the same thing as \u201cgrading on a curve.\u201d Metrics that allow for independent grading across departments and/or groups are especially valuable.\n3) Surveys (of workers and of customers).\n... 145) The most common reason problems aren\u2019t perceived is what I call the \u201cfrog in the boiling water\u201d problem. Supposedly, if you throw a frog in a pot of boiling water it will immediately jump out. But if you put a frog in room-temperature water and gradually bring the water to a\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Know How to Perceive Problems Effectively\nboil, the frog will stay in place and boil to death. There is a strong tendency to get used to and accept very bad things that would be shocking if seen with fresh eyes.\n... 146) In some cases, people accept unacceptable problems because they are perceived as being too difficult to fix. Yet fixing unacceptable problems is actually a lot easier than not fixing them, because not fixing them will make you miserable.\nThey will lead to chronic unacceptable results, stress, more work, and possibly get you fired. So remember one of the first principles of management: you either have to fix problems or escalate them (if need be, over and over again) if you can't fix them. There is no other, or easier, alternative.\n146a) Problems that have good, planned solutions are completely different from those that don\u2019t.\nThe spectrum of badness versus goodness with problems looks like this:\na) They\u2019re unidentified (worst);\nb) Identified but without a planned solution (better);\nc) Identified with a good, planned solution (good); and d) Solved (best).\nHowever, the worst situation for morale is the second case: identified but without a planned solution. So it\u2019s really important to identify which of these categories the problem belongs to.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of\n147) Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of\nSo...\n... 148) Recognize that all problems are just manifestations of their root causes, so diagnose to understand what the problems are symptomatic of. Don\u2019t deal with your\nproblems as one-offs. They are outcomes produced by your machine, which consists of design and people. If the design is excellent and the people are excellent, the outcomes will be excellent (though not perfect). So when you have problems, your diagnosis should look at the design and the people to determine what failed you and why.\n... 149) Understand that diagnosis is foundational both to progress and quality relationships. An honest and collaborative exploration of problems with the people around you will give\nyou a better understanding of why these problems occur so that they can be fixed. You will also get to know each other better, be yourself, and see whether the people around you are reasonable and/or enforce their reasonableness. Further, you will help your people grow and vice versa. So, this process is not only what good management is; it is also the basis for personal and organizational evolution and the way to establish deep and meaningful relationships. Because it starts and ends with how you approach mistakes, I hope that I have conveyed why I believe this attitude about and approach to dealing with mistakes is so important.\n... 150) Ask the following questions when diagnosing. These questions are intended to look at the problem (i.e., the outcome that was inconsistent with the goal) as a manifestation of your \u201cmachine.\u201d It does this first by examining how the responsible parties imagined that the machine would have worked, then examining how it did work, and then examining the inconsistencies. If you get adept at the process, it should take 10 to 20 minutes. As previously mentioned, it should be done constantly so that you have a large sample size and no one case is a big deal.\n1) Ask the person who experienced the problem: What suboptimality did you experience?\n2) Ask the manager of the area: Is there a clear responsible party for the machine as a whole who can describe the machine to you and answer your questions about how the machine performed compared with expectations? Who owns this responsibility?\n\u2022 Do not mask personal responsibility\u2014use specific names.\n3) Ask the responsible party: What is the \u201cmental map\u201d of how it was supposed to work?\n\u2022 A \u201cmental map\u201d is essentially the visualization of what should have happened.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of\n\u2022 To be practical, \u201cmental maps\u201d (i.e., the designs that you would have expected would have worked well) should account for the fact that people are imperfect. They should lead to success anyway.\n4) Ask the owner of the responsibility: What, if anything, broke in this situation? Were there problems with the design (i.e., who is supposed to do what) or with how the people in the design behaved?\n\u2022 Compare the mental map of \u201cwhat should have happened\u201d to \u201cwhat did happen\u201d in order to identify the gap.\n\u2022 If the machine steps were followed, ask, \u201cIs the machine designed well?\u201d If not, what\u2019s wrong with the machine?\n5) Ask the people involved why they handled the issue the way they did. What are the proximate causes of the problem (e.g., \u201cDid not do XYZ\u201d)? They will be described using verbs\u2014for example, \u201cHarry did XYZ.\u201d What are the root causes? They will be descriptions. For example: inadequate training/experience, lack of vision, lack of ability, lack of judgment, etc. In other words, root cause is not an action or a reaction\u2014it is a reason.\n\u2022 Be willing to touch the nerve.\n6) Ask the people involved: Is this broadly consistent with prior patterns (yes/no/unsure)? What is the systematic solution? How should the people / machines / responsibilities evolve as a result of this\nissue?\n\u2022 Confirm that the short-term resolution of the issue has been addressed.\n\u2022 Determine the steps to be taken for long-term solutions and who is responsible for those\nsteps. Specifically:\na. Are there responsibilities that need either assigning or greater clarification? b. Are there machine designs that need to be reworked?\nc. Are there people whose fit for their roles needs to be evaluated?\n... 151) Remember that a root cause is not an action but a reason. It is described by using adjectives rather than verbs. Keep asking \u201cwhy\u201d to get at root causes, and don\u2019t forget to examine problems with people. In fact, since most things are done or not done because someone decided to do them or not do them a certain way, most root causes can be traced to specific people, especially \u201cthe responsible party.\u201d When the problem is attributable to a person, you have to ask why the person made the mistake to get at the real root cause, and you need to be as accurate in diagnosing a fault in a person as you are in diagnosing a fault in a piece of equipment.\nFor example, a root cause discovery process might proceed like this: - \u201cThe problem was due to bad programming.\u201d\n- \u201cWhy was there bad programming?\u201d\n- \u201cBecause Harry programmed it badly.\u201d\n- \u201cWhy did Harry program it badly?\u201d\n- \u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t well trained and because he was in a rush.\u201d\n- \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t he well trained? Did his manager know that he wasn\u2019t well trained and let him do the job\nanyway, or did he not know?\u201d\nUltimately it will come down to what the people or the design is like.\n... 152) Identify at which step failure occurred in the 5-Step Process. If a person is chronically failing it is due to either lack of training or lack of ability. Which was it? At which of the five steps did the person fail? Different steps require different abilities.\n1. Setting goals: This requires big-picture thinking, vision, and values that are consistent with those of our community. (It is helpful to ask whether the responsible party lost sight of the goals or whether he or she set goals that are inconsistent with Bridgewater\u2019s.)\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of\n2. Perceiving problems: This requires perception, the ability to synthesize, and an intolerance of badness (i.e., some people see badness but aren\u2019t sufficiently bothered by it to push themselves to eliminate it). Of course, having perspective (typically gained via experience) helps at all steps.\n3. Diagnosis: This requires logic, assertiveness, and open-mindedness. You must be willing to have open and/or difficult discussions to get at the truth.\n4. Design: This requires creativity and practical visualization.\n5. Doing the tasks: This requires determination and self-discipline.\nIf you 1) identify at which of these steps the chronic failures are occurring and 2) see which, if any, of these abilities the person is short of, you will go a long way toward diagnosing the problem.\n... 153) Remember that a proper diagnosis requires a quality, collaborative, and honest discussion to get at the truth. Don\u2019t just give your verdict without exploring the mistake, because there\u2019s a reasonably high probability that you don\u2019t know the answer. Do not be arrogant. You might have a theory about what happened, and that theory should be explored with relevant others. If you and others are open-minded, you will almost certainly have a quality analysis that will give everyone working theories to explore or you will reach conclusions that can be used for the design phase. And if you do this whenever problems recur, you and others involved will eventually uncover the root causes.\n... 154) Keep in mind that diagnoses should produce outcomes. Otherwise there\u2019s no purpose in them. The outcome might not take the form of an agreement, but at a minimum it should take the form of theories about root causes (which should be written down so you have a collection of synthesized dots to use for identifying patterns) and clarity about what should be done in the future to protect against them, or to gather information to find out.\n... 155) Don\u2019t make too much out of one \u201cdot\u201d\u2014synthesize a richer picture by squeezing lots of \u201cdots\u201d quickly and triangulating with others. A dot is a particular outcome. When you\ndiagnose to understand the reason it occurred, you are \u201csqueezing\u201d the dot. Don\u2019t try to squeeze too much out of a single dot\u2014it can only tell you so much. Rather, try to collect and squeeze a bunch of dots in an 80/20 way, triangulating with the dots of others, so that you can synthesize a pointillist painting of what the person is like.\n... 156) Maintain an emerging synthesis by diagnosing continuously\u2014You must be able to categorize, understand, and observe the evolution of the different parts of your machine/system through time, and synthesize this understanding into a picture of how your machine is working and how it should be modified to improve. But if you don\u2019t look into the significant bad outcomes as they occur, you won\u2019t really understand what they are symptomatic of, nor will you be able to understand how things are changing through time (e.g., if they are improving or worsening).\n... 157) To distinguish between a capacity issue and a capability issue, imagine how the person would perform at that particular function if they had ample capacity. Think back on how they performed in similar functions when they had ample capacity.\n... 158) The most common reasons managers fail to produce excellent results or escalate are:\na. They are too removed.\nb. They have problems discerning quality differences.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of\nc. They have lost sight of how bad things have become because they have gradually gotten used to their badness (the \u201cfrog in the boiling water problem\u201d).\nd. They have such high pride in their work that they can\u2019t bear to admit they are unable to solve their own problems.\ne. They fear adverse consequences from admitting failure.\n... 159) Avoid \u201cMonday morning quarterbacking.\u201d That is, evaluate the merits of a past decision based on what you know now versus what you could have reasonably known at the time of the decision. Do this by asking yourself, \u201cWhat should a quality person have known and done in that situation?\u201d Also, have a deep understanding of the person who made the decision (how do they think, what type of person are they, did they learn from the situation, etc).\n... 160) Identify the principles that were violated. Identify which of these principles apply to the case at hand, review them, and see if they would have helped. Think for yourself what principles are best for handling cases like this. This will help solve not only this problem but it will also help you solve other problems like it.\n... 161) Remember that if you have the same people doing the same things, you should expect the same results.\n... 162) Use the following \u201cdrilldown\u201d technique to gain an 80/20 understanding of a department or sub-department that is having problems. A drilldown is the process by which\nsomeone who wants to do so can gain a deep enough understanding of the problems in an area as well as the root causes, so that they can then go on to design a plan to make the department or sub-department excellent. It is not a \u201cdiagnosis,\u201d which is done for each problem. A manager doing ongoing diagnosis will naturally understand his areas well and won\u2019t have to do a drilldown. Drilling down is a form of probing, though it is broader and deeper. Done well, it should get you almost all the information needed to turn a department around in about five hours of effort.\nA drilldown takes place in two distinct steps: 1) listing problems and 2) listing causes/diagnosing. It is followed by 3) designing a plan. If done well, getting informed via the first two steps typically takes about four hours (give or take an hour), with the first step of listing the problems typically taking one to two hours and the second step of diagnosing them typically taking two to four hours, if done efficiently.\nIt\u2019s very important that these steps are done separately and independently. That\u2019s because going into two or three directions at the same time causes confusion and doesn\u2019t allow adequate discussion of each of the possible causes and solutions.\nHaving the people from the area under scrutiny actively participate in all three steps is critical. You need to hear their descriptions and allow them to argue with you when they think you are wrong. This way you are much more likely to come up with an accurate diagnosis and a good plan.\nAfter the drilldown, you will create the plan or design, which typically takes two to three hours. So the whole process, from asking the first question to coming up with the detailed plan, typically takes about five to eight hours spread over three or four meetings. Then there is step four\u2014the executing, monitoring, and modifying of the plan\u2014which typically takes six to 12 months.\nHere is more detail on each of the steps:\nStep 1\u2014List the problems. Don\u2019t confuse problems with possible solutions. Sometimes problems occur for rare or insignificant reasons because nothing is perfect. Don\u2019t pay much attention to those. But more often than not, they are symptomatic of something malfunctioning in your machine, so it pays to investigate what that is. For example, not having enough capacity is not a \u201cproblem\u201d; it might cause problems, but it\u2019s not a problem. Having people work so late that they might quit, getting out reports too late, etc., might be\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of\nproblems that are caused by a lack of capacity. But the lack of capacity itself is not a problem. To fix problems, you need to start with the specific problems and address them one by one and come up with very specific solutions. That\u2019s because there are lots of ways to solve problems. The problem of people working late at night might be solved by gaining capacity, or it might be solved by shifting work to another department, or by doing less, etc. To assume that lack of capacity is the problem could lead to inferior problem-solving. So unless you keep in mind the very specific problems, you will not be effective at solving them. In the process of solving problems, you will often see that several problems are due to the same cause (e.g., lack of capacity, a shortage of tech resources, bad management, etc.), but that is not the same thing as starting at the more general level (like saying that bad management or lack of capacity, etc., are problems), which is why I am saying you must start with very specific problems before making generalizations. For example, when you have a \u201cpeople problem,\u201d be specific. Specify which people you are having what problems with and avoid the tendency of saying things like, \u201cPeople in operations aren\u2019t...\u201d Avoid the tendency not to name names for fear of offending.\nStep 2\u2014Identify root causes. Root causes are the deep-seated reasons behind the actions that caused the problems. It is important to distinguish between proximate causes, which are superficial reasons for what happened (e.g., \u201cI missed the train because I didn\u2019t check the train schedule\u201d), and root causes (e.g., \u201cI didn\u2019t check the schedule because I am forgetful\u201d). Typically a proximate cause is the action that led to the problem while a root cause is the fundamental reason that action occurred. So, when diagnosing, if you are describing what happened or didn\u2019t happen to cause the problem, you are probably describing proximate causes. When you start describing the qualities that were behind these actions, you are probably getting at the root causes. To get at the root cause, keep asking why. For example, if the problem is that people are working late and the direct cause was that there wasn\u2019t enough capacity, then ask why there wasn\u2019t enough capacity. Then you will get closer to the root cause.\nIf your machine is producing outcomes that you don\u2019t want, either the design is flawed or the parts/people that you dropped into the design are malfunctioning. Most, but not all, problems happen because 1) it isn\u2019t clear who the \u201cresponsible party\u201d is for making sure things go well68 or 2) the responsible party isn\u2019t handling his or her responsibilities well (in other words, isn\u2019t operating according to the principles to eliminate the problem). So first ask, \u201cIs it clear who the responsible party is?\u201d If not, specify that. If it is clear, then ask, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he or she doing a good job?\u201d There are two possible reasons for someone doing a poor job: insufficient training or insufficient ability.\nThough it is essential to connect problems to the responsible parties, this can be difficult if the responsible parties don\u2019t acknowledge their mistakes and fail to diagnose why they made the mistakes. Still, clarity about responsibility and the problems\u2019 root causes must be achieved because otherwise there is no hope for improvement. If the responsible parties do not explicitly take responsibility for ensuring that their areas operate smoothly, their areas will not operate smoothly. An important first step toward achieving clarity is to remove the mentality of blame and credit, because it stands in the way of accurately understanding problems, and that\u2019s a prerequisite for producing improvements. Also, it is important not to judge too quickly what the root causes are. Instead, you should observe the patterns of problems using the issues log as a tool and discuss with the responsible parties what the root causes might be each time a problem arises. You probably won\u2019t initially be able to come to conclusions with a high degree of confidence, because there are many possible reasons for any one problem. But over time, the problems\u2019 patterns and causes will become clear to everyone.\nAs mentioned, there are two possible reasons why the responsible party handled something badly: 1) the responsible party didn\u2019t encounter this problem enough times previously to learn from it and prevent it in the future (by using the principles) or 2) the responsible party is unsuited for that job. And there are also two possible reasons the person is not suited for that job: 1) not enough experience or training and 2) lack\n68 Which would be because the manager\u2014the responsible party for making it clear who is responsible for what\u2014is failing to do that well.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of\nof values and/or abilities required to do the job well. So getting at the root causes is largely a matter of figuring out:\n1. Who is the responsible party for what went wrong?\n2. Did that person encounter the problem enough times that he or she should have either learned how not to repeat it or elevated it to someone who could have helped learn how to solve it? The conclusions could be the following: 1) If the person did encounter the problem enough times to have resolved or elevated it, then the person is not suitable for the job69;2) if the person did not encounter the problems enough times to resolve or elevate it, what are the probable root causes? The most common root causes are: 1) the person is not suitable for the job in some way (doesn\u2019t learn from mistakes, doesn\u2019t have a high sense of responsibility, is lazy, etc.); 2) the design of the process is flawed (e.g., the person is doing things in a way that can be improved); or 3) there is no possible solution. If it\u2019s the first root cause, the person should have their job changed; if it\u2019s the second, you and the person need to properly diagnose the problem and come up with a different process that will work; and if it\u2019s the third, you won\u2019t know that until you have thoroughly explored whether the process can be remediated.\nThat second alternative of trying to find a better process takes time and patience (involving you and the person properly diagnosing the problem and finding a different approach that works). Normally, this is the point at which most companies and people fail. That is because people often take the identification of a \u201cmistake\u201d as the equivalent of an accusation that they are flawed (dumb, lazy, etc.), so they become defensive. If instead they view the exercise as an investigation into how the process might be flawed, it\u2019s easier to make progress. So when criticizing, it\u2019s sometimes helpful to convey explicitly the point of the exercise: mutually diagnosing the problem and exploring the pros and cons of alternative approaches. You both need to be mindful that doing this well typically takes time and patience. One of the purposes of the brainstorming session is to do this, ideally with an agreed diagnosis resulting from it.\nStep 3\u2014Create a plan (brief notes):\n-Look at each root cause and ask yourself what should be done about it.\n-Creating a plan is like writing a movie script in that you visualize who will do what through time in order to achieve the goal.\n-Step away from the group to reflect and work on the plan, then bring it back to the group to discuss and modify.\n-When developing the plan, iterate through multiple possibilities and play them out in time to help determine the best choice.\n-Make sure to assign who is supposed to do what with rough target dates for achieving individual tasks of the plan. Once the plan design is complete, make sure the tasks, responsible parties, and timelines are reasonable and doable.\n-While everyone does not need to agree with the plan, it is important that the key people agree that it will work.\nStep 4\u2014Implement the plan (brief notes):\n- Give each person a monthly to-do list to provide clarity and transparency around responsibilities and expectations for that month. Then plot the progress in open, monthly meetings with all the relevant parties. Explicitly assess how the plan is working and deal with problems that aren\u2019t being resolved.\n-Make sure to hold responsible parties accountable for target dates and develop metrics around how they are meeting their commitments.\n69 That doesn\u2019t mean that all people have to solve and prevent all repeating problems or they shouldn\u2019t be in their jobs. That might not be possible because smaller, repeating problems might be consciously accepted until they become high enough priorities to be fixed. However, it does mean that repeating problems should be recognized and, if not able to be resolved, they must be elevated.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of\n-Regularly look at that list of assigned tasks to track progress and determine if any adjustments are needed.\n-Create transparency around the plan by posting it publicly and reviewing it regularly with the group. This helps people see the ways in which all of the problems are being addressed and reinforces accountability.\nDo not exclude any relevant people from the drilldown: besides losing the benefit of their ideas, you disenfranchise these people from the game plan and reduce their sense of ownership.\nRemember that people tell you things they want and tend not to be self-critical. It is your job as a manager to get at truth and excellence, not to make people happy. For example, the correct path might be to fire some people and replace them with better people, or to put people in jobs they might not want, etc. The brainstorming session must include a discussion of people\u2019s weaknesses and failings to get at truth and excellence. Everyone\u2019s objective must be to get at the best answer, not the answer that will make people happy. This is especially true for managers. In the long run, the best answers will be the ones that make the people we want to be at Bridgewater happiest.\n\nSo...\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Put Things in Perspective\n163) Put Things in Perspective\n... 164) Go back before going forward. Before moving forward, take the time to reflect on how the machine worked. By diagnosing what went right and what went wrong (especially what went wrong), you can see how the machine is operating and how it should be improved. People who are just focused on what they should do next are overly focused on the tasks at hand and not on how the machine is working; so they don\u2019t make sustainable progress.\nGo back by \u201ctelling the story\u201d to help put things in perspective. Sometimes people have problems putting current conditions into perspective or projecting into the future. Sometimes they disagree on cause-effect relationships, or focus on details rather than addressing the big picture. Sometimes they forget who or what caused things to go well or poorly. By asking them to \u201ctell the story\u201d of how we got here, or by \u201ctelling the story\u201d yourself, you put where you are in perspective. Doing this highlights important items that were done well or poorly in relation to their consequences, draws attention to the overarching goals, and helps achieve agreement. By telling the story from the past to the present, it will help you continue it into the future (i.e., design a plan). Making a good plan involves sketching out the important events through time and thinking through the specifics in sequence so that when you are done, the final story is vivid and easy to visualize. Then other people can understand the plan, comment on it, and eventually believe in it. It\u2019s also required for specifying who should do what and when.\n164a) Tool: Have all new employees listen to tapes of \u201cthe story\u201d to bring them up to date. Listen to some of the associated tapes about Bridgewater\u2019s story. Imagine how much better informed you would be than a person who just joined Bridgewater and hadn\u2019t listened to these stories.\n... 165) Understand \u201cabove the line\u201d and \u201cbelow the line\u201d thinking and how to navigate between the two. There are different levels and themes going on in any one conversation. It is\nimportant to know how to navigate them. If you imagine main points and subordinate points organized in outline form, an above-the-line discussion addresses the main points. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t reference details, because some details might be necessary to the discussion. But reference details solely for the purpose of understanding major points rather than dissecting minor points.\nFor example, suppose your major point is: \u201cSally can do that job well.\u201d In an above-the-line conversation, the discussion of her qualities would target the question of Sally\u2019s capacity to do her job. As soon as agreement was reached on whether she could perform competently, you would pass to the next major point\u2014such as what qualities are required for that job. In contrast, a below-the-line discussion would focus on Sally\u2019s qualities for their own sake, without relating them to whether she can do her job well. The discussion might cover qualities that are irrelevant to the job. While both levels of discussion touch on minor points, \u201cabove the line\u201d discourse will always move coherently from one major point to the next in much the same way as you can read an outline in order to fully understand the whole concept and reach a conclusion. You go \u201cbelow the line\u201d to the minor points only to illustrate something important about the major points and progress in an orderly and accurate way to the conclusion. Your ability to do this is partially innate but can be improved with practice.70\n70 Good conceptual thinkers naturally see things in this outline-like form and know how to navigate. They know whether they are having an above-the-line conversation and appropriately delving, and they know how to navigate between both levels. Poor conceptual thinkers tend to get confused because they see things as one big pile of information from which they pick data points almost at random.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Put Things in Perspective\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals\n166) Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals\nSo...\n... 167) Remember: You are designing a \u201cmachine\u201d or system that will produce outcomes. This machine will consist of distinct parts (i.e., people and other resources as well as the way they interact with each other).\n167a) A short-term goal probably won\u2019t require you to build a machine. But for an ongoing mission, you will need a well-designed and efficient machine.\n167b) Beware of paying too much attention to what is coming at you and not enough attention to what your responsibilities are or how your machine should work to achieve your goals. Constantly compare your machine\u2019s outcomes to your goals in order to reflect on how well the machine is operating. Examine both the design and how the individual parts are functioning.\n... 168) Don\u2019t act before thinking. Take the time to come up with a game plan. Take at least a few hours to think through your plan. Those hours will be virtually nothing in relation to the amount of time that will be spent doing, and they will make the doing radically more effective.\n... 169) The organizational design you draw up should minimize problems and maximize\ncapitalization on opportunities. Make the design an extension of your understanding of your problems and opportunities.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals\n... 170) Put yourself in the \u201cposition of pain\u201d for a while so that you gain a richer understanding of what you\u2019re designing for. Temporarily insert yourself into the flow to gain a real understanding of what you are dealing with (the process flow, the type of people needed, the potential problems, etc.) and to visualize a clear picture of what will work. You can accomplish this in a number of ways (reviewing work, doing work at different stages in the process, etc.).\n... 171) Recognize that design is an iterative process; between a bad \u201cnow\u201d and a good \u201cthen\u201d is a \u201cworking through it\u201d period. That \u201cworking through it\u201d period involves trying processes and people out, seeing what goes well or poorly, learning from the iterations, and moving toward having the right people in the ideal systematic design. Even with a good future design picture in mind, it will naturally take time, testing, mistakes, and learning to get to a good \u201cthen\u201d state.\n... 172) Visualize alternative machines and their outcomes, and then choose. A good designer is able to visualize the machine and its outcomes accurately, though imperfectly. First visualize the parts and their interactions, and then find the parts to fit the design. Look at all the system\u2019s pieces and their interactions. Imagine how goals 1, 2, and 3 can be achieved. Imagine how Harry, Larry, and Sally can operate in various ways with various tools and different incentives and penalties in place to achieve those goals. Then imagine how the system would work differently if you replaced Harry with George, or if it was configured in an entirely different way. Do this iteratively. Think through what the products and people and finances will look like month by month (or quarter by quarter) over the next year given one system; then change the system and visualize the outcomes again. At the end of this process, your plan should look like a realistic movie script, which describes the parties and their interactions through time. Remember that everything takes longer and costs more than you plan for. Recognize that some people are relatively better or worse at visualization. Accurately assess your own abilities and those of others so you can use the most capable people to create the visualization.\n... 173) Think about second- and third-order consequences as well as first-order consequences. The outcome you get as a first-order consequence might be desirable (or undesirable),\nwhile the second- or third-order consequences could be the opposite, so focusing solely on first-order consequences, which people tend to do, could lead to bad decision-making. Though I might not like the first-order consequences of a rainy day, I might love the second-order consequences. So if I were in a position to choose whether or not there should be rainy days, I would need to look at the second- and third- order consequences to make the right decision. For example, for every person you plan to hire, you will have to hire more to support them. I call this \u201cThe 1.6 Effect.\u201d\n... 174) Most importantly, build the organization around goals rather than tasks. As an example of building the organization around goals rather than tasks, we have traditionally had a marketing department (goal: to market) that is separate from our client service department (goal: to service clients), even though they do similar things and there would be advantages to having them work together. But because marketing and servicing clients are two distinct goals, we have a separate department for each. If they were merged, the department head, salespeople, client advisors, analysts, and others would be giving and receiving conflicting feedback. If asked why clients were receiving relatively poor attention, the answer might be: \u201cWe have incentives to raise sales.\u201d Asked why they weren\u2019t making sales, the merged department might explain that they need to take care of their clients. Keeping the two areas separate gives each department a clear focus and the appropriate resources to achieve its goals, makes the diagnosis of resource allocations more straightforward, and reduces \u201cjob slip.\u201d Of course, when building departments around goals, your goals have to be the right size to warrant these resources. An organization might not be big enough to warrant having a few salesmen and its own analytical group. Bridgewater has successfully evolved from a one-cell organization, in which most people were involved in everything, to the current multi- cell organization because we retained our ability to efficiently focus as the organization grew. Also, I want to make clear that temporarily sharing or rotating resources is OK, and is not the same thing as a merging of responsibilities. I will discuss merging later in this document, as well the coordination required to maintain focus in large organizations.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals\n174a) First come up with the best workflow design, sketch it out in an organizational chart, visualize how the parts interact, specify what qualities are required for each job, and, only after that is done, choose the right people to fill the jobs (based on how their capabilities and desires match up with the requirements).\n174b) Organize departments and sub-departments around the most logical groupings. Some groups naturally gravitate toward one another. Trying to impose your own structure without acknowledging these magnetic pulls is ineffective and likely will result in a bad outcome.\n174c) Make departments as self-sufficient as possible so that they have control over the resources they need to achieve the goals. We do this because we don\u2019t want to create a bureaucracy that forces departments to requisition resources from a pool that lacks the focus to do the job. People sometimes argue that we should have a technology department, but I am against that because building technology is a task, not a goal in and of itself. You build technology to perform valuable tasks. If we kept the tech resources outside the department, we would have people from various departments arguing about whose project is most important in order to garner resources, which isn\u2019t good for efficiency. The tech people would be evaluated and managed by bureaucrats rather than the people they do the work for.\n174d) The efficiency of an organization decreases and the bureaucracy of an organization increases in direct relation to the increase in the number of people and/or the complexity of the organization.\n... 175) Build your organization from the top down. An organization is the opposite of a building\u2014 the foundation is at the top. The head of the organization is responsible for designing the organization and for choosing people to fill its boxes. Therefore, make sure you hire managers before their direct reports. Managers can then help design the machine and choose people who complement the machine.\n175a) Everyone must be overseen by a believable person who has high standards. Without this strong oversight, there is potential for inadequate quality control, inadequate training, and inadequate appreciation of excellent work. Do not \u201cjust trust\u201d people to do their jobs well.\n175b) The people at the top of each pyramid should have the skills and focus to manage their direct reports and a deep understanding of their jobs. Here\u2019s an example of the confusion that can arise when that understanding is absent: It was proposed that the head of technology have the facilities group (the people who take care of facilities like the building, lunches, office supplies, etc.) report to him because both are, in a sense, \u201cfacilities\u201d and because they have some things in common, such as the electrical supply. But the head of technology didn\u2019t understand what the facilities people do. Having people who are responsible for the janitorial services and meals reporting to a technology manager is as inappropriate as having the technology people report to the person who is taking care of facilities. These functions, even if they\u2019re considered \u201cfacilities\u201d in the broadest sense, are very different, as are the respective skill sets. Similarly, at another time, we talked about combining folks who work on client agreements with those who do counterparty agreements under one manager. That would have been a mistake because the skills required to reach agreements with clients are very different from the ones required to reach agreements with counterparties. It was wrong to conflate both departments under the general heading of \u201cagreements,\u201d because each kind called for specific knowledge and skills.\n175c) The ratio of senior managers to junior managers and to the number of people who work two levels below should be limited, to preserve quality communication and mutual understanding. Generally, the ratio should not be more than 1:10, and preferably closer to 1:5. Of course, the appropriate ratio will vary depending on how many people your direct reports have reporting to them, the complexity of the jobs they\u2019re doing, and the manager\u2019s ability to handle several people or projects at once.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals\n175d) The number of layers from top to bottom and the ratio of managers to their direct reports will limit the size of an effective organization.\n175e) The larger the organization, the more important are 1) information technology expertise in management and 2) cross-department communication (more on these later).\n175f) Do not build the organization to fit the people. Jobs are created based on the work that needs to be done, not what people want to do or what people are available. You can always search outside Bridgewater to find the people who \u201cclick\u201d best for a particular role.\n... 176) Have the clearest possible delineation of responsibilities and reporting lines. It\u2019s required both within and between departments. Make sure reporting lines and designated responsibilities are clear. To avoid confusion, people should not report to two different departments. Dual reporting (reporting across department lines) causes confusion, complicates prioritization, diminishes focus on clear goals, and muddies the lines of supervision and accountability, especially when a person reports to two people in two different departments. When situations require dual reporting, managers need to be informed. Asking someone from another department to do a task without consulting with his or her manager is strictly prohibited (unless the request will take less than an hour or so). However, appointing co- heads of a department or a sub-department can work well if the managers are in synch and combine complementary and essential strengths to this area; dual reporting in that case can work fine if properly coordinated by the co-heads.\n176a) Create an organizational chart to look like a pyramid, with straight lines down that don\u2019t cross. A series of descending pyramids make up the whole pyramid, but the number of layers should be limited to minimize hierarchy.\n... 177) Constantly think about how to produce leverage. For example, to make training as easy to leverage as possible, document the most common questions and answers through audio, video, or written guidelines and then assign someone to regularly organize them into a manual. Technology can do most tasks, so think creatively about how to design tools that will provide leverage for you and the people who work for you.\n177a) You should be able to delegate the details away. If you can\u2019t, you either have problems with managing or training or you have the wrong people doing the job. The real sign of a master manager is that he doesn\u2019t have to \u201cdo\u201d practically anything. Of course, a great manager has to hire and oversee the people who do things; but a \u201csupreme master\u201d manager can even hire a person or two to do this and has achieved such leverage that things are effortlessly running superbly. Of course, there is a continuum related to this. The main message I\u2019m trying to convey is that managers should strive to hire, train, and oversee in a way in which others can superbly handle as much as possible on their own. Managers should view the need to get involved in the nitty-gritty themselves as a bad sign.\n177b) It is far better to find a few smart people and give them the best technology than to have a greater number of ordinary and less well-equipped people. First of all, great people and great technology are almost always a great value because their effectiveness in enhancing the organization\u2019s productivity can be enormous. Second, it is desirable to have smart people have the widest possible span of understanding and control because fragmented understanding and control create inefficiencies and undermine organizational cohesion. Usually it is the person\u2019s capacity that limits the scope of his understanding and control. So the mix of really smart people operating with really great technology in a streamlined organization is optimal for organizational efficiency.\n177c) Use \u201cleveragers.\u201d Leveragers are capable of doing a lot to get your concepts implemented. Conceptualizing and managing are most important and take only about 10% of the time needed for implementing; so if you have good leveragers, you can accomplish a lot more with relative ease.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals\n... 178) Understand the clover-leaf design. Find two or three responsible parties who have overlapping believabilities and responsibilities and who are willing to challenge and check each other. If you do this, and those people are willing to fight for what they believe is best by being open-minded and assertive at the same time, and if they escalate their disagreements and failures to you, this process will have a high probability of sorting issues that they can probably handle well from issues that you should examine and resolve with them.\n... 179) Don\u2019t do work for people in another department or grab people from another department to do work for you unless you speak to the boss.\n... 180) Watch out for \u201cdepartment slip.\u201d This happens when a support department, such as HR or Facilities, mistakes its responsibilities to provide support with a responsibility to determine how the thing they are supporting should be done. An example of this sort of mistake is if those in the Recruiting department think they should determine whom we should hire or if people in HR think they should determine what our employment policies should be. Another example would be if the Facilities group determined what facilities we should have. While support departments should know the goals of the people they\u2019re supporting and provide feedback regarding possible choices, they are not the ones to determine the vision.\n... 181) Assign responsibilities based on workflow design and people\u2019s abilities, not job titles. What people do should primarily be a function of the job they have, and it should be pretty obvious\nwho should do what (if they\u2019re suited for the job). For example, just because someone is responsible for \u201chuman resources,\u201d \u201crecruiting,\u201d \u201clegal,\u201d \u201cprogramming,\u201d etc., doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are the appropriate person to do everything associated with those functions. For example, though \u201cHuman Resources\u201d people help with hiring, firing, and providing benefits, it would be a mistake to give them the responsibility of determining who gets hired and fired and what benefits are provided to employees. When assigning responsibilities, think about both the workflow design and a person\u2019s abilities, not the job title.\n... 182) Watch out for consultant addiction. Beware of the chronic use of consultants to do work that should be done by employees.\n... 183) Tool: Maintain a procedures manual. This is the document in which you describe how all of the pieces of your machine work. There needs to be enough specificity so that operators of the different pieces of the machine can refer to the manual to help them do their job. The manual should be a living document that includes output from the issues log so that mistakes already identified and diagnosed aren\u2019t repeated. It prevents forgetting previous learning and facilitates communication.\n... 184) Tool: Use checklists. When people are assigned tasks, it is generally desirable to have these captured on checklists so they can check off each item as it is done. If not, there is a risk that people will gradually not do the agreed tasks or there will be lack of clarity. Crossing items off a checklist will serve as a task reminder and confirmation of what has been done.\n184a) Don\u2019t confuse checklists with personal responsibility. People should be expected to do their job well, not just what is on their checklists.\n184b) Remember that \u201csystematic\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean computerized. It might mean having people do specified tasks and indicate that they have done them with checklists.\n184c) Use \u201cdouble-do\u201d rather than \u201cdouble-check\u201d to make sure mission-critical tasks are done correctly. When people double-check someone else\u2019s work, there is a much lower rate of catching errors than when two parties independently do the work and the results are compared. Double-doing is having two different people doing the same task on the same job so that two independent answers are derived. By comparing them you will not only assure better answers but you will see the\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals\ndifferences in people\u2019s performances and make much more rapid improvement. I use double-dos in critical areas such as finance, where large amounts of money are involved.\n... 185) Watch out for \u201cjob slip.\u201dJob slip is when a job changes without being explicitly thought through and agreed to, generally because of changing circumstances or a temporary necessity. Job slip will generally cause bad job design. It often leads to the wrong people handling the wrong responsibilities and confusion over who is supposed to do what.\n... 186) Think clearly how things should go, and when they aren\u2019t going that way, acknowledge it and investigate. First decide which issue to address first: finding the reason the\nmachine isn\u2019t working well or executing the tasks required to get past the problem (in which case you need to come back to the reasons later). Either way, don\u2019t pass the problem by without discussing the reasons. Otherwise, you will end up with job slip.\n... 187) Have good controls so that you are not exposed to the dishonesty of others and trust is never an issue. A higher percentage of the population than you might imagine will cheat if\ngiven an opportunity, and most people who are given the choice of being \u201cfair\u201d with you and taking more for themselves will choose taking more for themselves. Even a tiny amount of cheating is intolerable, so your happiness and success will depend on your controls. Security controls should be viewed as a necessary tool of our profession, not as a personal affront to an individual\u2019s integrity. Just as a bank teller doesn\u2019t view a check on the money in his drawer as an indication that the bank thinks he is dishonest, everyone here should understand the need for our security controls. Explain this to your people so they see it in the proper context. Even the best controls will never be foolproof, and trustworthiness is a quality that should be appreciated.\n187a) People doing auditing should report to people outside the department being audited, and auditing procedures should not be made known to those being audited.\n187b) Remember: There is no sense in having laws unless you have policemen (auditors).\n\nSo...\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems Do What You Set Out to Do\n188) Do What You Set Out to Do\n... 189) Push through! You can make great things happen, but you must MAKE great things happen. Times will come when the choice will be to plod along normally or to push through to achieve the goal. The choice should be obvious.71\n\ufffc71 As Lee Ann Womack\u2019s country and western song says, when you have a choice between sitting it out or dancing, I hope you'll dance.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Make Decisions Effectively Recognize the Power of Knowing How to Deal with Not Knowing\nTo Make Decisions Effectively...\n190) Recognize the Power of Knowing How to Deal with Not Knowing\nSo...\n... 191) Recognize that your goal is to come up with the best answer, that the probability of your having it is small, and that even if you have it, you can\u2019t be confident that you do have it unless you have other believable people test you.\n... 192) Understand that the ability to deal with not knowing is far more powerful than knowing. That is because there\u2019s way more that we don\u2019t know than what we could possibly ever know.\n192a) Embrace the power of asking: \u201cWhat don\u2019t I know, and what should I do about it?\u201d Generally you should find believable people and ask their advice, remembering that you are looking to understand their reasoning rather than get their conclusions.\n192b) Finding the path to success is at least as dependent on coming up with the right questions as coming up with answers. Successful people are great at asking the important questions and then finding the answers. When faced with a problem, they first ask themselves if they know all the important questions about it; they are objective in assessing the probability that they have the answers; and they are good at open-mindedly seeking believable people to ask.\n... 193) Remember that your goal is to find the best answer, not to give the best one you have. The answer doesn\u2019t have to be in your head; you can look outside of you. In life the goal is for you\nto do the right thing, considering the probability that you might be wrong. So it is invaluable to know what you don\u2019t know so that you can figure out a way to find out and/or to get help from others.\n... 194) While everyone has the right to have questions and theories, only believable people have the right to have opinions. If you can\u2019t successfully ski down a difficult slope, you\nshouldn\u2019t tell others how to do it, though you can ask questions about it and even express your views about possible ways if you make clear that you are unsure.\n... 195) Constantly worry about what you are missing. Even if you acknowledge you are a \u201cdumb shit\u201d and are following the principles and are designing around your weaknesses, understand that you still might be missing things. You will get better and be safer this way.\n195a) Successful people ask for the criticism of others and consider its merit.\n195b) Triangulate your view. Never make any important decisions without asking at least three believable people. Don\u2019t ask them for their conclusions or just do what they tell you to do. Understand, visualize, and assess their reasoning to see if it makes sense to you. Ask them to probe your own reasoning. That\u2019s critical to your learning as well as to your successful handling of your responsibilities.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Make Decisions Effectively Make All Decisions Logically, as Expected Value Calculations\n196) Make All Decisions Logically, as Expected Value Calculations\nSo...\n... 197) Considering both the probabilities and the payoffs of the consequences, make sure that the probability of the unacceptable (i.e., the risk of ruin) is nil.\n197a) The cost of a bad decision is equal to or greater than the reward of a good decision, so knowing what you don\u2019t know is at least as valuable as knowing.\n197b) Recognize opportunities where there isn\u2019t much to lose and a lot to gain, even if the probability of the gain happening is low. It is a reality that there are always multiple possibilities and nothing is certain. All decisions are therefore risk/reward bets. Know how to pursue fabulous risk/reward ratios that have a huge upside and very little downside, albeit a small probability of happening. My life has been filled with these.\n197c) Understand how valuable it is to raise the probability that your decision will be right by accurately assessing the probability of your being right. I often observe people giving opinions as soon as they have them, which seems at about the point that they think there\u2019s more than a 50% chance of them being right. Often they don\u2019t pay any attention to the value of raising the probability of being right (e.g., from 51% to 85%) by reflecting harder on whether the answer is right and doing the investigations and double-checking with others to make sure that the answer is right. Remember that, in an expected value sense, raising the probability of being right (e.g., from 51% to 85%) can be worth more than just going from probably wrong (e.g., 45%) to probably being right (e.g., 51%) because we are all playing probabilities. Think about the effects of altering the probabilities of achieving must-dos: if you have a 51% probability of handling a \u201cmust-do\u201d correctly, it means that only a bit more than half of your must-dos will be done appropriately, whereas an 85% probability of handling a decision well means that only 15% of the must-dos will be handled badly.\n197d) Don\u2019t bet too much on anything. Make 15 or more good, uncorrelated bets.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Make Decisions Effectively Remember the 80/20 Rule, and Know What the Key 20% Is\n198) Remember the 80/20 Rule, and Know What the Key 20% Is\nSo...\n... 199) Distinguish the important things from the unimportant things and deal with the important things first.\n199a) Don\u2019t be a perfectionist, because perfectionists often spend too much time on little differences at the margins at the expense of other big, important things. Be an effective imperfectionist. Solutions that broadly work well (e.g., how people should contact each other in the event of crises) are generally better than highly specialized solutions (e.g., how each person should contact each other in the event of every conceivable crisis), especially in the early stages of a plan. There generally isn\u2019t much gained by lots of detail relative to a good broad solution. Complicated procedures are tough to remember, and it takes a lot of time to make such detailed plans (so they might not even be ready when needed).\n199b) Since 80% of the juice can be gotten with the first 20% of the squeezing, there are relatively few (typically less than five) important things to consider in making a decision. For each of them, the marginal gains of studying them past a certain point are limited.\n199c) Watch out for \u201cdetail anxiety,\u201d i.e., worrying inappropriately about unimportant, small things. 199d) Don\u2019t mistake small things for unimportant things, because some small things can be very\nimportant (e.g., hugging a loved one).\n... 200) Think about the appropriate time to make a decision in light of the marginal gains made by acquiring additional information versus the marginal costs of postponing the decision. There are some decisions that are best made after acquiring more\ninformation, and some that are best made sooner rather than later. The later a decision is made, the more informed it can be; however, making it later can also have adverse consequences (e.g., postponing progress). Understanding the trade-off between the marginal gains of acquiring the extra information against the marginal costs of postponing a decision is an important factor in the timing and preparation of decision-making.\n... 201) Make sure all the \u201cmust do\u2019s\u201d are above the bar before you do anything else. First, distinguish between your \u201cmust do\u2019s\u201d and your \u201clike to do\u2019s\u201d. Don\u2019t overlook any \u201cmust do\u2019s,\u201d and don\u2019t mistakenly slip the \u201clike to do\u2019s\u201d onto the list. Then, get all the \u201cmust do\u2019s\u201d above the bar. Then get all the \u201cmust do\u2019s\u201d excellent. If you have time, turn to the \u201clike to do\u2019s\u201d and try to get them above the bar. Only if you have time (though you certainly will not if you are thinking broadly), turn toward making things perfect. Chances are, you won\u2019t have to deal with the unimportant things, which is better than not having time to deal with the important things. I often hear people say, \"Wouldn\u2019t it be good to do this or that,\u201d referring to nice-to-do\u2019s rather than must-do\u2019s that have to be above the bar. Chances are, they are being distracted from far more important things that need to be done well.\n... 202) Remember that the best choices are the ones with more pros than cons, not those that don\u2019t have any cons. Watch out for people who tend to argue against something because they can find something wrong with it without properly weighing all the pros against the cons. Such people tend to be poor decision-makers.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Make Decisions Effectively Remember the 80/20 Rule, and Know What the Key 20% Is\n... 203) Watch out for unproductively identifying possibilities without assigning them probabilities, because it screws up prioritization. You can recognize this with phrases like\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that...\u201d then going on to say something that\u2019s improbable and/or unimportant, rather than something like, \u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance that...\u201d followed by something that\u2019s important or probable. Almost anything is possible. All possibilities must be looked at in terms of their likelihoods and prioritized.\n... 204) Understand the concept and use the phrase \u201cby and large.\u201d Too often I hear discussions fail to progress when a statement is made and the person to whom it is made replies, \u201cNot always,\u201d leading to a discussion of the exceptions rather than the rule. For example, a statement like \u201cThe people in the XYZ Department are working too many hours\u201d might lead to a response like \u201cNot all of them are; Sally and Bill are working normal hours,\u201d which could lead to a discussion of whether Sally and Bill are working too long, which derails the discussion. Because nothing is 100% true, conversations can get off track if they turn to whether exceptions exist, which is especially foolish if both parties agree that the statement is by and large true. To avoid this problem, the person making such statements might use the term \u201cby and large,\u201d like \u201cBy and large, the people in the XYZ Department are working too many hours.\u201d People hearing that should consider whether it is a \u201cby and large\u201d statement and treat it accordingly.\n204a) When you ask someone whether something is true and they tell you that \u201cIt\u2019s not totally true,\u201d it\u2019s probably true enough.\n\nSo...\n205) Synthesize\n... 206) Understand and connect the dots. To do this well, you have to synthesize what is going on. Usually it takes diagnosing a few (e.g., five or so) dots of the same type to get at the true root cause so that you can see how the machine should be modified to produce better outcomes. For example, one type of outcome involves someone, let\u2019s call him Harry, handling a type of responsibility (entering an order). You will need at least a few experiences to learn about Harry doing this. It will pay for you to understand Harry and his handling of orders and have him understand you by looking objectively at the outcomes and by getting in synch, especially about the bad outcomes. The quality of your understanding of your machine and its constituent parts will depend on how well you diagnose and process the important outcomes. If you don\u2019t do this continuously and you don\u2019t synthesize well, you will fail. This isn\u2019t easy.\nSee how the dots connect through time. This requires collecting, analyzing, and sorting lots of different types, and it ain\u2019t easy for most folks. Imagine a day in which eight outcomes occur. Some are good, some bad. Let\u2019s represent this day as follows, with each type of event represented by a letter and the quality of the outcome represented by its height.\nIn order to see the day this way, you must categorize outcomes by type and quality, which will require synthesizing a \u201cby and large\u201d assessment of each. If you didn\u2019t examine the bad outcomes as they occurred, you couldn\u2019t understand what they are symptomatic of. Keep in mind our example is a relatively simple one: only eight occurrences over one day. Now let\u2019s look at what a month looks like.\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Make Decisions Effectively Synthesize\n\nIn order to understand how your machine is working to achieve your goals, you have to perceive change over time, charting improvement vs. deterioration. The chart below plots just the type X dots, which you can see improving. As mentioned in the section on diagnosis, you must categorize, understand, and observe the evolution of the different parts of your machine through time, and synthesize this understanding into a picture of how your machine is working and how it should be improved. People who do this well are rare and essential. As with most abilities, synthesizing well is partially innate and partially learned through practice.\n... 207) Understand what an acceptable rate of improvement is, and that it is the level and not the rate of change that matters most. I often hear people say, \u201cIt\u2019s getting better,\u201d as though that is good enough when \u201cit\u201d is both below that bar and improving at an inadequate rate. That isn\u2019t good enough. For example, if someone who has been getting 30s and 40s on tests raised his grade to the 50s, you could say he\u2019s improving but the level is still woefully inadequate. Everything important you manage has to be on a trajectory to be \u201cabove the bar\u201d and headed for \u201cexcellent\u201d at an acceptable pace. For example, in the chart below, the trajectory of A might be acceptable, but B\u2019s trajectory is not. A gets us above the bar in an acceptable amount of time.\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Make Decisions Effectively Synthesize\n\ufffcConfusing, eh? Some people are much better at this than others.\n\nPart 3: My Management Principles To Make Decisions Effectively Synthesize\n... 208) If your best solution isn\u2019t good enough, think harder or escalate that you can\u2019t produce a solution that is good enough. A common mistake is accepting your own best solution when it isn\u2019t good enough.\n... 209) Avoid the temptation to compromise on that which is uncompromisable. You must have and achieve high standards. This is particularly difficult when two uncompromisable things are at odds. At such times, there is a tendency to let one of them go. However, at such times you have to allocate more time to figure out how to best handle this, be more creative, and ask for more input. But don\u2019t compromise on one of the things that shouldn\u2019t be compromised. For example, one of the uncompromisable things I regularly get pressure from people to compromise on is letting great people avoid exploring their mistakes and weaknesses because they find it painful. For reasons articulated throughout these principles, I believe we can\u2019t compromise on this because that process of exploration is healthy for Bridgewater, healthy for them, and key to our culture. I also believe that to allow opt-outs would legitimatize two sets of rules and put our radically honest way of being in jeopardy. But I want great\npeople. 72\n... 210) Don\u2019t try to please everyone. Not everyone is going to be happy about every decision you make, especially the decisions that say they can\u2019t do something.\n\ufffc\ufffc72 Everyone is wrestling with some things, but most people don\u2019t talk about them\u2014some people don\u2019t like to probe you about your weaknesses because they think it\u2019s unkind or awkward. And it\u2019s often difficult for us to see and accept our own weaknesses. So when you are really in synch with others about what you\u2019re wrestling with, that is a great step forward, because this feedback is probably true.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/852966", "artist_names": "The Righteous Brothers", "full_title": "My Babe by\u00a0The\u00a0Righteous Brothers", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/cb907abce79aa8255024e59af4a54d41.300x302x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cb907abce79aa8255024e59af4a54d41.700x704x1.jpg", "id": 852966, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 126836, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1559574038, "path": "/The-righteous-brothers-my-babe-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-righteous-brothers-my-babe-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1963, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1963", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1963", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/cb907abce79aa8255024e59af4a54d41.300x302x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cb907abce79aa8255024e59af4a54d41.700x704x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "My Babe", "title_with_featured": "My Babe", "updated_by_human_at": 1559764052, "url": "https://genius.com/The-righteous-brothers-my-babe-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/68157", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/223045f690b1cc9401e63dd1602184f2.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 68157, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/223045f690b1cc9401e63dd1602184f2.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Righteous Brothers", "slug": "The-righteous-brothers", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-righteous-brothers"}, "artist": "The Righteous Brothers", "lyrics": "My Babe Lyrics[Chorus]\nI'm talkin' 'bout my baby, not your baby\nShe's my babe, she's so fine\nI'm talkin' 'bout my baby, not your baby\nShe's my babe, she's so fine\nShe's right there to love me\nWell people come, rain or shine, shine\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow I love her, don't you love her\n'Cause I love her, you hear?\nI said I love her, don't you love her\n'Cause I love her, you hear?\nShe upsets my soul when she whispers sweet things in my ear\n[Verse 2]\nI love the way she walks, I love the way she talks\nShe makes me feel so good, just like a young man should\nShe never makes me cry, and here's why\nShe's my babe, she's my babe\n\n[Verse 3]\nNothin' could be better than to see her in a sweater\nAnd a real tight skirt that won't quit\nNothin' could be better than to see her in a sweater\nAnd a tight skirt, that won't quit\nI'm warm for her form, but people, let me tell you that's it\nOh yeah!

"Man\u2019s Temptation LyricsOne more time to test\nThe willpower of me\nThis feeling that I hold now\nJust won't let me be\nThis woman won't leave me alone\nShe's going to ruin my happy home\nWith a man's temptation\nWell, I've got another back home\nWho's the beat in my heart\nI never thought that no one else\nCould ever tear us apart\nTo each other, we had been so true\nUntil along comes a lover like you\nWith a a man's temptation\nI know I've got to be strong\nI've got to fight this all alone\nSo afraid for what I must do\nI've got to hurt my woman or you\nBut I've got a feeling telling me\nLet your heart be your guide\nI don't want lose either one\nWhich makes it hard to decide\nThough my mind continues to roam\nOh, baby, my heart, it stays at home\nAnd controls my temptation\nI'm sorry, little miss\nThat's the way love is\nI'm sorry I can't stay\nI must be on my wayYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 14, "api_path":

A white hand, holding a lit\nmatch creeps into frame.\n143 EXT. PLANTATION - FIELD - DAY 143 *\n-- We start in close on the pocket of a pair of overalls. We * pull backwards to reveal a deceased BOY 11 wears them as he *\nhangs by the neck.

He slows to a stop, looks to\nhis left and right.\n146 EXT. DISMAL SWAMP - DAY (VISION 4) 146\nNat kneels in prayer. A SOUND from behind and his eyes open. *\nHe turns to find a YOUNG BOY we recognize as YOUNG NAT, * painted royal blue. (The scene mirrors Nat\u2019s childhood * vision). Demonic sounds permeate the forest. Nat stands,\nstrides towards his younger self, placing a protective hand * in front of him. WIDER to reveal Nat is alone. He stalks * toward us and past camera. *\n147 EXT. FARMER\u2019S MARKET - WOOD AND SEED - DAY 147 *\nSeveral stores have reopened. General childs sits under a *\nmilitary tent as his boots are shined. A few militia men *\nloiter nearby. Scattered locals crisscross the dusty square. *\nFURTHER AWAY *\nNat enters an empty frame. We take in his sunken eyes and *\ngaunt frame as he lumbers forward. His bullet wound festers,\nspilling puss.\nANGLE ON *\nA WHITE MAN who spots Nat. *\nWHITE MAN *\nHey! *\nAs he sprints toward Nat, others also recognize him, breaking * into hysterics. The white man arrives to nat, wasting no time * in connecting a wild blow to Nat\u2019s face. *\nDozens more follow suit, until a massive mob has formed, * raining blows onto Nat\u2019s body. A woman rips at his shirt as *\nthe energy of the lynch mob intensifies, until- *\nBANG!\nThe crowd freezes. We REVERSE to reveal GENERAL CHILDS, holds\nthe smoking gun. He\u2019s flanked by his lieutenant.\nGENERAL CHILDS\nI know you\u2019re angry, trust me, I\nunderstand. But, this man has\ncommitted mass murder and will\nstand trial.\n5/8/15 - PINK 103\n(CONTINUED)\nAs he approaches, the mob reluctantly backs off.

JERUSALEM - COURTHOUSE - DAY 150\nFollow a YOUNG BOY (7) as he crosses cobblestone road, up a\nflight of stairs, pushing his way through a surrounding mob.\nAs he steps onto a cross-bridge, we rise above him to revealTHE\nCOURTHOUSE SQUARE. Hundreds crowd in front of a stagelike\nplatform, others watch from roofs, windows and stairs.\n151 EXT. JERUSALEM - COURTHOUSE - DAY 151\nNat is led up a narrow staircase and onto the wooden\nplatform. He studies the multitude of people. *\nANGLE ON *\nA viewing platform, where Nat spots John Clark who stands at * the flank of General childs. A million words unspoken. Nat\u2019s *\neyes then drift to Jasper who stands amongst patrons. Nat *\nstudies Jasper who struggles to hold his gaze.\nNat\u2019s face softens a beat, as he offers the faintest nod of\nforgiveness. The sheriff motions for the roaring crowd to\nsettle. Within minutes, the area is near silent, save a few\nscattered slurs.\nSHERIFF\n(to Nat)\nSomethin\u2019 you\u2019d like to say to * these people first? *\nNat regards the people. Then, with a firm voiceNAT\nI\u2019m ready.\nThe sheriff exits and the crowd\u2019s energy escalates to near\nfever pitch. The UNDERTAKER fits a noose around Nat\u2019s neck.\nDraws the rope of the pulley and Nat\u2019s body rises several\nfeet above the platform.\nSOUND DROPS. Not a limb or a muscle moves as Nat hangs still\nas a stone.\n5/8/15 - PINK 105\n148 CONTINUED: 148\n(CONTINUED)\nCLOSE On Nat\u2019s face as he stares forward, as if frozen.

His eyes flit upward toward\nsomething we don\u2019t yet see.\nNat\u2019s POV to revealA\nWHITE DOVE CIRCLES JUST ABOVE.\nON NAT. Even through the pain, the slightest smile grows.\nSeconds later, we watch his eyes slowly CLOSE.\nON JASPER, who squeezes his eyes shut, his body trembling\nthrough sobs.\nPUSH IN on Jasper. CLOSER until his face fills the frame.\nWe watch as he AGES before our eyes. His features mature, his\njaw widens, age lines crawl across his brow. He slowly opens\nhis eyes and we see Jasper, now a grown man. The shame gone,\nonly a fierceness remains.\nWe slowly pull back as sound gradually returns. Muffled\nblasts and explosions permeate. We continue our pull to\nreveal-\n152 EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY 152\nJasper dons a blue FORAGE HAT and SACK COAT, white-knuckling\na bayonet-fitted rifle. We reveal other black soldiers on\neither side. A massive AMERICAN FLAG ripples in the BG. The * explosions are now deafening as the group of men clinch their\njaws in anticipation. After an arduous beatVOICE\n(O.C.)\nCHARGE!\nJasper and his fellow soldiers belt out battle cries as they\nrush the camera, bayonets pointed. Jasper raises his rife and\nBANG! A cloud of smoke takes us toBLACK\nSUPER:\nAfter Nat Turner\u2019s hanging, his body was skinned and\ndismembered.

indeed.\nO, he hath kept an evil diet long,\nAnd overmuch consumed his royal person:\n'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.\nWhat, is he in his bed?\n\nHASTINGS\nHe is.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nGo you before, and I will follow you.\n\nExit HASTINGS\n\nHe cannot live, I hope; and must not die\nTill George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.\nI'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,\nWith lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;\nAnd, if I fall not in my deep intent,\nClarence hath not another day to live:\nWhich done, God take King Edward to his mercy,\nAnd leave the world for me to bustle in!\nFor then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.\nWhat though I kill'd her husband and her father?\nThe readiest way to make the wench amends\nIs to become her husband and her father:\nThe which will I; not all so much for love\nAs for another secret close intent,\nBy marrying her which I must reach unto.\nBut yet I run before my horse to market:\nClarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:\nWhen they are gone, then must I count my gains.\n\nExit3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/5288884", "artist_names": "Chris Kenner", "full_title": "Land

1: Chris Webby]\nYeah, anytime I step I blaze it thoroughly\nNo one seein' me, y'all need corrective laser surgery\nCheck my date of birth you see, Webby's only 21\nHotter than the summer bitch, you know I got it covered son\nGet it done when I get up on a beat and I tear it up\nCause all I got in this world is my word and a pair of nuts\nBring em in I'll air em out, hustlin' like Escobar\nWith lyrics sharper then the claws retracted in a leopard's paw\nCheck my repertoire cause I been grindin' for a minute\nHeh, and even the haters admitted I can spit it\nThis rappin' is a sport to me, break it down importantly\nWhiter than a kilo bitch, I'm bringin' Boston George with me\nRamblin' answerin' the hate and spit it gorgeously\nCan't handle him I'm Anakin, and yes I got the force with me\nTorture beats, have them all askin' where the chorus be\nBitch I'm good money and ain't nobody affordin' me\nPlayin' my cards right whiter than a Marb light\nVoice raspier than Christian Bale in the Dark Knight\nI got my competition sayin' Our Fathers\nAnd every fuckin' hater runnin' scared like Paul Walker\nI don't fire deadly shots, never with a semi cocked\nJust light up headie pot and spit venom, call me Eddie Brock\nWebby drops, whether you ready or not\nHeavy metal or pop, so steadily I'll get to the top\nClever as ever so what, the bass and treble will not\nSo fuckin' loud its like gettin' hit in the head with a rock\nI'll leave em dead or in shock, when I spit it I'm a rap rebel\nWith my size 10 Jordan on the fuckin' gas pedal\nGrab the mic and I go\nAin't nobody messing with the rhythm I flow\nNeed that dough, Tic-tac-toe\nBreak mothafuckers like a Kit-Kat bro\nHit that dro, pass that back, layin' low, 20 sack\nThen I roll it up and hit it till that shit's all ash\nThen my drug dealer gonna get a call back\nBack on a track accurate that's the reason I'm so relaxed when I rap\nCause the facts are the facts and the fact of it is\nNext to Em nobody spit this crack\nBring it back, crowd packed, dog I'm rippin' more beats\nCarrying the game just like a baby in a stork's beak\nI'm servin' my competition like Roddick\nI'm Doctor Robotnik, with knuckles in my pocket\nToxic, so fuckin' dirty you should wash it\nGot this, hot shit, LeBron couldn't block it\nSpittin' it with flavor, rippin' wisdom on the paper\nBitch I get the block hoppin' just like Tigger was my neighbor\nPrecision like a laser, no one playin' with this\nCause this rap is second nature like inhalin' a spliff\nThen I throw together words and I rip shit ill\nNo one ever done like Christian will\nSpit with skills, bitch this real\nBrain slowed down on prescription pills\nNeed a deal, damn straight, make the fuckin' land shake\nAri Gold lookin' for me since he seen the fan base\nYouTube, numbers up, Facebook, yeah what's up\nAll you do is Google me and haters keep they mouth shut\nNow what, like a deer hunter all about bucks\nIf you tryna' to burn with me you'll need at least an ounce plus\nIt's in my nature I guess, I'm fuckin' meant for this\nAin't no type of censorship equipped for all my sentences\nThe booth is like my octagon, you don't wanna enter this\nI'm Anderson Silva so step in here you're gettin' leveled quick\nPoppin' stars and I'll be ravin' until I'm sober\nI'm not afraid of shit, I'm as brave as the Little Toaster\nCocaine and some bakin' soda, I'm crack next up to bat\nGriffy Junior to these losers, no ones fuckin' with the stats\nPupils fat and got a bag of molly in the pocket\nI'm like Pikachu shovin' a metal fork into a socket\nI'm electric, style eclectic, all these haters try to mock it\nBut spit so fuckin' flawless they can't help it but to jock it\nSon I'll rock it, and now they all bloggin' about the hotness\nDatpiff hot this week with a million comments\nThe big new thing, read about me in the comics\nUnder Hi and Lois rhymin' potent lyrics better watch it\nNow I'm back and I rip it up and spit it so nice\nAin't nobody messin' with the poltergeist\nSkin tone white, takin' flight\nSo far ahead that I'm out of sight\nDown to fight, rip it on a mic\nThere never been a night that my pen don't write\nThere never been a night that I don't rap nice\nWhen I'm on the right weed and rolled up tight\nHold that mic, get it in, who could ever mess with him\nSick go get some Levaquin, the medicine you get it

but poor boys don't fit in their plan\nGood-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary Ann\n\nThe weeks have gone by not a word have I heard since then;\nIn the papers I read of the far away places she's been\nI can't eat, I can't sleep for over and over again\nMy mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann\nMary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again;\nWe're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then\nThey know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plan\nGood-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary Ann\n\nMy Mary Ann died, they said she just wasted away;\nIf I could have seen her I know she'd be living today\nFor we loved each other and if they'd have left us alone\nToday she'd be wearing my ring, not a blanket of stone\n\nMary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again;\nWe're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then\nThey know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plan\nGood-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary-AnnYou might

my chores, now you're acting like a whore\nPhones at my crib with you off to the store\nFor now, you don't love me no more?\nHey, by the way who's Kirk?\nLeft a message on my machine said you didn't come to work\nYou're AWOL from the job, plus who's Rob?\nThe way you're acting, I think you've been slobbing 'em\nSometimes I swear I think I feel like robbing 'em\nBut my papa told me never to snuff no girls\nYou give 'em diamonds, jewels, furs, pearls\nRings and shoes and cars and things\nFrom time to time I wanna diss her\nYou couldn't blame me if I treat her like Amy Fisher\nAnd dismiss her from the courtroom in a Yugo\nYou know, something like Joe Buttafuoco\nBut deep inside my heart, the pain still stings\nWhen I think back and remember I was gonna swing her a ring\nFor her ring finger, yes I used to bang her\nLike \"inga binga bunga\" but I'm out like Felix Unger so uh...\n[Hook]\nSo why you trying to play me though?\nOut like a sucker\nSo why you trying to play me

swinging with Miss Pretty Young Thing\nShe got a kick outta my jeep and a meal at Burger King\nI shot her ego down with my maturity\nGetting papers from Port Authority doing security, uh\nShe just used to climb up in my whipper whip\nJust to stress a nigga quick, young chick on a ego trip\nWhip ping ha ha I had to stop the pigeon\nStep, find a dove who comprehends exactly how I'm living\nSo I met a girl around the way from the Uptown set\nWe used to drown in sweat, uh\nShe was my darling til I lost my 9 to 5\nShe started dissing listen pretending then shitting on my pride\nShe tried to crush my pride so cut off so to the next\nUh, not for the sex, this one used to run through the projects\nGossiping with the next about the next\nLoved to cover her neck, for stress gave her a cat as a pet\nItchbay didn't know which way she wanted to flow\nFlowing with this nosey hoochie when I was out doing my shows\nDoing a dem bow, dem bow, dem bow, dem bow\nYou can't front, you used to bust all over Prince Po\nAnd fall fast asleep into the morn\nGirlfriend started flipping, so yo Prince had to be gone\nI'm just another brother trying to get around the fakes\nAnd keep my mental state, no matter what it takes and yo...\nYou might also like[Hook]\nSo why you trying to play me though?\nOut like a sucker\nSo why you trying to play me though?\nOut like a sucker\nSo why you trying to play
