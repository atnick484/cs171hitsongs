how we rock\nThrow your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)\nTic toc, this is how we rock\nThrow your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)\nTic toc, this is how we rock\n(Tic toc, you don't stop...)\n\n[Verse 1: DoItAll]\nTic toc, this is how we rock\nWe're those same (um) brothers that brought you \"Chief Rocka\"\nNow, um, underground's my style\nTo this I have vows\nAnd I swear to my god\nI'll always rock a crowd\nSo (um) peace to my area, N.W.K\nWhich is scarier\nSo if your on the deals\nWho cares, the more the merrier\nNow right off South Orange\nOn the block of one-nine\nOf course, thirteenth ave\nIs my stomping grounds\nI open up my chest\nAnd to my 'hood give my heart\n'Cause without the heart\nThen your 'hood falls apart\nSo respect to the cement\nThe park called \"the Corner\"\n'Cause that's where the DoItAlldo was performing\nRunnin' from the cops\nI couldn't be stopped\n'Cause I was jumpin' big gates that connected the blocks\nNow before making records\nThe 'hood was my savior\nBut now I'm making tunes to make you jam wit 'cha neighbor\n[Hook]\nTic toc, this is how we rock\nThrow your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)\nTic toc, this is how we rock\nThrow your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)\nTic toc, this is how we rock\nThrow your hands in the air and represent your block (um)\nTic toc, this is how we rock\n(Tic toc, you don't stop...)\n\n[Verse 2: Mr. Funke]\nWell, I be the funk-ular\nUltra-funk-ular\nGamma-funk-ular\nHalf you rappers out there couldn't see me with binoculars\nAnyone who thinks he'll take me out is just a dreamer\nIf you think you're the bomb, then I'm Hiroshima\nWhen I die\nI hope they're making records up in heaven\nOn a scale of one to ten\nI'm like 100-5th-11\nAnd sticks-and-stones-may-break-my-bones\nBut if you ever try to diss the Lords, then it's on\nNow I go on beat...\nOff beat...\nThen jump right back on time\nI drop another rhyme\nAnd talk about your fat ugly mama (EEWWW!!)\nM.C.'s cannot rock me\nI'm stone-proof\nMe grabbin' the mic\nIs like Superman running to a phone booth\nStraight from Martin Luther King Boulevard\nIn the heart of Newark, New Jersey\nMake you say \"Lord have mercy\"\nIf you step up in my face\nThen it's do or die\nAnd I'm gonna make you cry (waaahhhhh!!)\nYou might also like[Hook]\nTic toc, this is how we rock\nThrow your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)\nTic toc, this is how we rock\nThrow your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)\nTic toc, this is how we rock\nThrow your hands in the air and represent your block (um)\nTic toc, this is how we rock\n(Tic toc, you don't stop...)\n\n[Verse 3: DoItAll]\nWell, times have changed\nNot only for the urban\nBut also for suburban\nWe get props, we're deservin'\nFrom black kids, to white kids\nI see them bob their heads\nFrom the blonde hair, to redhead\nI even seen a dread\nSo now it doesn't matter\nAs the clock winds down\nWith the tic and the toc\nBecause they love the sound\nBut people 'round your area\nSay you sell out\nBecause you sell a million copies\nAnd your tone goes BAAAAOOWW!\nSo do it for yourself\nAnd do it for the 'hood\nBut do it from the heart\n'Cause that's when it's good\nNow tell me what's gonna happen\nAfter the rappin'\nWhen the clock ticks away\nAnd ain't nothin' happenin'...\n[Verse 4: Mr. Funke]\nI remember way back in the days on my block\nWhen the kids used to meet up in the hallway and rock\nOn Martin Luther King's boulevard\nWith P.C., wise, Easy Ed, and my brother hard Bernard\nUsed to hit the ill rhymes from the head\nWhile I'd hit the beat on the wall until my hands turned red\nYou had the Shorty two MC's\nThe Educated Three\nI have to give them props for helping me be me\nNow I'm the one who's educated\nI suffered but I made it\nI only write rhymes that will be appreciated\nNo matter how large I get\nThe fire still burns\n'Cause from the 'hood I came\nAnd to the 'hood I must return\n\n[Hook]\nTic toc, this is how we rock\nThrow your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)\nTic toc, this is how we rock\nThrow your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)\nTic toc, this is how we rock\nThrow your hands in the air and represent your block (um)\nTic toc, this is how we rock\n(Tic toc, you don't stop...)2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0,

Special One]\nI'm just riding, sliding, let's take a little trip\nCMG and K and we finsta make a grip\nComing straight from out the O, so you know, that\n(We got the funky track that's phat)\nBut anyway it's my turn so let me introduce\nSpecial One first up from the gangsta crew\nKnown as TCD with a title and a rep, it's quite apparent\nServing funky shit to keep you motherfuckers staring\nPump it up, mack shit for your ears\nKick it loud and clear, making hoes disappear\nHittin' donuts in a tre' sideways, to the\nNext light, triple gold thangs and my shit's tight\nFive deep mobbin' through in The Town\nDeuce Tone, Gangsta Flake with the top down\nDamn, this shit's hittin' hard in the trunk\nGot me three wheel switchin' on them bitches on the next block\nHeaded straight to the top\nAnd as long as my skills pay the bills I'mma never stop\nKicking that shit you love\nPass the dank and a drank for the bitch to buzz\nIt's a ghetto thang so I bring the ghetto slang\nHookin' niggas like the 'caine when I do my thang\nFive real G's mobbin' on a mission\nCheck it, it's the funky expedition that we call a little something to ride to\n[Hook 8X]\nExpedition, funky expedition\n\n[Verse 2: CMG]\nCome and catch a thrill with the super skill rhyme flowing\nDaughter on attack with the knack to keep your speakers blowing\nRiding with a gat in my lap and one finger on a Zap\nLooking for some niggas in a Cadillac\nYeah, we on point, rollin' a point\nSpecial One and CMG blazin' up a joint\nKeepin' a steady pace in a car race\nSidin' on a strip with a grip and an eighth in my glove case\nNever leavin' a trace, but leaving the 5-O's blind\n'Cause I'm fucking conscious of these streets of mine\nRollin' lit with the tint shed shallow\nAnd I'll be back around the block for niggas to jock tomorrow\nFrom East O to the B town, looking for a freak now\nWith hella scratch to get at\nCheck it, CMG on a mission\nTo get with some niggas to ride on this funky expedition\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interlude: Paris]\nYeah, Conscious Daughters\nAll up in your trunk\nSomethin' to ride to, feel that shit, yeah\nA yo, K, why don't you step up and that ass know\nCheck it\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Special One]\nFoothill Boulevard, the bumpy ass strip\nHomies steady clownin' on the gas, brake, dip\nIt's a conscious groove, making all my daughters move\nRollin' through the town with big bass boom\nLet's get bigger on these niggas up the street\nJock 'em for a minute let 'em take us out to eat\nBut I concentrate on all my niggas later\nI flow to this shit 'cause I'm Special One the greater\nBut it's this funky that got me gripping still like this\nCome into my show, if you fine, you may kiss\nDon't mess with the bomb, I never stress no tension\nCome kick it with the Daughters as we take you on a funky expedition\n\n[Hook]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/980774", "artist_names": "Morrissey", "full_title": "The

far too many of you dying\n\n[Verse 1:  Scarface]\nJune twenty-eight was the date\nThirty-eight to the chest plate\nMommy dear's cryin at the wake\nAnd everybody's dressed up in black suits\nGoin to pay their last respects to the black troop\nWhy'd he have to die is the question that we're under\nBut everyone knows that every day's a different number\nSo when your time comes, just remember, G\nYou'll always have a place in this world as a memory\nEspecially my boys who passed away back in '92\nBest believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you\nWherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin\nOf how we hung in the clubs smokin and drinkin\nNever missin out on a hood fight\nCause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight\nEverything has changed and people are lookin lonely\nIt's gon' be strange spendin New Year's Eve without your homie\nBut ain't much that we can do\nExcept pour brew throughout the crew\nTo make sure we all remember you\nAnd believe me it hurts\nTo see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt... dirt\n[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]\nAnother homie got smoked but it's no surprise\nEverybody's trippin cause the boy was too young to die\nA sad sight to see my homie take his last breath\nEverybody's trippin cause they can't accept my homie's death\nAnother killin was reported on the evenin news\nSomebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes\nIn the midst of all this shit I think about myself\nWonderin when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf\nBut I refuse to be another violent casualty\nSo when I'm rollin I pack my pistol grip beside my knee\nCause on the city streets today a brother just can't win\nWhen the people you think are your friends really ain't your friends\nUh, and Bushwick can't sleep\nWhen everybody around me keeps fallin six feet deep\n\n[Verse 3: Scarface]\nThe pain that's deep inside of everybody grows\nAs they approach to see the body before the casket close\nThe person standin next to me has snapped a flick\nOnce I seen the casket closed I knew that that was it\nThe whole entire family spoke on his defense\nThe choir sung the songs that make us reminisce\nAnd durin all the singin I broke down myself\nWhen I looked and seen the family that my partner left\nAnd then the choir broke into its final song\nThinkin to myself the worst is yet to come\nEveryone was headed for the final flight\nAs we creeped along the gravel on the burial site\nThe director said his words and there was not a sound\nAs they lowered my little partner towards inside the ground\nEverybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top\nAnd then they work alone with the concrete block\nAnd that's deep\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Big Mike]\nA lotta homies die, a lotta mothers cry\nI watch tears fall down from their eyes\nEverybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to take the chance\nThey chose the music, so they had to dance\nCouldn't tell him nothin, was a player, had to have it\nGot caught up in the game now my boy's in the casket\nAnd everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame\nAshamed to let his mother know that he was in the game\nWe used to kick it on the ave at night\nComin up tryin to have the finer things in life\nBut now my boy's gone, I wish he was at home\nI wish he wouldn'ta never fell victim to the chrome\nSo when I drink a brew for you I pour some on the block, son\nYou might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten\nSo long, remember whenever or wherever\nDead or alive, real partners come together\nAnd you know that2Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

blame you for the moonlit nights\nWhen I wonder why\nAre the seas still dry?\nDon't blame this sleeping satellite\n\nDid we fly to the moon too soon\nDid we squander the chance\nIn the rush of the race\nThe reason we chase is lost in romance\nAnd still we try\nTo justify the waste\nFor a taste of man's greatest adventure\nI blame you for the moonlit sky\nAnd the dream that died\nWith the Eagle's flight\nI blame you for the moonlit nights\nWhen I wonder why\nAre the seas still dry?\nDon't blame this sleeping satellite\n\nHave we lost what it takes to advance?\nHave we peaked too soon?\nIf the world is so green\nThen why does it scream under a blue moon\nWe wonder why\nIf the earth's sacrificed\nFor the price of it's greatest treasure\n\nI blame you for the moonlit sky\nAnd the dream that died\nWith the Eagle's flight\nI blame you for the moonlit nights\nWhen I wonder why\nAre the seas still dry?\nDon't blame this sleeping satellite\n\nAnd when we shoot for stars\nWhat a giant step\nHave we got what it takes\nTo carry the weight of this concept\nOr pass it by like a shot in the dark\nMiss the mark with a sense of adventure\nYou might also likeI blame you for the

came around then late wouldn't LET ME\nWake up - WAKE UP - so I can get dressed\nI guess my body was mad cause I gave it no rest\nAnd when I finally did awake it was a quarter to eight\nJumped in the shower and I knew I was late\nStepped out, put on my jeans and my Ewings\nAnd said to myself if I miss school I'm ruined\nBut I ran down hill in a RUSH RUSH\nI ran down the hill TRYIN TO CATCH THE BUS\nNow I'm hopin to myself everything is cool\nStandin' on my block like a fool\nFor (1) I'm all alone and (2) the bus is gone\n(3) if I miss school, this weekend I'll be at home\nCan somebody come real fast to my rescue\nI'm stuck at the crib and I don't know what to do\n[Hook: repeat 2x]\nI missed the bus [ohh]\nI missed the bus\nI missed the bus [ohh]\nAnd that is somethin I will never ever ever do again\n\n[Verse 2/Mac Daddy]\nI was up - HE WAS UP - but I laid back down\nThinkin' I could chill 'til the time came around\nAnd I did - HE DID - but a little too long\nCause when I woke up, yo the bus was gone\nI almost broke my neck tryin' to get out the door\nAnd I chased the bus 'til my feet was sore\nOn the trail - THE TAIL - but I couldn't catch up\nI guess it must have been my day for me to have bad luck\nCause I lost my lunch MONEY, book bag BUSTED\nScuffed up my sneakers, now I'm really disgusted\nAnd when I got to school it was the same old thing\nStepped in the class and the school bell rang\nIt was nothin' I could do, I tried to explain\nBut the teacher treated me like I was playin' a game\nYOU LOSE YOU LOSE - the day was a no win\nI learned to never miss my bus

boogie\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've got a good job, I work hard for my money\nWhen it's quittin' time I hit the door runnin'\nI fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run\nI go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way\nStuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin' boogie\n[Chorus]\nYeah, heel, toe, do-si-do come on baby let's go boot scootin'\nOh Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie\nOh get down, turn around, go to town, boot scootin' boogie\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe bartender asks me, says son what'll it be\nI want a shot of that redhead yonder lookin' at me\nThe dance floor's hoppin' and it's hotter than the fourth of July\nI see outlaws, inlaws, crooks & straights all out makin' it shake\nDoin' the boot scootin' boogie\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, heel, toe, do-si-do come on baby

Smooth]\nI reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back\nTwenty-two years ago to keep it on track\nThe birth of a child on the 8th of October\nA toast, but my granddaddy came sober\nCountin' all the fingers and the toes\nNow I suppose you hope the little black boy grows\nHuh, eighteen years younger than my mama\nBut I rarely got beatings 'cause the girl loved drama\nIn single parenthood, there I stood\nBy the time she was 21, had another one\nThis one's a girl, let's name her Pam\nSame father as the first, but you don't give a damn\nIrresponsible, plain not-thinking\nPapa said chill but the brother keep winking\nStill he won't down you or tear out your hide\nOn your side while the baby maker slide\nBut mama got wise to the game\nThe youngest of five kids, hon here it is\nAfter 10 years without no spouse\nMomma's gettin married and a house\nListen, positive over negative for the woman and master\nMother Queen's rising a chapter\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, tell you what I'm gonna do\nWhen they reminisce over you, my God\nYou might also like[Bridge 1: Pete Rock]\nMy God\nIt's so\nYeah, so lovely\nThat's how we like to do it in the 90's\nPete Rock & CL Smooth comin' atcha\n\n[Verse 2: C.L.

Choco, the chocolate chicken\nThe rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kickin'\nYo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme\nThe rhythm is in sync (Unh!), the rhymes are on time (Time!)\nRippin' up the sound just like Horatio\nObserve the vibe and check out the scenario\nYeah, my man, mothafucka!\n[Chorus (Extended): All]\nHere we go, yo, here we go, yo\nSo what, so what, so what's the scenario?\nHere we go, yo, here we go, yo\nSo what, so what, so what's the scenario?\nHere we go, yo, here we go, yo\nSo what, so what, so what's the scenario?\nHere we go, yo, here we go,

ghetto Lyrics[Chorus]\nIt doesn't seem like\nI'll be going nowhere\nI'm just a victim of the ghetto\nIt doesn't seem like I'll be\nGetting too far, too far\n\nYou know, Tone\nIt really ain't that bad\nOnce you understand\nThe science of this shit\nCollege Boyz coming to you\nFor the year 2000\nCovering all sectors\nOf the universe\nCreep through the hood\nWith my drop top\nGangstas on the sidelines\nThrowing up nothing\nBut a peace sign\nBrothers on the curb\nWith the herb\nLevis, knee high\nO.G's clock as I creep by\nCrib to crib\nGrown ups to kid's girls I did\nThey all know me\nSo the ghetto stays cozy\nFiends and teens\nSport a couple of trophies\nOne for the dope man\nAnd the other for the homie\nThe ghetto's a real\nCool place to be fucked up\nSundown to sunup\nBut that's the way we come up\nYou talk with the street slang\nYou ball and you gang bang\nThat's where the family hangs\nSo it ain't no thang\n[Chorus]\nIt doesn't seem like\nI'll be going nowhere\nI'm just a victim of the ghetto\nIt doesn't seem like I'll be\nGetting too far, too far\n\n[Repeat Chorus]\nYeah, it's like a family affair\nIf you get through\nPlenty of old cuts\nSay, what's up\nKeep your mouth shut, yup\nHigh rollers know me\nBut they don't own me\n(Fuck you)\n5-0 might roll through quite slow\nKeep the forty in the bag\nAnd throw away the Zig Zag\nWaiting for five or six to come\nDown goes the sun\nSo we can run a game of 21\nFrom time to time some busters bring the noise and try to stop me because them cannot relate to the presence of my posse\nCall me anything\nFrom a hoodlum to a thug\nYou can push and you can shove\nAnd I still won't budge\nYou might also like[Repeat Chorus 2x]\nI'm just a victim of the ghetto\nWon't be getting too far, too far\nI'm just a victim of the ghetto\nToo far, too far, no\nMovie stars, yuppies\nMacs and politicians\nRoll through to get\nA nickel or a ten\nThey know me, I know them\nBut then again I can't extend\nMore than I need to\nCause suddenly, they read me\nAnd lead you astray\nAnd transactions completed\nYour presence in my ghetto\nAin't needed, so beat it\nBorn and raised on\nThe same damn concrete\nAnd I'll be put to sleep\nIn these streets\nI step into a different world\nFor college education\nKeep my safe ways\nPay days stays in effect\nI just can't let go\nI want my respect so\nI gotta return to the\nNation of my ghetto\n[Repeat Chorus]\nI'm just a victim of the ghetto\nToo far, to far\nSo know you now\nCollege Boyz sending out a fistful\nTo the Baytown Posse\nConcrete Evidence, the CB Posse\nMy main man, TJ\nOmega Psi Phi, Overdose\nSuicide, Homicide\nDOA and Genocide\nAnd to the law\nKeep your ass on the\nOther side of the tracks\nThis is The Q signing out\nOn radio fusion radio\n(Victim of the ghetto)\nCheckmate\n\n[Repeat Chorus to fade]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/791866", "artist_names": "Howard Jones", "full_title": "Lift Me Up

give it what I got\nBut it's hot in the day, it's cold in the night\nBut I thrive to survive, I pray to god to stay alive\nAttitude boils up inside\nAnd that ain't it, you think I ever quit\nStill I plan to get my hands around the neck of the man with the whip\n3 months passed, they brand a label on my ass\nTo signify I'm owned, I'm on the microphone\nSayin' 1555, how I'm livin'\nWe been livin'

thinking\nThe girl I spent 53 bucks on last night\nShe gives me a look from the corner of her eye\nThat says, \"Boy, keep acting right.\"\nHow surprised was I when she leaned over\nAnd whispered in my ear\nGet a leg up\nGet a leg over, boy\nGet a leg up\nWhat's the matter\nAre you shy, shy, shy?\n\nI'm pretty good with first impressions\nBut sometimes I'm not always right\nI pulled the car to the shoulder of the road\nTo see what she had in mind\n\"Want me to spend the night\nHey, lover boy, you know I will\nAnd my best girlfriend that lives down the road\nTogether we will thrill ya\"\nAnd I'm thinking to myself\nI could be lucky Pierre tonight\nIf I could get a leg up\nIf I could get a leg over, boy\nYou know I ain't that handsome\nBut you know I ain't shy, shy, shy\n\nThe rest of the night went on and on\nAnd the moral to this song\nDon't go making hasty judgments\nBecause sometimes they could be wrong\nNothing wrong with a good time\nJust keep yourself protected, make a list\nAnd you can bet your life that the women don't know\nThe little girls are acting like this\nSo the next time a young one moves up\nAnd she whispers in your ear\nYou might also likeGet a leg up\nGet a leg

out\nMaybe this something i should drink about\nThinking if the game and the fame gon bring a lil change\nNow i'm just contemplating liquor\nBut you know it start get ya\nWhen ya mind start to flicker\nLike maybe this something i should really fuck think about\nA penny for my thoughts\nTurned to nickels for my lines\nAnd rapping all these lines\nStarted gettin me the dimes\nNow i'm feelin like man i'm exactly what the game need\nQuarters turned into my dollar for a dream\nBut then you spending checks when you really should be saving\nMan fuck a freestyle when you write it like Langston\nBut you got the five heartbeats\nThen the temptations\nAnd ya conscience start the whispers\nAnd you really can't take it\nI'm just sayin\n(Chorus):\n\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\n\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\n4th quarter and you down two\n4th quarter and you down two\n\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\n\n(Verse 2):\n\nThen you try to flip a dollar\nJust to get something new\nNow you touchin bases\nTurnin one into two\nLike baseball\nOne day its gon pay off\nPlus you know 3's coming soon\nBut then you start to panic\nBut you can't get flustered\nCuz its a cold war\nSo you know they start rush ya\nBut you a rare kind and they'll never be another\nPlus its a cold world\nBe sure to bring a cover\nCuz the 4 in sight\nTurn to 5 by night\nMan a 6 would be fine\nBut you want 7-8-9\nBut then you hit 10\nThink you never win again\nThen you pray to god and you see its all meant\nSo you finally see that you can't be stopped\nTold you shoot for the moon so you aim for the top\nSo you finally see exactly why you got the rock\n4th quarter down 2 and then you take the shot\nYou might also like(Chorus):\n\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\n\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\n4th quarter and you down two\n4th quarter and you down two\n\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\n\n\nThaNuRelijun:\n\nDear God\nI think i found a new religion\nAnd its based on the true condition that was truly missing\nI was thinking of my brother who think they found you in prison\nAnd my other brothers that drown in the new prescription\nCuz they been praying every night\nBut they feel like you don't listen\nI became the smartest\nWhen i took my art sense\nMixed it with my darkness\nAnd became a true artist\nSo now i'm putting portraits\nOn vinyls or murals with a title\nThese illustrations i'm painting\nAre truer than the bible\nI mean no disrespct but this is the new religion\nLike expressionizm\nIf you close ya eyes and envision a television\nBut without a picture\nJust scriptures that come to life\nOr headless sculptures that walk around at night\nAll i need is one mic\nShit now i might need 3\nPromise before i die to get the revolution\nOn TV or maybe in 3D\nYou think that they'll see it then\nI mean just picture me rollin\nThe blackGOD lacing my rap ties\nAnd after i die just play this and close ya eyes\nIf you ever wanna see me again\nI mean im like Edgar Allan but with better styling\nThis my tell tale heart but with 11 volumes\nSculptures and portraits portrayed\nFrom photo albums stuck in my memory\nI just hope they remember me through infinity1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1038885", "artist_names": "Londonbeat", "full_title": "A

chill\nDon't be afraid of me, I know my love is scaring you\nBut I promise everything will be alright\nCome closer\nLet me talk to you\n[Pre-Chorus: Aaron Hall]\nLet's chill\nOh, oh, baby, hey,

dying to serve the final rite\nOne to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows\nAnd fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows\n\n[Chorus]\nAll this time the river flowed\nEndlessly to the sea\nIf I had my way\nI'd take a boat from the river\nAnd I'd bury the old man\nI'd bury him at sea\n\n[Verse 3]\nBlessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth\nBetter to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle\nAs these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing\nWhat good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?\n\nAll this time the river flowed\nEndlessly like a silent tear\nAll this time the river flowed\nFather, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?\n\n[Bridge]\nTeachers told the Romans built this place\nThey built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town\nThey lived and they died\nThey prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound\nAnd their empire crumbles 'till all that was left\nWere the stones the workmen found\nSee Sting LiveGet tickets as low as $47You might also like[Outro]\nAll this time the river flowed\nIn the falling light of a Northern sun\nIf I had my way, take a boat from the river\nMen go crazy in congregations, they only get better one by one\nOne by one4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

you dont have to hide\nBut my mind wanders , to the very first day\nWhat a shame things had to turn out this way\n\nIts time for letting go\nWe can't hide what we both know\nBut ooooh , oooh\nThe hurt grows , everytime i think its over\n\nNo words, could bring back your affection\nAnd no lies, could keep me holdin on\nHoldin on and holdin on\n\nNow i know that its\nTime for letting go\nWe can't hide what we both know\nBut oooh , oooh the hurt grows\nEverytime i think its over\nIts time to realize\nThat were both just living lies\nAnd way down deep inside\nThe time is telling me its time for letting go\n\nLet it go\nI keep tellin myself over and over\nLet it go .....................\nBut my loves still strong\nBut i just can't keep holding on\nAnd holdin on and holdin onYou might also

"Sowing the Seeds of Love Lyrics[Verse 1: Roland Orzabal]\nHigh time we made a stand\nAnd shook up the views of the common man\nAnd the love train rides from coast to coast\nD.J.'s the man we love the most\nCould you be, could you be squeaky clean\nAnd smash any hope of democracy?\nAs the headline says you're free to choose\nThere's egg on your face and mud on your shoes\nOne of these days they're gonna call it the blues, yeah, yeah\n[Chorus 1: Curt Smith & Roland Orzabal]\nSowing the seeds of love, seeds of love\nAnything is possible when you're sowing the seeds of love\nSowing the seeds\nSowing the seeds of love\nAnything is possible\nSeeds of love\nSowing the seeds of love\nSowing the seeds\n\n[Verse 2: Roland Orzabal]\nI spy tears in their eyes\nThey look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention\nFood goes to waste\nSo nice to eat, so nice to taste\nPolitician granny with your high ideals\nHave you no idea how the majority feels?\nSo without love and a promised land\nWe're fools to the rules of a government plan\nKick out the style, bring back the jam\n\n[Chorus 2: Curt Smith & Roland Orzabal]\nSowing the seeds of love, seeds of love\nAnything\nSowing the seeds of love\nSowing the seeds of love, seeds of love\nSowing the seeds\nYou might also like[Post-Chorus 1: Roland Orzabal]\nSowing the seeds\nThe birds and the bees\nMy girlfriend and me\nIn love\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Bridge 1: Roland Orzabal]\nFeel the pain, talk about it\nIf you're a worried man, then shout about it\nOpen hearts, feel about it\nOpen minds, think about it\nEveryone, read about it\nEveryone, scream about it\nEveryone\nEveryone, yeah, yeah\nEveryone read about it, read about it\nEveryone\nRead it in the books, in the crannies and the nooks, there are books to read for us\n\n[Chorus 3: Roland Orzabal]\nSowing the seeds of love\nSowing the seeds of love\nWe're sowing the seeds\nSowing the seeds\nSowing the seeds of love\nWe're sowing the seeds\nSowing the seeds of love\nSowing the seeds of love\nMr. England sowing the seeds of love\n[Bridge 2: Curt Smith, Curt Smith & Roland Orzabal]\nTime to eat all your words\nSwallow your pride\nOpen your eyes\nTime to eat all your words\nSwallow your pride\nOpen your eyes\n\n[Verse 3: Roland Orzabal, Curt Smith]\nHigh time we made a stand\nTime to eat all your words\nAnd shook up the views of the common man\nSwallow your pride\nAnd the love train rides from coast to coast\nOpen your eyes\nEvery minute of every hour\nI love a sunflower\nOpen your eyes\nAnd I believe in love power\nOpen your eyes\nLove power\nLove power\nOpen your eyes\n\n[Chorus 4: Curt Smith & Roland Orzabal]\nSowing the seeds of love, seeds of love\nSowing the seeds\nSowing the seeds of love, the seeds
