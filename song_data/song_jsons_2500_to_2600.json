livin' deep in my heart\nWear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours\nWhy you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again\nBut even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nI can feel the changes, I can feel the new

Okinawa\nMy heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors\nNorway, no, you didn't get my flowers\nNo way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward\nFace just showered, the minute in a hour\nHeard about the news, whole day went sour\nLil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head\nPut you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes\nGive 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested\nAin't worried about the killers, just the young and restless\nGetting mad cause the quarter million on my necklace\nDUI never said I was driving reckless\nYou and I know that jealously is not impressive\nOh no, I can't stop, I was destined\n[Chorus: Brenda Russell with Flo Rida]\nI know\nCaught up in the middle\nI cry, just a little\nWhen I think of letting go\nOh no\nGave up on the riddle\nI cry, just a

God-fearing\nLook at me steering, got the bossing staring\nGot a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren\nTell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet\nThank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries\nBuy my momma chandeliers on my tears, dammit\nThirty years you had thought these emotions vanish\nTryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish\nNo cheers, I know you wouldn't panic\nYou might also

day\nAnd an ol' boy pulled up with a license plate\nFrom Ohio I thought oh good lord he's lost\nFrom his wranglers to his boots\nHe reminded me of Chris LeDoux\nAnd that Copenhagen smile\nSaid country must be country wide\n[Chorus]\nIn every state\nThere's a station\nPlaying Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon\nIn foreign cars and four wheel drives\nThere's cowboys and hillbillies\nFrom farm towns to big cities\nThere ain't no doubt in my mind\nCountry must be country wide\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt ain't where\nIt's how you live\nWe weren't raised to take\nWe were raised to give\nThe shirt off our back\nTo anyone in need\nWe bow our heads before we eat\nBefore we start our day\nBefore we fall asleep\n'Cause in God we trust and we believe\nAnd we see what's wrong\nAnd we know what's right\nAnd all Hank he said it all\nWhen he said country folks can survive\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nCountry must be country wide\nIn every state\nThere's a station\nPlaying Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon\nIn foreign

could work it out\nI'm done with how it feels\nSpinnin' my wheels\nLettin' you drag my heart around, and oh\nAnd I'm done thinkin'\nThat you could ever change\nI know my heart will never be the same\nBut I'm tellin' myself I'll be okay\nEven on my weakest days\nI get a little bit stronger\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt doesn't happen overnight, but you\nTurn around and a month's gone by and you\nRealize you haven't cried\nI'm not givin' you an hour or a second or another minute longer\nI'm busy gettin' stronger\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'm done hopin'\nThat we could work it out\nI'm done with how it feels\nSpinnin' my wheels\nLettin' you drag my heart around, and oh\nAnd I'm done thinkin'\nThat you could ever change\nI know my heart will never be the same\nBut I'm tellin' myself I'll be okay\nEven on my weakest days\nI get a little bit stronger\nI get a little bit stronger\nSee Sara Evans LiveGet tickets as low as $500You might also like[Bridge]\nI'm gettin' along without you,

fixin',\nThe peaches need pickin'\nAnd the cows need bringin' round\n[Chorus]\nI was haulin' hay, I was feedin' the hogs\nAnd that summer sun had me sweatin' like a dog\nSo I cooled off in the creek\nThen it was back to work in the daggum heat\nI was cussin' out loud, thinkin' 'bout quitin'\nLookin' back now I'm sure glad I didn't\n'Cause just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter\nI caught glimpse of the farmer's daughter\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe was just gettin' home from Panama city\nShe was all tanned up and my kinda pretty\nWhen her eyes met mine\nI was thinkin' that I would sure love my job\nAs the days got shorter our talks got longer\nThe kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger\nSo we'd hop in the truck and get all tangled up\nEvery chance we got\nWe were down by the river all night long\nWhen the sun came up I was sneakin' her home\nAnd draggin' my butt to work\nWith the smell of her perfume on my shirt\nI'd be on the tractor she'd be on my mind\nWith that sun beatin' down on this back of mine\nJust when I thought it couldn't get no hotter\nI fell in love with the farmer's daughter\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nWe got married last spring\nWhoa and there

sweet ice tea\nI'm on the tractor and she's on my mind\nAnd I can't wait 'til it's quitin' time\nAnd just when I think it can't get no hotter\nI come home to the farmer's daughter\nYeah, the farmer's

seen in a while\nTry and stay out of everybody's way\nIt's your freshman year and you're gonna be here\nFor the next four years in this town\nHopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say\n\"You know, I haven't seen you around before\"\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out\nWell, count to ten, take it in\nThis is life before you know who you're gonna be\nFifteen\n[Verse 2]\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\nAnd soon enough, you're best friends\nLaughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool\nWe'll be outta here as soon as we can\nAnd then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car\nAnd you're feelin' like flyin'\nAnd your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one\nAnd you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends\nWhen the night ends\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen and your first kiss\nMakes your head spin 'round\nBut in your life, you'll do things greater than\nDating the boy on the football team\nBut I didn't know it at fifteen\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\nBack then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had\nTo a boy who changed his mind\nAnd we both cried\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $325You might also

always dreamed of\nClose enough for you to taste, but you just can't touch\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet\n(No one knows your name yet)\nWonder when and where and how you're gonna make it\nYou know you can if you get the chance\nIn your face, and the door keeps slamming\nNow you're feeling more and more frustrated (Frustrated)\nAnd you're getting all kind of impatient (Impatient)\nWaitin' (Waitin')\n[Chorus]\nWe live and we learn\nTo take one step at a time\nThere's no need to rush\nIt's like learning to fly\nOr falling in love (Just falling in love)\nIt's gonna happen when it's supposed to happen\nThen we find the reasons why\nOne step at a time\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou believe and you doubt\nYou're confused\nAnd got it all figured out\nEverything that you always wished for\nCould be yours, should be yours, would be yours\nIf they only knew\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet\n(No one knows your name yet)\nWonder when and where and how you're gonna make it (Make it)\nYou know you can if you get the chance\nIn your face, and the door keeps slamming\nNow you're feeling more and more frustrated

time\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen you can't wait any longer (You can't wait)\nBut there's no end in sight (Ooh, oh)\n(When you need to find the strength)\nIt's your faith that makes you stronger\n(The only way we get there) The only way we get there\nIs one step at a time\n\n[Chorus]\nOh-oh, take one step at a time\nThere's no need to rush (No need to rush)\nIt's like learning to fly\nOr falling in love

She's gonna be there.\n\nI've met her before\nand I was hoping to meet her again.\n\nWe don't have to wait for Bernard.\n\nIt has to be all three.\nIf I go with you and get talking to her,\n\nthen you'll be hovering, hovering.\nAnd a girl gets awkward, awkward.\n\nBecause she thinks that\nyou and I are a thing, thing.\n\nBut all three of us go, then I catch\nher eye, peel off, natural, natural.\n\nWe need Bernard to get to my person.\n\nYou know I don't approve\nof you seeing other girls... people.\n\nWho is she, this so-called person?\n\nRowena. She's a friend of Ann's.\n\nOh, I see. Ro-weena.\n\nRo-weeena.\n\nAnd what am I supposed to do\n\nwhen you do the underpants-Charleston\nwith this insane, blind tart?\n\nWhy are you so angry?\n\n- I always get angry when I'm furious.\n- It's no big deal.\n\nBefore you move to the country\nto raise your bearded freak circus...\n\nWhat's she like?\nWhat are her prospects?\n\n- She's nice.\n- Oh, she's nice?\n\nDon't make me get sick\ninto my own scorn.\n\nDoes she play the viola? Embroider?\nIs she kind to the servants?\n\nI just know that I like her.\nAnd there's a chance she likes me.\n\n- That's all.\n- Right, we are going to this party.\n\nCos I'm trying to picture\nthis girl who likes you.\n\nAnd all I can see is you in a dress.\n\n- Come on, come on.\n- Oh, oh, wait. We can't go yet.\n\n- Why?\n- I need my kit.\n\nKazoo. Snuff.\n\nThimbles. Amulet.\n\nSwabs.

Let's par...\n\nDon't you dare you the word \"party\"\nas a verb in this shop!\n\nLet's p... otter along\nin order to attend the party.\n\n- Fran, get the wine.\n- Sure.\n\nWhat? Lies!

You live... here.\n\nThe key won't go in the thing!\n\n- Bernard, you're using your finger.\n- Oh, yeah.\n\n- My hair. Is my hair still good?\n- Yeah, you're a vision.\n\nSee? I told you about hair power.\n\nThree blokes put their phone numbers\ninto my new phone.\n\nLook.\n\nI'm dancing.\n\n- Why aren't you dancing?\n- There's no music.\n\nSing us a song, then. You're Irish.\n\nThat's what the Irish do\nafter a drink, isn't it?\n\nWhat would I sing?\n\nMm... something about cliffs\nand a girl with golden black hair.\n\nAnd the English all being bad.\n\n- Sing it yourself.\n- Fine.\n\n# Oh, Eamonn, Danny dear\n\n- # I miss the Galway Bay\n\n# And I'll sing for all I got\n\n# And a riddle-diddle Dublin\nand a riddle-diddle Donegal\n\n# The English are all bollocks #\n\nOh, no. This is no good,\nwe need proper music.\n\nLet's have a dancing competition.\n\nI'll go first and then it's you, Manny, OK?\n\n'# Pushing up the ante\nI know you got to see me\n\n- # Read 'em and weep... #\n- I'm going next. That's rubbish.\n\nI saw you at the party -\nyou embarrassed us.\n\n- I'll have you any day.\n- You can't do this.\n\n# The ace of spades\nthe ace of spades #\n\nWhy would I want to do that?\n\nWhy would I want to when I can do this?\n\n- Oh...\n\nOh...\n\nOh! What is this... I'm drinking?\nIt's disgu...\n\nIt's like a choc ice\nfell into a bottle of bleach.\n\nIt's children's booze! What's yours?\n\nBludge. It's quite good, actually.\nYou don't even have to drink it.\n\nYou just rub it on your hips and\nit eats right through to your liver.\n\n- Manny, what's yours?\n- Delicio's beetroot liqueur.\n\n- Give us a bit. Swap, come on.\n- No. It's mine!\n\nManny, don't be a baby.\nIt sounds nice. Pour some.\n\nI'll have one with ice and on fire.\n\n- Come on.\n- It's mine. It's all mine!\n\n- I'm gonna get blind drunk.\n- Don't be silly.\n\n- You'll regret it tomorrow.\n- No!\n\nWhy are you always\nbringing the mood down?\n\nI didn't wanna leave that party,\nit was great.\n\nNo, it wasn't! The music\nwas too loud, the food was cold.\n\nThe drinks were few\nand the people many.\n\nIt was everything I expected.\nAnd less.\n\nI'm never going outside again\nunless I need someplace to throw up.\n\nAnyway, you got your chance with her.\nWhat did you talk about?\n\nOffshore wind farms.\n\nI couldn't think of anything else.\n\nNever mind. I'm sure you left\na bunsen burner behind.\n\nYou can get it tomorrow and propose.\n\nNo! I couldn't find\nthe right moment to plant anything.\n\nShe kept following me around, in\nthe kitchen, the bedroom, bathroom.\n\nEvery time I put something down,\n\"You dropped your kazoo.\n\n\"Ooh, you got snuff on your plums.\"\n\nA total waste of time.\n\nFrankly, you're doomed.\nYou and all the shy people are.\n\nNatural selection\nfavours the loud and aggressive.\n\nI don't mean this in a bad way\nbut genetically you are... a cul-de-sac.\n\nOK. OK, I tried.\nAll right? It didn't work.\n\nAt least I tried to make\na connection with another person.\n\nWhen have you ever done that? Eh?\n\nExactly. You don't actually have a heart,\nBernard. Just a shard of ice.\n\n- Flint.\n- Sorry?\n\nFlint. I always saw it as a piece of flint.\n\nOh. You don't see yourself as a human.\n\nYou... you... you're some kind of\nsuperior species, aren't you?\n\nHomo Bernardus. Scorning every fool\nwho believes in happiness.\n\nManny, shush.\nThis is the beetroot talking.\n\nYou don't know what love is.\n\nYou don't un... You don't know!\n\n- I had a girlfriend. She died.\n- And anyway... What?\n\nThat's right. Her name was Emma.\n\nSomebody you barely know\nknocked you back. Big deal.\n\nI should be living with her by now.\n\nInstead, every morning\nI look through my cornflakes\n\nto see your big,\nmad, snaggle-toothed head.\n\nSo excuse me if I'm a bit...\nout of sorts sometimes.\n\nWould you like some beetroot liqueur?\n\nYou can have it.\nYou can have the whole bottle.\n\nReally, I mean it.\nYou can have nearly all of it.\n\n- Whoa! Don't go mad.\n- I don't feel like a drink, anyway.\n\nI'm making tea. Who wants tea?\n\nThat is the saddest story I've ever heard.\nPoor Bernard.\n\nThe worst part of it is...\n\nShe isn't actually dead.\nShe lives the other side of Priory Road.\n\nWhat?\n\nBernard told me about her\nthree years ago.\n\nA year after that, I started doing\nthis exercise class run by a clown.\n\n- Yeah?\n- Circusise, it was called.\n\nWe had to wear\nthese really, really big shoes.\n\nSo the step stuff was really hard.\n\nIt was like this. It went...\n\nTwo, three, four.\n\nTwo, three, four.\n\nAnd throw the bucket of water.\n\n- Two, three...\n- Yeah, Fran, Fran.\n\n- Try to stick to the story.\n- Oh, right. Yeah.\n\nAfterwards, we'd go for a pizza.\nOne time, we talked about boyfriends.\n\nThis girl, she says\nthat she once got engaged\n\nto this awful Irish guy...\n\ncalled...\n\nBernard. The only way\nshe could think of getting out of it\n\nwas to get her friends\nto say she was dead.\n\n- But she wasn't... dead?\n- No, Manny.\n\nWhich is why she was having\na pepperoni with extra cheese...\n\nyears later.\n\n- Why haven't you told Bernard?\n- Oh, I couldn't deal with all that.\n\nCan you imagine? All the shouting\nand the blaming. No, be very messy.\n\nNo, now, listen. Oi, you don't tell him.\n\n- Don't you ever tell him.\n- No.\n\n- No, Manny, I mean it.\n- I won't. I won't do it.\n\n- Not even in ten or even 20 years.\n- No, no way.\n\n- No, no.\n- What about a nice game of Monopoly?\n\nOh, yeah, that is a good idea.\n\nYeah. Yeah. OK, all right.\nHere we go.\n\nSo, OK, Fran, you be the hat.\nI'll be the dog and, Bernard, you...\n\nShe's alive! Bernard, she's alive!\n\nFran told me. Fran knows her!\nAsk her. Ask Fran.\n\nEmma lives in London.\n\nStill. I'm sorry, Bernard.\n\n- So, you're saying she must have...\n- Yeah.\n\nI don't believe you.\n\nWell, look. She's in my phone.\n\nThat's her full name, isn't it?\n\nI... I still don't believe you.\n\nThat's her and me at her last birthday.\n\nOne of the many she'll have,\nstill being alive.\n\nHer dental records.\n\nIt can't be her!\n\nOK. Here's her birth certificate.\n\nI keep it safely inside\nthe envelope with the photo of her\n\nreading yesterday's newspaper,\n\nwearing an \"I love life\" T-shirt.\n\nSo. So... house rules as usual.\n\nFines in the middle.\nIf we throw three doubles...\n\n- How long have you known this?\n- Couple of years. Does it matter?\n\nOh! We all want Pall Mall, don't we?\n\n- Who else knows?\n- Nobody. Hardly anybody.\n\nA few people.\n\nMr Singh at the newsagent's.\nOh, and your parents, I told them.\n\nAnd I tell people at parties\nif your name comes up.\n\nWell, maybe I know\na few things about you.\n\n- Maybe I've got a few little facts.\n- I've thrown a seven! Beat that.\n\nManny doesn't know what name you\nwere born with. Have you met Enid?\n\nN... Don't let's go down this road.\n\nThe letter you wrote to your mother\nas part of the self-help programme?\n\nYou couldn't find it. I posted it.\n\nManny, you did get into\nthe Open University.\n\nBut Bernard tore up the letter.\n\nI read your personal ad, I saw that.\n\n\"Intelligent, funny, 30-something female\n\n\"seeks solvent man for sex\nand possible friendship.\n\n\"Sense of humour irrelevant.\"\n\n- I've been reading your short stories.\n- That's different.\n\nAh, but it's good. Listen to this.\n\n\"Feared by men and admired by women,\n\n\"Brendan Blake turned\nfrom the window and patted Larry,\n\n\"his barely hominoid, milk-fed gimp.\"\n\nYou went to the party looking like that.\n\nI think that covers everything.\n\n- Hello?\n- Rowena!\n\nHi. Hi.\n\n- Hi.\n- Hi.\n\nWe were talking at the party.\n\n- Yes, hi, hi.\n- Hi.\n\n- And you left something behind.\n- Did I?\n\nYou were drinking out of this.\n\nI thought maybe\nyou wanted to keep the cup.\n\nSo I asked Ann where you lived and...\nBut you're busy.\n\n- I'm sorry. I'm stupid.\n- No, no, no.\n\nThanks for bringing it.\n\nI'm really, really pleased\nthat you came round... with... it.\n\nOh, for Christ's sake!\n\nWell... thanks. Thanks.\nI'll just put that there.\n\nSafe and sound.\n\nSo... Erm...\n\n- That's about it, really.\n- Right. Right.\n\nWell, th... thanks for...\ner, bringing it round.\n\nOffer her something, you fool.\n\nOh. Oh. S-Seeing as you're here,\nwould you like some tea or coffee?\n\nOr Bovril? Or a herbal coffee?\n\n- Tea's nice.\n- Tea! Coming up.\n\nI'll help you make it.\n\nAah. Good for Manny.\n\nI'm sorry, I should've told you\nabout Emma but she asked me not to.\n\nI was too good for her, anyway.\n\nShe had arms like a stevedore.\nStay and have a drink, will you?\n\nOh, no, no. I've gotta go home.\n\nI'm not sleeping in the skip again.\n\nI'll just lie down, just to rest my eyes.\n\nI've got a date tomorrow.\n\nI've gotta look nice.\n\nCould I talk with Emma... Oh, it's you. Hi.\n\nYes. That's right. That's right, it's me.\n\nI'm very well, th...

a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert\nSomebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp\nThat right there could drive a sane man berserk\nNot to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk\nHow do you console my mom or give her light support\nTellin' her her son's on life support?\nAnd just imagine how my girl feel\nOn the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till\nShe was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine\nShe a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign\nNo use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed\nTryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines\nIn the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died\nThe doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man\nStory on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band\nI swear, this right here, history in

past can be undone\nBut we carry on our back the burden time always reveals\nIn the lonely light of morning\nIn the wound that would not heal\nIt's the bitter taste of losing everything\nThat I've held so dear\n\n[Chorus]\nI've fallen, I have sunk so low\nI messed up\nBetter, I should know\nSo don't come 'round here\nAnd tell me \"I told you so\"\nOh\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Bridge]\nHeaven

space\nWhat did it, the whip appeal or my baby face?\n[Verse 4: Malice]\nThe night's still young and I'm already leaning\nCruise through the lot on the deuce-twos gleaming\nThe liquor in me and I don't need a reason\nObnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen\nI pull up, let her get in, she know from the beginning\nShe added to the list of them chicks that I done been in\nHer head spinning and my head spinning\nMine from juice and gin and hers from neck and chin and\nI'm a winner, man (Get down)\n\n[Chorus: Pharrell]\nWhen the last time you heard it like this?\nSmoke something,

sharp\nI walked away without a scratch\nThey brought the helicopter in\nAnd Billy couldn't feel his legs\nSaid he'd never walk again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut Billy said he would and his mom and daddy prayed\nAnd the day we graduated, he stood up to say\n\n[Chorus]\nUnsinkable ships sink\nUnbreakable walls break\nSometimes the things you think would never happen\nHappen just like that\nUnbendable

Minute Man Lyrics[Intro: Missy Elliott]\nDon't want, I don't need, I can't stand no minute man\nI don't want no minute man\nOoh, here's your chance, be a man, take my hand, understand\nI don't want no minute man\n\n[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]\nBoy, I'ma make you love me, make you want me\nAnd I'ma give you some attention tonight (Shut up)\nNow follow my intuitions, what you're wishin'\nSee I'ma keep you up all night (All night), for a long time, so start countin' away\n[Chorus: Missy Elliott]\nBreak me off, show me what you got\n'Cause I don't want no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\n'Cause I don't want no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\n'Cause I don't want no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\n'Cause I don't want no\u2014\n\n[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]\nTonight I'ma give it to you, throw it to you\nI want you to com\u0435 prepared, oh, yeah (Oh, y\u0435s)\nBoy, it's been a long time, a crazy long time\nAnd I don't want no minute man and that's real, give it to me some more\n\n[Chorus: Missy Elliott & Ludacris]\nBreak me off, show me what you got\n'Cause I don't want no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\n'Cause I don't want no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\n'Cause I don't want no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\n'Cause I don't want no\u2014 (Yeah, uh, uh)\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nIt's time to set your clock back 'bout as long as you can\nI stop daylight, it's Ludacris, the maintenance man\nGet your oil changed, I check fluids and transmission\nYou one minute fools, you wonder why y'all missin'\nOn the back of milk cartons and there's no reward\nNo regards, close, but it's no cigar\nA hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last\nI jump in pools and make a big splash\nWater overflowin', so get your head right\nIt's all in your mind, punk, so keep your head tight\nEnough with tips and advice and thangs\nI'm big dog, havin' women seein' stripes and thangs\nThey go to sleep, start snorin', countin' sheep and shit\nThey so wet that they body start to leak and shit\nJust 'cause I'm a all-nighter, shoot all fire\nLudacris, balance and rotate all tires\n\n[Bridge: Missy Elliott]\nOoh, I don't want, I don't need, I can't stand no minute man\nI don't want no minute man\nOoh, here's your chance, be a man take my hand, understand\nI don't want no minute man\n\n[Outro: Missy Elliott]\nBreak me off, show me what you got\n'Cause I don't want no one minute man\nBr\u2014 Br\u2014 Break me off, show me what you got\n'Cause I don't want no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\n'Cause I don't want no one minute man\nBr\u2014 Br\u2014 Break me off, break\u2014 break me off, break\u2014 break me off\nShow me what you

after she moved in\nI caught her paintin' the bedroom blue\nShe brought home a bottle of pink Chablis\nAnd poured out my best brew\n\nI was sittin' on the porch in my overalls\nWhile she packed her things to leave\nShe changed her mind when she couldn't change me\nShe changed direction headed out west\nChanged her tune to some hip-hop mess\nHer dark brown hair went blonde\nAnd her pretty blue eyes went green\nShe changed everything when she couldn't change me\n\nShe was sittin' beside the ocean\nLooking out at the waves\nWatching how they keep on rollin'\nBut always seem the same\n\nShe called and said she'd been thinkin' about\nAll those quiet country nights\nAnd whatever she thought was so wrong with me\nSuddenly seemed all right\n\nI was sittin' on the porch in my overalls\nWhen her truck pulled into view\nShe said I changed my mind when I couldn't change you\n\nShe changed direction headed back home\nShe changed her tune it's all Haggard and Jones\nShe had her dark brown hair pulled back\nAnd blue eyes like you've never seen\nShe changed her mind when she couldn't change me\nYou might also likeShe said I guess when you love someone you just gotta let it be\nYeah, she

a stranger in my house\nIt took a while to figure out\nThere's no way you could be who you say you are\nYou gotta be someone else\n'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that\nAnd he wouldn't treat me like you do\nHe would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me\nSo I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm not sure who you are\nDon't see your shadow around when you walk\nYou leave with no kisses\nGoodbye with no words\nIf these walls could talk\nThey would have nothing to tell\nSo what could it be?\nIs there someone imitating me?\nCould she be taking my place?\nLook me in the face\nAnd tell me that I'm wrong\nWhen I say\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThere's a stranger in my house (There's a stranger in my house)\nIt took a while to figure out (It took a while to figure out)\nThere's no way you

scream but it only comes out as a yawn when ya\nTry to see the world beyond your front door\nTake your time because the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile when ya\nRealize that with a guy my size it might take a while just to\nTry to figure out what all this is for\n[Verse 2]\nIt's the perfect time of day\nTo throw all your cares away\nPut the sprinkler on the lawn\nAnd run through with my gym shorts on\nTake a drink right from the hose\nAnd change into some drier clothes\nClimb the stairs up to my room\nSleep away the afternoon\n[Chorus]\n(Pinch me)\nIt's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone then ya\n(Pinch me)\nTry to scream but it only comes out as a yawn when ya\n(I'm still asleep)\nTry to see the world beyond your front door\n(Please God)\nTake your time because the way

were out on a date in my daddy's car\nWe hadn't driven very far\nThere in the road, straight ahead\nA car was stalled, the engine was dead\nI couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right\nI'll never forget the sound that night\nThe screaming tires, the busting glass\nThe painful scream that I heard last\n[Chorus]\nOh where, oh where can my baby be?\nThe Lord took her away from me\nShe's gone to heaven, so I got to be good\nSo I can see my baby when I leave this world\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I woke up, the rain was pouring down\nThere were people standing all around\nSomething warm running through my eyes\nBut somehow I found my baby that night\nI lifted her head, she looked at me and said\n\"Hold me, darling, just a little while\"\nI held her close, I kissed her our last kiss\nI found the love that I knew I would miss\nBut now she's gone, even though I hold her tight\nI lost my love, my life that night\n\n[Chorus]\nOh where, oh where can my baby be?\nThe Lord took her away from me\nShe's gone to heaven, so I got to be good\nSo I can see my baby when I leave this world\n\n[Outro]\nOoh, ooh-oohYou might also like21Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

away\nI was going as fast as a Rambler goes\nI could feel the speed from my head to my toes\nNow I know how Richard Petty feels\n[Chorus]\nI've been around the block a time or two\nDone almost everything a boy can do\nI've done some living, yeah I've had fun\nBut there is one thing that I haven't done\n\n[Verse 2]\nSaved two months, bought a little diamond\nTonight\u2019s the night, feels like perfect timing\nDown on one knee on momma's front steps\nMan I'm going to die if she really says yes\nI want to know how forever feels\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been around the block a time or two\nDone almost everything a boy can do\nI've done some living, yeah I've had fun\nBut there is one thing that I haven't done\n\n[Outro]\nI want to know how forever feels\nHey, I want to know how forever
