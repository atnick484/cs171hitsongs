heart now, baby\n(Oh, break a)\nBreak another little piece of my heart and throw it away\n(Oh, take a)\nTake another little piece of my heart now, baby\nYou know you got it\nIf it makes you feel good, oh yeah\n[Verse 2]\nOut there in the streets lookin' good\nAnd in your heart you know it ain't right, it just ain't right\nYeah, and you never, never, never, never hear me\nWhen I cry all night\nI

off in a wooden shoe\nSailed in a river\nOf crystal light into a sea of dew\n\nNow where are you going?\nAnd what do you wish?\nThe old moon asked of the three\nWell, we're going out fishing\nFor herring fish\nThat live in the beautiful sea\nNets of silver\nAnd gold have we said\nWynken and Blynken and Nod\n\nThe old moon laughed\nAnd sang a song\nAs they rocked in their wooden shoe\nAnd the wind that sped them\nAll night long ruffled the waves of dew\n\nWell the little stars were the herring fish\nThat lived in the beautiful sea\nNow cast your nets\nWherever you wish\nNever as feared are we\nSo sang the stars\nTo the fisherman three\nWynken and Blynken and Nod\n\nAll night long\nTheir nets they threw\nTo the stars and the twinkling foam\nThen down from the skies came\nThe wooden shoe bringing the fisherman home\n\nTwas all so pretty a sight\nIt seemed as if it could not be\nAnd some folks thought it was\nA dream they dreamed\nOf sailing the beautiful sea\nBut I shall name you\nThe fisherman three\nWynken, Blynken and Nod\nSee The Doobie Brothers LiveGet tickets as low as $58You might also likeNow Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes\nAnd Nod is a little head\nAnd the wooden

up\nSo I'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckoned\nBut it's clear that the match is rough\n\n[Chorus 1]\nCommon sense's tell me not to try'n continue\nBut I'm after a piece of that diamond in you\nSo keep an eye open\nMy spirit ain't broken\nYour love is so incredible\nYour body so edible\nYou give me an overdose of love\nJust a little is enough\n[Verse 2]\nI'm like a connoisseur of champagne cognac\nThe perfume nearly beats the taste\nI eat an oyster and I feel the contact\nBut more than one would be a waste\n\n[Chorus 2]\nSome people want an endless line that's true\nBut all I have is a little time with you\nA smile sets me reeling\nA kiss feel like stealing\nYour love is like heroin\nThis addict is mellowing\nI can't pretend that I'm tough\nJust a little is enough\n\n{Instrumental}\n\n[Verse 3]\nJust like a sailor heading into the seas\nThere's a gale blowing in my face\nThe high winds scare me but I need the breeze\nAnd I can't head for any other place\n\n[Chorus 3]\nLife would seem so easy on the other tack\nBut even a hurricane won't turn me back\nYou might be an island\nOn the distant horizon\nBut the little I see\nLooks like heaven to me\nI don't care if the ocean gets rough\nJust a little is enough\nYou might also like[Chorus 1]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1719097", "artist_names": "Poco",

belong to you any longer?\nI mean what do you think of that?\nYou might not be able to get a job because of the color of your fuckin' skin\nPeople don't realize how far down the drain America has gone\n\n[Verse 1]\nAll I wanna know is why I wanna die like this\nWhy so many people hate me \u2018cause the life I live?\nI mean so what i don't like girls and I do like men?\nDo I deserve to die and never kiss my momma again?\nIt's been a minute God now I need you more than ever\nFeel like a strang\u0435r but I'm wishing I could know you better\u00a0\nI know I changed, I ain\u2019t \u0435ven prayed in so long\nI\u2019m tryna do right but know that I been living so wrong\nI got so much to do I guess it's meant for me to prolong\nNobody to call, I hope they miss me when I\u2019m long gone\nAnother black man found dead is what the paper read\nMy picture all over the gram with condolences\nMy legacy's a hashtag, how did it get so scary?\nThis the part of being different that nobody would tell me\nLord forgive me for my sins I ain't ask to be like this\nI can't help it who I love all this hatred make me sick\nVoices in my head saying damn you too emotional\u00a0\nNoose around my neck like what the hell i'm supposed\u00a0to do\nDown to my last breathe God just let me close to you\nStaring in his blue eyes body slowly turning cool\nCan I live?\n[Interlude 1]\nTired of you fuckin' niggers\nDie already, die!\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll this pussy in the world yet you taking dicks\nI hope you faggots die of aids you fuckin' make me sick\nI hate the color of your skin wish you didn't exist\nSo when you die and burn in hell just remember this (Fuckin' nigga)\nGod made Adam and Eve you chose Steve\nAin't no sense in praying to him he white just like me\nHe don't approve of your kind so it's less than likely\nThat he would even give a fuck if I choked you miserably\nGet on your knees nigga - beg to the master please nigga\nThis our country why don't you all fuckin' leave, nigga?\nWhile you down there suck my dick and get a kick out of that\nThe two things I hate the most, a fuckin' fag and a black\nI'll be a hero for lynching your coon ass\nProbably do a month before Trump give me a hall pass\nMessage from the MAGA clan, niggers ain\u2019t accepted\nNow shut the fuck up and wear this noose like a necklace, nigga\n\n[Interlude 2]\nWhat the fuck?\nAye what the fuck?\nAye hold up, hold up\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI think you crackers got us fucked up\nI need that same energy when my guns bust\nPut that barrel in yo mouth watch you bitch up\nI never liked you pecker woods and what you stood for, shit\nGod damn white man, what's the hate with y'all?\nI go to school, work a job and never break the law\nAnd got a license to carry inase some shit pop off\nI file my taxes on time and paid my credit off, fuck\nYet you still hate me\nIs it \u2018cause you got it all yet you still ain't me?\nIs it \u2018cause you rock with Ye and I rock with Jay-Z?\nYou owe us back four hundred years, nigga, fuck you pay me\nI'm tired of seeing these MAGA hats on a fuckin' daily\nI'm tired of working overtime just to feed my baby\nIt's a war in my hood so why I need the navy\nI should rob yo ass blind, the way you tried to play me pussy\nBut none of you crackers ain\u2019t worth me doing a hundred years\nI got a daughter on the way tell me who gon' wipe her tears?\nWho gon\u2019 be there to protect her now from all of her fears?\nGay or straight, look, my skin just as black as his\nWhy you protecting a faggot and you don\u2019t even know each other?\nI give a fuck what he is \u2018cause past that he still my brother\nI let you live though I should've put you under\nNow run and tell the clan a nigga spared your life for nothing\nFuck out of

That's Andy Bernard.\nAndy Bernard.\nIf I were you St.\nBernard.\nI would fire Anthony Gardner What? before noon I'm not to consolidate power.\nI'm not firing somebody on the first day.\nNo, no, not somebody.\nGardner!

Got the food, good! Looky, looky, looky.\nWhat I want you to do Set it up in the conference room, please.\nMake it look nice, as if you were trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.\nOkay.\nYes, I'm in a good mood today.\nI'm excited to meet all of the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely.\nThat's always a thing that makes people happy, to have an old friend back.\nHello?

Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty So check out how we live In the Electric City! They call it Scranton! What? The Electric City! Scranton! What? The Electric City! Call Poison Control if you're bit by a spider! But check that it's covered By your healthcare provider! It reminds me of the orientation video Michael showed on my first day, The Scranton Witch Project.\nI am so scared when people don't label their personal food.\nYou like coalmines and you wanna see 'em? Well, check it out, yo the Anthracite Museum Plenty of space in the parkin' lot! But the little cars go in the compact spot! Spot! Spot! Spot!

Yes.\nBecause the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes.\nMeanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there laying on the charm.\nHey, Angela.\nCheck this out.\nIt's my new screensaver.\nDo you like it? I do like it, actually.\nThank you.\nYou have such a pretty smile, by the way.\nThank you.\nYou're welcome.\nHey.\nHey.\nWhat happened to grape soda? Oh, yeah, I'm trying to move away from that.\nGetting into more of a bottled water phase.\nYou've changed so much.\nWell, I'm evolving, Pam.\nSo when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked, or You wanna grab a coffee or something after work? Tonight, actually? No, I'm just still getting settled, so Oh, yeah, no, you know, whenever.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSorry to interrupt, I Nope, you're not interrupting anything.\nNope, I'm Don't.\nAll right.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nI should probably get back to work.\nCrack the whip.\nAll right.\nYeah, I know, me, too.\nThe day's going fine.\nIt's been a little chaotic, but it's fine.\nIt's great.\nA lot of distractions, but it's good.\nTake a picture, it'll last longer.\nI'm sorry, it's just It's a little distracting.\nDitto that, my brother.\nLook what's on his computer! What is that, a squid's eye, or It's my left breast.\nHow did you Right place at the right time.\nOh, what's that smell? What smell? There must be an air freshener plugged in somewhere.\nIt smells like a funeral home.\nOh, I'll help you find it.\nYou know what, never mind.\nWhat is it? I think I'm just allergic to your perfume.\nMy perfume? It's just my crazy nose.\nI'm used to different smells.\nBob Vance bought this perfume for me in metropolitan Orlando.\nIt's made from real pine.\nWho's Bob Vance? You've a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.\nI don't know who these new people think they are.\nI've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years.\nNever said a word.\nPeople hate people that are different from them.\nThat's natural.\nBut you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show.\nThat is why I created the integration celebration.\nThis is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one, united in applause.\nI know a lot of you must be thinking, \"Wow, what a day.\n\"It feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.\n\" Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out, a night at the Roxbury.\nOkay, there's supposed to be music, and it's I got it, I got it, Dwight! Just Do you have batteries in there? Stupid What is love? That's it! Yes, yes! Okay.\nHere we go.\nBaby don't hurt me Don't hurt me no more Don't hurt me no more Let it rock, baby! What is love? Baby don't hurt me Here we go, here we go! Don't hurt me no more Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.\nYou and me! You and me! Me and you! You and me! You and me! You! You! You! You! You and me! You! You! Oh, my nose is so itchy.\nWhy is my nose so itchy? Probably because of all the nose candy.\nOkay.\nI told you these guys had a sense of humor.\nVery funny, Michael! Okay.\nReally funny, Michael! All right, all right, all right, I'm on a roll.\nWhy are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.\nShouldn't we be equals? Not today, no.\nTony! Please join your cohorts on the table, if you would.\nThis is difficult for me.\nHey, I understand, we're all friends.\nNo, I mean, I can't physically.\nI can't get on the table.\nOh, well Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.\nOkay? You know what? I'll help.\nI will help.\nNo, please.\nDon't Don't be shy.\nDwight, let's do this.\nCome on, we're doing this thing.\nReady? On three.\nOne Let's get up.\nBend at the knees.\nOkay.\nHere we go! Here we go! I'm under this.\nI'm under this hock here.\nI don't know what I'm grabbing here! All right, all right! Stop! Put me down! But it feels good.\nPush it, push it! I'm right in your crack! No, put me down right now! Don't give up! You got it, man! Put me down right now! I've had enough! Put me down right now! You got it, you got it! Wait, wait, wait, okay, okay, okay.\nEasy.\nHey, easy.\nI'm sorry! Don't It's just not going to work for me.\nI have to go.\nI don't understand.\nI was on the fence about this, and it's just not a good fit.\nWell, we'll squeeze you in! I can't work here.\nI have to quit.\nYou can't quit on the first day! That's heresy, my friend! Okay, let's talk about this.\nWhat happened? I mean, what Was it Toby? Did he say something? 'Cause he's No, Toby was helpful.\nHe was very kind.\nIt's just your management style.\nMy management style? So Didn't you think Lazy Scranton was funny? No.\nWas it supposed to be funny? Okay, well Don't bother quitting, because you're fired.\nExcuse me? You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk! But there's nothing in my desk except coupons.\nDon't try to apologize to me, man.\nIt's too late! Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you! That was my advice.\nRemember, I'm the one who suggested that you fire him! Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.\nAnd what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would none be an accurate estimate? None advice? Fire Andy.\nFire Andy.\nDwight may have won the battle, but I will win the next battle.\nTony was right.\nThis environment is dysfunctional.\nWell, maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.\nWhoa, Angela, hold on.\nHooters is a restaurant with over 400 locations worldwide.\nBack to work.\nWe don't have to get along.\nWe just have to work together.\nNo, we do have to get along.\nCan't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King? The word \"merger\" comes from the word \"marriage\" and that was what today was supposed to be.\nThe loving union between people.\nInstead, it has become like when my mom moved in with Jeff.\nAnd once again, it becomes my job to fix it.\nHey, hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires! What? Yeah, they punk'd us, they punk'd us good! Come on! Come on! Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration? Does he ever.\nMan, they got us so bad.\nWe cannot let them get away with this! We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators! Yeah! Yeah? I don't think we can do that.\nGo home, Toby.\nJust Hey.\nWhy doesn't your car have a flat tire? Why? I will tell you why.\nBecause they saved the worst for me! They put a hate note under my windshield wiper.\nCheck this out, it's so hateful.\n\"You guys suck! \"You can never pull together as one and revenge us! \"That is why you suck!\" For crying out loud.\nNo.\nNo, no, no, no! No, you are falling for it! You are playing right into their hands.\nThis is just what they want you to do! Don't, okay.\nWhat is with this guy? Got an hour? I'll try to explain.\nThis is egregious! This is egregious! Trust me, it only gets worse.\nIs he always like this? Sometimes he brings more costumes.\nWhen do people work? We find little times during the day.\nHow are we gonna get home? Bob Vance has an air pump.\nHe said he'd fill all our tires up.\nBob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.\nSee that? Mission accomplished.\nThey're like a bunch of fourth graders.\nSometimes what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady.\nAlthough, that'll change! Because by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most.\nJell-O.\nHi, Jan.\nMichael! Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit? I did.\nMajor personnel crisis averted.\nCompliment accepted.\nDo you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance? Yes.\nYou do? But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my number two.\nWhat? No, no, no, Jim is your number two.\nWhat? He is the only one who has worked with both groups.\nI sent you a memo about this.\nYes, I know that, for I do read the memos.\nSo, after a great deal of thought and introspectivtion, I have decided to make Jim my new number two.\nIf he even wants it.\nIt doesn't come with a pay raise.\nNo, it does, actually.\nSo who will be your new number three? That I have not decided yet.\nMichael, I would just like to say that you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.\nThank you, Andy, that's very kind, thanks.\nAnd I have to say that your leadership has brought Shut it.\nShut it.\nThat's Suck-up.\nHey, where you at, Filippelli? I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.\nWhat's wrong, you didn't have a good first day? Oh, my God! Hey, you wanna meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.\nYeah, sure.\nSounds good.\nI Hey, you know what? Can I give you a call right back? Yeah.\nBye.\nOkay, thanks.\nHey.\nHey! I thought you had already left.\nNo, I just had some other stuff I had to do.\nGood.\nWhat's up? Oh, nothing, I just feel bad.\nI feel like things were a little weird today, or something.\nWhat do you mean? I just think I should tell you that I've sort of started seeing someone.\nAnd That's totally cool.\nYou can do whatever you want.\nOkay, good.\nWe're friends.\nWe'll always be friends.\nRight.\nIt's good to have you back.\nYeah, good to be back.\nSaw your dork-mobile in the parking lot.\nWhat does it get, like, four miles to the gallon? Try double that.\nClassic Trans Am, vintage American muscle.\nPlease.\nYeah, my Xterra is pretty sweet.\nLuxurious yet rugged.\nLeave it to the Japanese.\nXterra's not even a real word.\nActually, it is, it's Latin for \"earth.\n\" Oh, so you drive an X-earth? Yeah, that makes sense.\nI'd rather drive a classic Trans Am than an X-earth.\nYeah, I bet you would.\nOh, by the way, 1985 called.\nIt wants its car back.\nWell, I hope 1985 has a time machine, 'cause I drive an '87.\nSpeaking of time machines? I just got back from the future, and I went to your funeral, and guess what? Nobody came.\nSpeaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die? That was a really well-constructed sentence.\nYou should be an English professor at Cor-Not University.\nIdiot! If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a Trans Am.\nIf you were driving a Trans Am, you'd be the smartest idiot in the whole world.\nIdiot! You're the idiot.\nNice comeback.\nI was making fun of your comeback.\nThat's why it worked.\nI totally got the best of that interchange.\nRead more:

more money\nCause I don't see the world the way they do\nAnd I don't care what they're in it for\nOr what they're dreaming of\nI'm in it for you\nYou're in it for me\nWe're in it for love\nSome fools want their glory\nHow they crave it\nFrom my point of view\nThere only prisoners of their own device\nDon't give it to me\nThey can have it\nCause darlin' I've found\nMy paradise within your loving eyes\n\nYou may never see me\nStaring from a front page of a magazine\nCause I don't want to be a big a star\nIn a world of push and shove\nI'm in it for you\nYou're in it for me\nWe're in it for

1)\nYo\nI'm a fuckin' beast, a disgustin' freak rapin' nuns and priests\nCause I've been violent since the day that I discovered peace\nNever nothin' sweat, I murder snares and leave the drums deceased\nMy pen can rupture sheets, stab a song, and acupuncture beats\nYou're more then desperate, I forced the weapon in your direction\nThe forks embedded in your intestines your scorched and breathless\nNow you're stored and kept in my basement cellar that's corpse infested\nBorn relentless experimentin' with different torture methods\nI was rhymin' and makin' features while you were chasin' divas\nI'm a rapper and great achiever, you can't relate to either\nA sacred preacher, I'll take a cleaver and slice your facial features\nClaimin' that you sick when you pussies couldn't even break a fever\nI don't give a fuck about new cars and big chains\nYou can go to hell with your smooth talk and bitch claims\nYou should've known by now that my true bars inflict pain\nI bring terror to beats when I drool sparks and spit flames\nMy words are wise, I rap hard, my flow is turnin' tides\nYou'll burn alive I sip liquor and like my Bourbon dry\nI spit a verse of mine on the stage with the curtains wide\nSo quit sayin' that you gon' murder guys, you wouldn't hurt a fly\nI keep the rhythm the way I kill it should be forbidden\nThe demon's risen, I'm lawless and don't believe religion\nYou'll be a victim when I stab creatin' deep incisions\nSo get familiar with fish because you gon' be sleepin' with um\n(Chorus x 2)\nThis is Hip Hop, fitted hats and baggy jeans\nThis is hardcore, sippin' jack and passin' weed\nThis is head nod music, where the purple at?\nFaggots better put their purses back this is Murder Rap\n\n(Verse 2)\nI'm the main attraction, your brains are bashed in until it stains the napkin\nI'm bringin' what the game is lackin' this is dangerous rappin'\nYour shameless passion's pathetic I can't refrain from laughin'\nIf I hear a track I'm takin' action, I'm a trained assassin\nI'm in the booth with machetes, razors, and Tommy guns\nI only rap over heavy base and atomic drums\nA verse of mine could leave the optics in your sockets numb\nWe're all born with original sin so why should I stop at one\nMy lyrical ways causin' miserable fates\nMy criminal traits intimidate political snakes\nSo now I'm puffin' on the kush until my visuals fade\nAnd takin' rap to put it back in its original state\nI got a beat obsession which motivates me to write and seek progression\nI spit key conceptions to release you from your deep depression\nIt's cause of rap that I don't need a weapon to release aggression\nI bleed in heaven, I box with God, and I dream inception\nI keep it comin' cause I know you fans in need of substance\nYour speakers bumpin' from my vocals and obscene production\nBang the repercussions till you suffer from a beat concussion\nYou know sleep faggot? Yeah well you about to meet his cousin\nYou might also like\n\n\n(Chorus x 2)\nThis is Hip Hop, fitted hats and baggy jeans\nThis is hardcore, sippin' jack and passin' weed\nThis is head nod music, where the purple at?\nFaggots better put their purses back this is Murder RapEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 320, "api_path": "/songs/101377", "artist_names": "James Joyce", "full_title": "Ulysses (Chap. 12 - Cyclops) by\u00a0James\u00a0Joyce", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "id": 101377, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 159066, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1627583807, "path": "/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-12-cyclops-annotated", "pyongs_count": 3, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-12-cyclops-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1922, "month": 2, "day": 2}, "release_date_for_display": "February 2, 1922", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 2, 1922", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 254, "hot": false, "pageviews": 20678}, "title": "Ulysses (Chap. 12 - Cyclops)", "title_with_featured": "Ulysses (Chap. 12 - Cyclops)", "updated_by_human_at": 1633434775, "url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-12-cyclops-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/22971", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/98f10611fc0aa6a525b9fbcab2ffa297.1000x600x1.jpg", "id": 22971, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9997f2e769ef85b9f941405cac99d1af.570x570x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "James Joyce", "slug": "James-joyce", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-joyce"}, "artist": "James Joyce", "lyrics": "Ulysses (Chap. 12 - Cyclops) LyricsI was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D.

I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.\n\n\u2014Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?\n\n\u2014Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?\n\n\u2014Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.\n\n\u2014What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane\u2014old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him\u2014lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.\n\u2014Circumcised? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.\n\n\u2014That the lay you're on now? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?\n\nFor nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.\n\u2014Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Not taking anything between drinks, says I.\n\n\u2014What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.\n\n\u2014Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.\n\n\u2014Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.\n\n\u2014Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?\n\u2014Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.\n\n\u2014-What was that, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.\n\nSo we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.\n\nIn Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.\n\nAnd there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.\n\nI dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!\n\nAnd by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.\n\nSo we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.\n\n\u2014There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.\n\nThe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.\n\n\u2014Stand and deliver, says he.\n\n\u2014That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.\n\u2014Pass, friends, says he.\n\nThen he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:\n\n\u2014What's your opinion of the times?\n\nDoing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.\n\n\u2014I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.\n\nSo begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:\n\n\u2014Foreign wars is the cause of it.\n\nAnd says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:\n\n\u2014It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.\n\n\u2014Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.\n\n\u2014Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Wine of the country, says he.\n\n\u2014What's yours? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.\n\n\u2014Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.\n\n\u2014Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?\n\nAnd with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.\n\nThe figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.\n\nHe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.\n\nSo anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.\n\n\u2014And there's more where that came from, says he.\n\n\u2014Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.\n\n\u2014I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.\n\nWho comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.\n\n\u2014For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.\n\nAnd he starts reading them out:\n\n\u2014Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...\n\n\u2014I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.\n\n\u2014Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, honourable person.\n\n\u2014Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.\n\nAh! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.\n\nAnd lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.\n\nLittle Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.\n\n\u2014Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...\n\nAnd he doubled up.\n\n\u2014Take a what? says I.\n\n\u2014Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.\n\n\u2014O hell! says I.\n\nThe bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.\n\n\u2014Bi i dho husht, says he.\n\n\u2014Who? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.\n\n\u2014When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...\n\nAnd he started laughing.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?\n\n\u2014Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.\n\nTerence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.\n\nThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\n\nBut he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.\n\n\u2014What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.\n\nSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.\n\n\u2014Are you codding? says I.\n\n\u2014Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.\n\nSo Joe took up the letters.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.\n\nSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:\n\n\u2014How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?\n\n\u2014I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...\n\n\u2014You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?\n\n\u2014With Dignam, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is it Paddy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Why?\n\n\u2014Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.\n\n\u2014Who's dead? says Bob Doran.\n\n\u2014You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?\n\n\u2014What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?\n\n\u2014Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.\n\n\u2014Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\n\n\u2014Paddy? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says Alf.\n\nBegob he was what you might call flabbergasted.\n\nIn the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.\n\nAssurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.\n\nHe is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.\n\n\u2014There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.\n\nAnd, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.\n\nLittle Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.\n\nAnd says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:\n\n\u2014Who said Christ is good?\n\n\u2014I beg your parsnips, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.\n\nBut Bob Doran shouts out of him.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.\n\nTerry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.\n\n\u2014The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.\n\nThe tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.\n\n\u2014The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.\n\nAnd mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.\n\nOld Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.\n\n\u2014Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.\n\nSo Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.\n\n\u2014O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?\n\nAnd he starts reading out one.\n\n7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.\n\nHonoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...\n\n\u2014Show us, Joe, says I.\n\n\u2014... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...\n\n\u2014Jesus, says I.\n\n\u2014... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...\n\nThe citizen made a grab at the letter.\n\n\u2014Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.\nH. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.\n\n\u2014And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?\n\nSo they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.\n\n\u2014Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.\n\nAnd Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.\n\n\u2014They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.\n\nAnd he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.\n\nIn the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.\n\nSo they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.\n\n\u2014There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.\n\n\u2014That so? says Joe.\n\n\u2014God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in\n\nKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.\n\n\u2014Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.\n\n\u2014That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...\n\nAnd then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.\n\nThe distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.\n\nSo of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:\n\n\u2014Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!\n\nArrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.\n\nAnd the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b\u00e9zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!\n\n\u2014The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...\n\n\u2014Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.\n\nThe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petit\u00e9patant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Vir\u00e1ga Kis\u00e1szony Putr\u00e1pesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.\n\nQuietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate\u2014short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fianc\u00e9e an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:\n\n\u2014God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.\n\nSo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.\n\nSo howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.\n\n\u2014Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.\n\n\u2014No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.\n\nSo he calls the old dog over.\n\n\u2014What's on you, Garry? says he.\n\nThen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.\n\nAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.\n\nThe curse of my curses\nSeven days every day\nAnd seven dry Thursdays\nOn you, Barney Kiernan,\nHas no sup of water\nTo cool my courage,\nAnd my guts red roaring\nAfter Lowry's lights.\n\nSo he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.\n\nGob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:\n\n\u2014Could you make a hole in another pint?\n\n\u2014Could a swim duck? says I.\n\n\u2014Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.\n\n\u2014Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.\n\n\u2014Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?\n\n\u2014Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.\n\n\u2014Whose admirers? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.\n\nThen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.\n\nSo Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.\n\n\u2014Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.\n\n\u2014No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.\n\n\u2014Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.\n\nAnd off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.\n\nSo Terry brought the three pints.\n\n\u2014Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.\n\n\u2014Slan leat, says he.\n\n\u2014Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.\n\nGob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.\n\n\u2014Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Friend of yours, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?\n\n\u2014I won't mention any names, says Alf.\n\n\u2014I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.\n\n\u2014Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.\n\nSo Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.\n\nGa Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.\n\n\u2014Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.\n\n\u2014Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.\n\n\u2014Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.\n\n\u2014That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?\n\n\u2014Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?\n\nMr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.\n\nMr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?\n\nMr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)\n\nMr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.\n\nMr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.\n\n(Ironical opposition cheers.)\n\nThe speaker: Order! Order!\n\n(The house rises. Cheers.)\n\n\u2014There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?\n\n\u2014Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.\n\n\u2014Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.\n\n\u2014Is that really a fact? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?\n\nSo off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.\n\nA most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.\n\nAmongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.\n\n\u2014Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?\n\n\u2014No, says Joe.\n\n\u2014I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Who? Blazes? says Joe.\n\nAnd says Bloom:\n\n\u2014What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.\n\n\u2014Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.\n\n\u2014We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.\n\n\u2014-True for you, says Joe.\n\nAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:\n\n\u2014Now, don't you think, Bergan?\n\n\u2014Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.\n\nIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.\n\n\u2014He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.\n\n\u2014He is, says Joe. Isn't he?\n\n\u2014Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.\n\n\u2014Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.\n\n\u2014My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.\n\nHe's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.\n\nHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.\n\nPride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.\n\nAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.\n\n\u2014Hello, Ned.\n\n\u2014Hello, Alf.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack.\n\n\u2014Hello, Joe.\n\n\u2014God save you, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?\n\n\u2014Half one, says Ned.\n\nSo J. J. ordered the drinks.\n\n\u2014Were you round at the court? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.\n\n\u2014Hope so, says Ned.\n\nNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.\n\n\u2014Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.\n\n\u2014Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.\n\n\u2014Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.\n\n\u2014Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.\n\n\u2014Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.\n\n\u2014Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.\n\n\u2014Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.\n\n\u2014Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.\n\n\u2014How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...\n\n\u2014Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.\n\n\u2014Nor good red herring, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.\n\nBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.\n\n\u2014And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.\n\nSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.\n\n\u2014Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Good health, Ned, says J. J.\n\n\u2014-There he is again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Where? says Alf.\n\nAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.\n\n\u2014How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Remanded, says J. J.\n\nOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.\n\n\u2014Who tried the case? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Recorder, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\n\n\u2014Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.\n\nAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:\n\n\u2014A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?\n\n\u2014Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\n\n\u2014And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.\n\nAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.\n\n\u2014Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.\n\nSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.\n\n\u2014Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.\n\n\u2014Rely on me, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.\n\n\u2014O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.\n\n\u2014Consider that done, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Very kind of you, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.\n\n\u2014Decree nisi, says J. J.\n\nAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.\n\n\u2014A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.\n\n\u2014And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\n\n\u2014Give us a squint at her, says I.\n\nAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.\n\n\u2014O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!\n\n\u2014There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?\n\nSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.\n\n\u2014Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?\n\nO'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.\n\n\u2014It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.\n\nSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.\n\n\u2014Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.\n\n\u2014The European family, says J. J....\n\n\u2014They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\n\nAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!\n\nHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.\n\n\u2014What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.\n\n\u2014Gold cup, says he.\n\n\u2014Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.\n\n\u2014And Bass's mare? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.\n\n\u2014I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.\n\n\u2014Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.\n\nSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.\n\n\u2014Not there, my child, says he.\n\n\u2014Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.\n\nAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.\n\n\u2014Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.\n\n\u2014Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?\n\n\u2014As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...\n\n\u2014Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.\n\n\u2014Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.\n\nThe fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.\n\n\u2014And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\n\n\u2014And will again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.\n\nAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.\n\n\u2014Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?\n\n\u2014An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\u2014Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.\n\nHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.\n\n\u2014But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?\n\n\u2014I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.\n\nSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.\n\n\u2014A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\n\nThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.\n\n\u2014That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.\n\nThe fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.\n\n\u2014On which the sun never rises, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.\n\nThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.\n\n\u2014But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?\n\nDidn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.\n\n\u2014We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.\n\n\u2014Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...\n\n\u2014We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.\n\n\u2014Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?\n\n\u2014The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Fran\u00e7ais, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.\n\n\u2014And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?\n\nJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.\n\n\u2014Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!\n\n\u2014And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.\n\n\u2014They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.\n\nAnd says J. J.:\n\n\u2014Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.\n\n\u2014Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says he. I will.\n\n\u2014You? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.\n\n\u2014Repeat that dose, says Joe.\n\nBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.\n\n\u2014Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.\n\n\u2014But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014What is it? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.\n\n\u2014By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years.\n\nSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:\n\n\u2014Or also living in different places.\n\n\u2014That covers my case, says Joe.\n\n\u2014What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.\n\nThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\n\n\u2014After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.\n\n\u2014Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.\n\nThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave\u2014all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.\n\n\u2014Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?\n\n\u2014That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.\n\n\u2014And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.\n\nGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.\n\n\u2014Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\n\n\u2014Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.\n\nThat's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.\n\n\u2014But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.\n\nWho's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.\n\n\u2014A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.\n\n\u2014Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.\n\n\u2014That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.\n\nLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.\n\n\u2014Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.\n\n\u2014Hurrah, there, says Joe.\n\n\u2014The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.\n\nAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\n\n\u2014We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\nSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:\n\n\u2014A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.\n\n\u2014Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.\n\n\u2014Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\n\n\u2014Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.\n\n\u2014And a very good initial too, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is?\n\n\u2014Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.\n\n\u2014I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels.\n\n\u2014Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?\n\n\u2014That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.\n\n\u2014There you are, says Terry.\n\nGoodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\n\nSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one.\n\n\u2014Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.\n\nSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense.\n\nOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.\n\n\u2014Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!\n\nSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\n\nMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\n\n\u2014Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\n\n\u2014Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\n\n\u2014Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.\n\n\u2014How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?\n\nAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.\n\n\u2014Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.\n\n\u2014Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?\n\nMine host bowed again as he made answer:\n\n\u2014What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?\n\n\u2014Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!\n\n\u2014Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.\n\nSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.\n\n\u2014Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.\n\n\u2014Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?\n\n\u2014That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.\n\n\u2014Who made those allegations? says Alf.\n\n\u2014I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.\n\n\u2014And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow?\n\n\u2014Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.\n\n\u2014Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.\n\n\u2014Who is Junius? says J. J.\n\n\u2014We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.\n\n\u2014He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.\n\n\u2014Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.\n\n\u2014That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!\n\n\u2014Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother.\n\n\u2014Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.\n\n\u2014O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\n\n\u2014En ventre sa m\u00e8re, says J. J.\n\n\u2014Do you call that a man? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014And who does he suspect? says the citizen.\n\nGob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.\n\n\u2014Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.\n\n\u2014A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\n\n\u2014Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.\n\n\u2014Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.\n\n\u2014You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.\n\n\u2014Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.\n\n\u2014Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.\n\n\u2014Amen, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And I'm sure He will, says Joe.\n\nAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.\n\n\u2014Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.\n\n\u2014Qui fecit coelum et terram.\n\n\u2014Dominus vobiscum.\n\n\u2014Et cum spiritu tuo.\n\nAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:\n\n\u2014Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.\n\n\u2014And so say all of us, says Jack.\n\n\u2014Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.\n\n\u2014Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.\n\nI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.\n\n\u2014I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not...\n\n\u2014No, says Martin, we're ready.\n\nCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,\n\n\u2014Beg your pardon, says he.\n\n\u2014Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret.\n\nAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\n\n\u2014Bye bye all, says Martin.\n\nAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\n\n\u2014-Off with you, says\n\nMartin to the jarvey.\n\nThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.\n\nBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\n\n\u2014Let me alone, says he.\n\nAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:\n\n\u2014Three cheers for Israel!\n\nArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.\n\nAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:\n\n\u2014Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!\n\nAnd says he:\n\n\u2014Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.\n\n\u2014He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.\n\n\u2014Whose God? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.\n\nGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\n\n\u2014By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.\n\nBy Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.\n\n\u2014Stop! Stop! says Joe.\n\nA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great \u00e9clat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy's March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra, kedves bar\u00e1ton! Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra! Gone but not forgotten.\n\nGob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre:\n\n\u2014Where is he till I murder him?\n\nAnd Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.\n\n\u2014Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.\n\nBut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other way and off with him.\n\n\u2014Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!\n\nBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\n\nThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of d\u00e9bris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R. C. S. I.\n\nYou never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.\n\n\u2014Did I kill him, says he, or what?\n\nAnd he shouting to the bloody dog:\n\n\u2014After him, Garry! After him, boy!\n\nAnd the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.\n\nWhen, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai! And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/160947", "artist_names": "George Eliot", "full_title": "Romola (Chap. 13) by\u00a0George\u00a0Eliot", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/9f36139fa4e29280d70027b0b5c990f7.266x266x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9f36139fa4e29280d70027b0b5c990f7.266x266x1.jpg", "id": 160947, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 226993, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": null, "path": "/George-eliot-romola-chap-13-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/George-eliot-romola-chap-13-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/9f36139fa4e29280d70027b0b5c990f7.266x266x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9f36139fa4e29280d70027b0b5c990f7.266x266x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Romola (Chap. 13)", "title_with_featured": "Romola (Chap. 13)", "updated_by_human_at": 1370295825, "url": "https://genius.com/George-eliot-romola-chap-13-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/44723", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fcafe0d84fc4d57736e61dbfd4ce7906.538x531x1.jpg", "id": 44723, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fcafe0d84fc4d57736e61dbfd4ce7906.538x531x1.jpg", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "George Eliot", "slug": "George-eliot", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/George-eliot"}, "artist": "George Eliot", "lyrics": "Romola (Chap. 13) LyricsThe Shadow of Nemesis\n\nIt was the lazy afternoon time on the seventh of September, more than two months after the day on which Romola and Tito had confessed their love to each other.\n\nTito, just descended into Nello\u2019s shop, had found the barber stretched on the bench with his cap over his eyes; one leg was drawn up, and the other had slipped towards the ground, having apparently carried with it a manuscript volume of verse, which lay with its leaves crushed. In a corner sat Sandro, playing a game at mora by himself, and watching the slow reply of his left fingers to the arithmetical demands of his right with solemn-eyed interest.\n\nTreading with the gentlest step, Tito snatched up the lute, and bending over the barber, touched the strings lightly while he sang\u2014\n\n\u201cQuant\u2019 \u00e8 bella giovinezza,\nChe si fugge tuttavia!\nChi vuol esser lieto sia,\nDi doman non c\u2019\u00e8 certezza.\u201d\nNello was as easily awaked as a bird. The cap was off his eyes in an instant, and he started up.\n\n\u201cAh, my Apollino! I am somewhat late with my siesta on this hot day, it seems. That comes of not going to sleep in the natural way, but taking a potion of potent poesy. Hear you, how I am beginning to match my words by the initial letter, like a Trovatore? That is one of my bad symptoms: I am sorely afraid that the good wine of my understanding is going to run off at the spigot of authorship, and I shall be left an empty cask with an odour of dregs, like many another incomparable genius of my acquaintance. What is it, my Orpheus?\u201d\n\nhere Nello stretched out his arms to their full length, and then brought them round till his hands grasped Tito\u2019s curls, and drew them out playfully.\n\n\u201cWhat is it you want of your well-tamed Nello? For I perceive a coaxing sound in that soft strain of yours. Let me see the very needle\u2019s eye of your desire, as the sublime poet says, that I may thread it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is but a tailor\u2019s image of your sublime poet\u2019s,\u201d said Tito,\n\nstill letting his fingers fall in a light dropping way on the strings.\n\n\u201cBut you have divined the reason of my affectionate impatience to see your eyes open. I want, you to give me an extra touch of your art\u2014not on my chin, no; but on the zazzera, which is as tangled as your Florentine politics. You have an adroit way of inserting your comb, which flatters the skin, and stirs the animal spirits agreeably in that region; and a little of your most delicate orange-scent would not lie amiss, for I am bound to the Scala palace, and am to present myself in radiant company. The young cardinal Giovanni de\u2019 Medici is to be there, and he brings with him a certain young Bernardo Dovizi of Bibbiena, whose wit is so rapid that I see no way of out-rivalling it save by the scent of orange-blossoms.\u201d\n\nNello had already seized and flourished his comb, and pushed Tito gently backward into the chair, wrapping the cloth round him.\n\n\u201cNever talk of rivalry, bel giovane mio: Bernardo Dovizi is a keen youngster, who will never carry a net out to catch the wind; but he has something of the same sharp-muzzled look as his brother Ser Piero, the weasel that Piero de\u2019 Medici keeps at his beck to slip through small holes for him. No! you distance all rivals, and may soon touch the sky with your forefinger. They tell me you have even carried enough honey with you to sweeten the sour Messer Angelo; for he has pronounced you less of an ass than might have been expected, considering there is such a good understanding between you and the Secretary.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd between ourselves, Nello mio, that Messer Angelo has more genius and erudition than I can find in all the other Florentine scholars put together. It may answer very well for them to cry me up now, when Poliziano is beaten down with grief, or illness, or something else; I can try a flight with such a sparrow-hawk as Pietro Crinito, but for Poliziano, he is a large-beaked eagle who would swallow me, feathers and all, and not feel any difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not contradict your modesty there, if you will have it so; but you don\u2019t expect us clever Florentines to keep saying the same things over again every day of our lives, as we must do if we always told the truth. We cry down Dante, and we cry up Francesco Cei, just for the sake of variety; and if we cry you up as a new Poliziano, heaven has taken care that it shall not be quite so great a lie as it might have been. And are you not a pattern of virtue in this wicked city? with your ears double-waxed against all siren invitations that would lure you from the Via de\u2019 Bardi, and the great work which is to astonish posterity?\u201d\n\n\u201cPosterity in good truth, whom it will probably astonish as the universe does, by the impossibility of seeing what was the plan of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, something like that was being prophesied here the other day. Cristoforo Landino said that the excellent Bardo was one of those scholars who lie overthrown in their learning, like cavaliers in heavy armour, and then get angry because they are over-ridden\u2014which pithy remark, it seems to me, was not a herb out of his own garden; for of all men, for feeding one with an empty spoon and gagging one with vain expectation by long discourse, Messer Cristoforo is the pearl. Ecco! you are perfect now.\u201d\nHere Nello drew away the cloth.\n\n\u201cImpossible to add a grace more! But love is not always to be fed on learning, eh? I shall have to dress the zazzera for the betrothal before long\u2014is it not true?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Tito, smiling,\n\n\u201cunless Messer Bernardo should next recommend Bardo to require that I should yoke a lion and a wild boar to the car of the Zecca before I can win my Alcestis. But I confess he is right in holding me unworthy of Romola; she is a Pleiad that may grow dim by marrying any mortal.\u201d\n\n\u201cGnaff\u00e8, your modesty is in the right place there. Yet fate seems to have measured and chiselled you for the niche that was left empty by the old man\u2019s son, who, by the way, Cronaca was telling me, is now at San Marco. Did you know?\u201d\n\nA slight electric shock passed through Tito as he rose from the chair, but it was not outwardly perceptible, for he immediately stooped to pick up the fallen book, and busied his fingers with flattening the leaves, while he said\u2014\n\n\u201cNo; he was at Fiesole, I thought. Are you sure he is come back to San Marco?\u201d\n\n\u201cCronaca is my authority,\u201d said Nello, with a shrug.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t frequent that sanctuary, but he does. Ah,\u201d\n\nhe added, taking the book from Tito\u2019s hands,\n\n\u201cmy poor Nencia da Barberino! It jars your scholarly feelings to see the pages dog\u2019s-eared. I was lulled to sleep by the well-rhymed charms of that rustic maiden\u2014\u2018prettier than the turnip-flower,\u2019 \u2018with a cheek more savoury than cheese.\u2019 But to get such a well-scented notion of the contadina, one must lie on velvet cushions in the Via Larga\u2014not go to look at the Fierucoloni stumping in to the Piazza della Nunziata this evening after sundown.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd pray who are the Fierucoloni?\u201d said Tito, indifferently, settling his cap.\n\n\u201cThe contadine who came from the mountains of Pistoia, and the Casentino, and heaven knows where, to keep their vigil in the church of the Nunziata, and sell their yarn and dried mushrooms at the Fierucola (the little Fair), as we call it. They make a queer show, with their paper lanterns, howling their hymns to the Virgin on this eve of her nativity\u2014if you had the leisure to see them. No?\u2014well, I have had enough of it myself, for there is wild work in the Piazza. One may happen to get a stone or two about one\u2019s ears or shins without asking for it, and I was never fond of that pressing attention. Addio.\u201d\nTito carried a little uneasiness with him on his visit, which ended earlier than he had expected, the boy-cardinal Giovanni de\u2019 Medici, youngest of red-hatted fathers, who has since presented his broad dark cheek very conspicuously to posterity as Pope Leo the Tenth, having been detained at his favourite pastime of the chase, and having failed to appear. It still wanted half an hour of sunset as he left the door of the Scala palace, with the intention of proceeding forthwith to the Via de\u2019 Bardi; but he had not gone far when, to his astonishment, he saw Romola advancing towards him along the Borgo Pinti.\n\nShe wore a thick black veil and black mantle, but it was impossible to mistake her figure and her walk; and by her side was a short stout form, which he recognised as that of Monna Brigida, in spite of the unusual plainness of her attire. Romola had not been bred up to devotional observances, and the occasions on which she took the air elsewhere than under the loggia on the roof of the house, were so rare and so much dwelt on beforehand, because of Bardo\u2019s dislike to be left without her, that Tito felt sure there must have been some sudden and urgent ground for an absence of which he had heard nothing the day before. She saw him through her veil and hastened her steps.\n\n\u201cRomola, has anything happened?\u201d said Tito, turning to walk by her side.\n\nShe did not answer at the first moment, and Monna Brigida broke in.\n\n\u201cAh, Messer Tito, you do well to turn round, for we are in haste. And is it not a misfortune?\u2014we are obliged to go round by the walls and turn up the Via del Maglio, because of the Fair; for the contadine coming in block up the way by the Nunziata, which would have taken us to San Marco in half the time.\u201d\n\nTito\u2019s heart gave a great bound, and began to beat violently.\n\n\u201cRomola,\u201d he said, in a lower tone, \u201care you going to San Marco?\u201d\n\nThey were now out of the Borgo Pinti and were under the city walls, where they had wide gardens on their left-hand, and all was quiet. Romola put aside her veil for the sake of breathing the air, and he could see the subdued agitation in her face.\n\n\u201cYes, Tito mio,\u201d she said, looking directly at him with sad eyes.\n\n\u201cFor the first time I am doing something unknown to my father. It comforts me that I have met you, for at least I can tell you. But if you are going to him, it will be well for you not to say that you met me. He thinks I am only gone to my cousin, because she sent for me. I left my godfather with him: he knows where I am going, and why. You remember that evening when my brother\u2019s name was mentioned and my father spoke of him to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tito,\n\nin a low tone. There was a strange complication in his mental state. His heart sank at the probability that a great change was coming over his prospects, while at the same time his thoughts were darting over a hundred details of the course he would take when the change had come; and yet he returned Romola\u2019s gaze with a hungry sense that it might be the last time she would ever bend it on him with full unquestioning confidence.\n\n\u201cThe cugina had heard that he was come back, and the evening before\u2014the evening of San Giovanni\u2014as I afterwards found, he had been seen by our good Maso near the door of our house; but when Maso went to inquire at San Marco, Dino, that is, my brother\u2014he was christened Bernardino, after our godfather, but now he calls himself Fra Luca\u2014had been taken to the monastery at Fiesole, because he was ill. But this morning a message came to Maso, saying that he was come back to San Marco, and Maso went to him there. He is very ill, and he has adjured me to go and see him. I cannot refuse it, though I hold him guilty; I still remember how I loved him when I was a little girl, before I knew that he would forsake my father. And perhaps he has some word of penitence to send by me. It cost me a struggle to act in opposition to my father\u2019s feeling, which I have always held to be just. I am almost sure you will think I have chosen rightly, Tito, because I have noticed that your nature is less rigid than mine, and nothing makes you angry: it would cost, you less to be forgiving; though, if you had seen your father forsaken by one to whom he had given his chief love\u2014by one in whom he had planted his labour and his hopes\u2014forsaken when his need was becoming greatest\u2014even you, Tito, would find it hard to forgive.\u201d\n\nWhat could he say? He was not equal to the hypocrisy of telling Romola that such offences ought not to be pardoned; and he had not the courage to utter any words of dissuasion.\n\n\u201cYou are right, my Romola; you are always right, except in thinking too well of me.\u201d\n\nThere was really some genuineness in those last words, and Tito looked very beautiful as he uttered them, with an unusual pallor in his face, and a slight quivering of his lip. Romola, interpreting all things largely, like a mind prepossessed with high beliefs, had a tearful brightness in her eyes as she looked at him, touched with keen joy that he felt so strongly whatever she felt. But without pausing in her walk, she said\u2014\n\n\u201cAnd now, Tito, I wish you to leave me, for the cugina and I shall be less noticed if we enter the piazza alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it were better you should leave us,\u201d said Monna Brigida;\n\n\u201cfor to say the truth, Messer Tito, all eyes follow you, and let Romola muffle herself as she will, every one wants to see what there is under her veil, for she has that way of walking like a procession. Not that I find fault with her for it, only it doesn\u2019t suit my steps. And, indeed, I would rather not have us seen going to San Marco, and that\u2019s why I am dressed as if I were one of the Piagnoni themselves, and as old as Sant\u2019 Anna; for if it had been anybody but poor Dino, who ought to be forgiven if he\u2019s dying, for what\u2019s the use of having a grudge against dead people?\u2014make them feel while they live, say I\u2014\u201d\n\nNo one made a scruple of interrupting Monna Brigida, and Tito, having just raised Romola\u2019s hand to his lips, and said,\n\n\u201cI understand, I obey you,\u201d now turned away,\n\nlifting his cap\u2014a sign of reverence rarely made at that time by native Florentines, and which excited Bernardo del Nero\u2019s contempt for Tito as a fawning Greek, while to Romola, who loved homage, it gave him an exceptional grace.\n\nHe was half glad of the dismissal, half disposed to cling to Romola to the last moment in which she would love him without suspicion. For it seemed to him certain that this brother would before all things want to know, and that Romola would before all things confide to him, what was her father\u2019s position and her own after the years which must have brought so much change. She would tell him that she was soon to be publicly betrothed to a young scholar, who was to fill up the place left vacant long ago by a wandering son. He foresaw the impulse that would prompt Romola to dwell on that prospect, and what would follow on the mention of the future husband\u2019s name. Fra Luca would tell all he knew and conjectured, and Tito saw no possible falsity by which he could now ward off the worst consequences of his former dissimulation. It was all over with his prospects in Florence. There was Messer Bernardo del Nero, who would be delighted at seeing confirmed the wisdom of his advice about deferring the betrothal until Tito\u2019s character and position had been established by a longer residence; and the history of the young Greek professor, whose benefactor was in slavery, would be the talk under every loggia. For the first time in his life he felt too fevered and agitated to trust his power of self-command; he gave up his intended visit to Bardo, and walked up and down under the walls until the yellow light in the west had quite faded, when, without any distinct purpose, he took the first turning, which happened to be the Via San Sebastiano, leading him directly towards the Piazza dell\u2019 Annunziata.\n\nHe was at one of those lawless moments which come to us all if we have no guide but desire, and if the pathway where desire leads us seems suddenly closed; he was ready to follow any beckoning that offered him an immediate purpose.\n\n\u201cBeauteous is life in blossom!\nAnd it fleeteth\u2014fleeteth ever;\nWhoso would be joyful\u2014let him!\nThere\u2019s no surety for the morrow.\u201d\n\nCarnival Song by Lorenzo de\u2019 MediciEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/188878", "artist_names": "Richard F.

But he was given to travelling everywhere and loved to fare over wild and wold, waterless lowland and stony waste, and to journey to the isles of the seas, in quest of dirhams and dinars: wherefore he had in his time encountered dangers and suffered duresse of the way such as would grizzle little children and turn their black hair grey. He was possessed of black slaves and Mamelukes, eunuchs and concubines, and was the wealthiest of the merchants of his time and the goodliest of them in speech, owning horses and mules and Bactrian camels and dromedaries; sacks great and small of size; goods and merchandise and stuffs such as muslins of Hums, silks and brocades of Ba'allak, cotton of Mery, stuffs of India, gauzes of Baghdad, burnouses of Moorland and Turkish white slaves and Abyssinian castratos and Grecian girls and Egyptian boys; and the coverings of his bales were silk with gold purfled fair, for he was wealthy beyond compare. Furthermore he was rare of comeliness, accomplished in goodliness, and gracious in his kindliness, even as one of his describers doth thus express,\n\n\"A merchant I spied whose lovers * Were fighting in furious\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    guise:\nQuoth he, 'Why this turmoil of people?' * Quoth I, 'Trader, for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  those fine eyes!'\"\nAnd saith another in his praise and saith well enough to accomplish the wish of him,\n\"Came a merchant to pay us a visit * Whose glance did my heart\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    surprise:\nQuoth he, 'What surprised thee so?' * Quoth I, 'Trader, 'twas\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    those fine eyes.'\"\n\nNow that merchant had a son called Ali Nur al-Din, as he were the full moon whenas it meeteth the sight on its fourteenth night, a marvel of beauty and loveliness, a model of form and symmetrical grace, who was sitting one day as was his wont, in his father's shop, selling and buying, giving and taking, when the sons of the merchants girt him around and he was amongst them as moon among stars, with brow flower-white and cheeks of rosy light in down the tenderest dight, and body like alabaster-bright even as saith of him the poet,\n\n\"'Describe me!' a fair one said. * Said I, 'Thou art Beauty's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    queen.'\nAnd, speaking briefest speech, * 'All charms in thee are seen.'\"\nAnd as saith of him one of his describers,\n\n\"His mole upon plain of cheek is like * Ambergr\u00eds-crumb on marble\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    plate,\nAnd his glances likest the sword proclaim * To all Love's rebels\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   'The Lord is Great!'\"[FN#378]\n\nThe young merchants invited him saying, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, we wish thee to go this day a-pleasuring with us in such a garden.\" And he answered, \"Wait till I consult my parent, for I cannot go without his consent.\" As they were talking, behold, up came Taj al-Din, and his son looked at him and said, \"O father mine, the sons of the merchants have invited me to wend a-pleasuring with them in such a garden. Dost thou grant me leave to go?\" His father replied, \"Yes, O my son, fare with them;\" and gave him somewhat of money. So the young men mounted their mules and asses and Nur al-Din mounted a she-mule and rode with them to a garden, wherein was all that sould desireth and that eye charmeth. It was high of walls which from broad base were seen to rise; and it had a gateway vault-wise with a portico like a saloon and a door azure as the skies, as it were one of the gates of Paradise: the name of the door-keeper was Rizw\u00e1n,[FN#379] and over the gate were trained an hundred trellises which grapes overran; and these were of various dyes, the red like coralline, the black like the snouts of S\u00fad\u00e1n[FN#380]-men and the white like egg of the pigeon-hen.

After the sitting had lasted an hour or so, up came a slave with a tray on his head, wherein were platters of china and crystal containing viands of all sorts (for one of the youths had so charged his people before coming to the garden); and the meats were of whatever walketh earth or wingeth air or swimmeth waters, such as Kat\u00e1-grouse and fat quails and pigeon-poults and mutton and chickens and the delicatest fish. So, the tray being sat before them, they fell to and ate their fill; and when they had made an end of eating, they rose from meat and washed their hands with pure water and musk-scented soap, and dried them with napery embroidered in silk and bugles; but to Nur al-Din they brought a napkin laced with red gold whereon he wiped his hands. Then coffee[FN#412] was served up and each drank what he would, after which they sat talking, till presently the garden-keeper who was young went away and returning with a basket full of roses, said to them, \"What say ye, O my masters, to flowers?\" Quoth one of them, \"There is no harm in them,[FN#413] especially roses, which are not to be resisted.\" Answered the gardener, \"'Tis well, but it is of our wont not to give roses but in exchange for pleasant converse;

but he said, \"This thing I wot it not nor have I ever drunken thereof, for therein is great offence and the Lord of All-might hath forbidden it in His Book.\" Answered the gardener, \"O my Lord Nur al-Din, an thou forbear to drink only by reason of the sin, verily Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) is bountiful, of sufferance great, forgiving and compassionate and pardoneth the mortalest sins: His mercy embraceth all things, Allah's ruth be upon the poet who saith,\n\n'Be as thou, wilt, for Allah is bountiful * And when thou sinnest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  feel thou naught alarm:\nBut 'ware of twofold sins nor ever dare * To give God partner or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  mankind to harm.'\"\n\nThen quoth one of the sons of the merchants, \"My life on thee, O my lord Nur al-Din, drink of this cup!\" And another conjured him by the oath of divorce and yet another stood up persistently before him, till he was ashamed and taking the cup from the gardener, drank a draught, but spat it out again, crying, \"'Tis bitter.\" Said the young gardener, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, knowest thou not that sweets taken by way of medicine are bitter? Were this not bitter, 'twould lack of the manifold virtues it possesseth; amongst which are that it digesteth food and disperseth cark and care and dispelleth flatulence and clarifieth the blood and cleareth the complexion and quickeneth the body and hearteneth the hen-hearted and fortifieth the sexual power in man; but to name all its virtues would be tedious. Quoth one of the poets,\n\n'We'll drink and Allah pardon sinners all * And cure of ills by\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  sucking cups I'll find:\nNor aught the sin deceives me; yet said He * 'In it there be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 advantage[FN#419] to mankind.'\"\n\nThen he sprang up without stay or delay and opened one of the cupboards in the pavilion and taking out a loaf of refined sugar, broke off a great slice which he put into Nur al-Din's cup, saying, \"O my lord, an thou fear to drink wine, because of its bitterness, drink now, for 'tis sweet.\" So he took the cup and emptied it: whereupon one of his comrades filled him another, saying, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, I am thy slave,\" and another did the like, saying, \"I am one of thy servants,\" and a third said, \"For my sake!\" and a fourth, \"Allah upon thee, O my lord Nur al-Din, heal my heart!\" And so they ceased not plying him with wine, each and every of the ten sons of merchants till they had made him drink a total of ten cups. Now Nur al-Din's body was virgin of wine-bibbing, or never in all his life had he drunken vine-juice till that hour, wherefore its fumes wrought in his brain and drunkenness was stark upon him and he stood up (and indeed his tongue was thick and his speech stammering) and said, \"O company, by Allah, ye are fair and your speech is goodly and your place pleasant; but there needeth hearing of sweet music; for drink without melody lacks the chief of its essentiality, even as saith the poet,\n\n'Pass round the cup to the old and the young man, too, And take\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   the bowl from the hand of the shining moon,[FN#420]\nBut without music, I charge you, forbear to drink; I see even\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 horses drink to a whistled tune.'\"[FN#421]\n\nTherewith up sprang the gardener lad and mounting one of the young men's mules, was absent awhile, after which he returned with a Cairene girl, as she were a sheep's tail, fat and delicate, or an ingot of pure silvern ore or a dinar on a porcelain plate or a gazelle in the wold forlore. She had a face that put to shame the shining sun and eyes Babylonian[FN#422] and brows like bows bended and cheeks rose-painted and teeth pearly-hued and lips sugared and glances languishing and breast ivory white and body slender and slight, full of folds and with dimples dight and hips like pillows stuffed and thighs like columns of Syrian stone, and between them what was something like a sachet of spices in wrapper swathed. Quoth the poet of her in these couplets,\n\n\"Had she shown her shape to idolaters' sight, * They would gaze\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   on her face and their gods detest:\nAnd if in the East to a monk she'd show'd, * He'd quit Eastern\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   posture and bow to West.[FN#423]\nAn she crached in the sea and the briniest sea * Her lips would\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   give it the sweetest zest.\"\nAnd quoth another in these couplets,\n\n\"Brighter than Moon at full with kohl'd eyes she came * Like Doe,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    on chasing whelps of Lioness intent:\nHer night of murky locks lets fall a tent on her * A tent of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    hair[FN#424] that lacks no pegs to hold the tent;\nAnd roses lighting up her roseate cheeks are fed * By hearts and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    livers flowing fire for languishment:\nAn 'spied her all the Age's Fair to her they'd rise *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Humbly,[FN#425] and cry 'The meed belongs to precedent!'\"\nAnd how well saith a third bard,[FN#426]\n\n\"Three things for ever hinder her to visit us, for fear Of the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   intriguing spy and eke the rancorous envier;\nHer forehead's lustre and the sound of all her ornaments And the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  sweet scent her creases hold of ambergris and myrth.\nGrant with the border of her sleeve she hide her brow and doff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Her ornaments, how shall she do her scent away from her?\"\n\nShe was like the moon when at fullest on its fourteenth night, and was clad in a garment of blue, with a veil of green, overbrown flower-white that all wits amazed and those of understanding amated.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying his permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the gardener brought a girl whom we have described, possessed of the utmost beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetrical grace as it were she the poet signified when he said,[FN#427]\n\n\"She came apparelled in a vest of blue,\nThat mocked the skies and shamed their azure hue;\nI thought thus clad she burst upon my sight,\nLike summer moonshine on a wintry night.\"\n\nAnd how goodly is the saying of another and how excellent,\n\n\"She came thick veiled, and cried I, 'O display * That face like\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   full moon bright with pure-white ray.'\nQuoth she, 'I fear disgrace,' quoth I, 'Cut short * This talk, no\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   shift of days thy thoughts affray.'\nWhereat she raised her veil from fairest face * And crystal spray\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   on gems began to stray:\nAnd I forsooth was fain to kiss her cheek, * Lest she complain of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   me on Judgment-Day.\nAnd at such tide before the Lord on High * We first of lovers\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   were redress to pray:\nSo 'Lord, prolong this reckoning and review' * (Prayed I) 'that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    longer I may sight my may.'\"\n\nThen said the young gardener to her, \"Know thou, O lady of the fair, brighter than any constellation which illumineth air we sought, in bringing thee hither naught but that thou shouldst entertain with converse this comely youth, my lord Nur al-Din, for he hath come to this place only this day.\" And the girl replied, \"Would thou hadst told me, that I might have brought what I have with me!\" Rejoined the gardener, \"O my lady, I will go and fetch it to thee.\" \"As thou wilt,\" said she: and he, \"Give me a token.\" So she gave him a kerchief and he fared forth in haste and returned after awhile, bearing a green satin bag with slings of gold. The girl took the bag from him and opening it shook it, whereupon there fell thereout two-and-thirty pieces of wood, which she fitted one into other, male into female and female into male[FN#428] till they became a polished lute of Indian workmanship. Then she uncovered her wrists and laying the lute in her lap, bent over it with the bending of mother over babe, and swept the strings with her finger-tips; whereupon it moaned and resounded and after its olden home yearned; and it remembered the waters that gave it drink and the earth whence it sprang and wherein it grew and it minded the carpenters who made it their merchandise and the ships that shipped it; and it cried and called aloud and moaned and groaned; and it was as if she asked it of all these things and it answered her with the tongue of the case, reciting these couplets,[FN#429]\n\n\"A tree whilere was I the Bulbul's home * To whom for love I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   bowed my grass-green head:\nThey moaned on me, and I their moaning learnt * And in that moan\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   my secret all men read:\nThe woodman fell me falling sans offence, * And slender lute of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  me (as view ye) made:\nBut, when the fingers smite my strings, they tell * How man\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   despite my patience did me dead;\nHence boon-companions when they hear my moan * Distracted wax as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   though by wine misled:\nAnd the Lord softens every heart of me, * And I am hurried to the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   highmost stead:\nAll who in charms excel fain clasp my waist; * Gazelles of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   languid eyne and Houri maid:\nAllah ne'er part fond lover from his joy * Nor live the loved one\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   who unkindly fled.\"\n\nThen the girl was silent awhile, but presently taking the lute in lap, again bent over it, as mother bendeth over child, and preluded in many different modes; then, returning to the first, she sang these couplets,\n\n\"Would they [FN#430] the lover seek without ado, * He to his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   heavy grief had bid adieu:\nWith him had vied the Nightingale[FN#431] on bough * As one far\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   parted from his lover's view:\nRouse thee! awake!

Then he kissed her on the mouth and played with her at kisses, after the manner of the billing of doves; and she met him with like warmth and did with him as she was done by till the others were distracted and rose to their feet; whereupon Nur al-Din was ashamed and held his hand from her.

So she pressed him to her bosom and fell to kissing him like the billing of doves, whilst he returned her caresses with successive kisses; but preeminence appertaineth to precedence.[FN#437] When she had made an end of kissing, she took the lute and recited these couplets,\n\n\"Alas, alack and well-away for blamer's calumny! * Whether or not\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I make my moan or plead or show no plea:\nO spurner of my love I ne'er of thee so hard would deem * That I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    of thee should be despised, of thee my property.\nI wont at lovers' love to rail and for their passion chide, * But\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    now I fain debase myself to all who rail at thee:\nYea, only yesterday I wont all amourists to blame * But now I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    pardon hearts that pine for passion's ecstasy;\nAnd of my stress of parting-stowre on me so heavy weighs * At\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   morning prayer to Him I'll cry, 'In thy name, O Ali!'\"\nAnd also these two couplets,\n\n\"His lovers said, 'Unless he deign to give us all a drink * Of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     wine, of fine old wine his lips deal in their purity;\nWe to the Lord of Threefold Worlds will pray to grant our prayer'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   * And all exclaim with single cry 'In thy name, O Ali!'\"\n\nNur al-Din, hearing these lines and their rhyme, marvelled at the fluency of her tongue and thanked her, praising her grace and passing seductiveness; and the damsel, delighted at his praise, arose without stay or delay and doffing that was upon her of outer dress and trinkets till she was free of all encumbrance sat down on his knees and kissed him between the eyes and on his cheek-mole. Then she gave him all she had put off.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the girl gave to Nur al-Din all she had doffed, saying, \"O beloved of my heart, in very sooth the gift is after the measure of the giver.\" So he accepted this from her and gave it back to her and kissed her on the mouth and cheeks and eyes. When this was ended and done, for naught is durable save the Living, the Eternal, Provider of the peacock and the owl,[FN#438] Nur al-Din rose from the s\u00e9ance and stood upon his feet, because the darkness was now fallen and the stars shone out; whereupon quoth the damsel to him, \"Whither away, O my lord?\"; and quoth he, \"To my father's home.\" Then the sons of the merchants conjured him to night with them, but he refused and mounting his shemule, rode, without stopping, till he reached his parent's house, where his mother met him and said to him, \"O my son, what hath kept thee away till this hour? By Allah, thou hast troubled myself and thy sire by thine absence from us, and our hearts have been occupied with thee.\" Then she came up to him, to kiss him on his mouth, and smelling the fumes of the wine, said, \"O my wine-bibber and a rebel against Him to whom belong creation and commandment?\" But Nur al-Din threw himself down on the bed and lay there. Presently in came his sire and said, \"What aileth Nur al-Din to lie thus?\"; and his mother answered, \"'Twould seem his head acheth for the air of the garden.\" So Taj al-Din went up to his son, to ask him of his ailment, and salute him, and smelt the reek of wine.[FN#439] Now the merchant loved not wine-drinkers; so he said to Nur al-Din, \"Woe to thee, O my son! Is folly come to such a pass with thee, that thou drinkest wine?\" When Nur al-Din heard his sire say this, he raised his hand, being yet in his drunkenness, and dealt him a buffet, when by decree of the Decreer the blow lit on his father's right eye which rolled down on his cheek; whereupon he fell a-swoon and lay therein awhile. They sprinkled rose-water on him till he recovered, when he would have beaten his son; but the mother withheld him, and he swore, by the oath of divorce from his wife that, as soon as morning morrowed, he would assuredly cut off his son's right hand.[FN#440] When she heard her husband's words, her breast was straitened and she feared for he son and ceased not to soothe and appease his sire, till sleep overcame him. Then she waited till moon-rise, when she went in to her son, whose drunkenness had now departed from him, and said to him, \"O Nur al-Din, what is this foul deed thou diddest with thy sire?\" He asked, \"And what did I with him?\"; and answered she, \"Thou dealtest him a buffet on the right eye and struckest it out so that it rolled down his cheek; and he hath sworn by the divorce-oath that, as soon as morning shall morrow he will without fail cut off thy right hand.\" Nur al-Din repented him of that he had done, whenas repentance profited him naught, and his mother sait to him, \"O my son, this penitence will not profit thee; nor will aught avail thee but that thou arise forthwith and seek safety in flight: go forth the house privily and take refuge with one of thy friends and there what Allah shall do await, for he changeth case after case and state upon state.\" Then she opened a chest and taking out a purse of an hundred dinars said, \"O my son, take these dinars and provide thy wants therewith, and when they are at an end, O my son, send and let me know thereof, that I may send thee other than these, and at the same time covey to me news of thyself privily: haply Allah will decree thee relief and thou shalt return to thy home. And she farewelled him and wept passing sore, nought could be more. Thereupon Nur al-Din took the purse of gold and was about to go forth, when he espied a great purse containing a thousand dinars, which his mother had forgotten by the side of the chest. So he took this also and binding the two purses about his middle,[FN#441] set out before dawn threading the streets in the direction of B\u00fal\u00e1k, where he arrived when day broke and all creatures arose, attesting the unity of Allah the Opener and went forth each of them upon his several business, to win that which Allah had unto him allotted. Reaching Bulak he walked on along the riverbank till he sighted a ship with her gangway out and her four anchors made fast to the land. The folk were going up into her and coming down from her, and Nur al-Din, seeing some sailors there standing, asked them whither they were bound, and they answered, \"To Rosetta-city.\" Quoth he, \"Take me with you;\" and quoth they, \"Well come, and welcome to thee, to thee, O goodly one!\" So he betook himself forthright to the market and buying what he needed of vivers and bedding and covering, returned to the port and went on board the ship, which was ready to sail and tarried with him but a little while before she weighed anchor and fared on, without stopping, till she reached Rosetta,[FN#442] where Nur al-Din saw a small boat going to Alexandria. So he embarked in it and traversing the sea-arm of Rosetta fared on till he came to a bridge called Al-J\u00e1m\u00ed, where he landed and entered Alexandria by the gate called the Gate of the Lote-tree. Allah protected him, so that none of those who stood on guard at the gate saw him, and he walked on till he entered the city.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventieth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nur al-Din entered Alexandria he found it a city goodly of pleasaunces, delightful to its inhabitants and inviting to inhabit therein. Winter had fared from it with his cold and Prime was come to it with his roses: its flowers were kindly ripe and welled forth its rills. Indeed, it was a city goodly of ordinance and disposition; its folk were of the best of men, and when the gates thereof were shut, its folk were safe.[FN#443] And it was even as is said of it in these couplets,\n\n\"Quoth I to a comrade one day, * A man of good speech and rare,\n'Describe Alexandria.' * Quoth he, 'Tis a march-town fair.'\nQuoth I, 'Is there living therein?' * And he, 'An the wind blow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  there.'\"\nOr as saith one of the poets,\n\n\"Alexandria's a frontier;[FN#444] Whose dews of lips are sweet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and clear;\nHow fair the coming to it is, * So one therein no raven speer!\"\n\nNur al-Din walked about the city and ceased not walking till her came to the merchants' bazar, whence he passed on to the mart of the money-changers and so on in turn to the markets of the confectioners and fruiterers and druggists, marvelling, as he went, at the city, for that the nature of its qualities accorded with its name.[FN#445] As he walked in the druggists' bazar, behold, an old man came down from his shop and saluting him, took him by the hand and carried him to his home. And Nur al-Din saw a fair bystreet, swept and sprinkled, whereon the zephyr blew and made pleasantness pervade it and the leaves of the trees overshaded it. Therein stood three houses and at the upper end a mansion, whose foundations were firm sunk in the water and its walls towered to the confines of the sky. They had swept the space before it and they had sprinkled it freshly; so it exhaled the fragrance of flowers, borne on the zephyr which breathed upon the place; and the scent met there who approached it on such wise as it were one of the gardens of Paradise. And, as they had cleaned and cooed the by-street's head, so was the end of it with marble spread. The Shaykh carried Nur al-Din into the house and setting somewhat of food before him ate with his guest. When they had made an end of eating, the druggist said to him, \"When camest thou hither from Cairo?\"; and Nur al-Din replied, \"This very night, O my father.\" Quoth the old man, \"What is thy name?\"; and quoth he, \"Ali Nur al-Din.\" Said the druggist, \"O my son, O Nur al-Din, be the triple divorce incumbent on me, an thou leave me so long as thou abidest in this city; and I will set thee apart a place wherein thou mayst dwell.\" Nur al-Din asked, \"O my lord the Shaykh, let me know more of thee\"; and the other answered, \"Know, O my son, that some years ago I went to Cairo with merchandise, which I sold there and bought other, and I had occasion for a thousand dinars. So thy sire Taj al-Din weighed them out[FN#446] for me, all unknowing me, and would take no written word of me, but had patience with me till I returned hither and sent him the amount by one of my servants, together with a gift. I saw thee, whilst thou wast little; and, if it please Allah the Most High, I will repay thee somewhat of the kindness thy father did me.\" When Nur al-Din heard the old man's story, he showed joy and pulling out with a smile the purse of a thousand dinars, gave it to his host the Shaykh and said to him, \"Take charge of this deposit for me, against I buy me somewhat of merchandise whereon to trade.\" Then he abode some time in Alexandria city taking his pleasure every day in its thoroughfares, eating and drinking ad indulging himself with mirth and merriment till he had made an end of the hundred dinars he had kept by way of spending-money; whereupon he repaired to the old druggist, to take of him somewhat of the thousand dinars to spend, but found him not in his shop and took a seat therein to await his return. He sat there gazing right and left and amusing himself with watching the merchants and passers-by, and as he was thus engaged behold, there came into the bazar a Persian riding on a she-mule and carrying behind him a damsel; as she were argent of alloy free or a fish Balti[FN#447] in mimic sea or a doe-gazelle on desert lea. Her face outshone the sun in shine and she had witching eyne and breasts of ivory white, teeth of marguerite, slender waist and sides dimpled deep and calves like tails of fat sheep;[FN#448] and indeed she was perfect in beauty and loveliness, elegant stature and symmetrical grace, even as saith one, describing her,[FN#449]\n\n\"'Twas as by will of her she was create * Nor short nor long, but\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Beauty's mould and mate:\nRose blushes reddest when she sees those cheeks * And fruits the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   bough those marvel charms amate:\nMoon is her favour, Musk the scent of her * Branch is her shape:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  she passeth man's estate:\n'Tis e'en as were she cast in freshest pearl * And every limblet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 shows a moon innate.\"\n\nPresently the Persian lighted down from his she-mule and, making the damsel also dismount, loudly summoned the broker and said to him as soon as he came, \"Take this damsel and cry her for sale in the market.\" So he took her and leading her to the middlemost of the bazar disappeared for a while and presently he returned with a stool of ebony, inlaid with ivory, and setting it upon the ground, seated her thereon. Then he raised her veil and discovered a face as it were a Median targe[FN#450] or a cluster of pearls:[FN#451] and indeed she was like the full moon, when it filleth on its fourteenth night, accomplished in brilliant beauty. As saith the poet,\n\n\"Vied the full moon for folly with her face, * But was\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   eclipsed[FN#452] and split for rage full sore;\nAnd if the spiring B\u00e1n with her contend * Perish her hands who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  load of fuel bore!\"[FN#453]\nAnd how well saith another,\n\n\"Say to the fair in the wroughten veil * How hast made that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   monk-like worshipper ail?\nLight of veil and light of face under it * Made the hosts of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  darkness to fly from bale;\nAnd, when came my glance to steal look at cheek. * With a\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  meteor-shaft the Guard made me quail.\"[FN#454]\n\nThen said the broker to the merchants,[FN#455] \"How much do ye bid for the union-pearl of the diver and prize-quarry of the fowler?\" Quoth one, \"She is mine for an hundred dinars.\" And another said, \"Two hundred,\" and a third, \"Three hundred\"; and they ceased not to bid, one against other, till they made her price nine hundred and fifty dinars, and there the biddings stopped awaiting acceptance and consent.[FN#456]\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchants bid one against other till they made the price of the girl nine hundred and fifty dinars. Then the broker went up to her Persian master and said to him, \"The biddings for this thy slavegirl have reached nine hundred and fifty dinars: so say me, wilt thou sell her at that price and take the money?\" Asked the Persian, \"Doth she consent to this? I desire to fall in with her wishes, for I sickened on my journey hither and this handmaid tended me with all possible tenderness, wherefore I sware not to sell her but to him whom she should like and approve, and I have put her sale in her own hand. So do thou consult her and if she say, 'I consent,' sell her to whom thou wilt: but an she say, 'No,' sell her not.\" So the broker went up to her and asked her, \"O Princess of fair ones, know that thy master putteth thy sale in thine own hands, and thy price hath reached nine hundred and fifty dinars; dost thou give me leave to sell thee?\" She answered, \"Show me him who is minded to buy me before clinching the bargain.\" So he brought her up to one of the merchants a man stricken with years and decrepit; and she looked at him a long while, then turned to the broker and said to him, \"O broker, art thou Jinn-mad or afflicted in thy wit?\" Replied he, \"Why dost thou ask me this, O Princess of fair ones?\"; and said she, \"Is it permitted thee of Allah to sell the like of me to yonder decrepit old man, who saith of his wife's case these couplets,\n\n'Quoth she to me,\u2014and sore enraged for wounded pride was she, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  For she in sooth had bidden me to that which might not be,\u2014\n'An if thou swive me not forthright, as one should swive his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wife, * Thou be made a cuckold straight, reproach it not to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   me.\nMeseems thy yard is made of wax, for very flaccidness; * For when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I rub it with my hand, it softens instantly.'[FN#457]\nAnd said he likewise of his yard,\n\n'I have a yard that sleeps in base and shameful way * When grants\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   my lover boon for which I sue and pray:\nBut when I wake o' mornings[FN#458] all alone in bed, * 'Tis fain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  o' foin and fence and fierce for futter-play.'\nAnd again quoth he thereof of his yard,\n\n'I have a froward yard of temper ill * Dishonoring him who shows\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  it most regard:\nIt stands when sleep I, when I stand it sleeps * Heaven pity not\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   who pitieth that yard!'\"\n\nWhen the old merchant heard this ill flouting from the damsel, he was wroth with wrath exceeding beyond which was no proceeding and said to the broker, \"O most ill-omened of brokers, thou hast not brought into the market this ill-conditioned wench but to gibe me and make mock of me before the merchants.\" Then the broker took her aside and said to her, \"O my lady, be not wanting in self-respect. The Shaykh at whom thou didst mock is the Syndic of the bazar and Inspector[FN#459] thereof and a committee-man of the council of the merchants.\" But she laughed and improvised these two couplets,\n\n\"It behoveth folk who rule in our time, * And 'tis one of the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  duties of magistrateship,\nTo hand up the Wali above his door * And beat with a whip the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Mohtasib!\"\n\nAdding, \"By Allah, O my lord, I will not be sold to yonder old man; so sell me to other than him, for haply he will be abashed at me and vend me again and I shall become a mere servant[FN#460] and it beseemeth not that I sully myself with menial service; and indeed thou knowest that the matter of my sale is committed to myself.\" He replied, \"I hear and I obey,\" and carried her to a man which was one of the chief merchants. And when standing hard by him the broker asked, \"How sayst thou, O my lady? Shall I sell thee to my lord Shar\u00edf al-D\u00edn here for nine hundred and fifty gold pieces?\" She looked at him and, seeing him to be an old man with a dyed beard, said to the broker, \"Art thou silly, that thou wouldst sell me to this worn out Father Antic? Am I cotton refuse or threadbare rags that thou marchest me about from greybeard to greybeard, each like a wall ready to fall or an Ifrit smitten down of a fire-ball? As for the first, the poet had him in mind when he said,[FN#461]\n\n'I sought of a fair maid to kiss her lips of coral red, But, 'No,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   by Him who fashioned things from nothingness!' she said.\nUnto the white of hoary hairs I never had a mind, And shall my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mouth be stuffed, forsooth, with cotton, ere I'm dead?'\nAnd how goodly is the saying of the poet,\n\n'The wise have said that white of hair is light that shines and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    robes * The face of man with majesty and light that awes the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sight;\nYet until hoary seal shall stamp my parting-place of hair * I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    hope and pray that same may be black as the blackest night.\nAlbe Time-whitened beard of man be like the book he bears[FN#462]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    * When to his Lord he must return, I'd rather 'twere not\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    white,'\nAnd yet goodlier is the saying of another,\n\n'A guest hath stolen on my head and honour may he lack! * The\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     sword a milder deed hath done that dared these locks to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    hack.\nAvaunt, O Whiteness,[FN#463] wherein naught of brightness\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  gladdens sight * Thou 'rt blacker in the eyes of me than\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  very blackest black!'\n\nAs for the other, he is a model of wantonness and scurrilousness and a blackener of the face of hoariness; his dye acteth the foulest of lies: and the tongue of his case reciteth these lines,[FN#464]\n\n'Quoth she to me, 'I see thou dy'st thy hoariness;' and I, 'I do\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    but hide it from thy sight, O thou mine ear and eye!'\nShe laughed out mockingly and said, 'A wonder 'tis indeed!

Quoth she, \"Trot him out that I may see him and question him of a certain thing, which if he have in his house, I will be sold to him; and if not, then not.\" So the broker left her standing there and going up to Shihab al-Din, said to him, \"O my lord, know that yonder damsel tells me she hath a mind to ask thee somewhat, which an thou have, she will be sold to thee. Now thou hast heard what she said to thy fellows, the merchants,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-second Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the broker said to the merchant, \"Thou hast heard what this handmaid said to thy fellows, the traders, and by Allah, I fear to bring her to thee, lest she do with thee like as she did with thy neighbours and so I fall into disgrace with thee: but, an thou bid me bring her to thee, I will bring her.\" Quoth the merchant, \"Hither with her to me.\" \"Hearing and obeying,\" answered the broker and fetched for the purchaser the damsel, who looked at him and said, \"O my lord, Shihab al-Din, hast thou in thy house round cushions stuffed with ermine strips?\" Replied Shihab al-Din, \"Yes, O Princess of fair ones, I have at home half a score such cushions; but I conjure thee by Allah, tell me, what will thou do with them?\" Quoth she, \"I will bear with thee till thou be asleep, when I will lay them on thy mouth and nose and press them down till thou die.\" Then she turned to the broker and said to him, \"O thou refuse of brokers, meseemeth thou art mad, in that thou showest me this hour past, first to a pair of greybeards, in each of whom are two faults, and then thou proferrest me to my lord Shihab al-Din wherein be three defects; and thirdly, he is dwarfish, secondly, he hath a nose which is big, and thirdly, he hath a beard which is long. Of him quoth one of the poets,\n\n'We never heard of wight nor yet espied * Who amid men three\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    gifts hath unified:\nTo wit, a beard one cubit long, a snout * Span-long and figure\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    tall a finger wide:'\nAnd quoth another poet,\n\n'From the plain of his face springs a minaret * Like a bezel of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ring on his finger set:\nDid creation enter that vasty nose * No created thing would\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    elsewhere be met.'\"\n\nWhen Shihab al-Din heard this, he came down from his shop and seized the broker by the collar, saying, \"O scurviest of brokers, what aileth thee to bring us a damsel to flout and make mock of us, one after other, with her verses and talk that a curse is?\" So the broker took her and carried her away from before him and fared, saying, \"By Allah, all my life long, since I have plied this profession never set I eyes on the like of thee for unmannerliness nor aught more curst to me than thy star, for thou hast cut off my livelihood this day and I have gained no profit by thee save cuffs on the neck-nape and catching by the collar!\" Then he brought her to the shop of another merchant, owner of negro slaves and white servants, and stationing her before him, said to her, \"Wilt thou be sold to this my lord 'Al\u00e1 al-D\u00edn?\" She looked at him and seeing him hump-backed, said, \"This is a Gobbo, and quoth the poet of him,\n\n'Drawn in thy shoulders are and spine thrust out, * As seeking\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  star which Satan gave the lout;[FN#466]\nOr as he tasted had first smack of scourge * And looked in marvel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  for a second bout.'\n\nAnd saith another on the same theme,\n\n'As one of you who mounted mule, * A sight for me to ridicule: Is 't not a farce?

This is a ram, whose tail hath sprouted from his gullet. Wilt thou sell me to him, O unluckiest of brokers? Hast thou not heard say: 'All long of beard are little of wits? Indeed, after the measure of the length of the beard is the lack of sense; and this is a well-known thing among men of understanding.' As saith one of the poets,\n\n'Ne'er was a man with beard grown overlong, * Tho' be he therefor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  reverenced and fear'd,\nBut who the shortness noted in his wits * Added to longness noted\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  in his beard.'\nAnd quoth another,[FN#468]\n\n'I have a friend with a beard which God hath made to grow to a\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  useless length,\nIt is like unto one of the nights of winter long and dark and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cold.'\"\n\nWith this the broker took her and turned away with her, and she asked, \"Whither goest thou with me?\" He answered, \"Back to thy master the Persian; it sufficeth me what hath befallen me because of thee this day; for thou hast been the means of spoiling both my trade and his by thine ill manners.\" Then she looked about the market right and left, front and rear till, by the decree of the Decreer her eyes fell on Ali Nur al-Din the Cairene. So she gazed at him and saw him[FN#469] to be a comely youth of straight slim form and smooth of face, fourteen years old, rare in beauty and loveliness and elegance and amorous grace like the full moon on the fourteenth night with forehead flower-white, and cheeks rosy red, neck like alabaster and teeth than jewels and dews of lips sweeter than sugar, even as saith of him one of his describers,\n\n\"Came to match him in beauty and loveliness rare * Full moons and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   gazelles but quoth I, 'Soft fare!\nFare softly, gazelles, nor yourselves compare * With him and, O\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Moons, all your pains forbear!'\"\nAnd how well saith another bard,\n\n\"Slim-waisted loveling, from his hair and brow * Men wake a-morn\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   in night and light renewed.\nBlame not the mole that dwelleth on his cheek * For Nu'uman's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  bloom aye shows spot negro-hued.\"\n\nWhen the slave-girl beheld Nur al-Din he interposed between her and her wits; she fell in love to him with a great and sudden fall and her heart was taken with affection for him;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-third Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the slave-girl beheld Nur al-Din, her heart was taken with affection for him; so she turned to the broker and said to him, \"Will not yonder young merchant, who is sitting among the traders in the gown of striped broadcloth, bid somewhat more for me?\" The broker replied, \"O lady of fair ones, yonder young man is a stranger from Cairo, where his father is chief of the trader-guild and surpasseth all the merchants and notables of the place. He is but lately come to this our city and lodgeth with one of his father's friends; but he hath made no bid for thee nor more nor less.\" When the girl heard the broker's words, she drew from her finger a costly signet-ring of ruby and said to the man, \"Carry me to yonder youth, and if he buy me, this ring shall be thine, in requital of thy travail with me this day.\" The broker rejoiced at this and brought her up to Nur al-Din, and she considered him straitly and found him like the full moon, perfect in loveliness and a model of fine stature and symmetric grace, even as saith of him one of his describers.\n\n\"Waters of beauty o'er his cheeks flow bright, * And rain his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    glances shafts that sorely smite:\nChoked are his lovers an he deal disdain's * Bitterest draught\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    denaying love-delight.\nHis forehead and his stature and my love * Are perfect perfected\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    perfection-dight;\nHis raiment folds enfold a lovely neck * As crescent moon in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    collar buttoned tight:\nHis eyne and twinn\u00e8d moles and tears of me * Are night that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    nighteth to the nightliest night.\nHis eyebrows and his features and my frame[FN#470] * Crescents on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     crescents are as crescents slight:\nHis pupils pass the wine-cup to his friends * Which, albe sweet,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     tastes bitter to my sprite;\nAnd to my thirsty throat pure drink he dealt * From smiling lips\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    what day we were unite:\nThen is my blood to him, my death to him * His right and rightful\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    and most righteous right.\"\n\nThe girl gazed at Nur al-Din and said, \"O my lord, Allah upon thee, am I not beautiful?\"; and he replied, \"O Princess of fair ones, is there in the world a comelier than thou?\" She rejoined, \"Then why seest thou all the other merchants bid high for me and art silent nor sayest a word neither addest one dinar to my price? 'Twould seem I please thee not, O my lord!\" Quoth he, \"O my lady, were I in my own land, I had bought thee with all that my hand possesseth of monies;\" and quoth she, \"O my lord, I said not, 'Buy me against thy will,' yet, didst thou but add somewhat to my price, it would hearten my heart, though thou buy me not, so the merchants may say, 'Were not this girl handsome, yonder merchant of Cairo had not bidden for her, for the Cairenes are connoisseurs in slave-girls.'\" These words abashed Nur al-Din and he blushed and said to the broker, \"How high are the biddings for her?\" He replied, \"Her price hath reached nine hundred and sixty dinars,[FN#471] besides brokerage, as for the Sultan's dues, they fall on the seller.\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"Let me have her for a thousand dinars, brokerage and price.\" And the damsel hastening to the fore and leaving the broker, said \"I sell myself to this handsome young man for a thousand dinars.\" But Nur al-Din held his peace. Quoth one, \"We sell to him;\" and another, \"He deserveth her;\" and a third, \"Accursed, son of accursed, is he who biddeth and doth not buy!\"; and a fourth, \"By Allah, they befit each other!\" Then, before Nur al-Din could think, the broker fetched Kazis and witnesses, who wrote out a contract of sale and purchase; and the broker handed the paper to Nur al-Din, saying, \"Take thy slave-girl and Allah bless thee in her for she beseemeth none but thee and none but thou beseemeth her.\" And he recited these two couplets,\n\n\"Boom Fortune sought him in humblest way[FN#472] * And came to\nhim draggle-tailed, all a-stir:\nAnd none is fittest for him but she * And none is fittest but he\nfor her.\"\n\nHereat Nur al-Din was abashed before the merchants; so he arose without stay or delay and weighed out the thousand dinars which he had left as a deposit with his father's friend the druggist, and taking the girl, carried her to the house wherein the Shaykh had lodged him. When she entered and saw nothing but ragged patched carpets and worn out rugs, she said to him, \"O my lord, have I no value to thee and am I not worthy that thou shouldst bear me to thine own house and home wherein are thy goods, that thou bringest me into thy servant's lodging? Why dost thou not carry me to thy father's dwelling?\" He replied, \"By Allah, O Princess of fair ones, this is my house wherein I dwell; but it belongeth to an old man, a druggist of this city, who hath set it apart for me and lodged me therein. I told thee that I was a stranger and that I am of the sons of Cairo city.\" She rejoined, \"O my lord, the least of houses sufficeth till thy return to thy native place; but, Allah upon thee, O my lord, go now and fetch us somewhat of roast meat and wine and dried fruit and dessert.\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"By Allah, O Princess of fair ones, I had no money with me but the thousand dinars I paid down to thy price nor possess I any other good. The few dirhams I owned were spent by me yesterday.\" Quoth she, \"Hast thou no friend in the town, of whom thou mayst borrow fifty dirhams and bring them to me, that I may tell thee what thou shalt do therewith?\" And he said, \"I have no intimate but the druggist.\" Then he betook himself forthright to the druggist and said to him, \"Peace be with thee, O uncle!\" He returned his salam and said to him, \"O my son, what hast thou bought for a thousand dinars this day?\" Nur al-Din replied, \"I have bought a slave-girl;\" and the oldster rejoined, \"O my son, art thou mad that thou givest a thousand dinars for one slave-girl? Would I knew what kind of slave-girl she is?\" Said Nur al-Din, \"She is a damsel of the children of the Franks;\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nur al-Din said to the ancient druggist, \"The damsel is of the children of the Franks;\" and the Shaykh said, \"O my son, the best of the girls of the Franks are to be had in this our town for an hundred dinars, and by Allah, O my son, they have cheated thee in the matter of this damsel! However, an thou have taken a fancy to her, lie with her this night and do thy will of her and to-morrow morning go down with her to the market and sell her, though thou lose by her two hundred dinars, and reckon that thou hast lost them by shipwreck or hast been robbed of them on the road.\" Nur al-Din replied, \"Right is thy rede, O uncle, but thou knowest that I had but the thousand dinars wherewith I purchased the damsel, and now I have not a single dirham left to spend; so I desire of thy favour and bounty that thou lend me fifty dirhams, to provide me withal, till to-morrow, when I will sell her and repay thee out of her price.\" Said the old man, \"Willingly, O my son,\" and counted out to him the fifty dirhams. Then he said to him, \"O my son, thou art but young in years and the damsel is fair, so belike thy heart will be taken with her and it will be grievous to thee to vend her. Now thou hast nothing to live on and these fifty dirhams will readily be spent and thou wilt come to me and I shall lend thee once and twice and thrice, and so on up to ten times; but, an thou come to me after this, I will not return thy salam[FN#473] and our friendship with thy father will end ill.\" Nur al-Din took the fifty dirhams and returned with them to the damsel, who said to him, \"O my lord, wend thee at once to the market and fetch me twenty dirhams' worth of stained silk of five colours and with the other thirty buy meat and bread and fruit and wine and flowers.\" So he went to the market and purchasing for her all she sought, brought it to her, whereupon she rose and tucking up her sleeves, cooked food after the most skilful fashion, and set it before him. He ate and she ate with him, till they had enough, after which she set on the wine, and she drank and he drank, and she ceased not to ply him with drink and entertain him with discourse, till he became drunken and fell asleep. Thereupon she arose without stay or delay and taking out of her bundle a budget of T\u00e1if\u00ed leather,[FN#474] opened it and drew forth a pair of knitting needles, wherewith she fell to work and stinted not till she had made a beautiful zone, which she folded up in a wrapper after cleaning it and ironing it, and laid it under her pillow. Then she doffed her dress till she was mother-naked and lying down beside Nur al-Din shampoo'd him till he awoke from his heavy sleep. He found by his side a maiden like virgin silver, softer than silk and delicater than a tail of fatted sheep, than standard more conspicuous and goodlier than the red camel,[FN#475] in height five feet tall with breasts firm and full, brows like bended bows, eyes like gazelles' eyes and cheeks like blood-red anemones, a slender waist with dimples laced and a navel holding an ounce of the unguent benzoin, thighs like bolsters stuffed with ostrich-down, and between them what the tongue fails to set forth and at mention whereof the tears jet forth. Brief it was as it were she to whom the poet alluded in these two couplets,\n\n\"From her hair is Night, from her forehead Noon * From her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  side-face Rose; from her lip wine boon:\nFrom her Union Heaven, her Severance Hell: * Pearls from her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  teeth; from her front full Moon.\"\nAnd how excellent is the saying of another bard,[FN#476]\n\n\"A Moon she rises, Willow-wand she waves * Breathes ambergris and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  gazeth a gazelle.\nMeseems that sorrow wooes my heart and wins * And when she wends\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   makes haste therein to dwell.\nHer face is fairer than the Stars of Wealth[FN#477] * And sheeny\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   brows the crescent Moon excel.\"\nAnd quoth a third also,\n\n\"They shine fullest Moons, unveil Crescent-bright; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Sway tenderest Branches and turn wild kine;\n'Mid which is a Dark-eyed for love of whose charms *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The Sailors[FN#478] would joy to be ground low-li'en.\"\n\nSo Nur al-Din turned to her at once and clasping her to his bosom, sucked first her upper lip and then her under lip and slid his tongue between the twain into her mouth. Then he rose to her and found her a pearl unthridden and a filly none but he had ridden. So he abated her maidenhead and had of her amorous delight and there was knitted between them a love-bond which might never know breach nor severance.[FN#479] He rained upon her cheeks kisses like the falling of pebbles into water, and struck with stroke upon stroke, like the thrusting of spears in battle brunt; for that Nur al-Din still yearned after clipping of necks and sucking of lips and letting down of tress and pressing of waist and biting of cheek and cavalcading on breast with Cairene buckings and Yamani wrigglings and Abyssinian sobbings and Hind\u00ed pamoisons and Nubian lasciviousness and R\u00edf\u00ed leg-liftings[FN#480] and Damiettan moanings and Sa'\u00edd\u00ed[FN#481] hotness and Alexandrian languishment[FN#482] and this damsel united in herself all these virtues, together with excess of beauty and loveliness, and indeed she was even as saith of her the poet,\n\n\"This is she I will never forget till I die * Nor draw near but\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   to those who to her draw nigh.\nA being for semblance like Moon at full * Praise her Maker, her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Modeller glorify!\nTho' be sore my sin seeking love-liesse * On esperance-day ne'er\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   repent can I;\nA couplet reciting which none can know * Save the youth who in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   couplets and rhymes shall cry,\n'None weeteth love but who bears its load * Nor passion, save\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  pleasures and pains he aby.'\"\n\nSo Nur al-Din lay with the damsel through the night in solace and delight,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nur al-Din lay with that damsel through the night in solace and delight, the twain garbed in the closely buttoned garments of embrace, safe and secure against the misways of nights and days, and they passed the dark hours after the goodliest fashion, fearing naught, in their joys love-fraught, from excess of talk and prate. As saith of them the right excellent poet,[FN#483]\n\n\"Go, visit her thou lovest, and regard not\nThe words detractors utter; envious churls\nCan never favour love. Oh! sure the merciful\nNe'er make a thing more fair to look upon,\nThan two fond lovers in each other's arms,\nSpeaking their passion in a mute embrace.\nWhen heart has turned to heart, the fools would part them\nStrike idly on cold steel. So when thou'st found\nOne purely, wholly thine, accept her true heart,\nAnd live for her alone. Oh! thou that blamest\nThe love-struck for their love, give o'er thy talk\nHow canst thou minister to a mind diseased?\"\n\nWhen the morning morrowed in sheen and shone, Nur al-Din awoke from deep sleep and found that she had brought water:[FN#484] so they made the Ghusl-ablution, he and she, and he performed that which behoved him of prayer to his Lord, after which she set before him meat and drink, and he ate and drank. Then the damsel put her hand under her pillow and pulling out the girdle which she had knitted during the night, gave it to Nur al-Din, who asked, \"Whence cometh this girdle?\"[FN#485] Answered she, \"O my lord, 'tis the silk thou boughtest yesterday for twenty dirhams. Rise now and go to the Persian bazar and give it to the broker, to cry for sale, and sell it not for less than twenty gold pieces in ready money.\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"O Princess of fair ones how can a thing, that cost twenty dirhams and will sell for as many dinars, be made in a single night?\"; and quoth she, \"O my lord, thou knowest not the value of this thing; but go to the market therewith and give it to the broker, and when he shall cry it, its worth will be made manifest to thee.\" Herewith he carried the zone to the market and gave it to the broker, bidding him cry it, whilst he himself sat down on a masonry bench before a shop. The broker fared forth and returning after a while said to him, \"O my lord, rise take the price of thy zone, for it hath fetched twenty dinars money down.\" When Nur al-Din heard this, he marvelled with exceeding marvel and shook with delight. Then he rose, between belief and misbelief, to take the money and when he had received it, he went forthright and spent it all on silk of various colours and returning home, gave his purchase to the damsel, saying, \"Make this all into girdles and teach me likewise how to make them, that I may work with thee; for never in the length of my life saw I a fairer craft than this craft nor a more abounding in gain and profit. By Allah, 'tis better than the trade of a merchant a thousand times!\" She laughed at his language and said, \"O my lord, go to thy friend the druggist and borrow other thirty dirhams of him, and to-morrow repay him from the price of the girdle the thirty together with the fifty already loaned to thee.\" So he rose and repaired to the druggist and said to him, \"O Uncle, lend me other thirty dirhams, and to-morrow, Almighty Allah willing, I will repay thee the whole fourscore.\" The old man weighed him out thirty dirhams, wherewith he went to the market and buying meat and bread, dried fruits, and flowers as before, carried them home to the damsel whose name was Miriam,[FN#486] the Girdle-girl. She rose forthright and making ready rich meats, set them before her lord Nur al-Din; after which she brought the wine-service and they drank and plied each other with drink. When the wine began to play with their wits, his pleasant address and inner grace pleased her, and she recited these two couplets,\n\n\"Said I to Slim-waist who the wine engraced * Brought in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  musk-scented bowl and a superfine,\n'Was it prest from thy cheek?' He replied 'Nay, nay! * When did\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  man from Roses e'er press the Wine?'\"\n\nAnd the damsel ceased not to carouse with her lord and ply him with cup and bowl and require him to fill for her and give her to drink of that which sweeteneth the spirits, and whenever he put forth hand to her, she drew back from him, out of coquetry. The wine added to her beauty and loveliness, and Nur al-Din recited these two couplets,\n\n\"Slim-waist craved wine from her companeer; * Cried (in meeting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  of friends when he feared for his fere,)\n'An thou pass not the wine thou shalt pass the night, * A-banisht\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  my bed!' And he felt sore fear.\"\n\nThey ceased not drinking till drunkenness overpowered Nur al-Din and he slept; whereupon she rose forthright and fell to work upon a zone, as was her wont. When she had wrought it to end, she wrapped it in paper and doffing her clothes, lay down by his side and enjoyed dalliance and delight till morn appeared.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Miriam the Girdle-girl, having finished her zone and wrapped it in paper doffed her dress and lay down by the side of her lord; and then happened to them what happened of dalliance and delight; and he did his devoir like a man. On the morrow, she gave him the girdle and said to him, \"Carry this to the market and sell it for twenty dinars, even as thou soldest its fellow yesterday.\" So he went to the bazar and sold the girdle for twenty dinars, after which he repaired to the druggist and paid him back the eighty dirhams, thanking him for the bounties and calling down blessings upon him. He asked, \"O my son, hast thou sold the damsel?\"; and Nur al-Din answered, \"Wouldst thou have me sell the soul out of my body?\" and he told him all that had passed, from commencement to conclusion, whereat the druggist joyed with joy galore, than which could be no more and said to him, \"By Allah, O my son, thou gladdenest me! Inshallah, mayst thou ever be in prosperity! Indeed I wish thee well by reason of my affection for thy ather and the continuance of my friendship with him.\" Then Nur al-Din left the Shaykh and straightway going to the market, bought meat and fruit and wine and all that he needed according to his custom and returned therewith to Miriam. They abode thus a whole year in eating and drinking and mirth and merriment and love and good comradeship, and every night she made a zone and he sold it on the morrow for twenty dinars, wherewith he bought their needs and gave the rest to her, to keep against a time of necessity. After the twelvemonth she said to him one day, \"O my lord, whenas thou sellest the girdle to-morrow, buy for me with its price silk of six colours, because I am minded to make thee a kerchief to wear on thy shoulders, such as never son of merchant, no, nor King's son, ever rejoiced in its like.\" So next day he fared forth to the bazar and after selling the zone brought her the dyed silks she sought and Miriam the Girdle-girl wrought at the kerchief a whole week, for, every night, when she had made an end of the zone, she would work awhile at the kerchief till it was finished. Then she gave it to Nur al-Din, who put it on his shoulders and went out to walk in the market-place, whilst all the merchants and folk and notables of the town crowded about him, to gaze on his beauty and that of the kerchief which was of the most beautiful. Now it chanced that one night, after this, he awoke from sleep and found Miriam weeping passing sore and reciting these couplets,\n\n\"Nears my parting fro' my love, nigher draws the Severance-day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Ah well-away for parting! and again ah well-away!\nAnd in tway is torn my heart and O pine I'm doomed to bear * For\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    the nights that erst witnessed our pleasurable play!\nNo help for it but Envier the twain of us espy * With evil eye\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    and win to us his lamentable way.\nFor naught to us is sorer than the jealousy of men * And the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   backbiter's eyne that with calumny affray.\"\n\nHe said, \"O my lady Miriam,[FN#487] what aileth thee to weep?\"; and she replied, \"I weep for the anguish of parting for my heart presageth me thereof.\" Quoth he, \"O lady of fair ones, and who shall interpose between us, seeing that I love thee above all creatures and tender thee the most?\"; and quoth she, \"And I love thee twice as well as thou me; but fair opinion of fortune still garreth folk fall into affliction, and right well saith the poet,[FN#488]\n\n'Think'st thou thyself all prosperous, in days which prosp'rous\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  be,\nNor fearest thou impending ill, which comes by Heaven's decree?\nWe see the orbs of heav'n above, how numberless they are,\nBut sun and moon alone eclips'd, and ne'er a lesser star!\nAnd many a tree on earth we see, some bare, some leafy green,\nOf them, not one is hurt with stone save that has fruitful been!\nSee'st not th' refluent ocean, bear carrion on its tide,\nWhile pearls beneath its wavy flow, fixed in the deep, abide?'\"\n\nPresently she added, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, an thou desire to nonsuit separation, be on thy guard against a swart-visaged oldster, blind of the right eye and lame of the left leg; for he it is who will be the cause of our severance. I saw him enter the city and I opine that he is come hither in quest of me.\" Replied Nur al-Din, \"O lady of fair ones, if my eyes light on him, I will slay him and make an example of him.\" Rejoined she, \"O my lord, slay him not; but talk not nor trade with him, neither buy nor sell with him nor sit nor walk with him nor speak one word to him, no, not even the answer prescribed by law,[FN#489] and I pray Allah to preserve us from his craft and his mischief.\" Next morning, Nur al-Din took the zone and carried it to the market, where he sat down on a shop-bench and talked with the sons of the merchants, till the drowsiness preceding slumber overcame him and he lay down on the bench and fell asleep. Presently, behold, up came the Frank whom the damsel had described to him, in company with seven others, and seeing Nur al-Din lying asleep on the bench, with his head wrapped in the kerchief which Miriam had made for him and the edge thereof in his grasp, sat down by him and hent the end of the kerchief in hand and examined it, turning it over for some time. Nur al-Din sensed that there was something and awoke; then, seeing the very man of whom Miriam had warned him sitting by his side, cried out at him with a great cry which startled him. Quoth the Frank, \"What aileth thee to cry out thus at us? Have we taken from thee aught?\"; and quoth Nur al-Din, \"By Allah, O accursed, haddest thou taken aught from me, I would carry thee before the Chief of Police!\" Then said the Frank, \"O Moslem, I conjure thee by thy faith and by that wherein thou believest, inform me whence thou haddest this kerchief;\" and Nur al-Din replied, \"Tis the handiwork of my lady mother,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Frank asked Nur al-Din anent the maker of the kerchief, he answered, saying, \"In very sooth this kerchief is the handiwork of my mother, who made it for me with her own hand.\" Quoth the Frank \"Wilt thou sell it to me and take ready money for it?,\" and quoth Nur al-Din, \"By Allah, I will not sell it to thee or to any else, for she made none other than it.\" \"Sell it to me and I will give thee to its price this very moment five hundred dinars, money down; and let her who made it make thee another and a finer.\" \"I will not sell it at all, for there is not the like of it in this city.\" \"O my lord, wilt thou sell it for six hundred ducats of fine gold?\" And the Frank went on to add to his offer hundred by hundred, till he bid nine hundred dinars; but Nur al-Din said, \"Allah will open to me otherwise than by my vending it. I will never sell it, not for two thousand dinars nor more than that; no, never.\" The Frank ceased not to tempt him with money, till he bid him a thousand dinars, and the merchants present said, \"We sell thee the kerchief at that price:[FN#490] pay down the money.\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"I will not sell it, I swear by Allah!\"[FN#491] But one of the merchants said to him, \"Know thou, O my son, that the value of this kerchief is an hundred dinars at most and that to an eager purchaser, and if this Frank pay thee down a thousand for it, thy profit will be nine hundred dinars, and what gain canst thou desire greater than this gain? Wherefore 'tis my rede that thou sell him this kerchief at that price and bid her who wrought it make thee other finer than it: so shalt thou profit nine hundred dinars by this accursed Frank, the enemy of Allah and of The Faith.\" Nur al-Din was abashed at the merchants and sold the kerchief to the Frank, who, in their presence, paid him down the thousand dinars, with which he would have returned to his handmaid to congratulate her on what had passed; but the stranger said, \"Harkye, O company of merchants, stop my lord Nur al-Din, for you and he are my guests this night. I have a jar of old Greek wine and a fat lamb, fresh fruit, flowers and confections; wherefore do ye all cheer me with your company to-night and not one of you tarry behind.\" So the merchants said, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, we desire that thou be with us on the like of this night, so we may talk together, we and thou, and we pray thee, of thy favour and bounty, to bear us company, so we and thou, may be the guests of this Frank, for he is a liberal man.\" And they conjured him by the oath of divorce[FN#492] and hindered him by main force from going home. Then they rose forthright and shutting up their shops, took Nur al-Din and fared with the Frank, who brought them to a goodly and spacious saloon, wherein were two da\u00efses. Here he made them sit and set before them a scarlet tray-cloth of goodly workmanship and unique handiwork, wroughten in gold with figures of breaker and broken, lover and beloved, asker and asked, whereon he ranged precious vessels of porcelain and crystal, full of the costliest confections, fruits and flowers, and brought them a flagon of old Greek wine. Then he bade slaughter a fat lamb and kindling fire, proceeded to roast of its flesh and feed the merchants therewith and give them draughts of that wine, winking at them the while to ply Nur al-Din with drink. Accordingly they ceased not plying him with wine till he became drunken and took leave of his wits; so when the Frank saw that he was drowned in liquor, he said to him, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, thou gladdenest us with thy company to-night: welcome, and again welcome to thee.\" Then he engaged him awhile in talk, till he could draw near to him, when he said, with dissembling speech, \"O my lord, Nur al-Din, wilt thou sell me thy slave-girl, whom thou boughtest in presence of these merchants a year ago for a thousand dinars? I will give thee at this moment five thousand gold pieces for her and thou wilt thus make four thousand ducats profit.\" Nur al-Din refused, but the Frank ceased not to ply him with meat and drink and lure him with lucre, still adding to his offers, till he bid him ten thousand dinars for her; whereupon Nur al-Din, in his drunkenness, said before the merchants, \"I sell her to thee for ten thousand dinars: hand over the money.\" At this the Frank rejoiced with joy exceeding and took the merchants to witness the sale. They passed the night in eating and drinking, mirth and merriment, till the morning, when the Frank cried out to his pages, saying, \"Bring me the money.\" So they brought it to him and he counted out ten thousand dinars to Nur al-Din, saying, \"O my lord, take the price of thy slave-girl, whom thou soldest to me last night, in the presence of these Moslem merchants.\" Replied Nur al-Din, \"O accursed, I sold thee nothing and thou liest anent me, for I have no slave-girls.\" Quoth the Frank, \"In very sooth thou didst sell her to me and these merchants were witnesses to the bargain.\" Thereupon all said, \"Yes, indeed! thou soldest him thy slave-girl before us for ten thousand dinars, O Nur al-Din and we will all bear witness against thee of the sale. Come, take the money and deliver him the girl, and Allah will give thee a better than she in her stead. Doth it irk thee, O Nur al-Din, that thou boughtest the girl for a thousand dinars and hast enjoyed for a year and a half her beauty and loveliness and taken thy fill of her converse and her favours? Furthermore thou hast gained some ten thousand golden dinars by the sale of the zones which she made thee every day and thou soldest for twenty sequins, and after all this thou hast sold her again at a profit of nine thousand dinars over and above her original price. And withal thou deniest the sale and belittlest and makest difficulties about the profit! What gain is greater than this gain and what profit wouldst thou have profitabler than this profit? An thou love her thou hast had thy fill of her all this time: so take the money and buy thee another handsomer than she; at a dowry of less than half this price, and the rest of the money will remain in thy hand as capital.\" And the merchants ceased not to ply him with persuasion and special arguments till he took the ten thousand dinars, the price of the damsel, and the Frank straightway fetched Kazis and witnesses, who drew up the contract of sale by Nur al-Din of the handmaid hight Miriam the Girdle-girl. Such was his case; but as regards the damsel's, she sat awaiting her lord from morning till sundown and from sundown till the noon of night; and when he returned not, she was troubled and wept with sore weeping. The old druggist heard her sobbing and sent his wife, who went in to her and finding her in tears, said to her, \"O my lady, what aileth her and finding her in tears, said to her, \"O my lady, what aileth thee to weep?\" Said she, \"O my mother, I have sat waiting the return of my lord, Nur al-Din all day; but he cometh not, and I fear lest some one have played a trick on him, to make him sell me, and he have fallen into the snare and sold me.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-eighth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Miriam the Girdle-girl said to the druggist's wife, \"I am fearful lest some one have been playing a trick on my lord to make him sell me, and he have fallen into the snare and sold me.\" Said the other, \"O my lady Miriam, were they to give thy lord this hall full of gold as thy price, yet would he not sell thee, for what I know of his love to thee. But, O my lady, belike there be a company come from his parents at Cairo and he hath made them an entertainment in the lodging where they alighted, being ashamed to bring them hither, for that the place is not spacious enough for them or because their condition is less than that he should bring them to his own house; or belike he preferred to conceal thine affair from them, so passed the night with them; and Inshallah! to-morrow he will come to thee safe and sound. So burden not thy soul with cark and care, O my lady, for of a certainty this is the cause of his absence from thee last night and I will abide with thee this coming night and comfort thee, until thy lord return to thee.\" So the druggist's wife abode with her and cheered her with talk throughout the dark hours and, when it was morning, Miriam saw her lord enter the street followed by the Frank and amiddlemost a company of merchants, at which sight her side-muscles quivered and her colour changed and she fell a-shaking, as ship shaketh in mid-ocean for the violence of the gale. When the druggist's wife saw this, she said to her, \"O my lady Miriam what aileth thee that I see thy case changed and thy face grown pale and show disfeatured?\" Replied she, \"By Allah, O my lady, my heart forebodeth me of parting and severance of union!\" And she bemoaned herself with the saddest sighs, reciting these couplets,[FN#493]\n\n\"Incline not to parting, I pray; * For bitter its savour is aye.\nE'en the sun at his setting turns pale * To think he must part\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   from the day;\nAnd so, at his rising, for joy * Of reunion, he's radiant and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   gay.\"\n\nThen Miriam wept passing sore wherethan naught could be more, making sure of separation, and cried to the druggist's wife, \"O my mother, said I not to thee that my lord Nur al-Din had been tricked into selling me? I doubt not but he hath sold me this night to yonder Frank, albeit I bade him beware of him; but deliberation availeth not against destiny. So the truth of my words is made manifest to thee.\" Whilst they were talking, behold, in came Nur al-Din, and the damsel looked at him and saw that his colour was changed and that he trembled and there appeared on his face signs of grief and repentance: so she said to him, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, meseemeth thou hast sold me.\" Whereupon he wept with sore weeping and groaned and lamented and recited these couplets,[FN#494]\n\n\"When e'er the Lord 'gainst any man,\nWould fulminate some harsh decree,\nAnd he be wise, and skilled to hear,\nAnd used to see;\nHe stops his ears, and blinds his heart,\nAnd from his brain ill judgment tears,\nAnd makes it bald as 'twere a scalp,\nReft of its hairs;[FN#495]\nUntil the time when the whole man\nBe pierced by this divine command;\nThen He restores him intellect\nTo understand.\"\n\nThen Nur al-Din began to excuse himself to his handmaid, saying, \"By Allah, O my lady Miriam, verily runneth the Reed with whatso Allah hath decreed. The folk put a cheat on me to make me sell thee, and I fell into the snare and sold thee. Indeed, I have sorely failed of my duty to thee; but haply He who decreed our disunion will vouchsafe us reunion.\" Quoth she, \"I warned thee against this, for this it was I dreaded.\" Then she strained him to her bosom and kissed him between the eyes, reciting these couplets,\n\n\"Now, by your love! your love I'll ne'er forget, * Though lost my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   life for stress of pine and fret:\nI weep and wail through livelong day and night * As moans the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   dove on sandhill-tree beset.\nO fairest friends, your absence spoils my life; * Nor find I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    meeting-place as erst we met.\"\n\nAt this juncture, behold, the Frank came in to them and went up to Miriam, to kiss her hands; but she dealt him a buffet with her palm on the cheek, saying, \"Avaunt, O accursed! Thou hast followed after me without surcease, till thou hast cozened my lord into selling me! But O accursed, all shall yet be well, Inshallah!\" The Frank laughed at her speech and wondered at her deed and excused himself to her, saying, \"O my lady Mirian, what is my offence? Thy lord Nur al-Din here sold thee of his full consent and of his own free will. Had he loved thee, by the right of the Messiah, he had not transgressed against thee! And had he not fulfilled his desire of thee, he had not sold thee.\" Quoth one of the poets,\n\n'Whom I irk let him fly fro' me fast and faster * If I name his\nname I am no directer.\nNor the wide wide world is to me so narrow * That I act expecter\nto this rejecter.'\"[FN#496]\n\nNow this handmaid was the daughter of the King of France, the which is a wide an spacious city,[FN#497] abounding in manufactures and rarities and trees and flowers and other growths, and resembleth the city of Constantinople; and for her going forth of her father's city there was a wondrous cause and thereby hangeth a marvellous tale which we will set out in due order, to divert and delight the hearer.[FN#498]\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the cause of Miriam the Girdle-girl leaving her father and mother was a wondrous and thereby hangeth a marvellous tale. She was reared with her father and mother in honour and indulgence and learnt rhetoric and penmanship and arithmetic and cavalarice and all manner crafts, such as broidery and sewing and weaving and girdle-making and silk-cord making and damascening gold on silver and silver on gold, brief all the arts both of men and women, till she became the union-pearl of her time and the unique gem of her age and day. Moreover, Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) had endowed her with such beauty and loveliness and elegance and perfection of grace that she excelled therein all the folk of her time, and the Kings of the isles sought her in marriage of her sire, but he refused to give her to wife to any of her suitors, for that he loved her with passing love and could not bear to be parted from her a single hour. Moreover, he had no other daughter than herself, albeit he had many sons, but she was dearer to him than all of them. It fortuned one year that she fell sick of an exceeding sickness and came nigh upon death, werefore she made a vow that, if she recovered from her malady, she would make the pilgrimage to a certain monastery, situate in such an island, which was high in repute among the Franks, who used to make vows to it and look for a blessing therefrom. When Miriam recovered from her sickness, she wished to accomplish her vow anent the monastery and her sire despatched her to the convent in a little ship, with sundry daughters of the city-notables to wait upon her and patrician Knights to protect them all. As they drew near the island, there came out upon them a ship of the ships of the Moslems, champions of The Faith, warring in Allah's way, who boarded the vessel and making prize of all therein, knights and maidens, gifts and monies, sold their booty in the city of Kayraw\u00e1n.[FN#499] Miriam herself fell into the hands of a Persian merchant, who was born impotent[FN#500] and for whom no woman had ever discovered her nakedness; so he set her to serve him. Presently, he fell ill and sickened well nigh unto death, and the sickness abode with him two months, during which she tended him after the goodliest fashion, till Allah made him whole of his malady, when he recalled her tenderness and loving-kindness to him and the persistent zeal with which she had nurst him and being minded to requite her the good offices she had done him, said to her, \"Ask a boon of me?\" She said, \"O my lord, I ask of thee that thou sell me not but to the man of my choice.\" He answered, \"So be it. I guarantee thee. By Allah, O Miriam, I will not sell thee but to him of whom thou shalt approve, and I put thy sale in thine own hand.\" And she rejoiced herein with joy exceeding. Now the Persian had expounded to her Al-Islam and she became a Moslemah and learnt of him the rules of worship. Furthermore during that period the Perisan had taught her the tenets of The Faith and the observances incumbent upon her: he had made her learn the Koran by heart and master somewhat of the theological sciences and the traditions of the Prophet; after which, he brought her to Alexandria-city and sold her to Nur al-Din, as we have before set out. Meanwhile, when her father, the King of France, heard what had befallen his daughter and her company, he saw Doomsday break and sent after her ships full of knights and champions, horsemen and footsmen; but they fell not in any trace of her whom they sought in the Islands[FN#501] of the Moslems; so all returned to him, crying out and saying, \"Well-away!\" and \"Ruin!\" and \"Well worth the day!\" The King grieved for her with exceeding grief and sent after her that one-eyed lameter, blind of the left,[FN#502] for that he was his chief Wazir, a stubborn tyrant and a froward devil,[FN#503] full of craft and guile, bidding him make search for her in all the lands of the Moslems and buy her, though with a ship-load of gold. So the accursed sought her, in all the islands of the Arabs and all the cities of the Moslems, but found no sign of her till he came to Alexandria-city where he made quest for her and presently discovered that she was with Nur al-Din Ali the Cairene, being directed to the trace of her by the kerchief aforesaid, for that none could have wrought it in such goodly guise but she. Then he bribed the merchants to help him in getting her from Nur al-Din and beguiled her lord into selling her, as hath been already related. When he had her in his possession, she ceased not to weep and wail: so he said to her, \"O my lady Miriam, put away from thee this mourning and grieving and return with me to the city of thy sire, the seat of thy kingship and the place of thy power and thy home, so thou mayst be among thy servants and attendants and be quit of this abasement and this strangerhood. Enough hath betided me of travail, of travel and of disbursing monies on thine account, for thy father bade me buy thee back, though with a shipload of gold; and now I have spent nigh a year and a half in seeking thee.\" And he fell to kissing her hands and feet and humbling himself to her; but the more he kissed and grovelled she only redoubled in wrath against him, and said to him, \"O accursed, may Almighty Allah not vouchsafe thee to win thy wish!\" Presently his pages brought her a shemule with gold-embroidered housings and mounting her thereon, raised over her head a silken canopy, with staves of gold and silver, and the Franks walked round about her, till they brought her forth the city by the sea-gate,[FN#504] where they took boat with her and rowing out to a great ship in harbor embarked therein. Then the monocular Wazir cried out to the sailors, saying, \"Up with the mast!\" So they set it up forthright and spreading the newly bent sails and the colours manned the sweeps and put out to sea. Meanwhile Miriam continued to gaze upon Alexandria, till it disappeared from her eyes, when she fell a-weeping in her privacy with sore weeping.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eightieth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir of the Frankish King put out to sea in the ship bearing Miriam the Girdle-girl, she gazed Alexandria-wards till the city was hidden from her sight when she wailed and wept copious tears and recited these couplets,\n\n\"O dwelling of my friends say is there no return * Uswards? But\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   what ken I of matters Allah made?\nStill fare the ships of Severance, sailing hastily * And in my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wounded eyelids tear have ta'en their stead,\nFor parting from a friend who was my wish and will * Healed every\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   ill and every pain and pang allay'd.\nBe thou, O Allah, substitute of me for him * Such charge some day\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  the care of Thee shall not evade.\"\n\nThen she could not refrain from weeping and wailing. So the patrician[FN#505] knights came up to her and would have comforted her, but she heeded not their consoling words, being distracted by the claims of passion and love-longing. And she shed tears and moaned and complained and recited these couplets,\n\n\"The tongue of Love within my vitals speaketh * Saying, 'This\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   lover boon of Love aye seeketh!'\nAnd burn my liver hottest coals of passion * And parting on my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   heart sore suffering wreaketh.\nHow shall I face this fiery love concealing * When fro' my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  wounded lids the tear aye leaketh?\n\nIn this plight Miriam abode during all the voyage; no peace was left her at all nor would patience come at her call. Such was her case in company with the Wazir, the monocular, the lameter; but as regards Nur al-Din the Cairene, when the ship had sailed with Miriam, the world was straitened upon him and he had neither peace nor patience. He returned to the lodging where they twain had dwelt, and its aspect was black and gloomy in his sight. Then he saw the m\u00e9tier wherewith she had been wont to make the zones and her dress that had been upon her beauteous body; so he pressed them to his breast, whilst the tears gushed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,\n\n\"Say me, will Union after parting e'er return to be * After\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   long-lasting torments, after hopeless misery?\nAlas! Alas! what wont to be shall never more return * But grant\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   me still return of dearest her these eyne may see.\nI wonder me will Allah deign our parted lives unite * And will my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   dear one's plighted troth preserve with constancy!\nNaught am I save the prey of death since parting parted us; * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   will my friends consent that I am a wierd so deadly dree?\nAlas my sorrow!

O Miriam! Was it but a vision of thee I saw in sleep or in the allusions of dreams?\" And by reason of that which grew on him of regrets, he recited these couplets,[FN#506]\n\n\"Mazed with thy love no more I can feign patience,\nThis heart of mine has held none dear but thee!\nAnd if mine eye hath gazed on other's beauty,\nNe'er be it joyed again with sight of thee!\nI've sworn an oath I'll ne'er forget to love thee,\nAnd sad's this breast that pines to meet with thee!\nThou'st made me drink a love-cup full of passion,\nBlest time! When I may give the draught to thee!\nTake with thee this my form where'er thou goest,\nAnd when thou 'rt dead let me be laid near thee!\nCall on me in my tomb, my bones shall answer\nAnd sigh responses to a call from thee!\n\nIf it were asked, 'What wouldst thou Heaven should order?'\n'His will,' I answer, 'First, and then what pleases thee.'\"\n\nAs Nur al-Din was in this case, weeping and crying out, \"O Miriam! O Miriam!\" behold, an old man landed from a vessel and coming up to him, saw him shedding tears and heard him reciting these verses,\n\n\"O Maryam of beauty[FN#507] return, for these eyne * Are as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   densest clouds railing drops in line:\nAsk amid mankind and my railers shall say * That mine eyelids are\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  drowning these eyeballs of mine.\"\n\nSaid the old man, \"O my son, meseems thou weepest for the damsel who sailed yesterday with the Frank?\" When Nur al-Din heard these words of the Shaykh he fell down in a swoon and lay for a long while without life; then, coming to himself, he wept with sore weeping and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"Shall we e'er be unite after severance-tide * And return in the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    perfectest cheer to bide?\nIn my heart indeed is a lowe of love * And I'm pained by the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    spies who my pain deride:\nMy days I pass in amaze distraught, * And her image a-nights I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   would see by side:\nBy Allah, no hour brings me solace of love * And how can it when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   makebates vex me and chide?\nA soft-sided damsel of slenderest waist * Her arrows of eyne on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    my heart hath plied?\nHer form is like B\u00e1n[FN#508]-tree branch in garth * Shame her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    charms the sun who his face most hide:\nDid I not fear God (be He glorified!) * 'My Fair be glorified!'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Had I cried.\"\n\nThe old man looked at him and noting his beauty and grace and symmetry and the fluency of his tongue and the seductiveness of his charms, had ruth on him and his heart mourned for his case. Now that Shaykh was the captain of a ship, bound to the damsel's city, and in this ship were a hundred Moslem merchants, men of the Saving Faith; so he said to Nur al-Din, \"Have patience and all will yet be well; I will bring thee to her an it be the will of Allah, extolled and exalted be He!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-first Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old skipper said to Nur al-Din, \"I will bring thee to her, Inshallah!\" the youth asked, \"When shall we set out?\" and the other said, \"Come but three days more and we will depart in peace and prosperity.\" Nur al-Din rejoiced at the captain's words with joy exceeding and thanked him for his bounty and benevolence. Then he recalled the days of love-liesse dear and union with his slave-girl without peer, and he shed bitter tears and recited these couplets,\n\n\"Say, will to me and you the Ruthful union show * My lords! Shall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    e'er I win the wish of me or no?\nA visit-boon by you will shifty Time vouchsafe? * And seize your\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    image eye-lids which so hungry grow?\nWith you were Union to be sold, I fain would buy; * But ah, I see\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   such grace doth all my means outgo!\"\n\nThen Nur al-Din went forthright to the market and bought what he needed of viaticum and other necessaries for the voyage and returned to the Rais, who said to him, \"O my son, what is that thou hast with thee?\" said he, \"My provisions and all whereof I have need for the voyage.\" Thereupon quoth the old man, laughing, \"O my son, art thou going a-pleasuring to Pompey's Pillar?[FN#509] Verily, between thee and that thou seekest is two months' journey and the wind be fair and the weather favourable.\" Then he took of him somewhat of money and going to the bazar, bought him a sufficiency of all that he needed for the voyage and filled him a large earthen jar[FN#510] with fresh water. Nur al-Din abode in the ship three days until the merchants had made an end of their precautions and preparations and embarked, when they set sail and putting out to sea, fared on one-and-fifty days. After this, there came out upon them corsairs,[FN#511] pirates who sacked the ship and taking Nur al-Din and all therein prisoners, carried them to the city of France and paraded them before the King, who bade cast them into jail, Nur al-Din amongst the number. As they were being led to prison the galleon[FN#512] arrived with the Princess Miriam and the one-eyed Wazir, and when it made the harbour, the lameter landed and going up to the King gave him the glad news of his daughter's safe return: whereupon they beat the kettledrums for good tidings and decorated the city after the goodliest fashion. Then the King took horse, with all his guards and lords and notables and rode down to the sea to meet her. The moment the ship cast anchor she came ashore, and the King saluted her and embraced her and mounting her on a bloodsteed, bore her to the palace, where her mother received her with open arms, and asked her of her case and whether she was a maid as before or whether she had become a woman carnally known by man.[FN#513] She replied, \"O my mother, how should a girl, who hath been sold from merchant to merchant in the land of Moslems, a slave commanded, abide a virgin? The merchant who bought me threatened me with the bastinado and violenced me and took my maidenhead, after which he sold me to another and he again to a third.\" When the Queen heard these her words, the light in her eyes became night and she repeated her confession to the King who was chagrined thereat and his affair was grievous to him. So he expounded her case to his Grandees and Patricians[FN#514] who said to him, \"O King, she hath been defiled by the Moslems and naught will purify her save the striking off of an hundred Mohammedan heads.\" Whereupon the King sent for the True Believers he had imprisoned; and they decapitated them, one after another, beginning with the captain, till none was left save Nur al-Din. They tare off a strip of his skirt and binding his eyes therewith, led him to the rug of blood and were about to smite his neck, when behold, an ancient dame came up to the King at that very moment and said, \"O my lord, thou didst vow to bestow upon each and every church five Moslem captives, to held us in the service thereof, so Allah would restore thee thy daughter the Princess Miriam; and now she is restored to thee, so do thou fulfil thy vow.\" The King replied, \"O my mother, by the virtue of the Messiah and the Veritable Faith, there remaineth to me of the prisoners but this one captive, whom they are about to put to death: so take him with thee to help in the service of the church, till there come to me more prisoners of the Moslems, when I will send thee other four. Hadst thou come earlier, before they hewed off the heads of these, I had given thee as many as thou wouldest have.\" The old woman thanked the King for his boon and wished him continuance of life, glory and prosperity. Then without loss of time she went up to Nur al-Din, whom she raised from the rug of blood; and, looking narrowly at him saw a comely youth and a dainty, with a delicate skin and a face like the moon at her full; whereupon she carried him to the church and said to him, \"O my son, doff these clothes which are upon thee, for they are fit only for the service of the Sultan.\"[FN#515] So saying the ancient dame brought him a gown and hood of black wool and a broad girdle,[FN#516] in which she clad and cowled him; and, after binding on his belt, bade him do the service of the church. Accordingly, he served the church seven days, at the end of which time behold, the old woman came up to him and said, \"O Moslem, don thy silken dress and take these ten dirhams and go out forthright and divert thyself abroad this day, and tarry not here a single moment, lest thou lose thy life.\" Quoth he, \"What is to do, O my mother?\"; and quoth she, \"Know, O my son, that the King's daughter, the Princess Miriam the Girdle-girl, hath a mind to visit the church this day, to seek a blessing by pilgrimage and to make oblation thereto, a douceur[FN#517] of thank-offering for her deliverance from the land of the Moslems and in fulfilment of the vows she vowed to the Messiah, so he would save her. With her are four hundred damsels, not one of whom but is perfect in beauty and loveliness and all of them are daughters of Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees: they will be here during this very hour and if their eyes fall on thee in this church, they will hew thee in pieces with swords.\" Thereupon Nur al-Din took the ten dirhams from the ancient dame, and donning his own dress, went out to the bazar and walked about the city and took his pleasure therein, till he knew its highways and gates,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-second Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nur al-Din, after donning his own dress and taking the ten dirhams from the ancient dame, fared forth to the market streets and wandered about a while till he knew every quarter of the city, after which he returned to the church[FN#518] and saw the Princess Miriam the Girdle-girl, daughter of the King of France come up to the fane, attended by four hundred damsels, high-bosomed maids like moons, amongst whom was the daughter of the one-eyed Wazir and those of the Emirs and Lords of the realm; and she walked in their midst as she were moon among stars. When his eyes fell upon her Nur al-Din could not contain himself, but cried out from the core of his heart, \"O Miriam! O Miriam!\" When the damsels heard his outcry they ran at him with swords shining bright like flashes of leven-light and would have slain him forthright. But the Princess turned and looking on him, knew him with fullest knowledge, and said to her maidens, \"Leave this youth; doubtless he is mad, for the signs of madness be manifest on his face.\" When Nur al-Din heard this, he uncovered his head and rolled his eyes and made signs with his hands and twisted his legs, foaming the while at the mouth. Quoth the Princess, \"Said I not that the poor youth was mad? Bring him to me and stand off from him, that I may hear what he saith; for I know the speech of the Arabs and will look into his case and see if his madness admit of cure or not.\" So they laid hold of him and brought him to her; after which they withdrew to a distance and she said to him, \"Hast thou come hither on my account and ventured thy life for my sake and feignest thyself mad?\" He replied, \"O my lady, hast thou not heard the saying of the poet?,[FN#519]\n\n'Quoth they, 'Thou'rt surely raving mad for her thou lov'st;' and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I, 'There is no pleasantness in life but for the mad,'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    reply.\nCompare my madness with herself for whom I rave; if she Accord\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   therewith, then blame me not for that which I aby.'\"\n\nMiriam replied, \"By Allah, O Nur al-Din, indeed thou hast sinned against thyself, for I warned thee of this before it befell thee: yet wouldst thou not hearken to me, but followest thine own lust: albeit that whereof I gave thee to know I learnt not by means of inspiration nor physiognomy[FN#520] nor dreams, but by eye-witness and very sight; for I saw the one-eyed Wazir and knew that he was not come to Alexandria but in quest of me.\" Said he, \"O my lady Miriam, we seek refuge with Allah from the error of the intelligent!\"[FN#521] Then his affliction redoubled on him and he recited this saying,[FN#522]\n\n\"Pass o'er my fault, for 'tis the wise man's wont\nOf other's sins to take no harsh account;\nAnd as all crimes have made my breast their site,\nSo thine all shapes of mercy should unite.\nWho from above would mercy seek to know,\nShould first be merciful to those below.\"\n\nThen Nur al-Din and Princess Miriam ceased not from lovers' chiding which to trace would be tedious, relating each to other that which had befallen them and reciting verses and making moan, one to other, of the violence of passion and the pangs of pine and desire, whilst the tears ran down their cheeks like rivers, till there was left them no strength to say a word and so they continued till day deprated and night darkened. Now the Princess was clad in a green dress, purfled with red gold and broidered with pearls and gems which enhanced her beauty and loveliness and inner grace; and right well quoth the poet of her,[FN#523]\n\n\"Like the full moon she shineth in garments all of green, With\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   loosened vest and collars and flowing hair beseen.\n'What is thy name?' I asked her, and she replied, 'I'm she Who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    roasts the hearts of lovers on coals of love and teen.\nI am the pure white silver, ay, and the gold wherewith The\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bondsmen from strait prison and dour releas\u00e8d been.'\nQuoth I, 'I'm all with rigours consumed;' but 'On a rock,' Said\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  she, 'such as my heart is, thy plaints are wasted clean.'\n'Even if thy heart,' I answered, 'be rock in very deed, Yet hath\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  God caused fair water well from the rock, I ween.'\"\n\nAnd when night darkened on them the Lady Miriam went up to her women and asked them, \"Have ye locked the door?\"; and they answered, \"Indeed we have locked it.\" So she took them and went with them to a place called the hapel of the Lady Mary the Virgin, Mother of Light, because the Nazarenes hold that there are her heart and soul. The girls betook themselves to prayer for blessings from above and circuited all the church; and when they had made an end of their visitation, the Princess turned to them and said, \"I desire to pass the night alone in the Virgin's chapel and seek a blessing thereof, for that yearning after it hath betided me, by reason of my long absence in the land of the Moslems; and as for you, when ye have made an end of your visitation, do ye sleep whereso ye will.\" Replied they, \"With love and goodly gree: be it as thou wilt!\"; and leaving her alone in the chapel, dispersed about the church and slept. The Lady Miriam waited till they were out of sight and hearing, then went in search of Nur al-Din, whom she found sitting in a corner on live coals, awaiting her. He rose and kissed her hands and feet and she sat down and seated him by her side. Then she pulled off all that was upon her of raiment and ornaments and fine linen and taking Nur al-Din in her arms strained him to her bosom. And they ceased not, she and he, from kissing and clipping and strumming to the tune of \"hocus-pocus,\"[FN#524] saying the while, \"How short are the nights of Union and the nights of Disunion how long are they!\" and reciting these verses,\n\n\"O Night of Union, Time's virginal prized, * White star of the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nights with auroral dyes,\nThou garrest Dawn after Noon to rise * Say art thou Kohl in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Morning's Eyes,\nOr wast thou Slumber to bleared eye lief?\nO Night of Parting, how long thy stay * Whose latest hours aye\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   the first portray,\nThis endless circle that noways may * Show breach till the coming\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   of Judgment-day,\nDay when dies the lover of parting-grief.\"[FN#525]\n\nAs they were in this mighty delight and joy engrossing they heard one of the servants of the Saint[FN#526] smite the gong[FN#527] upon the roof, to call the folk to the rites of their worship, and he was even as saith the poet,\n\n\"I saw him strike the gong and asked of him straightway, * Who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     made the Fawn[FN#528] at striking going so knowing, eh?'\nAnd to my soul, 'What smiting irketh thee the more\u2014 * Striking\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    the gong or striking note of going,[FN#529] say?'\"\n\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nur al-Din and Miriam the Girdle-girl rose forthwith and donned her clothes and ornaments; but this was grievous to Nur al-Din, and his gladness was troubled; the tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,\n\n\"I ceas\u00e8d not to kiss that cheek with budding roses dight * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   eyes down cast and bit the same with most emphatic bite;\nUntil we were in gloria[FN#530] and lay him down the spy * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sank his eyes within his brain declining further sight:\nAnd struck the gongs as they that had the charge of them were\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   like * Muezzin crying duty-prayers in Allah's book indite.\nThen rose she up right hastily and donned the dress she'd doffed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   * Sore fearing lest a shooting-star[FN#531] upon our heads\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   alight.\nAnd cried, 'O wish and will of me, O end of all my hopes! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Behold the morning comes to us in brightest whitest light.'\nI swear if but one day of rule were given to my life * And I were\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     made an Emperor of majesty and might,\nAdown I'd break the buttresses of churches one and all * And by\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    their slaughter rid the earth of every shaveling wight.\"\n\nThen the Lady Miriam pressed him to her bosom and kissed his cheek and asked him, \"O Nur al-Din, how long hast thou been in this town?\" \"Seven days.\" \"Hast thou walked about in it, and dost thou know its ways and issues and its sea-gates and land gates?\" \"Yes!\" \"Knowest thou the way to the offertory-chest[FN#532] of the church?\" \"Yes!\" \"Since thou knowest all this, as soon as the first third[FN#533] of the coming night is over, go to the offertory-chest and take thence what thou wishest and willest. Then open the door that giveth upon the tunnel[FN#534] leading to the sea, and go down to the harbour, where thou wilt find a little ship and ten men therein, and when the Rais shall see thee, he will put out his hand to thee. Give him thy hand and he will take thee up into the ship, and do thou wait there till I come to thee. But 'ware and have a care lest sleep overtake thee this night, or thou wilt repent whenas repentance shall avail thee naught.\" Then the Princess farewelled him and going forth from Nur al-Din, aroused from sleep her women and the rest of the damsels, with whom she betook herself to the church door and knocked; whereupon the ancient dame opened to her and she went forth and found the knights and varlets standing without. They brought her a dapple she-mule and she mounted: whereupon they raised over her head a canopy[FN#535] with curtains of silk, and the knights took hold of the mule's halter. Then the guards[FN#536] encompassed her about, drawn brand in hand, and fared on with her, followed by her, till they brought her to the palace of the King her father. Meanwhile, Nur al-Din abode concealed behind the curtain, under cover of which Miriam and he had passed the night, till it was broad day, when the main door was opened and the church became full of people. Then he mingled with the folk and accosted the old Prioress, the guardian[FN#537] of the shrine, who said to him, \"Where didst thou lie last night?\" Said he, \"In the town as thou badest me.\" Quoth she, \"O my son, thou hast done the right thing; for, hadst thou nighted in the Church, she had slain thee on the foulest wise.\" And quoth he, \"Praised be Allah who hath delivered me from the evil of this night!\" Then he busied himself with the service of the church and ceased not busying till day departed and night with darkness starkened when he arose and opened the offertory-chest and took thence of jewels whatso was light of weight and weighty of worth. Then he tarried till the first watch of the night was past, when he made his way to the postern of the tunnel and opening it, went forth, calling on Allah for protection, and ceased not faring on until, after finding and opening the door, he came to the sea. Here he discovered the vessel moored to the shore near the gate; and her skipper, a tall old man of comely aspect with a long beard, standing in the waist, his ten men being ranged before him. Nur al-Din gave him his hand, as Miriam had bidden him, and the captain took it and pulling him on board of the ship cried out to his crew, saying, \"Cast off the moorings and put out to sea with us, ere day break.\" Said one of the ten, \"O my lord the Captain, how shall we put out now, when the King hath notified us that to-morrow he will embark in this ship and go round about the sea, being fearful for his daughter Miriam from the Moslem thieves?\" But the Rais cried out at them saying, \"Woe to you, O accursed; Dare ye gainsay me and bandy words with me?\" So saying the old captain bared his blade and with it dealt the sailor who had spoken a thrust in the throat, that the steel came out gleaming from his nape; and quoth another of the sailors, \"What hath our comrade done of crime, that thou shouldst cut his throat?\" Thereupon the captain clapped hand to sword and smote the speaker's head, nor did he leave smiting the rest of the sailors till he had slain them all, one after other, and cast the ten bodies ashore. Then he turned to Nur al-Din and cried out at him with a terrible great cry, that made him tremble, saying, \"Go down and pull up the mooring-satke.\" Nur al-Din feared lest he should strike him also with the sword; so he sprang up and leapt ashore and pulling up the stake jumped aboard again, swiftlier than the dazzling leven. The captain ceased not to bid him do this and do that and tack and wear hither and thither and look at the stars, and Nur al-Din did all that he bade him, with heart a-quaking for affright; whilst he himself spread the sails, and the ship fared with the twain into the dashing sea, swollen with clashing billows.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old skipper had made sail he drave the ship, aided by Nur al-Din, into the dashing sea before a favouring gale. Meanwhile, Nur al-Din held on to the tackle immersed in deep thought, and drowned in the sea of solicitude, knowing not what was hidden for him in the future; and whenever he looked at the captain, his heart quaked and he knew not whither the Rais went with him. He abode thus, preoccupied with care and doubt, till it was high day, when he looked at the skipper and saw him take hold of his long beard and pull at it, whereupon it came off in his hand and Nur al-Din, examining it, saw that it was but a false beard glued on. So he straitly considered that same Rais, and behold, it was the Princess Miriam, his mistress and the dearling of his heart, who had contrived to waylay the captain and slay him and skinned off his beard, which she had stuck on to her own face. At this Nur al-Din was transported for you, and his breast broadened and he marvelled at her prowess and the stoutness of her heart and said to her, \"Welcome, O my hope and my desire and the end of mine every wish!\" Then love and gladness agitated him and he made sure of winning to his hopes and his expectancy; wherefore he broke out into song and chanted these couplets,\n\n\"To all who unknown my love for the May * From whom Fate disjoins\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    me O say, I pray,\n'Ask my kith and kin of my love that aye * Ensweetens my verses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    to lovely lay:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        For the loss of the tribesmen my life o'er sway!'\nTheir names when named heal all malady; * Cure and chase from\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    heart every pain I dree:\nAnd my longings for love reach so high degree * That my Sprite is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     maddened each morn I see,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And am grown of the crowd to be saw and say.\nNo blame in them will I e'er espy: * No! nor aught of solace sans\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    them descry:\nYour love hath shot me with pine, and I * Bear in heart a flame\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    that shall never die,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         But fire my liver with fiery ray.\nAll folk my sickness for marvel score * That in darkest night I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    wake evermore\nWhat ails them to torture this heart forlore * And deem right for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     loving my blood t' outpour:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          And yet\u2014how justly unjust are they!\nWould I wot who 'twas could obtain of you * To wrong a youth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     who's so fain of you:\nBy my life and by Him who made men of you * And the spy tell\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     aught I complain of you\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         He lies, by Allah, in foulest way!\nMay the Lord my sickness never dispel, * Nor ever my heart of its\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    pains be well,\nWhat day I regret that in love I fell * Or laud any land but\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     wherein ye dwell:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Wring my heart and ye will or make glad and gay!\nI have vitals shall ever be true to you * Though racked by the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rigours not new to you\nEre this wrong and this right I but sue to you: * Do what you\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     will to thrall who to you\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Shall ne'er grudge his life at your feet to lay.\"\n\nWhen Nur al-Din ceased to sing, the Princess Miriam marvelled at his song and thanked him therefor, saying, \"Whoso's case is thus it behoveth him to walk the ways of men and never do the deed of curs and cowards.\" Now she was stout of heart and cunning in the sailing of ships over the salt sea, and she knew all the winds and their shiftings and every course of the main. So Nur al-Din said, \"O my lady, hadst thou prolonged this case on me,[FN#538] I had surely died for stress of affright and chagrin, more by token of the fire of passion and love-longing and the cruel pangs of separation.\" She laughed at his speech and rising without stay or delay brought out somewhat of food and liquor; and they ate and drank and enjoyed themselves and made merry. Then she drew forth rubies and other gems and precious stones and costly trinkets of gold and silver and all manner things of price, light of weight and weighty of worth, which she had taken from the palace of her sire and his treasuries, and displayed them to Nur al-Din, who rejoiced therein with joy exceeding. All this while the wind blew fair for them and merrily sailed the ship nor ceased sailing till they drew near the city of Alexandria and sighted its landmarks, old and new, and Pompey's Pillar. When they made the port, Nur al-Din landed forthright and securing the ship to one of the Fulling-Stones,[FN#539] took somewhat of the treasures that Miriam had brought with her, and said to her, \"O my lady, tarry in the ship, against I return and carry thee up into the city in such way as I should wish and will.\" Quoth she, \"It behoveth that this be done quickly, for tardiness in affairs engendereth repentance.\" Quoth he, \"There is no tardiness in me;\" and, leaving her in the ship, went up into the city to the house of the druggist his father's old fried, to borrow of his wife for Miriam veil and mantilla, and walking boots and petticoat-trousers after the usage of the women of Alexandria, unknowing that there was appointed to betide him of the shifts of Time, the Father of Wonders, that which was far beyond his reckoning. Thus it befel Nur al-Din and Miriam the Girdle-girl; but as regards her sire the King of France, when he arose in the morning, he missed his daughter and questioned her women and her eunuchs of her. Answered they, \"O our lord, she went out last night, to go to Church and after that we have no tidings of her.\" But, as the King talked with them, behold, there arose so great a clamour of cries below the palace, that the place rang thereto, and he said, \"What may be the news?\" The folk replied, \"O King, we have found ten men slain on the sea-shore, and the royal yacht is missing. Moreover we saw the postern of the Church, which giveth upon the tunnel leading to the sea, wide open; and the Moslem prisoner, who served in the Church, is missing.\" Quoth the King, \"An my ship be lost, without doubt or dispute.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the King of France missed his daughter they brought him tidings of her, saying, \"Thy yacht is lost\"; and he replied, \"An the craft be lost, without dispute or doubt my daughter is in it.\" So he summoned without stay or delay the Captain of the Port and cried out at him, saying, \"By the virtue[FN#540] of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, except thou and thy fighting men overtake my ship forthright and bring it back to me, with those who are therein, I will do thee die the foulest of deaths and make a terrible example of thee!\" Thereupon the captain went out from before him, trembling, and betook himself to the ancient dame of the Church, to whom said he, 'Heardest thou aught from the captive, that was with thee, anent his native land and what countryman he was?\" And she answered, \"He used to say, I come from the town of Alexandria.\" When the captain heard the old woman's words he returned forthright to the port and cried out to the sailors, \"Make ready and set sail.\" So they did his bidding and straightway putting out to sea, fared night and day till they sighted the city of Alexandria at the very time when Nur al-Din landed, leaving the Princess in the ship. They soon espied the royal yacht and knew her; so they moored their own vessel at a distance therefrom and putting off in a little frigate they had with them, which drew but two cubits of water and in which were an hundred fighting-men, amongst them the one-eyed Wazir (for that he was a stubborn tyrant and a froward devil and a wily thief, none could avail against his craft, as he were Abu Mohammed al-Batt\u00e1l[FN#541]), they ceased not rowing till they reached the bark and boarding her, all at once, found none therein save the Princess Miriam. So they took her and the ship, and returning to their own vessel, after they had landed and waited a long while,[FN#542] set sail forthright for the land of the Franks, having accomplished their errand, without a fight or even drawing sword. The wind blew fair for them and they sailed on, without ceasing and with all diligence, till they reached the city of France and landing with the Princess Miriam carried her to her father, who received her, seated on the throne of his Kingship. As soon as he saw her, he said to her, \"Woe to thee, O traitress! What ailed thee to leave the faith of thy fathers and forefathers and the safeguard of the Messiah, on whom is our reliance, and follow after the faith of the Vagrants,[FN#543] to wit, the faith of Al-Islam, the which arose with the sword against the Cross and the Images?\" Replied Miriam, \"I am not at fault, I went out by night to the church, to visit the Lady Mary and seek a blessing of her, when there fell upon me unawares a band of Moslem robbers, who gagged me and bound me fast and carrying me on board the barque, set sail with me for their own country. However, I beguiled them and talked with them of their religion, till they loosed my bonds; and ere I knew it thy men overtook me and delivered me. And by the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar and the Cross and the Crucified thereon, I rejoiced with joy exceeding in my release from them and my bosom broadened and I was glad for my deliverance from the bondage of the Moslems!\" Rejoined the King, \"Thou liest, O whore! O adultress! By the virtue of that which is revealed of prohibition and permission in the manifest Evangel,[FN#544] I will assuredly do thee die by the foulest of deaths and make thee the vilest of examples! Did it not suffice thee to do as thou didst the first time and put off thy lies upon us, but thou must return upon us with thy deceitful inventions?\" Thereupon the King bade kill her and crucify her over the palace gate; but, at that moment the one-eyed Wazir, who had long been enamoured of the Princess, came in to him and said, \"Ho King! saly her not, but give her to me to wife, and I will watch over her with the utmost warding, nor will I go in unto her, till I have built her a palace of solid stone, exceeding high of foundation, so no thieves may avail to climb up to its terrace-roof; and when I have made an end of building it, I will sacrifice thirty Moslems before the gate thereof, as an expiatory offering to the Messiah for myself and for her.\" The King granted his request and bade the priests and monks and patriarchs marry the Princess to him; so they did his bidding, whereupon he bade set about building a strong and lofty palace, befitting her rank and the workmen fell to work upon it. On this wise it betided the Princess Miriam and her sire and the one-eyed Wazir; but as regards Nur al-Din, when he came back with the petticoat-trousers and mantilla and walking boots and all the attire of Alexandrian women which he had borrowed of the druggist's wife, he \"found the air void and the fane afar[FN#545]\";\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nur al-Din, \"found the aire void[FN#546] and the fane afar,\" his heart sank within him and he wept floods of tears and recited these verses,[FN#547]\n\n\"The phantom of Soada came by nigh to wake me towards morning\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     while my companions were sleeping in the desert:\nBut when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom, I saw the air\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    vacant, and the place of visitation distant.\"\n\nThen Nur al-Din walked on along the sea-shore and turned right and left, till he saw folk gathered together on the beach and heard them say, \"O Moslems, there remaineth no honour to Alexandria-city, since the Franks enter it and snatch away those who are therein and return to their own land, at their leisure[FN#548] nor pursued of any of the Moslems or fighters for the Faith!\" Quoth Nur al-Din to them, \"What is to do?\"; and quoth they, \"O my son, one of the ships of the Franks, full of armed men, came down but now upon the port and carried off a ship which was moored here, with her that was therein, and made unmolested for their own land.\" Nur al-Din fell down a-swoon, on hearing these words; and when he recovered they questioned him of his case and he told them all that had befallen him first and last; whereupon they all took to reviling him and railing at him, saying, \"Why couldst thou not bring her up into the town without mantilla and muffler?\" And all and each of the folk gave him some grievous word, berating him with sharp speech, and shooting at him some shaft or reproach, albeit one said, \"Let him be; that which hath befallen him sufficeth him,\" till he again fell down in a fainting-fit. And behold, at this moment, up came the old druggist, who, seeing the folk gathered together, drew near to learn what was the matter and found Nur al-Din lying a-swoon in their midst. So he sat down at his head and arousing him, said to him as soon as he recovered, \"O my son, what is this case in which I see thee?\" Nur al-Din said, \"O uncle, I had brought back in a barque my lost slave-girl from her father's city, suffering patiently all I suffered of perils and hardships; and when I came with her to this port, I made the vessel fast to the shore and leaving her therein, repaired to thy dwelling and took of thy consort what was needful for her, that I might bring her up into the town; but the Franks came and capturing barque and damsel made off unhindered, and returned to their own land.\" Now when the Shaykh, the druggist, heard this, the light in his eyes became night and he grieved with sore grieving for Nur al-Din and said to him, \"O my son, why didst thou not bring her out of the ship into the city without mantilla? But speech availeth not at this season; so rise, O my son, and come up with me to the city; haply Allah will vouchsafe thee a girl fairer than she, who shall console thee for her. Alhamdolillah-praised be Allah-who hath not made thee lose aught by her! Nay, thou hast gained by her. And bethink thee, O my son, that Union and Disunion are in the hands of the Most High King..\" Replied Nur al-Din, \"By Allah, O uncle, I can never be consoled for her loss nor will I ever leave seeking her, though on her account I drink the cup of death!\" Rejoined the druggist, \"O my son, and what art thou minded to do?\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"I am minded to return to the land of the Franks[FN#549] and enter the city of France and emperil myself there; come what may, loss of life or gain of life.\" Quoth the druggist, \"O my son, there is an old saw, 'Not always doth the crock escape the shock'; and if they did thee no hurt the first time, belike they will slay thee this time, more by token that they know thee now with full knowledge.\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"O my uncle, let me set out and be slain for the love of her straightway and not die of despair for her loss by slow torments.\" Now as Fate determined there was then a ship in port ready to sail, for its passengers had made an end of their affairs[FN#550] and the sailors had pulled up the mooring-stakes, when Nur al-Din embarked in her. So they shook out their canvas and relying on the Compassionate, put out to sea and sailed many days, with fair wind and weather, till behold, they fell in with certain of the Frank cruisers, which were scouring those waters and seizing upon all ships they saw, in their fear for the King's daughter from the Moslem corsairs: and as often as they made prize of a Moslem ship, they carried all her people to the King of France, who put them to death in fulfilment of the vow he had vowed on account of his daughter Miriam. So, seeing the ship wherein was Nur al-Din they boarded her and taking him and the rest of the company prisoners, to the number of an hundred Moslems, carried them to the King and set them between his hands. He bade cut their throats. Accordingly they slaughtered them all forthwith, one after another, till there was none left but Nur al-Din, whom the headsman had left to the last, in pity of his tender age and slender shape. When the King saw him, he knew him right well and said to him, \"Art thou not Nur al-Din, who was with us before?\" Said he, \"I was never with thee: and my name is not Nur al-Din, but Ibrahim.\" Rejoined the King; \"Thou liest, thou art Nur al-Din, he whom I gave to the ancient dame the Prioress, to help her in the service of the church.\" But Nur al-Din replied, \"O my lord, my name is Ibrahim.\" Quoth the King, \"Wait a while,\" and bade his knights fetch the old woman forthright, saying, \"When she cometh and seeth thee, she will know an thou be Nur al-Din or not.\" At this juncture, behold, in came the one-eyed Wazir who had married the Princess and kissing the earth before the King said to him, \"Know, O King, that the palace is finished; and thou knowest how I vowed to the Messiah that, when I had made an end of building it, I would cut thirty Moslems' throats before its doors; wherefore I am come to take them of thee, that I may sacrifice them and so fulfil my vow to the Messiah. They shall be at my charge, by way of loan, and whenas there come prisoners to my hands, I will give thee other thirty in lieu of them.\" Replied the King, 'By the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, I have but this one captive left!\" And he pointed to Nur al-Din, saying, \"Take him and slaughter him at this very moment and the rest I will send thee when there come to my hands other prisoners of the Moslems.\" Thereupon the one-eyed Wazir arose and took Nur al-Din and carried him to his palace, thinking to slaughter him on the threshold of the gate; but the painters said to him, \"O my lord, we have two days' painting yet to do: so bear with us and delay to cut the throat of this captive, till we have made an end of our work; haply by that time the rest of the thirty will come, so thou mayst despatch them all at one bout and accomplish thy vow in a single day.\" Thereupon the Wazir bade imprison Nur al-Din.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir bade imprison Nur al-Din, they carried him to the stables and left him there in chains, hungering and thirsting and making moan for himself; for indeed he saw death face to face. Now it fortuned, by the ordinance of Destiny and fore-ordained Fate, that the King had two stallions, own brothers,[FN#551] such as the Chosroe Kings might sigh in vain to possess themselves of one of them; they were called S\u00e1bik and L\u00e1hik[FN#552] and one of them was pure silvern white while the other was black as the darksome night. And all the Kings of the isles had said, \"Whoso stealeth us one of these stallions, we will give him all he seeketh of red gold and pearls and gems;\" but none could avail to steal them. Now one of them fell sick of a jaundice and there came a whiteness over his eyes;[FN#553] whereupon the King gathered together all the farriers in the city to treat him; but they all failed of his cure. Presently the Wazir came into the King; and finding him troubled because of the horse, thought to do away his concern and said to him, \"O King, give me the stallion and I will cure him,\" The King consented and caused carry the horse to the stable wherein Nur al-Din lay chained; but, when he missed his brother, he cried out with an exceeding great cry and neighed, so that he affrighted all the folk. The Wazir, seeing that he did thus but because he was parted from his brother, went to tell the King, who said, \"If this, which is but a beast, cannot brook to be parted from his brother, how should it be with those that have reason?\" And he bade his grooms take the other horse and put him with his brother in the Wazir's stables, saying, \"Tell the Minister that the two stallions be a gift from me to him, for the sake of my daughter Miriam.\" Nur al-Din was lying in the stable, chained and shackled, when they brought in the two stallions and he saw that one of them had a film over his eyes. Now he had some knowledge of horses and of the doctoring of their diseases; so he said to himself, \"This by Allah is my opportunity! I will go to the Wazir and lie to him, saying, 'I will heal thee this horse': then will I do with him somewhat that shall destroy his eyes, and he will slay me and I shall be at rest from this woe-full life.\" So he waited till the Wazir entered the stable, to look upon the steed, and said to him, \"O my lord, what will be my due, an I heal this horse, and make his eyes whole again?\" Replied the Wazir, \"As my head liveth, an thou cure him, I will spare thy life and give thee leave to crave a boon of me!\" And Nur al-Din said, \"O my lord, bid my hands be unbound!\" So the Wazir bade unbind him and he rose and taking virgin glass,[FN#554] brayed it and mixed it with unslaked lime and a menstruum of onion-juice. Then he applied the whole to the horse's eyes and bound them up, saying in himself, \"Now will his eyes be put out and they will slay me and I shall be at rest from this woe-full life.\" Then he passed the night with a heart free from the uncertainty[FN#555] of cark and care, humbling himself to Allah the Most High and saying, \"O Lord, in Thy knowledge is that which dispenseth with asking and craving!\" Now when the morning morrowed and the sun shone, the Wazir came to the stable and, loosing the bandage from the horse's eyes considered them and found them finer than before, by the ordinance of the King who openeth evermore. So he said to Nur al-Din, \"O Moslem, never in the world saw I the like of thee for the excellence of thy knowledge. By the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, thou makest me with wonder to admire, for all the farriers of our land have failed to heal this horse!\" Then he went up to Nur al-Din and, doing off his shackles with his own hand, clad him in a costly dress and made him his master of the Horse; and he appointed him stipends and allowances and lodged him in a story over the stables. So Nur al-Din abode awhile, eating and drinking and making merry and bidding and forbidding those who tended the horses; and whoso neglected or failed to fodder those tied up in the stable wherein was his service, he would thrown down and beat with grievous beating and lay him by the legs in bilboes of iron. Furthermore, he used every day to descend and visit the stallions and rub them down with his own hand, by reason of that which he knew of their value in the Wazir's eyes and his love for them; wherefore the Minister rejoiced in him with joy exceeding and his breast broadened and he was right glad, unknowing what was to be the issue of his case. Now in the new palace, which the one-eyed Wazir had bought for Princess Miriam, was a lattice-window overlooking his old house and the flat wherein Nur al-Din lodged. The Wazir had a daughter, a virgin of extreme loveliness, as she were a fleeing gazelle or a bending branchlet, and it chanced that she sat one day at the lattice aforesaid and behold, she heard Nur al-Din, singing and solacing himself under his sorrows by improvising these verses,\n\n\"O my Censor who wakest a-morn to see * The joys of life and its\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    jubilee!\nHad the fangs of Destiny bitten thee * In such bitter case thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    hadst pled this plea,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nBut from Fate's despight thou art safe this day;- * From her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    falsest fay and her crying 'Nay!'\nYet blame him not whom his woes waylay * Who distraught shall say\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    in his agony,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nExcuse such lovers in flight abhorr'd * Nor to Love's distreses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    thine aid afford:\nLest thy self be bound by same binding cord * And drink of Love's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bitterest injury.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nIn His service I wont as the days went by * With freest heart\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   through the nights to lie;\nNor tasted wake, nor of Love aught reckt * Ere my heart to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   subjection summoned he:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nNone weet of Love and his humbling wrong * Save those he sickened\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   so sore, so long,\nWho have lost their wits 'mid the lover-throng * Draining\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  bitterest cup by his hard decree:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nHow oft in Night's gloom he cause wake to rue * Lovers' eyne, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     from eyelids their sleep withdrew;\nTill tears to the railing of torrents grew, * Overflowing cheeks\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    , unconfined and free:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nHow many a man he has joyed to steep * In pain, and for pine hath\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     he plundered sleep,\u2014\nMade don garb of mourning the deepest deep * And even his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     dreaming forced to flee:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nHow oft sufferance fails me!

So she went to her and found her heavy at heart and her tears hurrying down her cheeks; and whilst she was weeping with sore weeping she recited these couplets,\n\n\"My life is gone but love-longings remain * And my breast is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    straitened with pine and pain:\nAnd my heart for parting to melt is fain * Yet hoping that union\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    will come again,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And join us in one who now are twain.\nStint your blame to him who in heart's your thrall * With the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wasted frame which his sorrows gall,\nNor with aim of arrow his heart appal * For parted lover is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   saddest of all,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And Love's cup of bitters is sweet to drain!\"\n\nQuoth the Wazir's daughter to her, \"What aileth thee, O Princess, to be thus straitened in breast and sorrowful of thought?\" Whereupon Miriam recalled the greatness of the delights that were past and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"I will bear in patience estrangement of friend * And on cheeks\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rail tears that like torrents wend:\nHaply Allah will solace my sorrow, for He * Neath the ribs of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     unease maketh ease at end.\"\n\nSaid the Wazir's daughter, \"O Princess, let not thy breast be straitened, but come with me straightway to the lattice; for there is with us in the stable[FN#556] a comely young man, slender of shape and sweet of speech, and meseemeth he is a parted lover.\" Miriam asked, \"And by what sign knowest thou that he is a parted lover?\"; and she answered, \"O Queen, I know it by his improvising odes and verses all watches of the night and tides of the day.\" Quoth the Princess in herself, \"If what the Wazir's daughter says be true, these are assuredly the traits of the baffled, the wretched Ali Nur al-Din. Would I knew if indeed he be the youth of whom she speaketh.\" At this thought, love-longing and distraction of passion redoubled on her and she rose at once and walking with the maiden to the lattice, looked down upon the stables, where she saw her love and lord Nur al-Din and fixing her eyes steadfastly upon him, knew him with the bestest knowledge of love, albeit he was sick, of the greatness of his affection for her and of the fire of passion, and the anguish of separation and yearning and distraction. Sore upon him was emaciation and he was improvising and saying,\n\n\"My heart is a thrall; my tears ne'er abate * And their rains the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     railing of clouds amate;\n'Twixt my weeping and watching and wanting love; * And whining\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   and pining for dearest mate.\nAh my burning heat, my desire, my lowe! * For the plagues that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    torture my heart are eight;\nAnd five upon five are in suite of them; * So stand and listen to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     all I state:\nMem'ry, madding thoughts, moaning languishment, * Stress of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  longing love, plight disconsolate;\nIn travail, affliction and strangerhood, * And annoy and joy when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    on her I wait.\nFail me patience and stay for engrossing care * And sorrows my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    suffering soul regrate.\nOn my heart the possession of passion grows * O who ask of what\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   fire in my heart's create,\nWhy my tears in vitals should kindle flame, * Burning heart with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ardours insatiate,\nKnow, I'm drowned in Deluge[FN#557] of tears and my soul * From\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Laz\u00e1-lowe fares to H\u00e1wiyah-goal.\"[FN#558]\n\nWhen the Princess Miriam beheld Nur al-Din and heard his loquence and verse and speech, she made certain that it was indeed her lord Nur al-Din; but she concealed her case from the Wazir's daughter and said to her, \"By the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, I thought not thou knewest of my sadness!\" Then she arose forthright and withdrawing from the window, returned to her own place, whilst the Wazir's daughter went to her own occupations. The Princess awaited patiently awhile, then returned to the window and sat there, gazing upon her beloved Nur al-Din and delighting her eyes with his beauty and inner and outer grace.

See vol. i. 83; where it applies to oranges and citrons.\n\n[FN#397] 'Andam = Dragon's blood: see vol. iii. 263.\n\n[FN#398] Arab. \"Jam\u00e1r,\" the palm-pith and cabbage, both eaten by\nArabs with sugar.\n\n[FN#399] Arab. \"Anw\u00e1r\" = lights, flowers (mostly yellow): hence the Moroccan \"N'w\u00e1r,\" with its usual abuse of Wakf or quiescence.\n\n[FN#400] Mr. Payne quotes Eugene From\u00e8ntin, \"Un Et\u00e9 dans le Sahara,\" Paris, 1857, p. 194. Apricot drying can be seen upon all the roofs at Damascus where, however, the season for each fruit is unpleasantly short, ending almost as soon as it begins.\n\n[FN#401] Arab. \"Jal\u00e1jal\" = small bells for falcons: in Port. cascaveis, whence our word.\n\n[FN#402] Khulanj\u00e1n. Sic all editions; but Khalanj, or Khaulanj adj. Khalanji, a tree with a strong-smelling wood which held in hand as a chaplet acts as perfume, as is probably intended. In Span. Arabic it is the Erica-wood. The \"Muhit\" tells us that is a tree parcel yellow and red growing in parts of India and China, its leaf is that of the Tamarisk (Tarf\u00e1); its flower is coloured red, yellow and white; it bears a grain like mustard-seed (Khardal) and of its wood they make porringers. Hence the poet sings,\n\n\"Yut 'amu 'l-shahdu f\u00ed 'l-jif\u00e1ni, wa yuska * Labanu 'l-Bukhti fi\nKus\u00e1'i 'l-Khalanji:\nHoney's served to them in platters for food; * Camels' milk in\nbowls of the Khalanj wood.\"\nThe pl. Khal\u00e1nij is used by Himy\u00e1n bin Kah\u00e1fah in this \"bayt\",\n\n\"Hatt\u00e1 iz\u00e1 m\u00e1 qazati 'l-Haw\u00e1ij\u00e1 * Wa malaat Hal\u00e1ba-h\u00e1\n'l-Khal\u00e1nij\u00e1:\nUntil she had done every work of hers * And with sweet milk had\nfilled the porringers.\"\n[FN#403] In text Al-Sh\u00e1'ir Al-Walah\u00e1n, vol. iii. 226.\n\n[FN#404] The orange I have said is the growth of India and the golden apples of the Hesperides were not oranges but probably golden nuggets. Captain Rolleston (Globe, Feb. 5, '84, on \"Morocco-Lixus\") identifies the Garden with the mouth of the Lixus River while M. Antichan would transfer it to the hideous and unwholesome Bissagos Archipelago.\n\n[FN#405] Arab. \"Iky\u00e1n,\" the living gold which is supposed to grow in the ground.\n\n[FN#406] For the Kubbad or Captain Shaddock's fruit see vol. ii. 310, where it is misprinted Kub\u00e1d.\n\n[FN#407] Full or Fill in Bresl. Edit. = Arabian jessamine or cork-tree ( ). The Bul. and Mac. Edits. read \"filfil\" = pepper or palm-fibre.\n\n[FN#408] Arab. \"Sumbul al-'Anbari\"; the former word having been introduced into England by patent medicines. \"Sumbul\" in Arab. and Pers. means the hyacinth, the spikenard or the Sign Virgo.\n\n[FN#409] Arab. \"Lis\u00e1n al-Hamal\" lit. = Lamb's tongue.\n\n[FN#410] See in Bresl. Edit. X, 221. Taif, a well-known town in the mountain region East of Meccah, and not in the Holy Land, was once famous for scented goat's leather. It is considered to be a \"fragment of Syria\" (Pilgrimage ii. 207) and derives its name = the circumambulator from its having circuited pilgrim-like round Ka'abah (Ibid.).\n\n[FN#411] Arab. \"Mikhaddah\" = cheek-pillow: Ital. guanciale. In\nBresl. Edit. Mudawwarah (a round cushion) Sinjabiyah (of Ermine).\nFor \"Mudawwarah\" see vol. iv. 135.\n\n[FN#412] \"Coffee\" is here evidently an anachronism and was probably inserted by the copyist. See vol. v. 169, for its first metnion. But \"Kahwah\" may have preserved its original meaning = strong old wine (vol. ii. 261); and the amount of wine-drinking and drunkenness proves that the coffee movement had not set in.\n\n[FN#413] i.e. they are welcome. In Marocco \"L\u00e1 baas\" means, \"I am pretty well\" (in health).\n\n[FN#414] The Rose (Ward) in Arab. is masculine, sounding to us most uncouth. But there is a fem. form Wardah = a single rose.\n\n[FN#415] Arab. \"Akm\u00e1m,\" pl. of Kumm, a sleeve, a petal. See vol. iv. 107 and supra p. 267. The Moslem woman will show any part of her person rather than her face, instinctively knowing that the latter may be recognised whereas the former cannot. The traveller in the outer East will see ludicrous situations in which the modest one runs away with hind parts bare and head and face carefully covered.\n\n[FN#416] Arab. \"Iky\u00e1n\" which Mr. Payne translates \"vegetable gold\" very picturesquely but not quite preserving the idea. See supra p. 272.\n\n[FN#417] It is the custom for fast youths, in Egypt, Syria, and elsewhere to stick small gold pieces, mere spangles of metal on the brows, cheeks and lips of the singing and dancing girls and the perspiration and mask of cosmetics make them adhere for a time till fresh movement shakes them off.\n\n[FN#418] See the same idea in vol. i. 132, and 349.\n\n[FN#419] \"They will ask thee concerning wine and casting of lots; say: 'In both are great sin and great advantages to mankind; but the sin of them both is greater than their advantage.'\" See Koran ii. 216. Mohammed seems to have made up his mind about drinking by slow degrees; and the Koranic law is by no means so strict as the Mullahs have made it. The prohibitions, revealed at widely different periods and varying in import and distinction, have been discussed by Al-Bayz\u00e1wi in his commentary on the above chapter. He says that the first revelation was in chapt. xvi. 69 but, as the passage was disregarded, Omar and others consulted the Apostle who replied to them in chapt. ii. 216. Then, as this also was unnoticed, came the final decision in chapt. v. 92, making wine and lots the work of Satan. Yet excuses are never wanting to the Moslem, he can drink Champagne and Cognac, both unknown in Mohammed's day and he can use wine and spirits medicinally, like sundry of ourselves, who turn up the nose of contempt at the idea of drinking for pleasure.\n\n[FN#420] i.e. a fair-faced cup-bearer. The lines have occurred before: so I quote Mr. Payne.\n\n[FN#421] It is the custom of the Arabs to call their cattle to water by whistling; not to whistle to them, as Europeans do, whilst making water.\n\n[FN#422] i.e. bewitching. See vol. i. 85. These incompatible metaphors are brought together by the Saj'a (prose rhyme) in\u2014\"iyah.\"\n\n[FN#423] Mesopotamian Christians, who still turn towards Jerusalem, face the West, instead of the East, as with Europeans: here the monk is so dazed that he does not know what to do.\n\n[FN#424] Arab. \"Bayt Sha'ar\" = a house of hair (tent) or a couplet of verse. Watad (a tentpeg) also is prosodical, a foot when the two first letters are \"moved\" (vowelled) and the last is jazmated (quiescent), e.g. Lakad. It is termed Majm\u00fa'a (united), as opposed to \"Mafr\u00fak\" (separated), e.g. Kabla, when the \"moved\" consonants are disjoined by a quiescent.\n\n[FN#425] Lit. standing on their heads, which sounds ludicrous enough in English, not in Arabic.\n\n[FN#426] These lines are in vol. iii. 251. I quote Mr. Payne who notes \"The bodies of Eastern women of the higher classes by dint of continual maceration, Esther-fashion, in aromatic oils and essences, would naturally become impregnated with the sweet scents of the cosmetics used.\"\n\n[FN#427] These lines occur in vol. i. 218: I quote Torrens for variety.\n\n[FN#428] So we speak of a \"female screw.\" The allusion is to the dove-tailing of the pieces. This personification of the lute has occurred before: but I solicit the reader's attention to it; it has a fulness of Oriental flavour all its own.\n\n[FN#429] I again solicit the reader's attention to the simplicity, the pathos and the beauty of this personification of the lute.\n\n[FN#430] \"They\" for she.\n\n[FN#431] The Arabs very justly make the \"'Andalib\" = nightingale, masculine.\n\n[FN#432] Anw\u00e1r = lights or flowers: See Night dccclxv. supra p. 270.\n\n[FN#433] These couplets have occurred in vol. i. 168; so I quote\nMr. Payne.\n[FN#434] i.e. You may have his soul but leave me his body: company with him in the next world and let me have him in this.\n\n[FN#435] Alluding to the Koranic (cxiii. 1.), \"I take refuge with the Lord of the Daybreak from the mischief of that which He hath created, etc.\" This is shown by the first line wherein occurs the Koranic word \"Gh\u00e1sik\" (cxiii. 3) which may mean the first darkness when it overspreadeth or the moon when it is eclipsed.\n\n[FN#436] \"Malak\" = level ground; also tract on the Nile sea.\nLane M.E. ii. 417, and Bruckhardt Nubia 482.\n\n[FN#437] This sentiment has often been repeated.\n\n[FN#438] The owl comes in because \"B\u00fam\" (pron. boom) rhymes with\nKayy\u00fam = the Eternal.\n\n[FN#439] For an incident like this see my Pilgrimmage (vol. i. 176). How true to nature the whole scene is; the fond mother excusing her boy and the practical father putting the excuse aside. European paternity, however, would probably exclaim, \"The beast's in liquor!\"\n\n[FN#440] In ancient times this seems to have been the universal and perhaps instinctive treatment of the hand that struck a father. By Nur al-Din's flight the divorce-oath became technically null and void for Taj al-Din had sworn to mutilate his son next morning.\n\n[FN#441] So Roderic Random and his companions \"sewed their money between the lining and the waistband of their breeches, except some loose silver for immediate expense on the road.\" For a description of these purses see Pilgrimage i. 37.\n\n[FN#442] Arab. Rashid (our Rosetta), a corruption of the Coptic\nTrashit; ever famous for the Stone.\n\n[FN#443] For a parallel passage in praise of Alexandria see vol. i. 290, etc. The editor or scribe was evidently an Egyptian.\n\n[FN#444] Arab. \"Saghr\" (Thagr), the opening of the lips showing the teeth. See vol. i. p. 156.\n\n[FN#445] Iskandariyah, the city of Iskandar or Alexander the Great, whose \"Soma\" was attractive to the Greeks as the corpse of the Prophet Daniel afterwards was to the Moslems. The choice of site, then occupied only by the pauper village of Rhacotis, is one proof of many that the Macedonian conqueror had the inspiration of genius.\n\n[FN#446] i.e. paid them down. See vol. i. 281; vol. ii. 145.\n\n[FN#447] Arab. \"Baltiyah,\" Sonnini's \"Bolti\" and N\u00e9buleux (because it is dozid-coloured when fried), the Labrus Niloticus from its labra or large fleshy lips. It lives on the \"leaves of Paradise\" hence the flesh is delicate and savoury and it is caught with the \u00e9pervier or sweep-net in the Nile, canals and pools.\n\n[FN#448] Arab. \"Liyyah,\" not a delicate comparison, but exceedingly apt besides rhyming to \"Baltiyah.\" The cauda of the \"five-quarter sheep, whose tails are so broad and thick that there is as much flesh upon them as upon a quarter of their body,\" must not be confounded with the lank appendage of our English muttons. See i. 25, Dr. Burnell's Linschoten (Hakluyt Soc. 1885).\n\n[FN#449] A variant occurs in vol. ix. 191.\n\n[FN#450] Arab. \"Tars Daylami,\" a small shield of bright metal.\n\n[FN#451] Arab. \"Kaukab al-durri,\" see Pilgrimage ii. 82.\n\n[FN#452] Arab. \"Kus\u00faf\" applied to the moon; Khus\u00faf being the solar eclipse.\n\n[FN#453] May Ab\u00fa Lahab's hands perish. . . and his wife be a bearer of faggots!\" Korau cxi. 184. The allusion is neat.\n\n[FN#454] Alluding to the Angels who shoot down the Jinn. See vol. i. 224. The index misprints \"Shib\u00e1h.\"\n\n[FN#455] For a similar scene see Ali Shar and Zumurrud, vol. iv. 187.\n\n[FN#456] i.e. of the girl whom as the sequel shows, her owner had promised not to sell without her consent. This was and is a common practice. See vol. iv. 192.\n\n[FN#457] These lines have occurred in vol. iii. p. 303. I quote\nMr. Payne.\n\n[FN#458] Alluding to the erectio et distensio penis which comes on before dawn in tropical lands and which does not denote any desire for women. Some Anglo-Indians term the symptom signum salutis, others a urine-proud pizzle.\n\n[FN#459] Arab. \"Mohtasib,\" in the Maghrib \"Mohtab,\" the officer charged with inspecting weights and measures and with punishing fraud in various ways such as nailing the cheat's ears to his shop's shutter, etc.\n\n[FN#460] Every where in the Moslem East the slave holds himself superior to the menial freeman, a fact which I would impress upon the several Anti-slavery Societies, honest men whose zeal mostly exceeds their knowledge, and whose energy their discretion.\n\n[FN#461] These lines, extended to three couplets, occur in vol. iv. 193. I quote Mr. Payne.\n\n[FN#462] \"At this examination (on Judgment Day) Mohammedans also believe that each person will have the book, wherein all the actions of his life are written, delivered to him; which books the righteous will receive in their right hand, and read with great pleasure and satisfaction; but the ungodly will be obliged to take them, against their wills, in their left (Koran xvii. xviii. lxix, and lxxxiv.), which will be bound behind their backs, their right hand being tied to their necks.\" Sale, Preliminary Discourse; Sect. iv.\n\n[FN#463] \"Whiteness\" (bay\u00e1z) also meaning lustre, honour.\n\n[FN#464] This again occurs in vol. iv. 194. So I quote Mr.\nPayne.\n\n[FN#465] Her impudence is intended to be that of a captive\nPrincess.\n\n[FN#466] i.e. bent groundwards.\n\n[FN#467] See vol. iv. 192. In Marocco Za'ar is applied to a man with fair skin, red hair and blue eyes (Gothic blood?) and the term is not complimentary as \"Sultan Yazid Za'ar.\"\n\n[FN#468] The lines have occurred before (vol. iv. 194). I quote Mr. Lane ii. 440. Both he and Mr. Payne have missed the point in \"ba'zu lay\u00e1li\" a certain night when his mistress had left him so lonely.\n\n[FN#469] Arab. \"Raat-hu.\" This apparently harmless word suggests one simlar in sound and meaning which gave some trouble in its day. Says Mohammed in the Koran (ii. 98) \"O ye who believe! say not (to the Apostle) R\u00e1'in\u00e1 (look at us) but Unzurn\u00e1 (regard us).\" \"R\u00e1'in\u00e1\" as pronounced in Hebrew means \"our bad one.\"\n\n[FN#470] By reason of its leanness.\n\n[FN#471] In the Mac. Edit. \"Fifty.\" For a scene which illustrates this mercantile transaction see my Pilgrimage i. 88, and its deduction. \"How often is it our fate, in the West as in the East, to see in bright eyes and to hear from rosy lips an implied, if not an expressed 'Why don't you buy me?' or, worse still, 'Why can't you buy me?'\"\n\n[FN#472] See vol. ii. 165 dragging or trailing the skirts = walking without the usual strut or swagger: here it means assuming the humble manners of a slave in presence of the master.\n\n[FN#473] This is the Moslem form of \"boycotting\": so amongst early Christians they refused to give one another God-speed. Amongst Hind\u00fas it takes the form of refusing \"Hukkah (pipe) and water\" which practically makes a man an outcast. In the text the old man expresses the popular contempt for those who borrow and who do not repay. He had evidently not read the essay of Elia on the professional borrower.\n\n[FN#474] See note p. 273.\n\n[FN#475] i.e. the best kind of camels.\n\n[FN#476] This first verse has occurred three times.\n\n[FN#477] Arab. \"Surayy\u00e1\" in Dictionaries a dim. of Sarw\u00e1 = moderately rich. It may either denote abundance of rain or a number of stars forming a constellation. Hence in Job (xxxviii. 31) it is called a heap (k\u00edmah).\n\n[FN#478] Pleiads in Gr. the Stars whereby men sail.\n\n[FN#479] This is the Eastern idea of the consequence of satisfactory coition which is supposed to be the very seal of love. Westerns have run to the other extreme.\n\n[FN#480] \"Al-R\u00edf\" simply means lowland: hence there is a R\u00edf in the Nile-delta. The word in Europe is applied chiefly to the Maroccan coast opposite Gibraltar (not, as is usually supposed the North-Western seaboard) where the Berber-Shilh\u00e1 race, so famous as the \"Rif pirates\" still closes the country to travellers.\n\n[FN#481] i.e. Upper Egypt.\n\n[FN#482] These local excellencies of coition are described jocosely rather than anthropologically.\n\n[FN#483] See vol. i. 223: I take from Torrens, p. 223.\n\n[FN#484] For the complete ablution obligatory after copulation before prayers can be said. See vol. vi. 199.\n\n[FN#485] Arab. \"Zunn\u00e1r,\" the Greek , for which, see vol. ii. 215.\n\n[FN#486] Miriam (Arabic Maryam), is a Christian name, in Moslem lands. Ab\u00fa Maryam \"Mary's father\" (says Motarrazi on Al-Hariri, Ass. of Alexandria) is a term of contempt, for men are called after sons (e.g. Abu Zayd), not after daughters. In more modern authors Abu Maryam is the name of ushers and lesser officials in the Kazi's court.\n\n[FN#487] This formality, so contrary to our Western familiarity after possession, is an especial sign of good breeding amongst Arabs and indeed all Eastern nations. It reminds us of the \"grand manner\" in Europe two hundred years ago, not a trace of which now remains.\n\n[FN#488] These lines are in Night i. ordered somewhat differently: so I quote Torrens (p. 14).\n\n[FN#489] i.e. to the return Sal\u00e1m\u2014\"And with thee be peace and the mercy of Allah and His blessings!\" See vol. ii. 146. The enslaved Princess had recognised her father's Wazir and knew that he could have but one object, which being a man of wit and her lord a \"raw laddie,\" he was sure to win.\n\n[FN#490] It is quite in Moslem manners for the bystanders to force the sale seeing a silly lad reject a most advantageous offer for sentimental reasons. And the owner of the article would be bound by their consent.\n\n[FN#491] Arab. \"Wa'llahi.\" \"Bi\" is the original particle of swearing, a Harf al-jarr (governing the genitive as Bi'll\u00e1hi) and suggesting the idea of adhesion: \"Wa\" (noting union) is its substitute in oath-formul\u00e6 and \"Ta\" takes the place of Wa as Ta'll\u00e1hi. The three-fold forms are combined in a great \"swear.\"\n\n[FN#492] i.e. of divorcing their own wives.\n\n[FN#493] These lines have occurred before: I quote Mr. Payne.\n\n[FN#494] These lines are in Night xxvi., vol. i. 275: I quote\nTorrens (p. 277), with a correction for \"when ere.\"\n\n[FN#495] This should be \"draws his senses from him as one pulls hair out of paste.\"\n\n[FN#496] R\u00e1ghib and Z\u00e1hid: see vol. v. 141.\n\n[FN#497] Carolus Magnus then held court in Paris; but the text evidently alludes to one of the port-cities of Provence as Marseille which we English will miscall Marseilles.\n\n[FN#498] Here the writer, not the young wife, speaks; but as a tale-teller he says \"hearer\"not \"reader.\"\n\n[FN#499] Kayraw\u00e1n, the Arab. form of the Greek Cyrene which has lately been opened to travellers and has now lost the mystery which enschrouded it. In Hafiz and the Persian poets it is the embodiment of remoteness and secrecy; as we till the last quarter century spoke of the \"deserts of Central Africa.\"\n\n[FN#500] Arab. \"'Inn\u00edn\": alluding to all forms of impotence, from dislike, natural deficiency or fascination, the favourite excuse. Easterns seldom attribute it to the true cause, weak action of the heart; but the Romans knew the truth when they described one of its symptoms as cold feet. \"Clino-pedalis, ad venerem invalidus, ab ea antiqua opinione, frigiditatem pedum concubituris admondum officere.\" Hence St. Francis and the bare-footed Friars. See Glossarium Eroticum Linguae Latin\u00e6, Parisiis, Dondey-Dupr\u00e9, MDCCCXXVI.\n\n[FN#501] I have noted the use of \"island\" for \"land\" in general. So in the European languages of the sixteenth century, insula was used for peninsula, e.g. Insula de Cori = the Corean peninsula.\n\n[FN#502] As has been noticed (vol. i. 333), the monocular is famed for mischief and men expect the mischief to come from his blinded eye.\n\n[FN#503] Here again we have a specimen of \"inverted speech\" (vol. ii. 265); abusive epithets intended for a high compliment, signifying that the man was a tyrant over rebels and a froward devil to the foe.\n\n[FN#504] Arab. \"Bab al-Bahr,\" see vol. iii. 281.\n\n[FN#505] Arab. \"Bat\u00e1rikah\" see vol. ii. 89. The Templars, Knights of Malta and other orders half ecclesiastic, half military suggested the application of the term.\n\n[FN#506] These lines have occurred in vol. i. 280\u2014I quote\nTorrens (p. 283).\n\n[FN#507] Maryam al-Husn containing a double entendre, \"O place of the white doe (R\u00edm) of beauty!\" The girl's name was Maryam the Arab. form of Mary, also applied to the B.V. by Eastern Christians. Hence a common name of Syrian women is \"Husn Maryam\" = (one endowed with the spiritual beauties of Mary: vol. iv. 87). I do not think that the name was \"manufactured by the Arab story-tellers after the pattern of their own names (e.g. Nur al-Din or Noureddin, light of the faith, Tajeddin, crown of faith, etc.) for the use of their imaginary Christian female characters.\"\n\n[FN#508] I may here remind readers that the B\u00e1n, which some Orientalists will write \"Ben,\" is a straight and graceful species of Moringa with plentiful and intensely green foliage.\n\n[FN#509] Arab. \"Am\u00fad al-Saw\u00e1ri\" = the Pillar of Masts, which is still the local name of Diocletian's column absurdly named by Europeans \"Pompey's Pillar.\"\n\n[FN#510] Arab. \"Batiyah,\" also used as a wine-jar (amphora), a flagon.\n\n[FN#511] Arab. \"Al-Kurs\u00e1n,\" evidently from the Ital. \"Corsaro,\" a runner. So the Port. \"Cabo Corso,\" which we have corrupted to \"Cape Coast Castle\" (Gulf of Guinea), means the Cape of Tacking.\n\n[FN#512] Arab. \"Ghur\u00e1b,\" which Europeans turn to \"Grab.\"\n\n[FN#513] Arab. \"Sayyib\" (Thayyib) a rare word: it mostly applies to a woman who leaves her husband after lying once with him.\n\n[FN#514] Arab. \"Bat\u00e1rikah:\" here meaning knights, leaders of armed men as in Night dccclxii., supra p. 256, it means \"monks.\"\n\n[FN#515] i.e. for the service of a temporal monarch.\n\n[FN#516] Arab. \"Sayr\" = a broad strip of leather still used by way of girdle amongst certain Christian religions in the East.\n\n[FN#517] Arab. \"Hal\u00e1wat al-Sal\u00e1mah,\" the sweetmeats offered to friends after returning from a journey or escaping sore peril. See vol. iv. 60.\n\n[FN#518] So Eginhardt was an Erzcapellan and belonged to the ghostly profession.\n\n[FN#519] These lines are in vols. iii. 258 and iv. 204. I quote\nMr. Payne.\n\n[FN#520] Arab. \"Fir\u00e1sah,\" lit. = skill in judging of horse flesh\n(Faras) and thence applied, like \"Kiy\u00e1fah,\" to physiognomy. One\nK\u00e1ri was the first to divine man's future by worldly signs\n(Al-Mayd\u00e1ni, Arab. prov. ii. 132) and the knowledge was\nhereditary in the tribe Mash\u00edj.\n\n[FN#521] Reported to be a \"Hadis\" or saying of Mohammed, to whom are attributed many such shrewd aphorisms, e.g. \"Allah defend us from the ire of the mild (tempered).\"\n\n[FN#522] These lines are in vol. i. 126. I quote Torrens (p. 120).\n\n[FN#523] These lines have occurred before. I quote Mr. Payne.\n\n[FN#524] Arab. \"Kh\u00e1k-b\u00e1k,\" an onomatopia like our flip-flap and a host of similar words. This profaning a Christian Church which contained the relics of the Virgin would hugely delight the coffee-house habitu\u00e9s, and the Egyptians would be equally flattered to hear that the son of a Cairene merchant had made the conquest of a Frankish Princess Royal.

This was e.g. Syria and the so-called \"Holy Land,\" not because, as is fondly asserted by Christians, al-Islam was forced upon them by the sword, but on account of its fulfilling a need, its supplying a higher belief, unity as opposed to plurality, and its preaching a more manly attitude of mind and a more sensible rule of conduct. Arabic still preserves a host of words special to the Christian creed; and many of them have been adopted by Moslems but with changes of signification.\n\n[FN#544] i.e. of things commanded and things prohibited.

It's where country, bluegrass, rockabilly, gospel, soul and rock and roll all started, and it claims more musicians per capita than any other state in the nation. Tennessee has contributed a great fortune to what American music is today, and the music falls into categories that follow the geography of the state.  The Gulf Coastal Plains in the west is where you'll hear rock, blues and soul.  The Nashville Basin in central Tennessee is where you'll hear the evolution of country music. The Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee Valley and Unaka Mountains region in the east is where you'll hear bluegrass and string band music. We'll cover all of them in this article, working from west to east.But before we get to these topics, here are some of the best tribute songs to the state itself:Johnny Cash's \"Tennessee\"Jimmy Martin's \"Tennessee\"John Hiatt's \"Tennessee Plates\"Jessica Andrews' \"James Dean In Tennessee\"Alabama's \"Dixieland Delight\"Brad Paisley's \"Southern Comfort Zone\"Steve Earle's \"Copperhead Road\"Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Wagon Wheel\"Dolly Parton's \"My Tennessee Mountain Home\"Music of the Gulf Coastal Plains -\nThe Elvis Presley Phenomenon\nElvis Presley was rock and roll\u2019s first big star, and his rise to fame marked a major change in American culture. He was a white man who sang country blues, r&b and rockabilly, all of it laced with a gospel sound. Perhaps even more than James Dean, he exuded a natural sexuality that shaped the thinking of American youth about what was cool. He was vilified by the older generation as vulgar and a bad influence on their children, but he was the beginning of a movement that changed our culture.\"Hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail.\" -  Bob DylanBorn on 8 January 1935 in East Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley was the son of Gladys and Vernon Presley, a seamstress and a truck driver. Elvis\u2019 twin brother, Jesse Garon, was stillborn, and Elvis grew up an only child. When he was three, his father served an eight-month prison term for writing bad checks, and afterward Vernon Presley\u2019s employment was erratic, keeping the family just above homelessness.\n\nIn 1945, Presley won second prize at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Diary Show for his rendition of Red Foley\u2019s \u201cOld Shep\u201d.  In 1948 the family moved to Memphis, and while attending L.C. Humes High School there, Presley spent much of his time in the black section of town, and especially on Beale Street watching and listening to bluesmen like Furry Lewis and B.B. King.\n\nAfter high school graduation in 1953, he thought he'd become a truck driver like his father, but he couldn't let go of his love of music. He recorded several songs at the Memphis Recording Service, a sideline business Sam Phillips set up in his Sun Records studio that allowed anyone to record a 10-inch acetate for four dollars.\nThe Sun Sessions\nSam Phillips noticed Presley, and called him in the  spring of 1954 to record a song for Sun Records. Although that session didn't go well, Phillips thought he'd found something in Presley: \u201ca white man with the Negro sound and the Negro feel\". Phillips worked with Presley to develop that style and brought guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black into the studio to rehearse with him for several months.  On the 5th of July 1954, they recorded \u201cBlue Moon of Kentucky\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s All Right, Mama\". The Memphis response was huge and it became his first local hit. Presley even made an appearance at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville on September 25th.Left to right: Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and (seated) Elvis Presley, 1955.  They all recorded for Sun Records at the same time.\nBy October 1954, Presley had debuted on the Louisiana Hayride, a popular radio program. He made his television debut on the television version of Hayride in March 1955. Meanwhile, \u201cGood Rockin\u2019 Tonight\u201d became a hit in Memphis.\nColonel Tom Parker entered Presley\u2019s life in 1955, helping Presley make some tour arrangements. Presley trusted Parker because Parker managed Hank Snow, and Presley's mother had great respect for Snow.  On May 13th, his song, \u201cBaby, Let\u2019s Play House\u201d was released and climbed to No. 10 on the Country and Western charts.\nElvis Hits the Big Time\nIn September 1955, Presley had his first No. 1 country hit, a version of Junior Parker\u2019s \u201cMystery Train\u201d. By early 1956, he was becoming a national star. He and Parker went to Nashville and recorded his first songs for RCA (including \u201cI Got a Woman\u201d and \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d. In January 1956, Presley made his national television debut with six consecutive appearances on the Dorsey Brothers\u2019 Stage Show. In March, Presley signed a management agreement with Parker giving Parker 25% of Presley\u2019s gross earnings, a deal that got even sweeter for Parker over time.\n\nThings started to snowball in 1956, when Parker got Presley appearances on the Milton Berle, Steve Allen, and Ed Sullivan TV shows. By August, he began filming his first movie. Love Me Tender was a hit and that sparked a series of hit singles: \u201cBlue Suede Shoes\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Cruel\u201d (with \u201cHound Dog\u201d on the B-side) and \u201cLove Me Tender\u201d.\n\nIn March 1957, Presley purchased Graceland, a former church that had been converted into a 23-room mansion. The next month, \u201cAll Shook Up\u201d began an eight-week run at No. 1.  He continued to make movies too, and they helped sell records like \u201c(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear\u201d and \u201cJailhouse Rock\u201d.\n\nIn December 1957, Presley received his draft notice, and entered the U.S. Army in March, 1958. He took leave just a few months later to be with his mother, who died the day after he  arrived home in Memphis. Presley served the remainder of his two year obligation to the Army and was discharged in March, 1960.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday of 1960, Priscilla Beaulie visited Presley at Graceland, and moved in soon after.  She was 14 at the time. They were married in May 1967, after Priscilla turned 21.  They had their first and only child nine months later.\"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been an Elvis, there wouldn't have been a Beatles.\" - John LennonThe Big Comeback\nMusic was changing fast by the mid 60s, and Presley started fading from the scene because of the \"British Invasion\" and the focus on live concerts by acts like The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who and others. Although he continued to make movies, they were received with less and less interest. Presley was becoming uncool and was in danger of becoming irrelevant.\n\nThe solution was a TV special, and it became his big come-back vehicle. It took the form of what later became the MTV Unplugged series. The idea started as a Christmas special, but people close to Presley argued against that, wanting something more engaging and personal. Director and producer Steve Binder noticed that Presley and his band members would blow-off steam during rehearsals by improvising blues and r&b throw aways. \"And that's when I really got the idea: Wouldn't it be great if I had a camera in here and they didn't know I was here?\".Presley was concerned about doing a live performance, but Binder built his confidence by doing several live audience rehearsals and using Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana. He also put Priscilla and several of Presley's friends in the audience. On 27 June 1968, Presley took the stage for his first live perfor-mance in seven years. The result was four one-hour live shows, taped at NBC's Burbank studios. Presley sat and jammed with band mates for two shows, and the second two were done two nights later as small room stand-ups. Those sessions are often referred to as \"The Burbank Sessions\".\n\nBut by the early 70s, Presley\u2019s personal life had become fodder for tabloid headlines. Priscilla left Elvis in February 1972, and on his birthday in 1973, he filed for divorce. Professionally, he reached his peak after the 1968 comeback. Although new hits were few (\"Suspicious Minds\", \"In the Ghetto\" and \"Promised Land\" are three of only a handful), he was more popular than ever and his fan worship was turning into a personality cult.  But he was plagued by self-doubt and poor management.  Starting in 1974, he repeatedly threatened to quit show business. He turned to drugs and became a virtual recluse. His abuse of prescription drugs increased during the last years of his life. Ironically, he remained devoutly spiritual, never drank alcohol, and publicly denounced drug use. He even  visited Richard Nixon at the White House to receive an honorary DEA badge.Towards the end, he gained weight, slept poorly, and his on-stage performances fell-off dramatically. Presley\u2019s last live performance was on 25 June 1977, in Indianapolis. At the time, he was preoccupied by the impending publication of one of the tell-all books that would make public his drug abuse and obsession with firearms. The book came out on August 12th and on 16 August 1977, Presley was discovered dead in the bathroom of his home by girlfriend Ginger Alden. He was just 42 at the time. His death was blamed on congestive heart failure, but later investigation revealed that drug abuse was at least part of the cause of his death.Rockabilly MusicRockabilly blends country and bluegrass with western swing, boogie-woogie and jump blues to deliver a hard-driving rhythm that's meant for dancing.  Rockabilly may have peaked in the mid 1950s, but it never really died.  There are many artists who continue the tradition today, like Imelda May, Brian Setzer and The Reverend Horton Heat.\n\nHere's a short list of some great rockabilly, arranged in chronological order from 1954 - 2014:Elvis Presley's \"Good Rockin' Tonight\"Jerry Lee Lewis' \"Whole Lotta Shakin'\"Chuck Berry's \"Little Queenie\"Eddie Cochran's \"Summertime Blues\"Wanda Jackson's \"Let's Have a Party\"The Del Lords' \"Shame on You\"Link Wray's \"Good Good Lovin'\"Willie Nile's \"She's So Cold\"John Melencamp's \"Little Pink Houses\"Keith Richards' \"I Could Have Stood You Up\"Steve Earle's \"Guitar Town\"Carl Perkins' \"Give Me Back My Job\"Imelda May's \"Johnny Got a Boom-Boom\"Devil's Daughters' \"Pass That Bottle\"Joshua Scott Jones' \"Honk if You're Tonky\"Brian Setzer's \"Let's Shake\"Memphis Blues and R&B MusicBeale Street in Memphis has lured Mississippi blues players for over a hundred years. The earliest arrivals included Gus Cannon, Furry Lewis, Tommy Johnson, Mississippi John Hurt and Memphis Minnie.  But it was W.C. Handy who made blues a noticed genre with songs like \"St. Louis Blues\" and \"Yellow Dog Blues\".\n\nAfter WW2, Memphis became a hot spot for blues and soul recording with artists like Rufus Thomas, Junior Parker, B.B. King, and Elvis Presley.  The mix of rural and urban musical traditions led to the creation of new blues styles, including the revolutionary new sounds of rhythm and blues and rock and roll. Riley King arrived from Indianola and soon became known as the \u201cBeale Street Blues Boy\u201d, a name he later shortened to B.B. King. Rufus Thomas helped King come into his own by featuring him in his shows.  Thomas and King were among the many Mississippi-born artists who recorded at Sam Phillips' Sun Records.\n\nThe Memphis music scene went through some tough times in the late 1960s and 70s; the place became a virtual ghost town.  But in 1966, Beale Street was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.  In the late 70s, the City of Memphis bought nearly every property on a three block stretch of what had been the heart of the historic Beale Street blues district. In 1977, an act of the U.S. Congress declared Beale Street as the \"Home of the Blues\".  The Beale Street Management Corporation rebuilt the entertainment district, and by the early 80s, a complete renovation was underway.  New clubs, restaurants and shops opened throughout the 80s and 90s, and by the turn of the century, Beale Street's comeback was complete.\nToday, Beale Street is bigger and better than ever.  The  blues traditions are promoted today by theCenter for Southern Folklore, the Memphis Blues Society and the Memphis-based Blues Foundation and their annual International Blues Competition and Blues Music Awards.\n\nHere are some good examples of Memphis blues and r&b:B.B. King's \"Everyday I Have the Blues\",\n\"Riding with the King\" and \"When Love Comes to Town\"Ry Cooder's \"Willie Brown Blues\"Howlin' Wolf's \"Smokestack Lightning\" and \"Killing Floor\"Bobby King & Terry Evan's \"Bald Head\" and \"Just a Little Bit\"John Lee Hooker's \"Mama, You Got a Daughter\", \"Crawlin' Kingsnake\" and \"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\"Little Milton's \"I Can't Quit You Baby\"Frank Stokes' \"Downtown Blues\"Junior Parker's \"Mystery Train\" and \"Drivin' Wheel\"Aretha Franklin's \"Respect\" and \"Chain of Fools\"Johnny Rivers' \"Memphis, Tennessee\"John Hiatt's \"Memphis in the Meantime\"Memphis Soul Music\nSoul music originated in Memphis. The roots of both blues and soul can be traced to the slave music of the 19th century, and both started a transformation with American urbanization after WW2. Soul became a  separate genre by 1960, and was brought to mainstream radio largely by the records made at Stax Records, Hi Records and Goldwax Records.  Stax Records was the most famous of the soul studios because of artists like Booker T. and the MG\u2019s, Sam and Dave, Isaac Hayes and Otis Redding.  The soul genre declined in popularity during the disco era of the late 70s, but your can still hear its influence in other genres like motown, r&b, hip-hop, and even country.\n\nHere are some good examples of Memphis soul music:Sam & Dave's \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\"Bobby Bland's\"(If Loving You is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\"Booker T & the MG's \"Green Onions\"Otis Redding's \"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay\" and\n\"These Arms of Mine\"Rufus Thomas' \"Walkin' the Dog\"Aretha Franklin's \"I Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You)\"James Carr's \"The Dark End of the Street\"This is page 1 of a 3 page article on the music of Tennessee.

And as a hip hopper \u2013 someone who has participated in, observed, criticized, and championed the culture for twenty years -- the aesthetic techniques and political assumptions of my work derive from the foundational tenets of hip hop as I understand them. Other writers of my generation have been similarly affected, in ways more complex, profound and subtle than have generally been recognized by readers, critics or the market. I want to do two things in this essay: discuss my lit hop aesthetic, and explore some of the ways lit hop has been misunderstood thus far, in hopes of preventing future works from being dissed with the ease, ignorance and prejudice that currently pervade the public discourse. I still maintain the increasingly-antiquated belief that literature can be transformative, socially and spiritually, and thus I don\u2019t want to see the work of the hip hop generation marginalized \u2013 not even for some probationary wait-outside-until-they-finally-get-it period. We don\u2019t have time for that. The literary establishment grows ever more elitist and alienating, and threatens to exclude not just a generation of writers, but a generation of readers.\n\nAny discussion of hip hop\u2019s original impulses tends to veer toward rhapsody, dogma, or both. As a well-intentioned but problematic strand of hip hop originalism emerges (2), it becomes common to hear hip hop talked about as if it is a cosmic revelation, bestowed upon Herc, Flash and Bam atop some Bronx-rooftop equivalent of Mount Sinai. Hip hop becomes a single-narrative in the retelling, a child sprung full-grown from the womb, five-elements-indivisible-for-which-we-stand. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to overstate the ingenuity, beauty, or political significance of hip hop practices at their purest, but I\u2019m wary of pretending hip hop aesthetics represent a radical departure from everything that came before them. The practices of b-boying, MCing, graffiti writing and deejaying had never been seen before, but the aesthetic concepts that underwrite them were updated, not invented. As with everything in hip hop, the key is how everything is put together, and the energy with which it is suffused.\n\nFor instance, one of the foundation elements I hold most dear, and try hardest to translate on the page, is the notion of intellectual democracy through collage: the idea that whatever\u2019s hot is worthy of adoption regardless of its location or context: a dope Monkees drumbreak is not penalized for the corniness of its origins, any more than a lackluster James Brown jam gets any run on reputation alone. Hip hop \u2013 as dramatized by the crate-digging of DJs, by breakers\u2019 assimilation of everything from Capoiera to cinema kung fu, by graff writers\u2019 blend-happy attitudes toward color and style \u2013 values a free-ranging, studious, and critical-minded approach to source material and, by extension, life.\n\nIn and of itself, there is nothing about this concept that is unique to hip hop. (3) It is the way the influences are made to cohere, the way the collage is put together sonically or visually, kinetically or verbally, that is original. Hip hop introduces a specific sense of interplay in revealing and obscuring the layers of the collage, takes a specific kind of pleasure in the mash-up refreaking of technologies and texts, understands history as something to backspin and cut up and cover with fingerprints in a particular kind of way.\n\nIt is this energy that makes hip hop\u2019s aesthetic principles its own: what\u2019s unique is not the reclamation of public space on behalf of marginalized peoples and purposes, but the audacious brilliance of jimmying open lamp-posts to steal electricity to run sound systems, thus literally reclaiming power from a city that had denied it. Not the notion of public expression through guerilla art, but the specific genius of taking over the New York Transit System and engaging the same city that had cut school funding for arts programs in a $250 million subterranean war over art, ownership and access. Not just the impulse to think interdisciplinarily, but the instinct to do so, hardwired in hip hoppers in a way no previous generation can claim and made manifest in every hip hop artform. Not just innovation-as-mandate, a feature of many artistic movements, but the specific critical skills and frenetic learning curve that hip hoppers taught themselves -- the way train pieces and rhymes and musical productions became fodder for what was to come next at the exact moment of their completion, went from innovative to passe in the blink of an eye because of the sheer intellectual force of every kid clocking and biting and scheming on how to take it one step further, chop those wildstyle letter-segments or that rhyme scheme or that drum loop just a little bit\u2026 flyer.\nI like to think of a novel in terms of a mix board. Harry Allen once claimed that Public Enemy\u2019s seminal 1988 album It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back was the first rap record to make use of all forty-eight channels: on any given song, layers of musical and vocal samples overlap and abutt each other, swirling in and out of the mix at the glide of a fader. The listener\u2019s degree of appreciation for the collage is related (probably directly, possibly inversely (4), and maybe in some other way) to his or her degree of familiarity with the elements of the collage. Resonances, echoes, homages and subversions (5) bubble up: a Wattstax vocal sample evokes a historical moment of black unity in the aftermath of chaos; a James Brown break summons up not just the Godfather of Soul but the long history of the song\u2019s hip hop usage; an old-school rap snippet throws a headnod to a forgotten predecessor; a Funkadelic loop reminds us that funkin\u2019 on the one has always been a political statement. On top, Chuck D builds a vocal collage of his own, paraphrasing his contemporary Ced Gee before embarking on a bob-and-weave narrative that touches on racial profiling, the teachings of Farrakan, and Public Enemy\u2019s mission, as well as laying down a double-entendre that he himself will mine as a sample later on this very album... and this is all in the first verse of \u201cBring the Noise.\u201d\n\nMy goal is to write fiction that works the same way: that builds layers of reference and meaning and plot and dialogue and character, tweaks the levels of the mix for smooth reading but still allows you to dissect the individual elements and analyze them. If you read the three-page prologue of my novel Angry Black White Boy and you\u2019re familiar with Kool Keith, Malcolm X, Michael Jackson, Winston Churchill, old GI Joe commercials, Martin Luther King, Jr., Amiri Baraka, The Doors, Brown vs. The Board of Education, Nation of Gods and Earths numerology, Native Son, Eyes on the Prize, Eldridge Cleaver, Red Rodney and Bernhard Goetz -- some of them mentioned, some referenced, others sampled -- you\u2019ll appreciate the text (and the character speaking) on one level. If not, it should still work. But differently. If you were so inclined, you could drop out everything but the samples and graph their meanings and connections the same way you might drop everything on the PE mixboard but the drums, and just peep those. Some samples might be deliberately forefronted; others, in the tradition of DJs steaming off record labels to protect their secret weapons and producers making artful chops to avoid illegal-useage litigation, are obscured.\n\nSampling is more than an authorial technique in my work. It is also a way to reveal character, and map a novel\u2019s worldview: because ABWB is populated by hip hoppers, conversations and actions are studded with a range of references and echoes, flips and homages. Conversant with race literature and real-life struggle, the characters are able to position themselves in relation to these traditons, both playfully and seriously. The events of their lives are bound together by the same internal logic, and with the same sense of tension, that binds a bunch of disparate sounds into a coherent musical composition. They make decisions to re-enact historical moments (like commandeering the corner of 125th and Lenox Avenue, a la Malcolm X and the title of Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s first album), adopt and adapt and reject roles like abolitionist John Brown, Native Son\u2019s Bigger Thomas and Crime and Punishment\u2019s Raskolnikov, debate each other in shorthand because a shared culture has given them a common language. They act with the freewheeling, undisciplined vigor and all-embracing attitude of hip hop: natural historians, but only for eight bars at a time. Not the entire breadth and context: just the party-rocking shit. Lest I sound too celebratory about it, I should also say that this mindstate underwrites both their success and their failure. They face the same void in leadership that hip hoppers did as we came of age in the eighties, step into that void as best they can, and do just as brilliant and terrible a job of it.\n\nUltimately, the notion of literary hip hop aesthetics begs the question of form versus content. Can a novel whose plot has nothing to do with hip hop culture -- one that takes place a hundred years before Herc was born, or is populated by people with no relationship to hip hop whatsoever -- take up the aesthetic and political concerns of the culture and thus be lit hop? My answer would be yes; the jazz literature (6) of Langston Hughes, Amiri Baraka or Yusef Komunyaakaa does not have to take jazz as its subject, any more than the jazz painting of Romare Bearden or Jacob Lawrence. Rather, they share techniques with the music. They may have produced iconic images that, in turn, enhanced the popular understanding of jazz; they may even have lionized their musical muses. But such things are only an incidental part of their total work; their genius was not in writing about jazz, but in writing jazz.\n\nIn some ways, the mark of success for lit hop will be when a book that isn\u2019t about hip hop is understood as beholden to the aesthetics of the culture. That will mean we\u2019ve surgeoned lit hop from the crass market concerns that now define it, and enforced a fuller understanding of the expansive ways in which a literature of hip hop can exist, and flourish.\n\nAs it now stands, a \u201dhip hop novel\u201d denotes any book in which words usually ending in -er instead terminate in -a, any book containing characters who are young, urban and black or at least two out of the three, any book aimed at a demographic group more notorious for purchasing CDs. As soon as the notion of using hip hop to market literature dawned, belatedly, on the publishing industry, the phrase started getting tossed around without much rigor \u2013 and thus, many writers I know cringe at the prospect of being termed \u201chip hop novelists.\u201d\n\nThe literary world isn\u2019t just late to the party in co-opting hip hop to move product; it is equally tardy in throwing off the institutional influence of old-guard critics (some of them quite young) determined to act as cultural gatekeepers. To them, literature is the last bastion of high culture, and hip hop a corrupting force. (7)\n\nI should say what they think of as hip hop. Snobbery, racism and the sheer desire to maintain a position of cultural centrality are all factors in the critical resistance to lit hop, but benign ignorance is in play, too. If I understood hip hop not as a culture rooted in poetic, dexterous, inventive, courageous resistance to oppression, but rather only through its most visible, consumable, mysogynistic manifestations, I wouldn\u2019t want that shit infesting literature either. (8)\n\nHip hop novelists don\u2019t need a free pass, merely a critical infrastructure that approaches lit hop as it would any other genre: on its own terms, with an eye toward understanding what is being attempted. Some of the most pointed and common critical complaints about lit hop stem from resistance to hip hop paradigms. Ecstatic genre-crossing and cultural multi-literacy have been fundamental since the first time Herc blended a reggae record with a funk break, then threw a TV jingle over that, but literary mash-ups are still a surefire way to get dissed -- to say nothing of characters capable of both teaching the seminar and rocking the boulevard. The number of times I\u2019ve been told some variation of \u201ca drug dealer would never be as articulate as the one in your book\u201d by writing teachers and reviewers alike is surpassed only by the number of young writing students who have contacted me to complain about being on the receiving end of the same kinds of comments. What is behind this incredulousness at the multiple literacies of the hip hop generation? And why are book reviewers hanging out with such inarticulate drug dealers?\n\nFor a compact seminar on pervasive anti-lit hop prejudices, peep this 1999 New York Times Book Review (9) of Victor Lavalle\u2019s debut collection of stories, Slapboxing With Jesus. Reviewer Ray Sawhill begins by speculating that Lavalle\u2019s ambition seems to be \u201cto make the book approximate an hour or two of rap videos\u201d (huh?), then describes the book as \u201c...full of peculiarities of punctuation and phrasing, creat[ing] effects impressively close to the scratch-and-sample effects of rap... A case could be made that LaValle has found a way to give linguistic form to the brain patterns of media-soaked, post-PC street youth. But readers less taken by the idea that literature should come out of a boombox are likely find the book tediously juvenile.\u201d\n\nNote, first, the laziness of Sawhill\u2019s take on hip hop: his unexplicated video reference employs an obtuse critical shorthand, leaving the reader to speculate on just what goes on in an hour or two of rap videos, and how Lavalle might translate the sensibility of a three-minute clip into a collection of stories. The only thing clear about the sentence is that Sawhill thinks rap videos are all the same, and approximating them is a bad idea. The reader is expected to agree; at work here is a tacit disdain that necessitates no further explanation. Any evidence in support of the ridiculous assertion that video-versimilitude is Lavalle\u2019s goal to begin with goes similarly uncited.\n\nSawhill then belittles scratches and samples as \u2018effects,\u2019 when they are, rather, the musical bedrock of contemporary hip hop production. And note the phrase \u2018peculiarities of punctuation and phrasing:\u2019 Lavalle\u2019s prose is being dissed for its departures from standard English. Although \u201ca case could be made\u201d that the author\u2019s language is evocative of the brain patterns of \u2018street youth\u2019 (whatever that means -- none of Lavalle\u2019s characters are homeless), Sawhill certainly can\u2019t be bothered to make that case himself, or pretend he thinks Lavalle\u2019s goal in presenting such characters is valuable. Sawhill\u2019s problem is not with Lavalle\u2019s execution (his scratch-and-sample effects, after all, come \u201cimpressively close\u201d to the real thing), but with the unworthiness of speaking for, like, or about the hip hop generation.\n\nThe parting-shot image of literature spewing from a boombox makes this clear. Putting aside for a moment the utter inaccuracy of this description of Lavalle\u2019s quiet, understated storytelling, what is the image intended to connote? Literature from a boombox -- abrasive, confrontational, noise pollution... rap. One can almost feel the wind as Sawhill shuts the gate in Lavalle\u2019s face. This is literature -- there\u2019s no place for boomboxes, street youth, or nonstandard phrasing. Go wait outside with your hoodlum friends, Lavalle.\nBehind such gatekeeping is a deep discomfort not only with the amplification of marginalized voices (and what they might say if allowed to speak) but with the way hip hop drags American race-hypocrisy and class-complacency out of the catacombs, kicking and screaming, and throws them on the examination table. It\u2019s true that the mainstream press rewards books that address race and class, but only if they do so within certain parameters.\n\nThose parameters, to quote my editor, Chris Jackson (10) are \u201cgive us our lesson and go.\u201d Tell us racism is tragic, or slavery was an inhumane institution, and then get the fuck outta here. Give it to us clean, simple, unambiguous, so we know how to feel: empathetic, indignant, disturbed. Don\u2019t start mucking around with satire, don\u2019t abandon gravitas or cross genres or switch tones on us. You start blurring right and wrong, budddy, and it\u2019s all over.\n\nThe New York Times Book Review of Angry Black White Boy delineates the location of these parameters quite well. ABWB is a satire about an Afrocentric white hip hopper who starts robbing white people, becomes famous, and ends up orchestrating a disastrous National Day of Apology on which whites are supposed to follow Malcolm X\u2019s rhetorical advice and apologize to blacks. The reviewer, Nathaniel Rich (Frank\u2019s kid), really liked the most straight-forward parts of the book -- a series of chapters set in 1889 that detail the near-lynching of the last black player in about-to-be-segregated major league baseball. Those scenes, according to Rich \u201ccapture vividly the inhuman sadism inherent in racial violence,\u201d just the kind of unambiguous \u201clesson\u201d Race Novels are celebrated for imparting (it\u2019s also a tiny part of what those chapters were intended to do, but lemme not get into all that).\n\nABWB\u2019s modern-day storyline, meanwhile, Rich faults because \u201cdespite the complexity of his subject, Mansbach\u2019s tone is distractingly breezy and frivolous,\u201d and because it \u201cunfolds in jarring bursts of fantasy... Mansbach's shrewd observations of race in America are too often obscured by... bizarrely whimsical excursions that are ultimately too fanciful to unnerve.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m far from imapartial on this one, and it\u2019s certainly possible that Rich is right. He seems unwilling, though, to accept the notion that a novel purporting to grapple with race can depart from the kind of earnestness he found so compelling in the 1889 sections. The breeziness Rich found so distracting is a narrative voice calibrated to reflect the young, intelligent hip hoppers who are ABWB\u2019s main characters -- and who, as members of a generation whose race politics were forged equally in the flames of the Rodney King riots and the fiery funk of Chuck D\u2019s voice, possess an instinctive, interdisciplinary comfort with both the absurdity and horror of race in America. Satire, surrealism, absurdity, dream-sequences in which Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard takes over Seinfeld, The Cosby Show and Beverly Hills 90210 -- such tactics comprise an attempt to make race approachable, to reflect its complexity, and to draw on the raucous, subversive legacy of race novels like George Schuyler\u2019s Black No More, Ishmael Reed\u2019s Flight to Canada, and Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man. If Angry Black White Boy doesn\u2019t manage to pull that off, so be it. But Rich seems antagonistic to the very approach. This is race literature -- there\u2019s no place for breeziness or satire. Take your jarring bursts of fantasy and wait outside with your homies until you learn to limit yourself to being unnerving, Mansbach.\nI could run down a further litany of critical hostilities, misreads, and belittlements -- from the NYTBR\u2019s characterization of Danyel Smith\u2019s novel More Like Wrestling as \u201csave-the-drama-for-mama fiction\u201d (would they take that tone if a sixty-year-old white writer from Connecticut had penned the tale?) to Kirkus Reviews\u2019 standard practice of adopting faux-ebonics when reviewing so-called \u201curban novels.\u201d As I write this, the NYTBR has just published a review of T Cooper\u2019s novel Lipshitz Six, which contains the following line, seemingly written just for this essay: \u201cWould a published novelist, even one who has taken to impersonating a rap star, really write lines like \u2018I know I can spit an ill rhyme\u2019?\u201d\n\nBut you get the point. And anyway, there is more at stake than simply offering critics a roadmap, or enfranchising hip hop writers. If lit hop bumrushes the show, it threatens to break apart one of the most psychotically hegemonic conversations in the literary world: The State of the Novel.\n\nRight now, that conversation looks like this: every few years, a writer hungry for success and frustrated with his lack of popular acclaim publishes an essay (typically in the pages of Harpers\u2019) lambasting whatever dominant set of aesthetics -- in stark contrast to his own -- seems to be capturing the hearts and minds of readers. In so doing, said writer (most recently Ben Marcus, and before that Jonathan Franzen) knocks down a figurehead or two, gets people buzzing for a couple of weeks, and sets high expectations for his own next work: with a framework in place, readers can now anticipate and later understand just how the writer will flip the paradigm upside-down. Ten years later, this writer, and this paradigm, will again be flipped.\n\nThis perpetual king-killing accounts for only two paradigm positions: rightside-up and upside-down. It enforces the notion of literary binaries -- experimental vs. mainstream, accessible vs. alienating -- and excludes from the conversation any writer or reader bored by the narrowness of such strictures. It also tends to privilege a set of concerns and aesthetics that dovetails neatly with a white, male, (over)educated writership. (11) In the tradition of the New York Times Magazine praising the new literary journal N+1 for being bold enough to editorialize that 'it's time to say what we mean,' (12) the writers who pen these essays are having a discussion about aesthetics and literary mores that excludes the people doing some of the bravest and boldest work.\n\nPerhaps 'saying what we mean' is a revolutionary idea for a generation that, if you believe the New York Times, has grown up in the throes of cynicism, irony, and disaffection. But these are tremendous luxuries, and in truth, the dominant artforms of my generation have never embraced them. Hip hop is a lot of things, but it has never been ironic. Nihilistic, yes, but not cynical. It has always said what it means. The people who pioneered hip hop and chaperoned it to global prominence have been too affected -- by poverty, by discrimmination, by incarceration, by Reaganomics, by crack, by the struggle to survive and create -- to cultivate the disaffect for which our generation is unfairly known.\n\nSelf-awareness -- the oft-lamented paralyzing postmodern condition of knowing that one is producing art, knowing that it\u2019s all been said and done before, fearing that in forging ahead you risk redundancy, irrelevance, pretention -- has not produced paralysis in hip hoppers. Perhaps our immunity from this generational malaise stems from hip hop\u2019s love of collaging, sampling, dislocating and reconfiguring: the more that\u2019s been said and done already, the more we have to play with. Where others see defeat, we find liberation, empowerment.\n\nThis is the high culture/low culture dichotomy in full effect: despite inventing one of the most brazen, earnest and political artforms on the books, my generation is defined by the tortured self-aware pomo aesthetic of a few writers, filmmakers and musicians. Then, when the camps that cultivated and embraced disaffection begin to reconsider it, they get props for doing so. This is the 21st century equivalent of coronating Paul Whiteman the King of Jazz while Armstrong and Ellington and Basie wait outside: you only find the Voice Of A Generation where you look for it.\n\n(1) The jury\u2019s still out on whether this contraction of \u2018hip hop literature\u2019 is corny, but we\u2019ll go with it for now, because it\u2019s mad short.\n(2) The hip hop version of Justice Scalia\u2019s notorious judicial philosophy, hip hop originalism deifies the founding fathers, insists on strict fidelity to their supposed intentions, and treats dissenters as heretics.\n\n(3) The notion of hip hop as a structural metaphor for democracy, for instance, has also been applied to jazz and baseball, two other quintessentially American inventions.\n\n(4) For instance, if you\u2019d never heard Diana Ross, you might hear \u201cMo Money, Mo Problems\u201d and think Diddy was the greatest musical mind of his generation.\n\n(5) My favorite example of sample-as-subversion is the Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s first song, \u201cParty and Bullshit,\u201d in which a line from The Last Poets\u2019 \u201cWhen The Revolution Comes\u201d is truncated in such a way that Jalal\u2019s critique of folks too caught up in hedonism to fight for change becomes a celebration of that hedonism.\n\n(6) If jazz were hip hop, (and it\u2019s a common enough metaphor) it would be roughly 1935, and we\u2019d be in the middle of the swing era. Charlie Parker would be a teenager in Kansas City, Miles Davis a nine-year-old in East St. Louis. John Coltrane wouldn\u2019t be jamming with Thelonious Monk at the Five Spot for another twenty years. Bebop, modal, free and fusion would all be things of the future. All this should be reassuring to those of us who worry that hip hop peaked in 1988 and has increasingly been on some bullshit ever since -- as should the fact that critics were pronouncing jazz dead as early as the 1930s. None of this is reassuring in the least, of course. But it should be.\n\n(7) Do we need their approval, or would it be a death knell? That\u2019s an eternal conversation, and I don\u2019t want to spend too much time on it. My investment isn\u2019t in winning over critics, per se, but on the mainstream audiences their support -- or even respect -- would help us access. Those audiences need to hear what we have to say, and through us understand hip hop as something deeper than what they flip past on MTV.\n\n(8) This seems like a good time to mention so-called \u2018street-lit,\u2019 the usually self-published books available on your finer 125th St card tables, because so much of it seems intent on embodying this exact paradigm. While I\u2019m down with anything that encourages kids to read, or allows folks to get paid for writing, it seems to me that the bulk of these books are \u2013 from a literary perspective \u2013 garbage. If we indulge the increasingly tired \u2018hip hop vs. rap\u2019 polarity, these books would be rap: chocked with brand names, populated by blinged out thugs and and video-vixen-style women, and plagued by shallow characters and bad storytelling.\n\n(9) There are two reasons I\u2019m drawing so heavily on the NTYBR. First, because as our national \u201cnewspaper of record,\u201d it wields more influence on a book\u2019s fate than any other review source. And second, because it publishes a lot of egregiously bigoted reviews.\n\n(10) Who, in the interest of full disclosure, is also Victor Lavalle\u2019s editor and Danyel Smith\u2019s. He also holds the distinction of being the only hip hop generation black male Senior Editor in big publishing. Yes. The only one.\n\n(11) On paper, I\u2019m totally one of those guys -- a white Jewish novelist with an MFA from Columbia. I\u2019ve never activated my membership in that club, though. Nor have I ever made a conscious decision not to; I\u2019ve just always been a hip hopper, and the sensibilities, artistically and politically, that followed from that have dictated my path since I was eleven, memorizing Criminal Minded and beginning to understand the subjectivity of whiteness, as hip hop was won't to make a whiteboy do back then. I\u2019m relegating all this to a footnote because I think us white folks tend to centralize ourselves and our issues way too much when we do deign to talk about race or privilege or access. Is it the role of yet another overeducated white guy to point out the elitism of the State of the Novel convo? I think it can be, for the same reason I wrote Angry Black White Boy: because I can\u2019t be labeled as just another complainer speaking from bitterness and self-interest, which is the way people of color are often tagged, and dismissed. To me, this is the proper use of privilege: to say things for which people with less privilege might face knee-jerk recrimination.\n\n(12) The author of this editorial is Keith Gessen.

The only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when we have to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt because he has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even think about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of these locks you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff is safe.\n\n\nGYM LOCKER ROOM\n\nKRAMER: Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.\n\nGEORGE: Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.\nJERRY: I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.\n\nGEORGE: Oh I'm a chucker.\n\nJERRY: That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.\n\nGEORGE: I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!\n\nJERRY: You chuck.\n\nGEROGE: Kramer am I a chucker?\n\nKRAMER: You're a chucker.\n\nGEORGE: All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?\n\nJERRY: Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.\n\nKRAMER: Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.\n\nJERRY: Believe me I didn't see anything.\n\nKRAMER: Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?\n\nJERRY: No, did you?\nKRAMER: Yeah, I snuck a peak.\n\nJERRY: Why?\n\nKRAMER: Why not? hey what about you George?\n\nGEORGE: yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.\n\nJERRY: I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.\n\nKRAMER: Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.\n\nJERRY: All right\n\nKRAMER: Have a good one.\n\nJERRY: All right\n\nGEORGE: See ya.\n\n(Kramer exits)\n\nGEORGE: look at this guy.

Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.\n\nGEORGE: ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension\n\nJERRY: Hey, should we say something to him?\n\nGEORGE: Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.\n\nJERRY: well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.\n\nGEORGE: He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.\n\nJERRY: So?\n\nGEORGE: What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!\n\nJERRY: I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.\n\nGEORGE: What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo.

You are one of my favorite ball players of all time\n\nGEORGE: Mine too.\n\nKEITH: I love that bit about Jimmy Olson\n\nJERRY: Thank you.\n\nGEORGE: You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...\n\nKEITH: (to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?\n\nJERRY: I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.\n\nGEORGE: But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.\n\nKEITH: You know, I live on the East Side.\n\nJERRY: I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.\n\nKEITH: or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee\n\nJERRY: Oh. that would be great.\n\nGEORGE: Uh, it's only a matter of time.\n\nKEITH: Who's this chucker?\n\nMONKS\n\nJERRY: It's been three days and he hasn't called.\n\nELAINE: Well maybe you should call him.\n\nJERRY: I can't ... I can't\n\nELAINE: Why not?\n\nJERRY: I don't know. I just feel he should call me.\n\nELAINE: What's the difference?\n\nJERRY: You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.\n\nELAINE: Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.\n\nJERRY: I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?\n\nELAINE: I'm sorry honey.\n\nJERRY: I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along.

I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.\n\nELAINE: Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.\n\nJERRY: Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!\n\nELAINE: You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?\n\nJERRY: Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?\n\nELAINE: Why don't you just go ahead and call him?\n\nJERRY: I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?\n\nELAINE: Just ask him if he wants a to get together.\n\nJERRY: For what dinner?\n\nELAINE: Dinner's good.\n\nJERRY: Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? ..

Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.\n\nKRAMER: Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, \" Nice game pretty boy.\". Keith continued past us up the ramp.\n\nNEWMAN: A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.\n\nELAINE: What was it?\n\nKRAMER: He spit on us.... and I screamed out, \"I'm hit!\"\n\nNEWMAN: Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.\n\nELAINE: Wow! What a story.\n\nJERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.\n\nJERRY: Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.\n\n\nNEWMAN: Well that's the way it happened.\n\nJERRY: What happened to your head when you got hit?\n\nKRAMER: Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left\n\nJERRY: Again\n\nKRAMER: Back and to the left\n\nJERRY: Back and to the left Back and to the left\n\nELAINE: So, what are you saying?\n\nJERRY: I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.\n\nELAINE: So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.\n\nJERRY: But that is not what they would have you believe.\n\nNEWMAN: I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)\n\nKRAMER: Wait, wait, (Exits)\n\nJERRY: The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.\n\n(George runs in)\n\nGEORGE: (Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?\n\nJERRY: No. What happened to you?\n\nGEORGE: Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer \"Vandelay Industries\".\n\nJERRY: I'm Vandelay Industries?\n\nGEORGE: Right.\n\nJERRY: And what is that?\n\nGEORGE: You're in latex\n\nJERRY: Latex? And what do I do with latex?\n\nGEORGE: Ya manufacture it.\n\nELAINE: Here in this little apartment?\n\nJERRY: And what do I say about you?\n\nGEORGE: You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.\n\nJERRY: I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?\n\nGEORGE: Right.\n\nJERRY: I don't think so. Why would I do that?\n\nGEORGE: Because I asked you to.\n\nJERRY: If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.\n\n(Buzzer)\n\nJERRY: Yeah.\n\nKRAMER: It's Keith.\n\nJERRY: All right we're coming down.\n\nGEORGE: KEITH HERNANDEZ:?\n\nJERRY: Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.\n\nGEORGE: Where are you goin?\n\nELAINE: He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter.

iron.\n\n\u201cI wish you would manage the time to come in and talk with me about your daughter.  I\u2019m sure you can help me understand her.  She\u2019s a youngster who needs help and whom I\u2019m deeply interested in helping.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho needs help,\u201d\u2026Even if I came, what good would it do?  You think because I am her mother I have a key, or that in some way you could use me as a key?  She has lived for nineteen years.  There is all that life that has happened outside of me, beyond me.\n\nAnd when is there time to remember, to sift, to weigh, to estimate, to total?  I will start and there will be an interruption and I will have to gather it all together again.  Or I will become engulfed with all I did or did not do, with what should have been and what cannot be helped.\n\nShe was a beautiful baby.  The first and only one if our five that was beautiful at birth.  You do not guess how new and uneasy her tenancy in her now-loveiiness.  You did not know her all those years she was thought homely, or see her poring over her baby pictures, making me tell her over and over how beautiful she had been \u2013 and would be, I would tell her \u2013 and was now, to the seeing eye.  But the seeing eyes were few or nonexistent.  Including mine.\n\nI nursed her.  They feel that\u2019s important nowadays.  I nursed all the children, but with her, with all the fierce rigidity of first motherhood, I did like the books then said.  Through her cries battered me to trembling and my breasts ached with swollenness.  I waited till the clock decreed.\nWhy do I put that first?  I do not even know if it matters, or if it explains anything.\n\nShe was a beautiful baby.  She blew shining bubbles of sound.  She loved motion, loved light, loved color and music and textures.  She would lie on the floor in her blue overalls patting the surface so hard in ecstasy her hands and feet would blur.  She was a miracle to me, but when she was eight months old I had to leave her daytimes with the woman downstairs to whom she was no miracle at all, for I worked or looked for work and for Emily\u2019s father, who \u201ccould no longer endure\u201d (he wrote in his good-bye note) \u201csharing want with us.\u201d\n\nI was nineteen.  It was the pre-relief, pre WPA world of the depression.  I would start running as soon as I got off the streetcar, running up the stairs, the place smelling sour, and awake or asleep to startle awake, when she saw me she would break into a clogged weeping that could not be comforted, a weeping I can hear yet.\n\nAfter a while I found a job hashing at night so I could be with her days, and it was better.  But I came to where I had to bring her to family and leave her.\n\nIt took a long time to raise the money for her fare back.  Then she got chicken pox and I had to wait longer.  When she finally came, I hardly knew her, walking quick and nervous like her father, looking like her father, thin, and dressed a shoddy red that yellowed her skin and giared at the pockmarks.  All the baby loveliness gone.\n\nShe was two.  Old enough for nursery school they said, and I did not know then what I did now \u2013 the fatigue of the long day, and the lacerations of group life in the kinds of nurseries that are only parking places for children.\n\nExcept that it would have made no difference if I had known.  It was the only place there was.  It was the only way we could be together, the only way I could hold a job.\n\nAnd even without knowing, I knew.  I knew the teacher that was evil because all these years it has curdled into my memory, the little boy hunched in the corner, her rasp, \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you outside, because Alvin hits you?  that\u2019s no reason.  go out.  scaredy.\u201d  I knew Emily hated it even if she did not clutch and implore \u201cdon\u2019t go Mommy\u201d like the other children, mornings.\n\nShe always had a reason why we should stay home.  Momma, you look sick.  Momma, I feel sick.  Momma, the teachers aren\u2019t there today, they\u2019re sick.  Momma, we can\u2019t go, there was a fire there last night.  Momma, it\u2019s a holiday today, no school, they told me.\n\nBut never a direct protest, never rebellion.  I think of our others in their three-four-year-oldness \u2013 the explosions, the tempers, the denunciations, the demands \u2013 and I feel suddenly ill.  I put down the iron.  What in me demanded that goodness in her?  And what was the cost, the cost of her such goodness?\n\nThe old man living in the back once said in his gentle way:  \u201cYou should smile more at Emily when you look at her.\u201d  What was in my face when I looked at her?  I loved her.  There were all the acts of love.\n\nIt was only with the others I remembered what he said, and it was the face of joy, and not of care or tightness or worry I turned to \u2013 too late for Emily.  She does not smile easily, let alone almost always as her brothers and sisters do.  Her face is closed and sombre, but when she wants, how fluid.  You must have seen it in her pantomimes, you spoke of her rare gift for comedy on the stage that rouses laughter out of the audience so dear they applaud and applaud and do not want to let her go.\n\nWhere does it come from, that comedy?  There was none of it in her when she came back to me that second time, after I had had to send her away again.  She had a new daddy now to learn to love, and I think perhaps it was a better time.\nExcept when we left her alone nights, telling ourselves she was old enough.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you go some other time, Mommy, like tomorrow?\u201d she would ask, \u201cWill it be just a little while you\u2019ll be gone?  Do you promise?\u201d\n\nThe time we came back, the front door open, the clock on the floor in the hall.  She rigid awake.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a little while.  I didn\u2019t cry.  Three times I called you, just three times, and then I ran downstairs to open the door so you could come faster.  The clock talked loud.  I threw it away, it scared me what it talked.\u201d\n\nShe said the clock talked loud again that night I went to the hospital to have Susan.  She was delirious with the fever that comes before red measles, but she was fully conscious all the week I was gone and the week after we were home when she could not come near the new baby or me.\n\nShe did not get well.  She stayed skeleton thin, not wanting to eat, and night after night she had nightmares.  She would call for me, and I would rouse from exhaustion to sleepily call back:  \u201cYou\u2019re all right, darling, go to sleep, it\u2019s just a dream,\u201d and if she still called, in a sterner voice, \u201cnow go to sleep, Emily, there\u2019s nothing to hurt you.\u201d  Twice, only twice, when I had to get up for Susan anyhow, I went in to sit with her.\n\nNow when it is too late (as if she would let me hold and comfort her like I do the others) I get up and go to her at once at her moan or restless stirring.  \"Are you awake, Emily?  Can I get you something?\"  And the answer is always the same: \"No, I'm all right, go back to sleep, Mother.\"\n\nThey persuaded ma at the clinic to send her away to a convalescent home in the country where \"she can have the kind of food and care you can't manage for her, and you'll be free to concentrate on the new baby.\"  They still send children to that place.  I see pictures on the society page of sleek young women planning affairs to raise money for it, or dancing at the affairs, or decorating Easter eggs or filling Christmas stockings for the children.\n\nThey never have a picture of the children so I do not know if the girls still wear those gigantic red bows and the ravaged looks on every other Sunday when parents can come to visit \"unless otherwise notified\" - as we were notified the first six weeks.\n\nOh it is a handsome place, green lawns and tall trees and fluted flower beds.  High up on the balconies of each cottage the children stand, the girls in their red bows and white dresses, the boys in white suits and giant red ties.  The parents stand below shrieking up to be heard and the children shriek down to be heard, and between them the invisible wall: \"Not to Be Contaminated by Parental Germs or Physical Affection.\"\n\nThere was a tiny girl who always stood hand in hand with Emily.  Her parents never came.  One visit she was gone.  \"They mover her to Rose Cottage,\" Emily shouted in explanation.  \"They don't like you to love anybody here.\"\n\nShe wrote once a week, the labored writing of a seven-year-old.  \"I am fine.  How is the baby.  If I write my letter nicely I will have a star.  Love.\"  There was never a star.  We wrote every other day, letters she could never hold or keep but only hear read - once.  \"We simply do not have room for children to keep any personal possessions,\" they patiently explained when we pieced one Sunday's shrieking together to plead how much it would mean to Emily, who loved to keep things, to be allowed to keep her letters and cards.\n\nEach visit she looked frailer.  \"She isn't eating,\" they told us.\n\n(They had runny eggs for breakfast or mush with lumps, Emily said later, I'd hold it in my mouth and not swallow.  Nothing ever tasted good, just when they had chicken.)\nIt took us eight months to get her released home, and the fact that she gained back so little of her seven lost pounds convinced the social worker.\n\nI used to try to hold and love her after she came back, but her body would stay stiff, and after a while she'd push away.  She ate little.  Food sickened her, and I think much of life too.  Oh she had physical lightness and brightness, twinkling by on skates, bouncing like a ball up and down up and down over the jump rope, skimming over the hill; but these were momentary.\n\nShe fretted about her appearance, thin and dark and foreign-looking at a time when every little girl was supposed to look or thought she should look a chubby blond replica of Shirley Temple.  The doorbell sometimes rang for her, but no one seemed to come and play in the house or be a best friend.  Maybe because we moved so much.\n\nThere was a boy she loved painfully through two school semesters.  Months later she told me how she had taken pennies from my purse to buy him candy.  \"Licorice was his favorite and I bought him some every day, but he still liked Jennifer better'n me.  Why, Mommy?  The kind of question for which there is no answer.\n\nSchool was a worry to her.  She was not glib or quick in a world where glibness and quickness were easily confused with ability to learn.  To her overworked and exasperated teachers she was an overconscientious \"slow learner\" who kept trying to catch up and was absent entirely too often.\n\nI let her be absent, though sometimes the illness was imaginary.  How different from my now-strictness about attendance with the others.  I wasn't working.  We had a new baby, I was home anyhow.  Sometimes, after Susan grew old enough, I would keep her home from school, too, to have them all together.\n\nMostly Emily had asthma, and her breathing, harsh and labored, would fill the house with a curiously tranquil sound.  I would bring the two old dresser mirrors and her boxes of collections to her bed.  She would select beads and single earrings, bottle tops and shells, dried flowers and pebbles, old postcards and scraps, all sorts of oddments; then she and Susan would play Kingdom, setting up landscapes and furniture, peopling them with action.\n\nThose were the only times of peaceful companionship between her and Susan.  I have edged away from it, that poisonous feeling between them, that terrible balancing of hurts and needs I had to do between the two, and did so badly, those earlier years.\n\nOh there are conflicts between the others too, each one human, needing, demanding, hurting, taking - but only between Emily and Susan, no, Emily toward Susan that was corroding resentment.  It seems so obvious on the surface, yet it was not obvious.  Susan, the second child, Susan, golden and curly-haired and chubby, quick and articulate and assured, everything in appearance and manner Emily was not; Susan, not able to resist Emily's precious things, losing or sometimes clumsily breaking them; Susan telling jokes and riddles to company for applause while Emily sat silent (to say to me later: that was my riddle, Mother, I told it to Susan); Susan, who for all the five years' difference in age was just a year behind Emily in developing physically.\n\nI am glad for that slow physical development that widened the difference between her and her contemporaries, though she suffered over it.  She was too vulnerable for that terrible world of youthful competition, of preening and parading, of constant measuring of yourself against every other, of envy, \"If I had that copper hair,\" \"If I had that skin\u2026\" She tormented herself enough about not looking like the others, there was enough of the unsureness, the having to be conscious of words before you speak, the constant caring - what are they thinking of me?  without having it all magnified by the merciless physical drives.\n\nRonnie is calling.  He is wet and I change him.  It is rare there is such a cry now.  That time of motherhood is almost behind me when the ear is not one's own but must always be racked and listening for the child cry, the child call.  We sit for a while and I hold him, looking out over the city spread in charcoal with its soft aisles of light.  \"Shoogily,\" he breathes and curls closer.  I carry him back to bed, asleep.  Shoogily.  A funny word, a family word, inherited from Emily, invented by her to say: comfort.\n\nIn this and other ways she leaves her seal, I would say aloud.  And startle at my saying it.  What do I mean?  What did I start to gather together, to try and make coherent?  I was at the terrible, growing years.  War years.  I do not remember them well.  I was working, there were four smaller ones now, there was not time for her.  She had to help be a mother, and housekeeper, and shopper.  She had to set her seal.  Mornings of crisis and near hysteria trying to get lunches packed, hair combed, coats and shoes found, everyone to school or Child Care on time, the baby ready for transportation.  And always the paper scribbled on by a smaller one, the book looked at by Susan then mislaid, the homework not done.  Running out to that huge school where she was one, she was lost, she was a drop; suffering over the unpreparedness, stammering and unsure in her classes.\n\nThere was so little time left at night after the kids were bedded down.  She would struggle over books, always eating (it was in those years she developed her enormous appetite that is legendary in our family) and I would be ironing, or preparing food for the next day, or writing V-mail to Bill, or tending the baby.  Sometimes, to make me laugh, or out of her despair, she would imitate happenings at school.\n\nI think I said once: \"Why don't you do something like this in the school amateur show?\"  One morning she phoned me at work, hardly understandable through the weeping: \"Mother, I did it.  I won, I won; they gave me first prize; they clapped and clapped and wouldn't let me go.\"\n\nNow suddenly she was Somebody, and as imprisoned in her difference as she had been in anonymity.\n\nShe began to be asked to perform at other high schools, even colleges, than at city and statewide affairs.  The first one we went to, I only recognized her that first moment when thin, shy, she almost drowned herself into the curtains.  Then:  Was this Emily?  The control, the command, the convulsing and deadly clowning, the spell, then the roaring, the stamping audience, unwilling to let this rare and precious laughter out of their lives.\n\nAfterwards:  You ought to do something about her with a gift like that - but without money or knowing how, what does one do?  We have left it all to her, and the gift has often eddied inside, clogged and clotted, as been used and growing.\n\nShe is coming.  She runs up the stairs two at a time with her light graceful step, and I know she is happy tonight.  Whatever it was that occasioned your call did not happen today.\n\n\"Aren't you ever going to finish ironing, Mother?  Whistler painted his mother in a rocker.  I'd have to paint mine standing over an ironing board.\"  This is one of her communicative nights and she tells me everything and nothing as she fixes herself a plate of food out of the icebox.\n\nShe is so lovely.  Why did you want to come up at all?  Why were you concerned?  She will find her way.\n\nShe starts up the stairs to bed.  \"Don't get me up with the rest in the morning.\"  \"But I thought you were having midterms.\"  \"Oh, those,\" she comes back in, kisses me, and says quite lightly, \"in a couple of years when we'll all be atom-dead they won't matter a bit.\"\n\nShe has said it before.  She believes it.  But because I have been dredging the past, and all that compounds a human being is so heavy and meaningful in me, I cannot endure it tonight.\n\nI will never total it all.  I will never come to say: She was a child seldom smiled at.  Her father left me before she was a year old.  I had to work her first six years when there was work, or I sent her home and to his relatives.  There were tears she had care she hated.  She was dark and thin and foreign-looking in a world where the prestige went to blondness and curly hair and dimples, she was slow where glibness was prized.  She was a child of anxious, not proud, love.  We were poor and could not afford for her the soil of easy growth.  I was a young mother, I was a distracted mother.  There were other children pushing up, demanding.  Her younger sister seemed all that she was not.  There were years she did not want me to touch her.  She kept too much in herself, her life was such she had to keep too much in herself.  My wisdom came too late.  She has much to her and probably little will come of it.  She is a child of her age, of depression, of war, of fear.\n\nLet her be.  So all that is in her will not bloom - but in how many does it?  There is still enough left to live by.  Only help her to know - help make it so there is cause for her to know - that she is more than this dress on the ironing board, helpless before the iron.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4888412", "artist_names": "Sam Wise (Ft.

"lyrics": "Bad Pharma Lyrics1\nMissing Data\nSponsors get the answer they want\n\n\nBefore we get going, we need to establish one thing beyond any doubt: industry-funded trials are more likely to produce a positive, flattering result than independently-funded trials. This is our core premise, and you\u2019re about to read a very short chapter, because this is one of the most well-documented phenomena in the growing field of \u2018research about research\u2019. It has also become much easier to study in recent years, because the rules on declaring industry funding have become a little clearer.\n\nWe can begin with some recent work: in 2010, three researchers from Harvard and Toronto found all the trials looking at five major classes of drug \u2013 antidepressants, ulcer drugs and so on \u2013 then measured two key features: were they positive, and were they funded by industry?1 They found over five hundred trials in total: 85 per cent of the industry-funded studies were positive, but only 50 per cent of the government-funded trials were. That\u2019s a very significant difference.\nIn 2007, researchers looked at every published trial that set out to explore the benefit of a statin.2 These are cholesterol-lowering drugs which reduce your risk of having a heart attack, they are prescribed in very large quantities, and they will loom large in this book. This study found 192 trials in total, either comparing one statin against another, or comparing a statin against a different kind of treatment. Once the researchers controlled for other factors (we\u2019ll delve into what this means later), they found that industry-funded trials were twenty times more likely to give results favouring the test drug. Again, that\u2019s a very big difference.\n\nWe\u2019ll do one more. In 2006, researchers looked into every trial of psychiatric drugs in four academic journals over a ten-year period, finding 542 trial outcomes in total. Industry sponsors got favourable outcomes for their own drug 78 per cent of the time, while independently-funded trials only gave a positive result in 48 per cent of cases. If you were a competing drug put up against the sponsor\u2019s drug in a trial, you were in for a pretty rough ride: you would only win a measly 28 per cent of the time.3\n\nThese are dismal, frightening results, but they come from individual studies. When there has been lots of research in a field, it\u2019s always possible that someone \u2013 like me, for example \u2013 could cherry-pick the results, and give a partial view. I could, in essence, be doing exactly what I accuse the pharmaceutical industry of doing, and only telling you about the studies that support my case, while hiding the reassuring ones from you.\n\nTo guard against this risk, researchers invented the systematic review. We\u2019ll explore this in more detail soon (p.14), since it\u2019s at the core of modern medicine, but in essence a systematic review is simple: instead of just mooching through the research literature, consciously or unconsciously picking out papers here and there that support your pre-existing beliefs, you take a scientific, systematic approach to the very process of looking for scientific evidence, ensuring that your evidence is as complete and representative as possible of all the research that has ever been done.\n\nSystematic reviews are very, very onerous. In 2003, by coincidence, two were published, both looking specifically at the question we\u2019re interested in. They took all the studies ever published that looked at whether industry funding is associated with pro-industry results. Each took a slightly different approach to finding research papers, and both found that industry-funded trials were, overall, about four times more likely to report positive results.4 A further review in 2007 looked at the new studies that had been published in the four years after these two earlier reviews: it found twenty more pieces of work, and all but two showed that industry-sponsored trials were more likely to report flattering results.5\n\nI am setting out this evidence at length because I want to be absolutely clear that there is no doubt on the issue. Industry-sponsored trials give favourable results, and that is not my opinion, or a hunch from the occasional passing study. This is a very well-documented problem, and it has been researched extensively, without anybody stepping out to take effective action, as we shall see.\n\nThere is one last study I\u2019d like to tell you about. It turns out that this pattern of industry-funded trials being vastly more likely to give positive results persists even when you move away from published academic papers, and look instead at trial reports from academic conferences, where data often appears for the first time (in fact, as we shall see, sometimes trial results only appear at an academic conference, with very little information on how the study was conducted).\n\nFries and Krishnan studied all the research abstracts presented at the 2001 American College of Rheumatology meetings which reported any kind of trial, and acknowledged industry sponsorship, in order to find out what proportion had results that favoured the sponsor\u2019s drug. There is a small punch-line coming, and to understand it we need to cover a little of what an academic paper looks like. In general, the results section is extensive: the raw numbers are given for each outcome, and for each possible causal factor, but not just as raw figures. The \u2018ranges\u2019 are given, subgroups are perhaps explored, statistical tests are conducted, and each detail of the result is described in table form, and in shorter narrative form in the text, explaining the most important results. This lengthy process is usually spread over several pages.\n\nIn Fries and Krishnan [2004] this level of detail was unnecessary. The results section is a single, simple, and \u2013 I like to imagine \u2013 fairly passive-aggressive sentence:\n\nThe results from every RCT (45 out of 45) favored the drug of the sponsor.\n\nThis extreme finding has a very interesting side effect, for those interested in time-saving shortcuts. Since every industry-sponsored trial had a positive result, that\u2019s all you\u2019d need to know about a piece of work to predict its outcome: if it was funded by industry, you could know with absolute certainty that the trial found the drug was great.\n\nHow does this happen? How do industry-sponsored trials almost always manage to get a positive result? It is, as far as anyone can be certain, a combination of factors. It may be that companies are more likely to run trials when they\u2019re more confident their treatment is going to \u2018win\u2019; this sounds reasonable, although even this conflicts with the ethical principle that you should only do a trial when there\u2019s genuine uncertainty about which treatment is best (otherwise you\u2019re exposing half of your participants to a treatment you already know to be inferior). Sometimes the chances of one treatment winning can be increased with outright design flaws. You can compare your new drug with something you know to be rubbish \u2013 an existing drug at an inadequate dose, perhaps, or a placebo sugar pill that does almost nothing. You can choose your patients very carefully, so they are more likely to get better on your treatment. You can peek at the results halfway through, and stop your trial early if they look good (which is \u2013 for interesting reasons we shall discuss \u2013 statistical poison). And so on.\n\nBut before we get to these fascinating methodological twists and quirks, these nudges and bumps that stop a trial from being a fair test of whether a treatment works or not, there is something very much simpler at hand.\nSometimes drug companies conduct lots of trials, and when they see that the results are unflattering, they simply fail to publish them. This is not a new problem, and it\u2019s not limited to medicine. In fact, this issue of negative results that go missing in action cuts into almost every corner of science. It distorts findings in fields as diverse as brain imaging and economics, it makes a mockery of all our efforts to exclude bias from our studies, and despite everything that regulators, drug companies and even some academics will tell you, it is a problem that has been left unfixed for decades.\n\nIn fact, it is so deep-rooted that even if we fixed it today \u2013 right now, for good, forever, without any flaws or loopholes in our legislation \u2013 that still wouldn\u2019t help, because we would still be practising medicine, cheerfully making decisions about which treatment is best, on the basis of decades of medical evidence which is \u2013 as you\u2019ve now seen \u2013 fundamentally distorted.\n\nBut there is a way ahead.\n\nWhy missing data matters\n\nReboxetine is a drug I myself have prescribed. Other drugs had done nothing for this particular patient, so we wanted to try something new. I\u2019d read the trial data before I wrote the prescription, and found only well-designed, fair tests, with overwhelmingly positive results. Reboxetine was better than placebo, and as good as any other antidepressant in head-to-head comparisons. It\u2019s approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the MHRA), which governs all drugs in the UK. Millions of doses are prescribed every year, around the world. Reboxetine was clearly a safe and effective treatment. The patient and I discussed the evidence briefly, and agreed it was the right treatment to try next. I signed a piece of paper, a prescription, saying I wanted my patient to have this drug.\n\nBut we had both been misled. In October 2010 a group of researchers were finally able to bring together all the trials that had ever been conducted on reboxetine.6 Through a long process of investigation \u2013 searching in academic journals, but also arduously requesting data from the manufacturers and gathering documents from regulators \u2013 they were able to assemble all the data, both from trials that were published, and from those that had never appeared in academic papers.\n\nWhen all this trial data was put together it produced a shocking picture. Seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against placebo. Only one, conducted in 254 patients, had a neat, positive result, and that one was published in an academic journal, for doctors and researchers to read. But six more trials were conducted, in almost ten times as many patients. All of them showed that reboxetine was no better than a dummy sugar pill. None of these trials was published. I had no idea they existed.\n\nIt got worse. The trials comparing reboxetine against other drugs showed exactly the same picture: three small studies, 507 patients in total, showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other drug. They were all published. But 1,657 patients\u2019 worth of data was left unpublished, and this unpublished data showed that patients on reboxetine did worse than those on other drugs. If all this wasn\u2019t bad enough, there was also the side-effects data. The drug looked fine in the trials which appeared in the academic literature: but when we saw the unpublished studies, it turned out that patients were more likely to have side effects, more likely to drop out of taking the drug, and more likely to withdraw from the trial because of side effects, if they were taking reboxetine rather than one of its competitors.\n\nIf you\u2019re ever in any doubt about whether the stories in this book make me angry \u2013 and I promise you, whatever happens, I will keep to the data, and strive to give a fair picture of everything we know \u2013 you need only look at this story. I did everything a doctor is supposed to do. I read all the papers, I critically appraised them, I understood them, I discussed them with the patient, and we made a decision together, based on the evidence. In the published data, reboxetine was a safe and effective drug. In reality, it was no better than a sugar pill, and worse, it does more harm than good. As a doctor I did something which, on the balance of all the evidence, harmed my patient, simply because unflattering data was left unpublished.\n\nIf you find that amazing, or outrageous, your journey is just beginning. Because nobody broke any law in that situation, reboxetine is still on the market, and the system that allowed all this to happen is still in play, for all drugs, in all countries in the world. Negative data goes missing, for all treatments, in all areas of science. The regulators and professional bodies we would reasonably expect to stamp out such practices have failed us.\n\nIn a few pages, we will walk through the literature that demonstrates all of this beyond any doubt, showing that \u2018publication bias\u2019 \u2013 the process whereby negative results go unpublished \u2013 is endemic throughout the whole of medicine and academia; and that regulators have failed to do anything about it, despite decades of data showing the size of the problem. But before we get to that research, I need you to feel its implications, so we need to think about why missing data matters.\n\nEvidence is the only way we can possibly know if something works \u2013 or doesn\u2019t work \u2013 in medicine. We proceed by testing things, as cautiously as we can, in head-to-head trials, and gathering together all of the evidence. This last step is crucial: if I withhold half the data from you, it\u2019s very easy for me to convince you of something that isn\u2019t true. If I toss a coin a hundred times, for example, but only tell you about the results when it lands heads-up, I can convince you that this is a two-headed coin. But that doesn\u2019t mean I really do have a two-headed coin: it means I\u2019m misleading you, and you\u2019re a fool for letting me get away with it. This is exactly the situation we tolerate in medicine, and always have. Researchers are free to do as many trials as they wish, and then choose which ones to publish.\n\nThe repercussions of this go way beyond simply misleading doctors about the benefits and harms of interventions for patients, and way beyond trials. Medical research isn\u2019t an abstract academic pursuit: it\u2019s about people, so every time we fail to publish a piece of research we expose real, living people to unnecessary, avoidable suffering.\nTGN1412\n\nIn March 2006, six volunteers arrived at a London hospital to take place in a trial. It was the first time a new drug called TGN1412 had ever been given to humans, and they were paid \u00a32,000 each.7 Within an hour these six men developed headaches, muscle aches, and a feeling of unease. Then things got worse: high temperatures, restlessness, periods of forgetting who and where they were. Soon they were shivering, flushed, their pulses racing, their blood pressure falling. Then, a cliff: one went into respiratory failure, the oxygen levels in his blood falling rapidly as his lungs filled with fluid. Nobody knew why. Another dropped his blood pressure to just 65/40, stopped breathing properly, and was rushed to an intensive care unit, knocked out, intubated, mechanically ventilated. Within a day all six were disastrously unwell: fluid on their lungs, struggling to breathe, their kidneys failing, their blood clotting uncontrollably throughout their bodies, and their white blood cells disappearing. Doctors threw everything they could at them: steroids, antihistamines, immune-system receptor blockers. All six were ventilated on intensive care. They stopped producing urine; they were all put on dialysis; their blood was replaced, first slowly, then rapidly; they needed plasma, red cells, platelets. The fevers continued. One developed pneumonia. And then the blood stopped getting to their peripheries. Their fingers and toes went flushed, then brown, then black, and then began to rot and die. With heroic effort, all escaped, at least, with their lives.\n\nThe Department of Health convened an Expert Scientific Group to try to understand what had happened, and from this two concerns were raised.8 Firstly: can we stop things like this from happening again? It\u2019s plainly foolish, for example, to give a new experimental treatment to all six participants in a \u2018first-in-man\u2019 trial at the same time, if that treatment is a completely unknown quantity. New drugs should be given to participants in a staggered process, slowly, over a day. This idea received considerable attention from regulators and the media.\n\nLess noted was a second concern: could we have foreseen this disaster? TGN1412 is a molecule that attaches to a receptor called CD28 on the white blood cells of the immune system. It was a new and experimental treatment, and it interfered with the immune system in ways that are poorly understood, and hard to model in animals (unlike, say, blood pressure, because immune systems are very variable between different species). But as the final report found, there was experience with a similar intervention: it had simply not been published. One researcher presented the inquiry with unpublished data on a study he had conducted in a single human subject a full ten years earlier, using an antibody that attached to the CD3, CD2 and CD28 receptors. The effects of this antibody had parallels with those of TGN1412, and the subject on whom it was tested had become unwell. But nobody could possibly have known that, because these results were never shared with the scientific community. They sat unpublished, unknown, when they could have helped save six men from a terrifying, destructive, avoidable ordeal.\n\nThat original researcher could not foresee the specific harm he contributed to, and it\u2019s hard to blame him as an individual, because he operated in an academic culture where leaving data unpublished was regarded as completely normal. The same culture exists today. The final report on TGN1412 concluded that sharing the results of all first-in-man studies was essential: they should be published, every last one, as a matter of routine. But phase 1 trial results weren\u2019t published then, and they\u2019re still not published now. In 2009, for the first time, a study was published looking specifically at how many of these first-in-man trials get published, and how many remain hidden.9 They took all such trials approved by one ethics committee over a year. After four years, nine out of ten remain unpublished; after eight years, four out of five were still unpublished.\n\nIn medicine, as we shall see time and again, research is not abstract: it relates directly to life, death, suffering and pain. With every one of these unpublished studies we are potentially exposed, quite unnecessarily, to another TGN1412. Even a huge international news story, with horrific images of young men brandishing blackened feet and hands from hospital beds, wasn\u2019t enough to get movement, because the issue of missing data is too complicated to fit in one sentence.\n\nWhen we don\u2019t share the results of basic research, such as a small first-in-man study, we expose people to unnecessary risks in the future. Was this an extreme case? Is the problem limited to early, experimental, new drugs, in small groups of trial participants? No.\n\nIn the 1980s, doctors began giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to all patients who\u2019d had a heart attack. This practice made perfect sense on paper: we knew that anti-arrhythmic drugs helped prevent abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that people who\u2019ve had a heart attack are quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that often these went unnoticed, undiagnosed and untreated. Giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to everyone who\u2019d had a heart attack was a simple, sensible, preventive measure.\n\nUnfortunately, it turned out that we were wrong. This prescribing practice, with the best of intentions, on the best of principles, actually killed people. And because heart attacks are very common, it killed them in very large numbers: well over 100,000 people died unnecessarily before it was realised that the fine balance between benefit and risk was completely different for patients without a proven abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nCould anyone have predicted this? Sadly, yes, they could have. A trial in 1980 tested a new anti-arrhythmic drug, lorcainide, in a small number of men who\u2019d had a heart attack \u2013 less than a hundred \u2013 to see if it was any use. Nine out of forty-eight men on lorcainide died, compared with one out of forty-seven on placebo. The drug was early in its development cycle, and not long after this study it was dropped for commercial reasons. Because it wasn\u2019t on the market, nobody even thought to publish the trial. The researchers assumed it was an idiosyncrasy of their molecule, and gave it no further thought. If they had published, we would have been much more cautious about trying other anti-arrhythmic drugs on people with heart attacks, and the phenomenal death toll \u2013 over 100,000 people in their graves prematurely \u2013 might have been stopped sooner. More than a decade later, the researchers finally did publish their results, with a mea culpa, recognising the harm they had done by not sharing them earlier:\n\nWhen we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance. The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons, and this study was therefore never published; it is now a good example of \u2018publication bias\u2019. The results described here might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead.10\n\nAs we shall shortly see, this problem of unpublished data is widespread throughout medicine, and indeed the whole of academia, even though the scale of the problem, and the harm it causes, have been documented beyond any doubt. We will see stories on basic cancer research, Tamiflu, cholesterol blockbusters, obesity drugs, antidepressants and more, with evidence that goes from the dawn of medicine to the present day, and data that is still being withheld, right now, as I write, on widely used drugs which many of you reading this book will have taken this morning. We will also see how regulators and academic bodies have repeatedly failed to address the problem.\n\nBecause researchers are free to bury any result they please, patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine, from research to practice. Doctors can have no idea about the true effects of the treatments they give. Does this drug really work best, or have I simply been deprived of half the data? Nobody can tell. Is this expensive drug worth the money, or have the data simply been massaged? No one can tell. Will this drug kill patients? Is there any evidence that it\u2019s dangerous? No one can tell.\n\nThis is a bizarre situation to arise in medicine, a discipline where everything is supposed to be based on evidence, and where everyday practice is bound up in medico-legal anxiety. In one of the most regulated corners of human conduct we\u2019ve taken our eyes off the ball, and allowed the evidence driving practice to be polluted and distorted. It seems unimaginable. We will now see how deep this problem goes.\n\nWhy we summarise data\n\nMissing data has been studied extensively in medicine. But before I lay out that evidence, we need to understand exactly why it matters, from a scientific perspective. And for that we need to understand systematic reviews and \u2018meta-analysis\u2019. Between them, these are two of the most powerful ideas in modern medicine. They are incredibly simple, but they were invented shockingly late.\n\nWhen we want to find out if something works or not, we do a trial. This is a very simple process, and the first recorded attempt at some kind of trial was in the Bible (Daniel 1:12, if you\u2019re interested). Firstly, you need an unanswered question: for example, \u2018Does giving steroids to a woman delivering a premature baby increase the chances of that baby surviving?\u2019 Then you find some relevant participants, in this case, mothers about to deliver a premature baby. You\u2019ll need a reasonable number of them, let\u2019s say two hundred for this trial. Then you divide them into two groups at random, give the mothers in one group the current best treatment (whatever that is in your town), while the mothers in the other group get current best treatment plus some steroids. Finally, when all two hundred women have gone through your trial, you count up how many babies survived in each group.\n\nThis is a real-world question, and lots of trials were done on this topic, starting from 1972 onwards: two trials showed that steroids saved lives, but five showed no significant benefit. Now, you will often hear that doctors disagree when the evidence is mixed, and this is exactly that kind of situation. A doctor with a strong pre-existing belief that steroids work \u2013 perhaps preoccupied with some theoretical molecular mechanism, by which the drug might do something useful in the body \u2013 could come along and say: \u2018Look at these two positive trials! Of course we must give steroids!\u2019 A doctor with a strong prior intuition that steroids were rubbish might point at the five negative trials and say: \u2018Overall the evidence shows no benefit. Why take a risk?\u2019\n\nUp until very recently, this was basically how medicine progressed. People would write long, languorous review articles \u2013 essays surveying the literature \u2013 in which they would cite the trial data they\u2019d come across in a completely unsystematic fashion, often reflecting their own prejudices and values. Then, in the 1980s, people began to do something called a \u2018systematic review\u2019. This is a clear, systematic survey of the literature, with the intention of getting all the trial data you can possibly find on one topic, without being biased towards any particular set of findings. In a systematic review, you describe exactly how you looked for data: which databases you searched, which search engines and indexes you used, even what words you searched for. You pre-specify the kinds of studies that can be included in your review, and then you present everything you\u2019ve found, including the papers you rejected, with an explanation of why. By doing this, you ensure that your methods are fully transparent, replicable and open to criticism, providing the reader with a clear and complete picture of the evidence. It may sound like a simple idea, but systematic reviews are extremely rare outside clinical medicine, and are quietly one of the most important and transgressive ideas of the past forty years.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got all the trial data in one place, you can conduct something called a meta-analysis, where you bring all the results together in one giant spreadsheet, pool all the data and get one single, summary figure, the most accurate summary of all the data on one clinical question. The output of this is called a \u2018blobbogram\u2019, and you can see one on the opposite page, in the logo of the Cochrane Collaboration, a global, non-profit academic organisation that has been producing gold-standard reviews of evidence on important questions in medicine since the 1980s.\n\nThis blobbogram shows the results of all the trials done on giving steroids to help premature babies survive. Each horizontal line is a trial: if that line is further to the left, then the trial showed steroids were beneficial and saved lives. The central, vertical line is the \u2018line of no effect\u2019: and if the horizontal line of the trial touches the line of no effect, then that trial showed no statistically significant benefit. Some trials are represented by longer horizontal lines: these were smaller trials, with fewer participants, which means they are prone to more error, so the estimate of the benefit has more uncertainty, and therefore the horizontal line is longer. Finally, the diamond at the bottom shows the \u2018summary effect\u2019: this is the overall benefit of the intervention, pooling together the results of all the individual trials. These are much narrower than the lines for individual trials, because the estimate is much more accurate: it is summarising the effect of the drug in many more patients. On this blobbogram you can see \u2013 because the diamond is a long way from the line of no effect \u2013 that giving steroids is hugely beneficial. In fact, it reduces the chances of a premature baby dying by almost half.\n\nThe amazing thing about this blobbogram is that it had to be invented, and this happened very late in medicine\u2019s history. For many years we had all the information we needed to know that steroids saved lives, but nobody knew they were effective, because nobody did a systematic review until 1989. As a result, the treatment wasn\u2019t given widely, and huge numbers of babies died unnecessarily; not because we didn\u2019t have the information, but simply because we didn\u2019t synthesise it together properly.\n\nIn case you think this is an isolated case, it\u2019s worth examining exactly how broken medicine was until frighteningly recent times. The diagram on the opposite page contains two blobbograms, or \u2018forest plots\u2019, showing all the trials ever conducted to see whether giving streptokinase, a clot-busting drug, improves survival in patients who have had a heart attack.11\n\nLook first only at the forest plot on the left. This is a conventional forest plot, from an academic journal, so it\u2019s a little busier than the stylised one in the Cochrane logo. The principles, however, are exactly the same. Each horizontal line is a trial, and you can see that there is a hodgepodge of results, with some trials showing a benefit (they don\u2019t touch the vertical line of no effect, headed \u20181\u2019) and some showing no benefit (they do cross that line). At the bottom, however, you can see the summary effect \u2013 a dot on this old-fashioned blobbogram, rather than a diamond. And you can see very clearly that overall, streptokinase saves lives.\n\nSo what\u2019s that on the right? It\u2019s something called a cumulative meta-analysis. If you look at the list of studies on the left of the diagram, you can see that they are arranged in order of date. The cumulative meta-analysis on the right adds in each new trial\u2019s results, as they arrived over history, to the previous trials\u2019 results. This gives the best possible running estimate, each year, of how the evidence would have looked at that time, if anyone had bothered to do a meta-analysis on all the data available to them. From this cumulative blobbogram you can see that the horizontal lines, the \u2018summary effects\u2019, narrow over time as more and more data is collected, and the estimate of the overall benefit of this treatment becomes more accurate. You can also see that these horizontal lines stopped touching the vertical line of no effect a very long time ago \u2013 and crucially, they do so a long time before we started giving streptokinase to everyone with a heart attack.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t spotted it for yourself already \u2013 to be fair, the entire medical profession was slow to catch on \u2013 this chart has devastating implications. Heart attacks are an incredibly common cause of death. We had a treatment that worked, and we had all the information we needed to know that it worked, but once again we didn\u2019t bring it together systematically to get that correct answer. Half of the people in those trials at the bottom of the blobbogram were randomly assigned to receive no streptokinase, I think unethically, because we had all the information we needed to know that streptokinase worked: they were deprived of effective treatments. But they weren\u2019t alone, because so were most of the rest of the people in the world at the time.\n\nThese stories illustrate, I hope, why systematic reviews and meta-analyses are so important: we need to bring together all of the evidence on a question, not just cherry-pick the bits that we stumble upon, or intuitively like the look of. Mercifully the medical profession has come to recognise this over the past couple of decades, and systematic reviews with meta-analyses are now used almost universally, to ensure that we have the most accurate possible summary of all the trials that have been done on a particular medical question.\n\nBut these stories also demonstrate why missing trial results are so dangerous. If one researcher or doctor \u2018cherry-picks\u2019, when summarising the existing evidence, and looks only at the trials that support their hunch, then they can produce a misleading picture of the research. That is a problem for that one individual (and for anyone who is unwise or unlucky enough to be influenced by them). But if we are all missing the negative trials, the entire medical and academic community, around the world, then when we pool the evidence to get the best possible view of what works \u2013 as we must do \u2013 we are all completely misled. We get a misleading impression of the treatment\u2019s effectiveness: we incorrectly exaggerate its benefits; or perhaps even find incorrectly that an intervention was beneficial, when in reality it did harm.\n\nNow that you understand the importance of systematic reviews, you can see why missing data matters. But you can also appreciate that when I explain how much trial data is missing, I am giving you a clean overview of the literature, because I will be explaining that evidence using systematic reviews.\n\nHow much data is missing?\n\nIf you want to prove that trials have been left unpublished, you have an interesting problem: you need to prove the existence of studies you don\u2019t have access to. To work around this, people have developed a simple approach: you identify a group of trials you know have been conducted and completed, then check to see if they have been published. Finding a list of completed trials is the tricky part of this job, and to achieve it people have used various strategies: trawling the lists of trials that have been approved by ethics committees (or \u2018institutional review boards\u2019 in the USA), for example; or chasing up the trials discussed by researchers at conferences.\n\nIn 2008 a group of researchers decided to check for publication of every trial that had ever been reported to the US Food and Drug Administration for all the antidepressants that came onto the market between 1987 and 2004.12 This was no small task. The FDA archives contain a reasonable amount of information on all the trials that were submitted to the regulator in order to get a licence for a new drug. But that\u2019s not all the trials, by any means, because those conducted after the drug has come onto the market will not appear there; and the information that is provided by the FDA is hard to search, and often scanty. But it is an important subset of the trials, and more than enough for us to begin exploring how often trials go missing, and why. It\u2019s also a representative slice of trials from all the major drug companies.\n\nThe researchers found seventy-four studies in total, representing 12,500 patients\u2019 worth of data. Thirty-eight of these trials had positive results, and found that the new drug worked; thirty-six were negative. The results were therefore an even split between success and failure for the drugs, in reality. Then the researchers set about looking for these trials in the published academic literature, the material available to doctors and patients. This provided a very different picture. Thirty-seven of the positive trials \u2013 all but one \u2013 were published in full, often with much fanfare. But the trials with negative results had a very different fate: only three were published. Twenty-two were simply lost to history, never appearing anywhere other than in those dusty, disorganised, thin FDA files. The remaining eleven which had negative results in the FDA summaries did appear in the academic literature, but were written up as if the drug was a success. If you think this sounds absurd, I agree: we will see in Chapter 4, on \u2018bad trials\u2019, how a study\u2019s results can be reworked and polished to distort and exaggerate its findings.\n\nThis was a remarkable piece of work, spread over twelve drugs from all the major manufacturers, with no stand-out bad guy. It very clearly exposed a broken system: in reality we have thirty-eight positive trials and thirty-six negative ones; in the academic literature we have forty-eight positive trials and three negative ones. Take a moment to flip back and forth between those in your mind: \u2018thirty-eight positive trials, thirty-six negative\u2019; or \u2018forty-eight positive trials and only three negative\u2019.\n\nIf we were talking about one single study, from one single group of researchers, who decided to delete half their results because they didn\u2019t give the overall picture they wanted, then we would quite correctly call that act \u2018research misconduct\u2019. Yet somehow when exactly the same phenomenon occurs, but with whole studies going missing, by the hands of hundreds and thousands of individuals, spread around the world, in both the public and private sector, we accept it as a normal part of life.13 It passes by, under the watchful eyes of regulators and professional bodies who do nothing, as routine, despite the undeniable impact it has on patients.\n\nEven more strange is this: we\u2019ve known about the problem of negative studies going missing for almost as long as people have been doing serious science.\n\nThis was first formally documented by a psychologist called Theodore Sterling in 1959.14 He went through every paper published in the four big psychology journals of the time, and found that 286 out of 294 reported a statistically significant result. This, he explained, was plainly fishy: it couldn\u2019t possibly be a fair representation of every study that had been conducted, because if we believed that, we\u2019d have to believe that almost every theory ever tested by a psychologist in an experiment had turned out to be correct. If psychologists really were so great at predicting results, there\u2019d hardly be any point in bothering to run experiments at all. In 1995, at the end of his career, the same researcher came back to the same question, half a lifetime later, and found that almost nothing had changed.15\n\nSterling was the first to put these ideas into a formal academic context, but the basic truth had been recognised for many centuries. Francis Bacon explained in 1620 that we often mislead ourselves by only remembering the times something worked, and forgetting those when it didn\u2019t.16 Fowler in 1786 listed the cases he\u2019d seen treated with arsenic, and pointed out that he could have glossed over the failures, as others might be tempted to do, but had included them.17 To do otherwise, he explained, would have been misleading.\n\nYet it was only three decades ago that people started to realise that missing trials posed a serious problem for medicine. In 1980 Elina Hemminki found that almost half the trials conducted in the mid-1970s in Finland and Sweden had been left unpublished.18 Then, in 1986, an American researcher called Robert Simes decided to investigate the trials on a new treatment for ovarian cancer. This was an important study, because it looked at a life-or-death question. Combination chemotherapy for this kind of cancer has very tough side effects, and knowing this, many researchers had hoped it might be better to give a single \u2018alkylating agent\u2019 drug first, before moving on to full chemotherapy. Simes looked at all the trials published on this question in the academic literature, read by doctors and academics. From this, giving a single drug first looked like a great idea: women with advanced ovarian cancer (which is not a good diagnosis to have) who were on the alkylating agent alone were significantly more likely to survive longer.\n\nThen Simes had a smart idea. He knew that sometimes trials can go unpublished, and he had heard that papers with less \u2018exciting\u2019 results are the most likely to go missing. To prove that this has happened, though, is a tricky business: you need to find a fair, representative sample of all the trials that have been conducted, and then compare their results with the smaller pool of trials that have been published, to see if there are any embarrassing differences. There was no easy way to get this information from the medicines regulator (we will discuss this problem in some detail later), so instead he went to the International Cancer Research Data Bank. This contained a register of interesting trials that were happening in the USA, including most of the ones funded by the government, and many others from around the world. It was by no means a complete list, but it did have one crucial feature: the trials were registered before their results came in, so any list compiled from this source would be, if not complete, at least a representative sample of all the research that had ever been done, and not biased by whether their results were positive or negative.\n\nWhen Simes compared the results of the published trials against the pre-registered trials, the results were disturbing. Looking at the academic literature \u2013 the studies that researchers and journal editors chose to publish \u2013 alkylating agents alone looked like a great idea, reducing the rate of death from advanced ovarian cancer significantly. But when you looked only at the pre-registered trials \u2013 the unbiased, fair sample of all the trials ever conducted \u2013 the new treatment was no better than old-fashioned chemotherapy.\n\nSimes immediately recognised \u2013 as I hope you will too \u2013 that the question of whether one form of cancer treatment is better than another was small fry compared to the depth charge he was about to set off in the medical literature. Everything we thought we knew about whether treatments worked or not was probably distorted, to an extent that might be hard to measure, but that would certainly have a major impact on patient care. We were seeing the positive results, and missing the negative ones. There was one clear thing we should do about this: start a registry of all clinical trials, demand that people register their study before they start, and insist that they publish the results at the end.\n\nThat was 1986. Since then, a generation later, we have done very badly. In this book, I promise I won\u2019t overwhelm you with data. But at the same time, I don\u2019t want any drug company, or government regulator, or professional body, or anyone who doubts this whole story, to have any room to wriggle. So I\u2019ll now go through all the evidence on missing trials, as briefly as possible, showing the main approaches that have been used. All of what you are about to read comes from the most current systematic reviews on the subject, so you can be sure that it is a fair and unbiased summary of the results.\n\nOne research approach is to get all the trials that a medicines regulator has record of, from the very early ones done for the purposes of getting a licence for a new drug, and then check to see if they all appear in the academic literature. That\u2019s the method we saw used in the paper mentioned above, where researchers sought out every paper on twelve antidepressants, and found that a 50/50 split of positive and negative results turned into forty-eight positive papers and just three negative ones. This method has been used extensively in several different areas of medicine:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Lee and colleagues, for example, looked for all of the 909 trials \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0submitted alongside marketing applications for all ninety new \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0drugs that came onto the market from 2001 to 2002: they \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0found that 66 per cent of the trials with significant results \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0were published, compared with only 36 per cent of the rest.19\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Melander, in 2003, looked for all forty-two trials on five \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0antidepressants that were submitted to the Swedish drug \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regulator in the process of getting a marketing authorisation: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0all twenty-one studies with significant results were published; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0only 81 per cent of those finding no benefit were published.20\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Rising et al., in 2008, found more of those distorted write-ups \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that we\u2019ll be dissecting later: they looked for all trials on two \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0years\u2019 worth of approved drugs. In the FDA\u2019s summary of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the results, once those could be found, there were 164 trials. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those with favourable outcomes were a full four times more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0likely to be published in academic papers than those with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0negative outcomes. On top of that, four of the trials with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0negative outcomes changed, once they appeared in the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0academic literature, to favour the drug.21\n\nIf you prefer, you can look at conference presentations: a huge amount of research gets presented at conferences, but our current best estimate is that only about half of it ever appears in the academic literature.22 Studies presented only at conferences are almost impossible to find, or cite, and are especially hard to assess, because so little information is available on the specific methods used in the research (often as little as a paragraph). And as you will see shortly, not every trial is a fair test of a treatment. Some can be biased by design, so these details matter.\n\nThe most recent systematic review of studies looking at what happens to conference papers was done in 2010, and it found thirty separate studies looking at whether negative conference presentations \u2013 in fields as diverse as anaesthetics, cystic fibrosis, oncology, and A&E \u2013 disappear before becoming fully-fledged academic papers.23 Overwhelmingly, unflattering results are much more likely to go missing.\n\nIf you\u2019re very lucky, you can track down a list of trials whose existence was publicly recorded before they were started, perhaps on a register that was set up to explore that very question. From the pharmaceutical industry, up until very recently, you\u2019d be very lucky to find such a list in the public domain. For publicly-funded research the story is a little different, and here we start to learn a new lesson: although the vast majority of trials are conducted by the industry, with the result that they set the tone for the community, this phenomenon is not limited to the commercial sector.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0By 1997 there were already four studies in a systematic review \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on this approach. They found that studies with significant \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0results were two and a half times more likely to get \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0published than those without.24\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0A paper from 1998 looked at all trials from two groups of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0triallists sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health over \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the preceding ten years, and found, again, that studies with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0significant results were more likely to be published.25\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Another looked at drug trials notified to the Finnish National \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Agency, and found that 47 per cent of the positive results \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0were published, but only 11 per cent of the negative ones.26\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Another looked at all the trials that had passed through the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pharmacy department of an eye hospital since 1963: 93 per \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cent of the significant results were published, but only 70 per \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cent of the negative ones.27\n\nThe point being made in this blizzard of data is simple: this is not an under-researched area; the evidence has been with us for a long time, and it is neither contradictory nor ambiguous.\n\nTwo French studies in 2005 and 2006 took a new approach: they went to ethics committees, and got lists of all the studies they had approved, and then found out from the investigators whether the trials had produced positive or negative results, before finally tracking down the published academic papers.28 The first study found that significant results were twice as likely to be published; the second that they were four times as likely. In Britain, two researchers sent a questionnaire to all the lead investigators on 101 projects paid for by NHS R&D: it\u2019s not industry research, but it\u2019s worth noting anyway. This produced an unusual result: there was no statistically significant difference in the publication rates of positive and negative papers.29\n\nBut it\u2019s not enough simply to list studies. Systematically taking all the evidence that we have so far, what do we see overall?\n\nIt\u2019s not ideal to lump every study of this type together in one giant spreadsheet, to produce a summary figure on publication bias, because they are all very different, in different fields, with different methods. This is a concern in many meta-analyses (though it shouldn\u2019t be overstated: if there are lots of trials comparing one treatment against placebo, say, and they\u2019re all using the same outcome measurement, then you might be fine just lumping them all in together).\n\nBut you can reasonably put some of these studies together in groups. The most current systematic review on publication bias, from 2010, from which the examples above are taken, draws together the evidence from various fields.30 Twelve comparable studies follow up conference presentations, and taken together they find that a study with a significant finding is 1.62 times more likely to be published. For the four studies taking lists of trials from before they started, overall, significant results were 2.4 times more likely to be published. Those are our best estimates of the scale of the problem. They are current, and they are damning.\n\nAll of this missing data is not simply an abstract academic matter: in the real world of medicine, published evidence is used to make treatment decisions. This problem goes to the core of everything that doctors do, so it\u2019s worth considering in some detail what impact it has on medical practice. Firstly, as we saw in the case of reboxetine, doctors and patients are misled about the effects of the medicines they use, and can end up making decisions that cause avoidable suffering, or even death. We might also choose unnecessarily expensive treatments, having been misled into thinking they are more effective than cheaper older drugs. This wastes money, ultimately depriving patients of other treatments, since funding for health care is never infinite.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth being clear that this data is withheld from everyone in medicine, from top to bottom. NICE, for example, is the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, created by the British government to conduct careful, unbiased summaries of all the evidence on new treatments. It is unable either to identify or to access data that has been withheld by researchers or companies on a drug\u2019s effectiveness: NICE has no more legal right to that data than you or I do, even though it is making decisions about effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, on behalf of the NHS, for millions of people. In fact, as we shall see, the MHRA and EMA (the European Medicines Agency) \u2013 the regulators that decide which drugs can go on the market in the UK \u2013 often have access to this information, but do not share it with the public, with doctors, or with NICE. This is an extraordinary and perverse situation.\n\nSo, while doctors are kept in the dark, patients are exposed to inferior treatments, ineffective treatments, unnecessary treatments, and unnecessarily expensive treatments that are no better than cheap ones; governments pay for unnecessarily expensive treatments, and mop up the cost of harms created by inadequate or harmful treatment; and individual participants in trials, such as those in the TGN1412 study, are exposed to terrifying, life-threatening ordeals, resulting in lifelong scars, again quite unnecessarily.\n\nAt the same time, the whole of the research project in medicine is retarded, as vital negative results are held back from those who could use them. This affects everyone, but it is especially egregious in the world of \u2018orphan diseases\u2019, medical problems that affect only small numbers of patients, because these corners of medicine are already short of resources, and are neglected by the research departments of most drug companies, since the opportunities for revenue are thinner. People working on orphan diseases will often research existing drugs that have been tried and failed in other conditions, but that have theoretical potential for the orphan disease. If the data from earlier work on these drugs in other diseases is missing, then the job of researching them for the orphan disease is both harder and more dangerous: perhaps they have already been shown to have benefits or effects that would help accelerate research; perhaps they have already been shown to be actively harmful when used on other diseases, and there are important safety signals that would help protect future research participants from harm. Nobody can tell you.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most shamefully, when we allow unflattering data to go unpublished, we betray the patients who participated in these studies: the people who have given their bodies, and sometimes their lives, in the implicit belief that they are doing something to create new knowledge, that will benefit others in the same position as them in the future. In fact, their belief is not implicit: often it\u2019s exactly what we tell them, as researchers, and it is a lie, because the data might be withheld, and we know it.\n\nSo whose fault is this?\n\nWhy do negative trials disappear?\n\nIn a moment we will see more clear cases of drug companies withholding data \u2013 in stories where we can identify individuals \u2013 sometimes with the assistance of regulators. When we get to these, I hope your rage might swell. But first, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to recognise that publication bias occurs outside commercial drug development, and in completely unrelated fields of academia, where people are motivated only by reputation, and their own personal interests.\n\nIn many respects, after all, publication bias is a very human process. If you\u2019ve done a study and it didn\u2019t have an exciting, positive result, then you might wrongly conclude that your experiment isn\u2019t very interesting to other researchers. There\u2019s also the issue of incentives: academics are often measured, rather unhelpfully, by crude metrics like the numbers of citations for their papers, and the number of \u2018high-impact\u2019 studies they get into glamorous well-read journals. If negative findings are harder to publish in bigger journals, and less likely to be cited by other academics, then the incentives to work at disseminating them are lower. With a positive finding, meanwhile, you get a sense of discovering something new. Everyone around you is excited, because your results are exceptional.\n\nOne clear illustration of this problem came in 2010. A mainstream American psychology researcher called Daryl Bem published a competent academic paper, in a well-respected journal, showing evidence of precognition, the ability to see into the future.fn1 These studies were well-designed, and the findings were statistically significant, but many people weren\u2019t very convinced, for the same reasons you aren\u2019t: if humans really could see into the future, we\u2019d probably know about it already; and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, rather than one-off findings.\n\nBut in fact the study has been replicated, though Bem\u2019s positive results have not been. At least two groups of academics have rerun several of Bem\u2019s experiments, using the exact same methods, and both found no evidence of precognition. One group submitted their negative results to the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, \u2013 the very same journal that published Bem\u2019s paper in 2010 \u2013 and that journal rejected their paper out of hand. The editor even came right out and said it: we never publish studies that replicate other work.\n\nHere we see the same problem as in medicine: positive findings are more likely to be published than negative ones. Every now and then, a freak positive result is published showing, for example, that people can see into the future. Who knows how many psychologists have tried, over the years, to find evidence of psychic powers, running elaborate, time-consuming experiments, on dozens of subjects \u2013 maybe hundreds \u2013 and then found no evidence that such powers exist? Any scientist trying to publish such a \u2018So what?\u2019 finding would struggle to get a journal to take it seriously, at the best of times. Even with the clear target of Bem\u2019s paper on precognition, which was widely covered in serious newspapers across Europe and the USA, the academic journal with a proven recent interest in the question of precognition simply refused to publish a paper with a negative result. Yet replicating these findings was key \u2013 Bem himself said so in his paper \u2013 so keeping track of the negative replications is vital too.\n\nPeople working in real labs will tell you that sometimes an experiment can fail to produce a positive result many times before the outcome you\u2019re hoping for appears. What does that mean? Sometimes the failures will be the result of legitimate technical problems; but sometimes they will be vitally important statistical context, perhaps even calling the main finding of the research into question. Many research findings, remember, are not absolute black-and-white outcomes, but fragile statistical correlations. Under our current system, most of this contextual information about failure is just brushed under the carpet, and this has huge ramifications for the cost of replicating research, in ways that are not immediately obvious. For example, researchers failing to replicate an initial finding may not know if they\u2019ve failed because the original result was an overstated fluke, or because they\u2019ve made some kind of mistake in their methods. In fact, the cost of proving that a finding was wrong is vastly greater than the cost of making it in the first place, because you need to run the experiment many more times to prove the absence of a finding, simply because of the way that the statistics of detecting weak effects work; and you also need to be absolutely certain that you\u2019ve excluded all technical problems, to avoid getting egg on your face if your replication turns out to have been inadequate. These barriers to refutation may partly explain why it\u2019s so easy to get away with publishing findings that ultimately turn out to be wrong.31\n\nPublication bias is not just a problem in the more abstract corners of psychology research. In 2012 a group of researchers reported in the journal Nature how they tried to replicate fifty-three early laboratory studies of promising targets for cancer treatments: forty-seven of the fifty-three could not be replicated.32 This study has serious implications for the development of new drugs in medicine, because such unreplicable findings are not simply an abstract academic issue: researchers build theories on the back of them, trust that they\u2019re valid, and investigate the same idea using other methods. If they are simply being led down the garden path, chasing up fluke errors, then huge amounts of research money and effort are being wasted, and the discovery of new medical treatments is being seriously retarded.\n\nThe authors of the study were clear on both the cause of and the solution for this problem. Fluke findings, they explained, are often more likely to be submitted to journals \u2013 and more likely to be published \u2013 than boring, negative ones. We should give more incentives to academics for publishing negative results; but we should also give them more opportunity.\n\nThis means changing the behaviour of academic journals, and here we are faced with a problem. Although they are usually academics themselves, journal editors have their own interests and agendas, and have more in common with everyday journalists and newspaper editors than some of them might wish to admit, as the episode of the precognition experiment above illustrates very clearly. Whether journals like this are a sensible model for communicating research at all is a hotly debated subject in academia, but this is the current situation. Journals are the gatekeepers, they make decisions on what\u2019s relevant and interesting for their audience, and they compete for readers.\n\nThis can lead them to behave in ways that don\u2019t reflect the best interests of science, because an individual journal\u2019s desire to provide colourful content might conflict with the collective need to provide a comprehensive picture of the evidence. In newspaper journalism, there is a well-known aphorism: \u2018When a dog bites a man, that\u2019s not news; but when a man bites a dog \u2026\u2019 These judgements on newsworthiness in mainstream media have even been demonstrated quantitatively. One study in 2003, for example, looked at the BBC\u2019s health news coverage over several months, and calculated how many people had to die from a given cause for one story to appear. 8,571 people died from smoking for each story about smoking; but there were three stories for every death from new variant CJD, or \u2018mad cow disease\u2019.33 Another, in 1992, looked at print-media coverage of drug deaths, and found that you needed 265 deaths from paracetamol poisoning for one story about such a death to appear in a paper; but every death from MDMA received, on average, one piece of news coverage.34\n\nIf similar judgements are influencing the content of academic journals, then we have a problem. But can it really be the case that academic journals are the bottleneck, preventing doctors and academics from having access to unflattering trial results about the safety and effectiveness of the drugs they use? This argument is commonly deployed by industry, and researchers too are often keen to blame journals for rejecting negative findings en masse. Luckily, this has been the subject of some research; and overall, while journals aren\u2019t blameless, it\u2019s hard to claim that they are the main source of this serious public-health problem. This is especially so since there are whole academic journals dedicated to publishing clinical trials, with a commitment to publishing negative results written into their constitutions.\n\nBut to be kind, for the sake of completeness, and because industry and researchers are so keen to pass the blame on to academic journals, we can see if what they claim is true.\n\nOne survey simply asked the authors of unpublished work if they had ever submitted it for publication. One hundred and twenty-four unpublished results were identified, by following up on every study approved by a group of US ethics committees, and when the researchers contacted the teams behind the unpublished results, it turned out that only six papers had ever actually been submitted and rejected.35 Perhaps, you might say, this was a freak finding. Another approach is to follow up all the papers submitted to one journal, and see if those with negative results are rejected more often. Where this has been tried, the journals seem blameless: 745 manuscripts submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) were followed up, and there was no difference in acceptance rate for significant and non-significant findings.36 The same thing has been tried with papers submitted to the BMJ, the Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine and the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.37 Again and again, no effect was found. Some have argued that this might still represent evidence of editorial bias, if academics know that manuscripts with negative results have to be of higher quality before submission, to get past editors\u2019 prejudices. It\u2019s also possible that the journals played fair when they knew they were being watched, although turning around an entire publishing operation for one brief performance would be tough.\n\nThese studies all involved observing what has happened in normal practice. One last option is to run an experiment, sending identical papers to various journals, but changing the direction of the results at random, to see if that makes any difference to the acceptance rates. This isn\u2019t something you\u2019d want to do very often, because it wastes a lot of people\u2019s time; but since publication bias matters, it has been regarded as a justifiable intrusion on a few occasions.\n\nIn 1990 a researcher called Epstein created a series of fictitious papers, with identical methods and presentation, differing only in whether they reported positive or negative results. He sent them at random to 146 social-work journals: the positive papers were accepted 35 per cent of the time, and the negative ones 26 per cent of the time, a difference that wasn\u2019t large enough to be statistically significant.38\n\nOther studies have tried something similar on a smaller scale, not submitting a paper to a journal, but rather, with the assistance of the journal, sending spoof academic papers to individual peer reviewers: these people do not make the final decision on publication, but they do give advice to editors, so a window into their behaviour would be useful. These studies have had more mixed results. In one from 1977, sham papers with identical methods but different results were sent to seventy-five reviewers. Some bias was found from reviewers against findings that disagreed with their own views.39\n\nAnother study, from 1994, looked at reviewers\u2019 responses to a paper on TENS machines: these are fairly controversial devices sold for pain relief. Thirty-three reviewers with strong views one way or the other were identified, and again it was found that their judgements on the paper were broadly correlated with their pre-existing views, though the study was small.40 Another paper did the same thing with papers on quack treatments; it found that the direction of findings had no effect on reviewers from mainstream medical journals deciding whether to accept them.41\n\nOne final randomised trial from 2010 tried on a grand scale to see if reviewers really do reject ideas based on their pre-existing beliefs (a good indicator of whether journals are biased by results, when they should be focused simply on whether a study is properly designed and conducted). Fabricated papers were sent to over two hundred reviewers, and they were all identical, except for the results they reported: half of the reviewers got results they would like, half got results they wouldn\u2019t. Reviewers were more likely to recommend publication if they received the version of the manuscript with results they\u2019d like (97 per cent vs 80 per cent), more likely to detect errors in a manuscript whose results they didn\u2019t like, and rated the methods more highly in papers whose results they liked.42\n\nOverall, though, even if there are clearly rough edges in some domains, these results don\u2019t suggest that the journals are the main cause of the problem of the disappearance of negative trials. In the experiments isolating the peer reviewers, those individual referees were biased in some studies, but they don\u2019t have the last word on publication, and in all the studies which look at what happens to negative papers submitted to journals in the real world, the evidence suggests that they proceed into print without problems. Journals may not be entirely innocent \u2013 The Trouble With Medical Journals by Richard Smith, previously editor of the BMJ, is an excellent overview of their faults;43 and we will see later how they fail to police important and simple flaws in studies. But it would be wrong to lay the blame for publication bias entirely at their door.\n\nIn the light of all this, the data on what researchers say about their own behaviour is very revealing. In various surveys they have said that they thought there was no point in submitting negative results, because they would just be rejected by journals: 20 per cent of medical researchers said so in 1998;44 61 per cent of psychology and education researchers said so in 1991;45 and so on.46 If asked why they\u2019ve failed to send in research for publication, the most common reasons researchers give are negative results, a lack of interest, or a lack of time.\n\nThis is the more abstract end of academia \u2013 largely away from the immediate world of clinical trials \u2013 but it seems that academics are mistaken, at best, about the reasons why negative results go missing. Journals may pose some barriers to publishing negative results, but they are hardly absolute, and much of the problem lies in academics\u2019 motivations and perceptions.\n\nMore than that, in recent years, the era of open-access academic journals has got going in earnest: there are now several, such as Trials, which are free to access, and have a core editorial policy that they will accept any trial report, regardless of result, and will actively solicit negative findings. Trials registers like clinicaltrials.gov will also post results. With offers like this on the table, it is very hard to believe that anyone would really struggle to disseminate the findings of a trial with a negative result if they wanted to. And yet, despite this, negative results continue to go missing, with vast multinational companies simply withholding results on their drugs, even though academics and doctors are desperate to see them.\n\nYou might reasonably wonder whether there are people who are supposed to prevent this kind of data from being withheld. The universities where research takes place, for example; or the regulators; or the \u2018ethics committees\u2019, which are charged with protecting patients who participate in research. Unfortunately, our story is about to take a turn to the dark side. We will see that many of the very people and organisations we would have expected to protect patients from the harm inflicted by missing data have, instead, shirked their responsibilities; and worse than that, we will see that many of them have actively conspired in helping companies to withhold data from patients. We are about to hit some big problems, some bad people, and some simple solutions.\n\nHow ethics committees and universities have failed us\n\nBy now, you will, I hope, share my view that withholding results from clinical trials is unethical, for the simple reason that hidden data exposes patients to unnecessary and avoidable harm. But the ethical transgressions here go beyond the simple harm inflicted on future patients.\n\nPatients and the public participate in clinical trials at some considerable cost to themselves: they expose themselves to hassle and intrusion, because clinical trials almost always require that you have more check-ups on your progress, more blood tests, and more examinations; but participants may also expose themselves to more risk, or the chance of receiving an inferior treatment. People do this out of altruism, on the implicit understanding that the results from their experience will contribute to improving our knowledge of what works and what doesn\u2019t, and so will help other patients in the future. In fact, this understanding isn\u2019t just implicit: in many trials it\u2019s explicit, because patients are specifically told when they sign up to participate that the data will be used to inform future decisions. If this isn\u2019t true, and the data can be withheld at the whim of a researcher or a company, then the patients have been actively lied to. That is very bad news.\n\nSo what are the formal arrangements between patients, researchers and sponsors? In any sensible world, we\u2019d expect universal contracts, making it clear that all researchers are obliged to publish their results, and that industry sponsors \u2013 which have a huge interest in positive results \u2013 must have no control over the data. But despite everything we know about industry-funded research being systematically biased, this does not happen. In fact, quite the opposite is true: it is entirely normal for researchers and academics conducting industry-funded trials to sign contracts subjecting them to gagging clauses which forbid them to publish, discuss or analyse data from the trials they have conducted, without the permission of the funder. This is such a secretive and shameful situation that even trying to document it in public can be a fraught business, as we shall now see.\n\nIn 2006 a paper was published in JAMA describing how common it was for researchers doing industry-funded trials to have these kinds of constraints placed on their right to publish the results.47 The study was conducted by the Nordic Cochrane Centre, and it looked at all the trials given approval to go ahead in Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. (If you\u2019re wondering why these two cities were chosen, it was simply a matter of practicality, and the bizarre secrecy that shrouds this world: the researchers applied elsewhere without success, and were specifically refused access to data in the UK.48) These trials were overwhelmingly sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry (98 per cent), and the rules governing the management of the results tell a story which walks the now-familiar line between frightening and absurd.\n\nFor sixteen of the forty-four trials the sponsoring company got to see the data as it accumulated, and in a further sixteen they had the right to stop the trial at any time, for any reason. This means that a company can see if a trial is going against it, and can interfere as it progresses. As we will see later (early stopping, breaking protocols, pp.186, 202), this distorts a trial\u2019s results with unnecessary and hidden biases. For example, if you stop a trial early because you have been peeking at the preliminary results, then you can either exaggerate a modest benefit, or bury a worsening negative result. Crucially, the fact that the sponsoring company had this opportunity to introduce bias wasn\u2019t mentioned in any of the published academic papers reporting the results of these trials, so nobody reading the literature could possibly know that these studies were subject \u2013 by design \u2013 to such an important flaw.\n\nEven if the study was allowed to finish, the data could still be suppressed. There were constraints on publication rights in forty of the forty-four trials, and in half of them the contracts specifically stated that the sponsor either owned the data outright (what about the patients, you might say?), or needed to approve the final publication, or both. None of these restrictions was mentioned in any of the published papers, and in fact, none of the protocols or papers said that the sponsor had full access to all the data from the trial, or the final say on whether to publish.\n\nIt\u2019s worth taking a moment to think about what this means. The results of all these trials were subject to a bias that will significantly distort the academic literature, because trials that show early signs of producing a negative result (or trials that do produce a negative result) can be deleted from the academic record; but nobody reading these trials could possibly have known that this opportunity for censorship existed.\n\nThe paper I\u2019ve just described was published in JAMA, one of the biggest medical journals in the world. Shortly afterwards, a shocking tale of industry interference appeared in the BMJ.49 Lif, the Danish pharmaceutical industry association, responded to the paper by announcing in the Journal of the Danish Medical Association that it was \u2018both shaken and enraged about the criticism, that could not be recognised\u2019. It demanded an investigation of the scientists, though it failed to say by whom, or of what. Then Lif wrote to the Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty, accusing the Cochrane researchers of scientific misconduct. We can\u2019t see the letter, but the Cochrane researchers say the allegations were extremely serious \u2013 they were accused of deliberately distorting the data \u2013 but vague, and without documents or evidence to back them up.\n\nNonetheless, the investigation went on for a year, because in academia people like to do things properly, and assume that all complaints are made in good faith. Peter G\u00f8tzsche, the director of the Cochrane centre, told the BMJ that only Lif\u2019s third letter, ten months into this process, made specific allegations that could be investigated by the committee. Two months later the charges were dismissed. The Cochrane researchers had done nothing wrong. But before they were cleared, Lif copied the letters alleging scientific dishonesty to the hospital where four of them worked, and to the management organisation running that hospital, and sent similar letters to the Danish Medical Association, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science, and so on. G\u00f8tzsche and his colleagues said that they felt \u2018intimidated and harassed\u2019 by Lif\u2019s behaviour. Lif continued to insist that the researchers were guilty of misconduct even after the investigation was completed. So, researching in this area is not easy: it\u2019s hard to get funding, and the industry will make your work feel like chewing on a mouthful of wasps.\n\nEven though the problem has been widely recognised, attempts to fix it have failed.50 The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, for example, stood up in 2001, insisting that the lead author of any study it published must sign a document stating that the researchers had full access to the data, and full control over the decision to publish. Researchers at Duke University, North Carolina, then surveyed the contracts between medical schools and industry sponsors, and found that this edict was flouted as a matter of routine. They recommended boilerplate contracts for the relationship between industry and academia. Was this imposed? No. Sponsors continue to control the data.\n\nHalf a decade later, a major study in the New England Journal of Medicine investigated whether anything had changed.51 Administrators at all 122 accredited medical schools in the US were asked about their contracts (to be clear, this wasn\u2019t a study of what they did; rather it was a study of what they were willing to say in public). The majority said contract negotiations over the right to publish data were \u2018difficult\u2019. A worrying 62 per cent said it was OK for the clinical trial agreement between academics and industry sponsor to be confidential. This is a serious problem, as it means that anyone reading a study cannot know how much interference was available to the sponsor, which is important context for the person reading and interpreting the research. Half of the centres allowed the sponsor to draft the research paper, which is another interesting hidden problem in medicine, as biases and emphases can be quietly introduced (as we shall see in more detail in Chapter 6). Half said it was OK for contracts to forbid researchers sharing data after the research was completed and published, once again hindering research. A quarter said it was acceptable for the sponsor to insert its own statistical analyses into the manuscript. Asked about disputes, 17 per cent of administrators had seen an argument about who had control of data in the preceding year.\n\nSometimes, disputes over access to such data can cause serious problems in academic departments, when there is a divergence of views on what is ethical. Aubrey Blumsohn was a senior lecturer at Sheffield University, working on a project funded by Procter & Gamble to research an osteoporosis drug called risedronate.52 The aim was to analyse blood and urine samples from an earlier trial, led by Blumsohn\u2019s head of department, Professor Richard Eastell. After signing the contracts, P&G sent over some \u2018abstracts\u2019, brief summaries of the findings, with Blumsohn\u2019s name as first author, and some summary results tables. That\u2019s great, said Blumsohn, but I\u2019m the researcher here: I\u2019d like to see the actual raw data and analyse it myself. The company declined, saying that this was not their policy. Blumsohn stood his ground, and the papers were left unpublished. Then, however, Blumsohn saw that Eastell had published another paper with P&G, stating that all the researchers had \u2018had full access to the data and analyses\u2019. He complained, knowing this was not true. Blumsohn was suspended by Sheffield University, which offered him a gagging clause and \u00a3145,000, and he was eventually forced out of his job. Eastell, meanwhile, was censured by the General Medical Council, but only after a staggering delay of several years, and he remains in post.\n\nSo contracts that permit companies and researchers to withhold or control data are common, and they\u2019re bad news. But that\u2019s not just because they lead to doctors and patients being misled about what works. They also break another vitally important contract: the agreement between researchers and the patients who participate in their trials.\n\nPeople participate in trials believing that the results of that research will help to improve the treatment of patients like them in the future. This isn\u2019t just speculation: one of the few studies to ask patients why they have participated in a trial found that 90 per cent believed they were making a \u2018major\u2019 or \u2018moderate\u2019 contribution to society, and 84 per cent felt proud that they were making this contribution.53 Patients are not stupid or na\u00efve to believe this, because it is what they are told on the consent forms they sign before participating in trials. But they are mistaken, because the results of trials are frequently left unpublished, and withheld from doctors and patients. These signed consent forms therefore mislead people on two vitally important points. Firstly, they fail to tell the truth: that the person conducting the trial, or the person paying for it, may decide not to publish the results, depending on how they look at the end of the study. And worse than that, they also explicitly state a falsehood: researchers tell patients that they are participating in order to create knowledge that will be used to improve treatment in future, even though the researchers know that in many cases, those results will never be published.\n\nThere is only one conclusion that we can draw from this: consent forms routinely lie to patients participating in trials. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, made all the more extraordinary by the huge amounts of red tape that everyone involved in a trial must negotiate, closely monitoring endless arcane pieces of paperwork, and ensuring that patients are fully informed on the minutiae of their treatment. Despite all this regulatory theatre, which hinders good research on routine practice (as we shall see \u2013 p.232), we allow these forms to tell patients outright lies about the control of data, and we fail to police one of the most important ethical problems in the whole of medicine. The deceit of these consent forms is, to me, a good illustration of how broken and outdated the regulatory frameworks of medicine have become. But it also, finally, poses a serious problem for the future of research.\n\nWe desperately need patients to continue to believe that they are contributing to society, because trial recruitment is in crisis, and it is increasingly hard to persuade patients to participate at all. In one recent study, a third of all trials failed to reach their original recruitment target, and more than half had to be awarded an extension.54 If word gets out that trials are often more promotional than genuinely scientific, recruitment will become even more difficult. The answer is not to hide this problem, but rather to fix it.\n\nSo universities and ethics committees may have failed us, but there is one group of people we might expect to step up, to try to show some leadership on missing trial data. These are the medical and academic professional bodies, the Royal Colleges of General Practice, Surgery and Physicians, the General Medical Council, the British Medical Association, the pharmacists\u2019 organisations, the bodies representing each sub-specialty of academia, the respiratory physiologists, the pharmacologists, the Academy of Medical Sciences, and so on.\n\nThese organisations have the opportunity to set the tone of academic and clinical medicine, in their codes of conduct, their aspirations, and in some cases their rules, since some have the ability to impose sanctions, and all have the ability to exclude those who fail to meet basic ethical standards. We have established, I hope, beyond any doubt, that non-publication of trials in humans is research misconduct, that it misleads doctors and harms patients around the world. Have these organisations used their powers, stood up and announced, prominently and fiercely, that this must stop, and that they will take action?\n\nOne has: the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine, a small organisation of doctors \u2013 largely working in the industry \u2013 with 1,400 members. And none of the others have bothered.\n\nNot one.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThere are several simple solutions to these problems, which fall into three categories. There is no argument against any of the following suggestions that I am aware of. The issue of missing data has been neglected through institutional inertia, and reluctance by senior academics to challenge industry. Their failure to act harms patients every day.\n\nGagging clauses\n\nIf there is nothing to be ashamed of in gagging clauses \u2013 if companies, and legislators, and academics, and university contracts departments, all believe that they are acceptable \u2013 then everything should be out in the open, prominently flagged up, so that everyone outside those systems can decide if they agree.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Until they can be eradicated, where gagging clauses exist, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patients should be told, at the time they are invited to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0participate in a trial, that the company sponsoring it is allowed \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to hide the results if it doesn\u2019t like them. The consent form \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0should also explain clearly that withholding negative results \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0will lead to doctors and patients being misled about the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0effectiveness of the treatment being trialled, and so exposed \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to unnecessary harm. Trial participants can then decide for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0themselves if they think these contracts are acceptable.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Wherever the sponsoring company has the contractual right \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to gag publication, even if it doesn\u2019t exercise that right, the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fact that a gagging clause existed should be stated clearly: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the academic paper; in the trial protocol; and in the publicly \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0available trial registry entry that goes up before the trial \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0starts. Readers of the trial findings can then decide for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0themselves if they trust that sponsor and research group to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0publish all negative findings, and interpret any reported \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0positive findings in that light.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0All university contracts should follow the same boilerplate \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0format, and forbid gagging clauses. Failing that, all universities \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0should be forced to prominently declare which contracts \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with gagging clauses they have permitted, and to publish those \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0clauses online for all to see, so that all can be alerted that the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0institution is producing systematically biased research, and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0discount any findings from them accordingly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0In legislation, gagging clauses should be made illegal, with no \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0possibility of quibbles. If there is a dispute about analysis or \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0interpretation between the people running the trial and the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0people paying for it, it should take place in the published \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0academic literature, or some other public forum. Not in secret.\n\nProfessional bodies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0All professional bodies should take a clear stand on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unpublished trial data, declare it clearly as research \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0misconduct, and state that it will be handled like any other \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0form of serious misconduct that misleads doctors and harms \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patients.That they have not done so is a stain on the reputation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of these organisations, and on their senior members.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0All research staff involved in any trial on humans should be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regarded as jointly and severally liable for ensuring that it is \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0published in full within one year of completion.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.All those responsible for withholding trial data should have \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0their names prominently posted in a single database, so \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that others can be made aware of the risk of working with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0them, or allowing them access to patients for research, in \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0future.\n\nEthics committees\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.No person should be allowed to conduct trials in humans if a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0research project they are responsible for is currently \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0withholding trial data from publication more than one year \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0after completion. Where any researcher on a project has a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0previous track record of delayed publication of trial data, the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ethics committee should be notified, and this should be taken \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0into account, as with any researcher guilty of research \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0misconduct.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.No trial should be approved without a firm guarantee of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0publication within one year of completion.\n\nHow regulators and journals have failed us\n\nSo far we\u2019ve established that ethics committees, universities and the professional bodies of medical researchers have all failed to protect patients from publication bias, even though the selective non-publication of unflattering data is a serious issue for medicine. We know that it distorts and undermines every decision that researchers, doctors and patients make, and that it exposes patients to avoidable suffering and death. This is not seriously disputed, so you might reasonably imagine that governments, regulators and medical journals must all have tried to address it.\n\nThey have tried, and failed. Worse than simply failing, they have repeatedly provided what we might regard as \u2018fake fixes\u2019: we have seen small changes in regulations and practices, announced with great fanfare, but then either ignored or bypassed. This has given false reassurance to doctors, academics and the public that the problem has been fixed. What follows is the story of these fake fixes.\n\nRegisters\n\nThe earliest and simplest solution proposed was to open registers of trials: if people are compelled to publish their protocol, in full, before they start work, then we at least have the opportunity to go back and check to see if they\u2019ve published the trials that they\u2019ve conducted. This is very useful, for a number of reasons. A trial protocol describes in great technical detail everything that researchers will do in a trial: how many patients they\u2019ll recruit, where they\u2019ll come from, how they\u2019ll be divided up, what treatment each group will get, and what outcome will be measured to establish if the treatment was successful. Because of this, it can be used to check whether a trial was published, but also whether its methods were distorted along the way, in a manner that would allow the results to be exaggerated (as described in Chapter 4).\n\nThe first major paper to call for a registry of clinical trial protocols was published in 1986,55 and it was followed by a flood. In 1990 Iain Chalmers (we can call him Sir Iain Chalmers if you likefn2) published a classic paper called \u2018Underreporting Research is Scientific Misconduct\u2019,57 and he has traced the chequered history of trials registers in the UK.58 In 1992, as the Cochrane Collaboration began to gather influence, representatives of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) asked to meet Chalmers.59 After explaining the work of Cochrane, and the vital importance of summarising all the trial results on a particular drug, he explained very clearly to them how biased under-reporting of results harms patients.\n\nThe industry\u2019s representatives were moved, and soon they took action. Mike Wallace, the chief executive of Schering and a member of that ABPI delegation, agreed with Chalmers that withholding data was ethically and scientifically indefensible, and said that he planned to do something concrete to prevent it, if only to protect the industry from having the issue forced upon it in less welcome terms. Wallace stepped out of line from his colleagues, and committed to registering every trial conducted by his company with Cochrane. This was not a popular move, and he was reprimanded by colleagues, in particular those from other companies.\n\nBut then GlaxoWellcome followed suit, and in 1998 its chief executive, Richard Sykes, wrote an editorial in the BMJ called \u2018Being a modern pharmaceutical company involves making information available on clinical trial programmes\u2019.60 \u2018Programmes\u2019 was the crucial word, because as we\u2019ve seen, and as we shall see in greater detail later, you can only make sense of individual findings if you assess them in the context of all the work that has been done on a drug.\n\nGlaxoWellcome set up a clinical trials registry, and Elizabeth Wager, the head of the company\u2019s medical writers group, pulled together a group from across the industry to develop ethical guidelines for presenting research. The ABPI, seeing individual companies take the lead, saw the writing on the wall: it decided to commend GlaxoWellcome\u2019s policy to the whole industry, and launched this initiative at a press conference where Chalmers \u2013 a strong critic \u2013 sat on the same side of the table as the industry. AstraZeneca, Aventis, MSD, Novartis, Roche, Schering Healthcare and Wyeth began registering some of their trials \u2013 only the ones involving UK patients, and retrospectively \u2013 but there was movement at last.\n\nAt the same time, there was movement in America. The 1997 FDA Modernization Act created clinicaltrials.gov, a register run by the US government National Institutes of Health. This legislation required that trials should be registered, but only if they related to an application to put a new drug on the market, and even then, only if it was for a serious or life-threatening disease. The register opened in 1998, and the website clinicaltrials.gov went online in 2000. The entry criteria were widened in 2004.\n\nBut soon it all began to fall apart. GlaxoWellcome merged with SmithKline Beecham to become GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and initially the new logo appeared on the old trials register. Iain Chalmers wrote to Jean-Paul Garnier, the chief executive of the new company, to thank him for maintaining this valuable transparency: but no reply ever came. The registry website was closed, and the contents were lost (though GSK was later forced to open a new register, as part of a settlement with the US government over the harm caused by its withholding of data on new drug trials just a couple of years later). Elizabeth Wager, the author of the Good Publication Practice guidelines for drug companies, was out of a job, as her writing department at GSK was closed. Her guidelines were ignored.61\n\nFrom the moment that these registries were first suggested, and then opened, it was implicitly assumed that the shame of producing this public record, and then not publishing your study, would be enough to ensure that people would do the right thing. But the first problem for the US register, which could have been used universally, was that people simply chose not to use it. The regulations required only a very narrow range of trials to be posted, and nobody else was in a hurry to post their trials if they didn\u2019t have to.\n\nIn 2004 the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) \u2013 a collection of editors from the most influential journals in the world \u2013 published a policy statement, announcing that none of them would publish any clinical trials after 2005, unless they had been properly registered before they began.62 They did this, essentially, to force the hand of the industry and researchers: if a trial has a positive result, then people desperately want to publish it in the most prestigious journal they can find. Although they had no legal force, the journal editors did have the thing that companies and researchers wanted most: the chance of a major journal publication. By insisting on pre-registration, they were doing what they could to force researchers and industry sponsors to register all trials. Everyone rejoiced: the problem had been fixed.\n\nIf you think it seems odd \u2013 and perhaps unrealistic \u2013 that fixing this crucial flaw in the information architecture of a $700 billion industry should be left to an informal gathering of a few academic editors, with no legislative power, then you\u2019d be right. Although everybody began to talk as if publication bias was a thing of the past, in reality it was continuing just as before, because the journal editors simply ignored their own threats and promises. Later (pp.247, 307) we will see the phenomenal financial inducements on offer to editors for publishing positive industry papers, which can extend to millions of dollars in reprint and advertising revenue. But first we should look at what they actually did after their solemn promise in 2005.\n\nIn 2008 a group of researchers went through every single trial published in the top ten medical journals, every one of which was a member of the ICMJE, after the deadline for pre-registration. Out of 323 trials published during 2008 in these high-impact academic journals, only half were adequately registered (before the trial, with the main outcome measure properly specified), and trial registration was entirely lacking for over a quarter.63 The ICMJE editors had simply failed to keep their word.\n\nMeanwhile, in Europe, there were some very bizarre developments. With enormous fanfare, the European Medicines Agency created a registry of trials called EudraCT. EU legislation requires all trials to be posted here if they involve any patients in Europe, and many companies will tell you that they\u2019ve met their responsibilities for transparency by doing so. But the contents of this EU register have been kept entirely secret. I can tell you that it contains around 30,000 trials, since that figure is in the public domain, but that is literally all I know, and all anyone can know. Despite EU legislation requiring that the public should be given access to the contents of this register, it remains closed. This creates an almost laughable paradox: the EU clinical trials register is a transparency tool, held entirely in secret. Since March 2011, after heavy media criticism (from me at any rate), a subset of trials has slowly been made public through a website called EudraPharm. As of summer 2012, although the agency now claims that its register is accessible to all, at least 10,000 trials are still missing, and the search engine doesn\u2019t work properly.64 It\u2019s absolutely one of the strangest things I\u2019ve ever seen, and nobody other than the EU even regards this peculiar exercise as a trials register: I certainly don\u2019t, I doubt you do, and both the ICMJE and the World Health Organization have explicitly stated that EudraCT is not a meaningful register.\n\nBut new work was being done in the US, and it seemed sensible. In 2007 the FDA Amendment Act was passed. This is much tighter: it requires registration of all trials of any drug or device, at any stage of development other than \u2018first-in-man\u2019 tests, if they have any site in the US, or involve any kind of application to bring a new drug onto the market. It also imposes a startling new requirement: all results of all trials must be posted to clinicaltrials.gov, in abbreviated summary tables, within one year of completion, for any trial on any marketed drug that completes after 2007.\n\nOnce again, to great fanfare, everyone believed that the problem had been fixed. But it hasn\u2019t been, for two very important reasons.\n\nFirstly, unfortunately, despite the undoubted goodwill, requiring the publication of all trials starting from \u2018now\u2019 does absolutely nothing for medicine today. There is no imaginable clinic, anywhere in the world, at which medicine is practised only on the basis of trials that completed within the past three years, using only drugs that came to market since 2008. In fact, quite the opposite is true: the vast majority of drugs currently in use came to market over the past ten, twenty or thirty years, and one of the great challenges for the pharmaceutical industry today is to create drugs that are anything like as innovative as those that were introduced in what has come to be known as the \u2018golden era\u2019 of pharmaceutical research, when all the most widely used drugs, for all the most common diseases, were developed. Perhaps they were the \u2018low-lying fruit\u2019, plucked from the research tree, but in any case, these are the tablets we use.\n\nAnd crucially, it is for these drugs \u2013 the ones we actually use \u2013 that we need the evidence: from trials completed in 2005 or 1995. These are the drugs that we are prescribing completely blind, misled by a biased sample of trials, selectively published, with the unflattering data buried in secure underground data archives somewhere in the hills (I am told) of Cheshire.\n\nBut there is a second, more disturbing reason why these regulations should be taken with a pinch of salt: they have been widely ignored. A study published in January 2012 looked at the first slice of trials subject to mandatory reporting, and found that only one in five had met its obligation to post results.65 Perhaps this is not surprising: the fine for non-compliance is $10,000 a day, which sounds spectacular, until you realise that it\u2019s only $3.5 million a year, which is chickenfeed for a drug bringing in $4 billion a year. And what\u2019s more, no such fine has ever been levied, throughout the entire history of the legislation.\n\nSo that, in total, is why I regard the ICMJE, the FDA and the EU\u2019s claims to have addressed this problem as \u2018fake fixes\u2019. In fact, they have done worse than fail: they have given false reassurance that the problem has been fixed, false reassurance that it has gone away, and they have led us to take our eyes off the ball. For half a decade now, people in medicine and academia have talked about publication bias as if it was yesterday\u2019s problem, discovered in the 1990s and early 2000s, and swiftly fixed.\n\nBut the problem of missing data has not gone away, and soon we will see exactly how shameless some companies and regulators can be, in the very present day.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe ICMJE should keep its promises, the EU should be less risible, and the FDA Amendment Act 2007 should be muscularly enforced. But there are many more disappointments to come, so I will leave my action plan on missing data for later in this chapter.\n\nBlood from a stone: trying to get data from regulators\n\nSo far we\u2019ve established that doctors and patients have been failed by a range of different people and organisations, all of whom we might have expected to step up and fix the problem of missing data, since it harms patients in large numbers around the world. We have seen that governments take no action against those who fail to publish their results, despite the public pretence to the contrary; and that they take no action against those who fail to register their trials. We have seen that medical journal editors continue to publish unregistered trials, despite the public pretence that they have taken a stand. We have seen that ethics committees fail to insist on universal publication, despite their stated aim of protecting patients. And we have seen that professional bodies fail to take action against what is obviously research misconduct, despite evidence showing that the problem of missing data is of epidemic proportions.66\n\nWhile the published academic record is hopelessly distorted, you might hope that there is one final route which patients and doctors could use to get access to the results of clinical trials: the regulators, which receive large amounts of data from drug companies during the approval process, must surely have obligations to protect patients\u2019 safety? But this, sadly, is just one more example of how we are failed by the very bodies that are supposed to be protecting us.\n\nIn this section, we will see three key failures. Firstly, the regulators may not have the information in the first place. Secondly, the way in which they \u2018share\u2019 summary trial information with doctors and patients is broken and shabby. And finally, if you try to get all of the information that a drug company has provided \u2013 the long-form documents, where the bodies are often buried \u2013 then regulators present bizarre barriers, blocking and obfuscating for several years at a time, even on drugs that turn out to be ineffective and harmful. Nothing of what I am about to tell you is in any sense reassuring.\n\nOne: Information is withheld from regulators\n\nParoxetine is a commonly used antidepressant, from the class of drugs known as \u2018selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\u2019, or SSRIs. You will hear more about this class of drugs later in this book, but here we will use paroxetine to show how companies have exploited our longstanding permissiveness about missing trials, and found loopholes in our inadequate regulations on trial disclosure. We will see that GSK withheld data about whether paroxetine works as an antidepressant, and even withheld data about its harmful side effects, but most importantly, we will see that what it did was all entirely legal.\n\nTo understand why, we first need to go through a quirk of the licensing process. Drugs do not simply come onto the market for use in all medical conditions: for any specific use of any drug, in any specific disease, you need a separate marketing authorisation. So, a drug might be licensed to treat ovarian cancer, for example, but not breast cancer. That doesn\u2019t mean the drug doesn\u2019t work in breast cancer. There might well be some evidence that it\u2019s great for treating that disease too, but maybe the company hasn\u2019t gone to the trouble and expense of getting a formal marketing authorisation for that specific use. Doctors can still go ahead and prescribe it for breast cancer, if they want, because the drug is available for prescription, and there are boxes of it sitting in pharmacies waiting to go out (even though, strictly speaking, it\u2019s only got marketing approval for use in ovarian cancer). In this situation the doctor will be prescribing the drug legally, but \u2018off-label\u2019.\n\nThis is fairly common, as getting a marketing authorisation for a specific use can be time-consuming and expensive. If doctors know that there\u2019s a drug which has been shown in good-quality trials to help treat a disease, it would be perverse and unhelpful of them not to prescribe it, just because the company hasn\u2019t applied for a formal licence to market it for that specific use. I\u2019ll discuss the ins and outs of all this in more detail later. But for now, what you need to know is that the use of a drug in children is treated as a separate marketing authorisation from its use in adults.\n\nThis makes sense in many cases, because children can respond to drugs in very different ways to adults, so the risks and benefits might be very different, and research needs to be done in children separately. But this licensing quirk also brings some disadvantages. Getting a licence for a specific use is an arduous business, requiring lots of paperwork, and some specific studies. Often this will be so expensive that companies will not bother to get a licence specifically to market a drug for use in children, because that market is usually much smaller.\n\nBut once a drug is available in a country for one specific thing, as we have seen, it can then be prescribed for absolutely anything. So it is not unusual for a drug to be licensed for use in adults, but then prescribed for children on the back of a hunch; or a judgement that it should at least do no harm; or studies that suggest benefit in children, but that would probably be insufficient to get through the specific formal process of getting marketing authorisation for use in kids; or even good studies, but in a disease where the market is so small that the company can\u2019t be bothered to get a marketing approval for use in children.\n\nRegulators have recognised that there is a serious problem with drugs being used in children \u2018off-label\u2019, without adequate research, so recently they have started to offer incentives for companies to conduct the research, and formally seek these licences. The incentives are patent extensions, and these can be lucrative. All drugs slip into the public domain about a decade after coming onto the market, and become like paracetamol, which anyone can make very cheaply. If a company is given a six-month extension on a drug, for all uses, then it can make a lot more money from that medicine. This seems a good example of regulators being pragmatic, and thinking creatively about what carrots they can offer. Licensed use in children will probably not itself make a company much extra money, since doctors are prescribing the drug for children already, even without a licence or good evidence, simply because there are no other options. Meanwhile, six months of extra patent life for a blockbuster drug will be very lucrative, if its adult market is large enough.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of debate about whether the drug companies have played fair with these offers. For example, since the FDA started offering this deal, about a hundred drugs have been given paediatric licences, but many of them were for diseases that aren\u2019t very common in children, like stomach ulcers, or arthritis. There have been far fewer applications for less lucrative products that could be used in children, such as more modern medicines called \u2018large-molecule biologics\u2019. But there it is.\n\nWhen GSK applied for a marketing authorisation in children for paroxetine, an extraordinary situation came to light, triggering the longest investigation in the history of UK drugs regulation. This investigation was published in 2008, and examined whether GSK should face criminal charges.67 It turned out that what the company had done \u2013 withholding important data about safety and effectiveness that doctors and patients clearly needed to see \u2013 was plainly unethical, and put children around the world at risk; but our laws are so weak that GSK could not be charged with any crime.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2002 GSK conducted nine trials of paroxetine in children.68 The first two failed to show any benefit, but the company made no attempt to inform anyone of this by changing the \u2018drug label\u2019 that is sent to all doctors and patients. In fact, after these trials were completed, an internal company management document stated: \u2018it would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine\u2019. In the year after this secret internal memo, 32,000 prescriptions were issued to children for paroxetine in the UK alone: so, while the company knew the drug didn\u2019t work in children, it was in no hurry to tell doctors that, despite knowing that large numbers of children were taking it. More trials were conducted over the coming years \u2013 nine in total \u2013 and none showed that the drug was effective at treating depression in children.\n\nIt gets much worse than that. These children weren\u2019t simply receiving a drug that the company knew to be ineffective for them: they were also being exposed to side effects. This should be self-evident, since any effective treatment will have some side effects, and doctors factor this in, alongside the benefits (which in this case were non-existent). But nobody knew how bad these side effects were, because the company didn\u2019t tell doctors, or patients, or even the regulator about the worrying safety data from its trials. This was because of a loophole (on which more in a couple of pages\u2019 time): you only had to tell the regulator about side effects reported in studies looking at the specific uses for which the drug has a marketing authorisation. Because the use of paroxetine in children was \u2018off-label\u2019, GSK had no legal obligation at the time to tell anyone about what it had found.\n\nPeople had worried for a long time that paroxetine might increase the risk of suicide, though that is quite a difficult side effect to detect in an antidepressant, because people with depression are at a much higher risk of suicide than the general population anyway, as a result of their depression. There are also some grounds to believe that as patients first come out of their depression, and leave behind the sluggish lack of motivation that often accompanies profound misery, there may be a period during which they are more capable of killing themselves, just because of the depression slowly lifting.\n\nFurthermore, suicide is a mercifully rare event, which means you need a lot of people on a drug to detect an increased risk. Also, suicide is not always recorded accurately on death certificates, because coroners and doctors are reluctant to give a verdict that many would regard as shameful, so the signal you are trying to detect in the data \u2013 suicide \u2013 is going to be corrupted. Suicidal thoughts or behaviours that don\u2019t result in death are more common than suicide itself, so they should be easier to detect, but they too are hard to pick up in routinely collected data, because they\u2019re often not presented to doctors, and where they are, they can be coded in health records in all sorts of different ways, if they appear at all. Because of all these difficulties, you would want to have every scrap of data you could possibly cobble together on the question of whether these drugs cause suicidal thoughts or behaviour in children; and you would want a lot of experienced people, with a wide range of skills, all looking at the data and discussing it.\n\nIn February 2003, GSK spontaneously sent the MHRA a package of information on the risk of suicide on paroxetine, containing some analyses done in 2002 from adverse-event data in trials the company had held, going back a decade. This analysis showed that there was no increased risk of suicide. But it was misleading: although it was unclear at the time, data from trials in children had been mixed in with data from trials in adults, which had vastly greater numbers of participants. As a result, any sign of increased suicide risk among children on paroxetine had been completely diluted away.\n\nLater in 2003, GSK had a meeting with the MHRA to discuss another issue involving paroxetine. At the end of this meeting, the GSK representatives gave out a briefing document, explaining that the company was planning to apply later that year for a specific marketing authorisation to use paroxetine in children. They mentioned, while handing out the document, that the MHRA might wish to bear in mind a safety concern the company had noted: an increased risk of suicide among children with depression who received paroxetine, compared with those on dummy placebo pills.\n\nThis was vitally important side-effect data, being presented, after an astonishing delay, casually, through an entirely inappropriate and unofficial channel. GSK knew that the drug was being prescribed in children, and it knew that there were safety concerns in children, but it had chosen not to reveal that information. When it did share the data, it didn\u2019t flag it up as a clear danger in the current use of the drug, requiring urgent attention from the relevant department in the regulator; instead it presented it as part of an informal briefing about a future application. Although the data was given to completely the wrong team, the MHRA staff present at this meeting had the wit to spot that this was an important new problem. A flurry of activity followed: analyses were done, and within one month a letter was sent to all doctors advising them not to prescribe paroxetine to patients under the age of eighteen.\n\nHow is it possible that our systems for getting data from companies are so poor that they can simply withhold vitally important information showing that a drug is not only ineffective, but actively dangerous? There are two sets of problems here: firstly, access for regulators; and secondly, access for doctors.\n\nThere is no doubt that the regulations contain ridiculous loopholes, and it\u2019s dismal to see how GSK cheerfully exploited them. As I\u2019ve mentioned, the company had no legal duty to give over the information, because prescription of the drug in children was outside of paroxetine\u2019s formally licensed uses \u2013 even though GSK knew this was widespread. In fact, of the nine studies the company conducted, only one had its results reported to the MHRA, because that was the only one conducted in the UK.\n\nAfter this episode, the MHRA and the EU changed some of their regulations, though not adequately, and created an obligation for companies to hand over safety data for uses of a drug outside its marketing authorisation, closing the paroxetine loophole.\n\nThis whole incident illustrates a key problem, and it is one that recurs throughout this section of the book: you need all of the data in order to see what\u2019s happening with a drug\u2019s benefits, and risks. Some of the trials that GSK conducted were published in part, but that is obviously not enough: we already know that if we see only a biased sample of the data, we are misled. But we also need all the data for the more simple reason that we need lots of data: safety signals are often weak, subtle and difficult to detect. Suicidal thoughts and plans are rare in children \u2013 even those with depression, even those on paroxetine \u2013 so all the data from a large number of participants needed to be combined before the signal was detectable in the noise. In the case of paroxetine, the dangers only became apparent when the adverse events from all of the trials were pooled and analysed together.\n\nThat leads us to the second obvious flaw in the current system: the results of these trials \u2013 the safety data and the effectiveness data \u2013 are given in secret to the regulator, which then sits and quietly makes a decision. This is a huge problem, because you need many eyes on these difficult problems. I don\u2019t think that the people who work in the MHRA are bad, or incompetent: I know a lot of them, and they are smart, good people. But we shouldn\u2019t trust them to analyse this data alone, in the same way that we shouldn\u2019t trust any single organisation to analyse data alone, with nobody looking over its shoulder, checking the working, providing competition, offering helpful criticism, speeding it up, and so on.\n\nThis is even worse than academics failing to share their primary research data, because at least in an academic paper you get a lot of detail about what was done, and how. The output of a regulator is often simply a crude, brief summary: almost a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 about side effects. This is the opposite of science, which is only reliable because everyone shows their working, explains how they know that something is effective or safe, shares their methods and their results, and allows others to decide if they agree with the way they processed and analysed the data.\n\nYet for the safety and efficacy of drugs, one of the most important of all analyses done by science, we turn our back on this process completely: we allow it to happen behind closed doors, because drug companies have decided that they want to share their trial results discreetly with the regulators. So the most important job in evidence-based medicine, and a perfect example of a problem that benefits from many eyes and minds, is carried out alone and in secret.\n\nThis perverse and unhealthy secrecy extends way beyond regulators. NICE, the UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, is charged with making recommendations about which treatments are most cost-effective, and which work best. When it does this, it\u2019s in the same boat as you or me: it has absolutely no statutory right to see data on the safety or effectiveness of a drug, if a company doesn\u2019t want to release it, even though the regulators have all of that data. For \u2018single technology appraisals\u2019, on one treatment, they ask the company to make available to them the information the company thinks is relevant. For \u2018guidelines\u2019 on treatment in a whole area of medicine, they are more vulnerable to what is published in journals. As a result, even NICE can end up working on distorted, edited, biased samples of the data.\n\nSometimes NICE is able to access some extra unpublished data from the drug companies: this is information that doctors and patients aren\u2019t allowed to see, despite the fact that they are the people making decisions about whether to prescribe the drugs, or are actually taking them. But when NICE does get information in this way, it can come with strict conditions on confidentiality, leading to some very bizarre documents being published. On the opposite page, for example, is the NICE document discussing whether it\u2019s a good idea to have Lucentis, an extremely expensive drug, costing well over \u00a31,000 per treatment, that is injected into the eye for a condition called acute macular degeneration.\n\nAs you can see, the NICE document on whether this treatment is a good idea is censored. Not only is the data on the effectiveness of the treatment blanked out by thick black rectangles, in case any doctor or patient should see it; absurdly, even the names of some trials are missing, preventing the reader from even knowing of their existence, or cross referencing information about them. Most disturbing of all, as you can see in the last bullet point, the data on adverse events is also censored: I\u2019m reproducing the whole page here because I worry that it would otherwise be almost too bizarre for you to believe. This level of censorship isn\u2019t an everyday phenomenon; but it illustrates the absurdity of what medicine has come to accept, in professional documents that most people wouldn\u2019t bother to read.69\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t we all \u2013 doctors, patients and NICE \u2013 have access to the information on trials that regulators see? This is something I asked both Kent Woods from the MHRA, and Hans Georg Eichler, Medical Director of the European Medicines Agency, in 2010. Both, separately, gave me the same answer: people outside the agencies cannot be trusted with this information, because they might misinterpret it, either deliberately or through incompetence. Both, separately \u2013 though I guess they must chat at parties \u2013 raised the MMR vaccine scare, as the classic example of how the media can contrive a national panic on the basis of no good evidence, creating dangerous public-health problems along the way. What if they released raw safety data, and people who don\u2019t know how to analyse it properly found imaginary patterns, and created scares that put patients off taking life-saving medication?\n\nI accept that this is a risk, but I also believe their priorities are wrong: I think that the advantages of many eyes working on these vitally important problems are enormous, and the possibility of a few irrational scaremongers is no excuse for hiding data. Drug companies and regulators also both say that you can already get all the information you need from regulators\u2019 websites, in summary form.\n\nWe shall now see that this is untrue.\n\nTwo: Regulators make it hard to access the data they do have\n\nWhen exposed to criticism, drug companies often become indignant, and declare that they already share enough data for doctors and patients to be informed. \u2018We give everything to the regulator,\u2019 they say, \u2018and you can get it from them.\u2019 Similarly, regulators insist that all you need to do is look on their website, and you will easily find all the data you need. In reality, there is a messy game, in which doctors and academics trying to find all the data on a drug are sent around the houses, scrabbling for information that is both hard to find and fatally flawed.\n\nFirstly, as we\u2019ve already seen, regulators don\u2019t have all the trials, and they don\u2019t share all the ones that they do. Summary documents are available on the early trials used to get a drug onto the market in the first place, but only for the specific licensed uses of the drug. Even where the regulator has been given safety data for off-label uses (following the paroxetine case above) the information from these trials still isn\u2019t made publicly available through the regulator: it simply sits quietly in the regulator\u2019s files.\n\nFor example: duloxetine is another drug in fairly widespread use, which is usually given as an antidepressant. During a trial on its use for a completely different purpose \u2013 treating incontinence \u2013 there were apparently several suicides.70 This is important and interesting information, and the FDA holds the relevant data: it conducted a review on this issue, and came to a view on whether the risk was significant. But you cannot see any of that on the FDA website, because duloxetine never got a licence for use in treating incontinence.71 The trial data was only used by the FDA to inform its internal ruminations. This is an everyday situation.\n\nBut even when you are allowed to see trial results held by regulators, getting this information from their public websites is supremely tricky. The search functions on the FDA website are essentially broken, while the content is haphazard and badly organised, with lots missing, and too little information to enable you to work out if a trial was prone to bias by design. Once again \u2013 partly, here, through casual thoughtlessness and incompetence \u2013 it is impossible to get access to the basic information that we need. Drug companies and regulators deny this: they say that if you search their websites, everything is there. So let\u2019s walk, briefly, through the process in all its infuriating glory. The case I will use was published three years ago in JAMA as a useful illustration of how broken the FDA site has become:72 replicating it today, in 2012, nothing has changed.\n\nSo: let\u2019s say we want to find the results from all the trials the FDA has, on a drug called pregabalin, in which the drug is used to treat pain for diabetics whose nerves have been affected by their disease (a condition called \u2018diabetic peripheral neuropathy\u2019). You want the FDA review on this specific use, which is the PDF document containing all the trials in one big bundle. But if you search for \u2018pregabalin review\u2019, say, on the FDA website, you get over a hundred documents: none of them is clearly named, and not one of them is the FDA review document on pregabalin. If you type in the FDA application number \u2013 the unique identifier for the FDA document you\u2019re looking for \u2013 the FDA website comes up with nothing at all.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, or wise, you\u2019ll get dropped at the Drugs@FDA page: typing \u2018pregabalin\u2019 there brings up three \u2018FDA applications\u2019. Why three? Because there are three different documents, each on a different condition that pregabalin can be used to treat. The FDA site doesn\u2019t tell you which condition each of these three documents is for, so you have to use trial and error to try to find out. That\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. I have the correct document for pregabalin and diabetic peripheral neuropathy right here in front of me: it\u2019s almost four hundred pages long, but it doesn\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s about diabetic peripheral neuropathy until you get to here. There\u2019s no executive summary at the beginning \u2013 in fact, there\u2019s no title page, no contents page, no hint of what the document is even about, and it skips randomly from one sub-document to another, all scanned and bundled up in the same gigantic file.\n\nIf you\u2019re a nerd, you might think: these files are electronic; they\u2019re PDFs, a type of file specifically designed to make sharing electronic documents convenient. Any nerd will know that if you want to find something in an electronic document, it\u2019s easy: you just use the \u2018find\u2019 command: type in, say, \u2018peripheral neuropathy\u2019, and your computer will find the phrase straight off. But no: unlike almost any other serious government document in the world, the PDFs from the FDA are a series of photographs of pages of text, rather than the text itself. This means you cannot search for a phrase. Instead, you have to go through it, searching for that phrase, laboriously, by eye.\n\nI could go on. I will. There\u2019s some kind of \u2018table of contents\u2019 on the seventeenth page, but it gets the page numbers wrong. I\u2019ve finished now. There is simply no reason for this obfuscation and chaos. These problems aren\u2019t caused by technical issues specific to trials, and they would hardly cost any money at all to fix. This is plainly, simply, unhelpful, and the best we can hope is that it\u2019s driven by thoughtlessness.\n\nThat\u2019s a tragedy, because if you can unearth this document, and decode it, you will find that it is full of terrifying gems: perfect examples of situations in which a drug company has used dodgy statistical methods to design and analyse a study, in such a way that it is predestined \u2013 from the outset \u2013 to exaggerate the benefits of the drug.\n\nFor example, in the five trials on pregabalin and pain, lots of people dropped out during the study period. This is common in medical trials, as you will shortly see, and it often happens because people have found a drug to be unhelpful, or have had bad side effects. During these trials you\u2019re measuring pain at regular intervals. But if some people drop out, you\u2019re left with an important question: what kind of pain score should you use for them in your results? We know, after all, that people dropping out are more likely to have done badly on the drug.\n\nPfizer decided to use a method called \u2018Last Observation Carried Forward\u2019, which means what you\u2019d expect: you take the last measurement of pain severity while the patients were on the drug, from just before they dropped out, and then paste that in for all the remaining pain measures that they missed, after they stopped coming to follow-up appointments.\n\nThe FDA disapproved of this: it pointed out, quite correctly, that Pfizer\u2019s strategy would make the drug look better than it really is. For a fairer picture, we have to assume that the drop-outs stopped taking the drug because of side effects, so their pain score should reflect the reality, which is that they would never get any benefit from the drug in normal use. The correct level of pain to record for them is, therefore, their pain at the beginning of the study, before they had any kind of treatment (if you\u2019re interested, this is called \u2018Baseline Observation Carried Forward\u2019). The analysis was duly redone, properly, and a more modest, more accurate view of the benefits of the drug was produced. In this case, it turns out that using the \u2018last observation\u2019 method overestimated the improvement in pain by about a quarter.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch. Four out of five of these trials were then published in the peer-reviewed academic literature, the place where doctors look for evidence on whether a drug works or not (one trial wasn\u2019t published at all). Every single one of the published analyses used \u2018Last Observation Carried Forward\u2019, the dodgy method, the one that exaggerates the benefits of the drug. Not one of them acknowledges that \u2018last observation\u2019 is a technique that overstates these benefits.\n\nYou can see why it is important that we have access to all the information we can possibly get on every drug trial: not only are some whole trials withheld from us, but there are often hidden flaws in the methods used. The devil is in the detail, and there are many dodgy trials, as we shall soon see, with flaws that may not be clear even in the academic papers, let alone in the thin and uninformative summaries from regulators. Furthermore, as we shall also see very shortly, there are often worrying discrepancies between the regulators\u2019 summary documents and what actually happened in the trial.\n\nThis is why we need to get hold of a more detailed document on each trial: something called the Clinical Study Report (CSR). These are long pieces of work, sometimes thousands of pages, but they are complete enough for the reader to reconstruct exactly what happened to all the participants; and they will let you find out where the bodies are buried. Drug companies give this study report to the regulator \u2013 though still only for formally licensed uses of the drug \u2013 so both have a copy, and both should be happy to hand it over.\n\nWe will now see what happens when you ask them.\n\nThree: Regulators withhold study reports that they do have\n\nIn 2007, researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre were working on a systematic review for two widely used diet drugs, orlistat and rimonabant. A systematic review, as you know, is the gold-standard summary of the evidence on whether a treatment is effective. These are life-saving, because they give us the best possible understanding of the true effects of a treatment, including its side effects. But doing this requires access to all of the evidence: if some is missing, especially if unflattering data is deliberately harder to obtain, we will be left with a distorted picture.\n\nThe researchers knew that the trial data they were able to find in the published academic literature was probably incomplete, because negative trials are routinely left unpublished. But they also knew that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would have much of this information, since the manufacturers of drugs are obliged to give the study reports to the regulator when trying to get them onto the market. Since regulators are supposed to act in the interests of patients, they applied to the EMA for the protocols and the study reports. That was in June 2007.\n\nIn August, the EMA responded: it had decided not to give out the study reports for these trials, and was invoking the section of its rules which allows it to protect the commercial interests and intellectual property of drug companies. The researchers replied immediately, almost by return of post: there is nothing in the study reports that will undermine the protection of someone\u2019s commercial interests, they explained. But if there was, could the EMA please explain why it felt the commercial interests of the drug companies should override the welfare of patients?\n\nWe should pause for just one moment, and think about what the EMA is doing here. It is the regulator that approves and monitors drugs for the whole of Europe, with the aim of protecting the public. Doctors and patients can only make meaningful decisions about treatments if they have access to all the data. The EMA has that data, but has decided that the drug companies\u2019 interests are more important. Having spoken to a lot of people in regulation, I can offer one small insight into what on earth they might be thinking. Regulators, in my experience, are preoccupied with the idea that they see all the data, and use it to make the decision about whether a drug should go on the market, and that this is enough: doctors and patients don\u2019t need to see the data, because the regulator has done all that work.\n\nThis misunderstands a crucial difference between the decisions made by regulators and the decisions made by doctors. Contrary to what some regulators seem to think, a drug is not either \u2018good\u2019 and therefore on the market, or \u2018bad\u2019 and therefore off it. A regulator makes a decision about whether it\u2019s in the interests of the population as a whole that the drug should be available for use, at all, ever \u2013 even if only in some very obscure circumstance, infrequently and cautiously. This bar is set pretty low, as we shall see, and lots of drugs that are on the market (in fact, the overwhelming majority) are hardly ever used.\n\nA doctor needs to use the same information as that available to the regulator in order to make a very different decision: is this the right drug for the patient in front of me right now? The simple fact that a drug is approved for prescription doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s particularly good, or the best. In fact, there are complex decisions to be made in each clinical situation about which drug is best. Maybe the patient has failed to get better on one drug, so you want to try another, from a different class of drugs; maybe the patient has mild kidney failure, so you don\u2019t want to use the most popular drug, as that causes very occasional problems in patients with dodgy kidneys; maybe you need a drug that won\u2019t interfere with other drugs the patient is taking.\n\nThese complex considerations are the reason we are OK with having a range of drugs on the market: even if some of them are less useful overall, they might be useful in specific circumstances. But we need to be able to see all of the information about them, in order to make these decisions. It is not enough for the regulators to grandly state that they have approved a drug, and therefore we should all feel happy to prescribe it. Doctors and patients need the data just as much as regulators do.\n\nIn September 2007 the EMA confirmed to the Cochrane researchers that it wasn\u2019t going to share the study reports on orlistat and rimonabant, and explained that it had a policy of never disclosing the data given as part of a marketing authorisation. A serious problem had emerged. These weight-loss drugs were being widely prescribed throughout Europe, but doctors and patients were unable to access important information about whether they worked, how bad the side effects were, which was more effective, or any of a whole host of other important questions. Real patients were being exposed to potential harm, in everyday prescribing decisions, through this lack of information that was enforced by the EMA.\n\nThe researchers went to the European Ombudsman with two clear allegations. Firstly, the EMA had failed to give sufficient reasons for refusing them access to the data; and secondly, the EMA\u2019s brief, dismissive claim that commercial interests must be protected was unjustified, because there was no material of commercial interest in the trial results, other than the data on safety and effectiveness, which doctors and patients obviously need to access. They didn\u2019t know it at the time, but this was the beginning of a battle for data that would shame the EMA, and would last more than three years.\n\nIt took four months for the EMA to respond, and over the next year it simply reiterated its position: as far as it was concerned, any kind of information the disclosure of which would \u2018unreasonably undermine or prejudice the commercial interests of individuals or companies\u2019 was commercially confidential. The study reports, it said, might contain information about the commercial plans for the drug. The researchers responded that this was unlikely, but was in any case of marginal importance, as part of a much more important and pressing situation: \u2018As a likely consequence of [the] EMA\u2019s position, patients would die unnecessarily, and would be treated with inferior and potentially harmful drugs.\u2019 They regarded the EMA\u2019s position as ethically indefensible. More than that, they said, the EMA had a clear conflict of interest: this data could be used to challenge its summary views on the benefits and risks of these treatments. The EMA had failed to explain why doctors and patients having access to study reports and protocols should undermine anyone\u2019s reasonable commercial interests, and why these commercial interests were more important than the welfare of patients.\n\nThen, almost two years into this process, the EMA changed tack. Suddenly, it began to argue that study reports contain personal data about individual patients. This argument hadn\u2019t been raised by the EMA before, but it\u2019s also not true. There may have been some information in some whole sections of the study reports that gave detail on some individual participants\u2019 odd presentations, or on possible side effects, but these were all in the same appendix, and could easily be removed.\n\nThe EU Ombudsman\u2019s conclusions were clear: the EMA had failed in its duty to give an adequate or even coherent explanation of why it was refusing access to this important information. He made a preliminary finding of maladministration. After doing that, he was under no obligation to offer any further opinion on the weak excuses offered by the EMA, but he decided to do so anyway. His report is damning. The EMA had flatly failed to address a serious charge that its withholding information about these trials was against the public interest, and exposed patients to harm. The Ombudsman also described how he had gone through the study reports in detail himself, and had found that they contained neither any commercially confidential information, nor any details about the commercial development of the drugs. The EMA\u2019s claims that answering the request would have put it under an inappropriate administrative burden were untrue, and it had overestimated the work this would have involved: specifically, he explained, removing any personal data, where it did sometimes appear, would be easy.\n\nThe Ombudsman told the EMA to hand over the data, or produce a convincing explanation of why it shouldn\u2019t. Amazingly, the EMA, the drugs regulator covering the whole of Europe, still refused to hand over the documents. During this delay, people certainly suffered unnecessarily, and some possibly also died, simply for want of information. But the behaviour of the EMA then deteriorated even further, into the outright surreal. Any scrap of the company\u2019s thinking about how to run the trial, it argued, which could be intuited from reading the study reports and protocols, was commercially sensitive with respect to its thoughts and plans. This was true, the EMA said, even though the drugs were already on the market, and the information was from final clinical trials, at the very end of the commercial drug-development process. The researchers responded that this was perverse: they knew that withheld data is often negative, so if anything, any other company seeing negative data about these drugs would be less likely to try to get a competitor to market, if it appeared that the benefits of the drugs were more modest than had been thought.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the end of it. The EMA also grandly dismissed the idea that lives were at risk, stating that the burden of proof was on the researchers to demonstrate this. To me this is \u2013 if you can forgive me \u2013 a slightly contemptuous attitude, especially given what happens in the next paragraph. It\u2019s plainly true that if doctors and patients are unable to see which is the best treatment, then they will make worse decisions, exposing patients to unnecessary harm. Furthermore, it is obvious that larger numbers of academics making transparent judgements about publicly accessible trial data are a much more sensible way of determining the risks and benefits of an intervention than a brief blanket \u2018yes or no\u2019 edict and summary from a regulator. This is all true of drugs like orlistat and rimonabant, but it\u2019s also true of any drug, and we will see many cases where academics spotted problems with drugs that regulators had missed.\n\nThen, in 2009, one of the two drugs, rimonabant, was taken off the market, on the grounds that it increases the risk of serious psychiatric problems and suicide. This, at the same time that the EMA was arguing that researchers were wrong to claim that withholding information was harming patients.\n\nAnd then the EMA suddenly claimed that the design of a randomised trial itself is commercially confidential information.\n\nIn case it needs reiterating, let me remind you that the first trial appears in the Bible, Daniel 1:12, and although the core ideas have certainly been refined over time, all trials are essentially identical experiments, generic across any field, with the basics of a modern trial sketched out at least half a century ago. There is absolutely no earthly sense in which anyone could realistically claim that the design of a randomised controlled trial is a commercially confidential or patentable piece of intellectual property.\n\nThis was now a farce. The researchers opened all barrels. The EMA was in breach of the Declaration of Helsinki, the international code of medical ethics, which states that everyone involved in research has a duty to make trial findings public. The researchers knew that published papers give a flattering subset of the trial data, and so did the EMA. Patients would die if the EMA continued to withhold data. There was nothing of serious commercial value in there. The EMA\u2019s brief public summaries of the data were inaccurate. The EMA was complicit in the exploitation of patients for commercial gain.\n\nIt was now August 2009, and the researchers had been fighting for more than two years for access to data on two widely prescribed drugs, from the very organisation that is supposed to be protecting patients and the public. They weren\u2019t alone. The French \u2018prescribers\u2019 bulletin\u2019 Prescrire was trying at the same time to get the EMA\u2019s documents on rimonabant. It was sent some unhelpful documents, including the rather remarkable \u2018Final Assessment Report\u2019, from the Swedish agency that had handled the drug\u2019s approval much earlier. You can read this PDF in full online. Or rather, you can\u2019t. On the following page you can see exactly what the scientific analysis of the drug looked like \u2013 the document the EMA sent to one of France\u2019s most respected journals for doctors.73 I think it tells a rather clear story, and to add to the insult, there are sixty pages of this in total.\n\nIn the meantime, the Danish Medical Authority had handed over fifty-six study reports to Cochrane (though it still needed more from the EMA); a complaint from the drug company about this had been rejected by the Danish government, which had seen no problem with commercial information (there was none), nor administrative hassle (it was minimal), nor the idea that the design of a randomised trial is commercial information (which is laughable). This was chaos. The EMA \u2013 which you may remember was responsible for EudraCT, the transparency tool that is held in secret \u2013 was going out on a very peculiar limb. It seemed that it would do anything it could to withhold this information from doctors and patients. As we shall see, sadly, this level of secrecy is its stock in trade.\n\nBut now we come to the end of this particular road for the EMA. It handed the full, final study reports over to the Ombudsman, reminding him that even the table of contents for each was commercial. Once he had had these documents in his hand, his final opinion came swiftly. There was no commercial data here. There was no confidential patient information here. Hand it over to the public, now. The EMA, at glacial pace, agreed to set a deadline for delivering the data to the researchers, doctors and patients who needed it. The Ombudsman\u2019s final ruling was published at the end of November 2010.74 The initial complaint was made in June 2007. That is a full three and a half years of fighting, obstruction and spurious arguments from the EMA, during which one of the drugs had to be removed from the market because it was harming patients.\n\nAfter this precedent had been set, things had to shift at the EMA; it was forced to revise its approach, and study reports were briefly made more widely available under a new policy (this window has just been shut down, in 2013, as you will read in the Afterword). But even this policy of sharing reports did not solve the problem of access to all information about a trial: the EMA often doesn\u2019t hold all the modules, of all the reports, for all the uses of all the medicines it has approved. And it only holds records for the most recent few years, which is hopelessly incomplete, since in medicine we use treatments that have come on the market over the past few decades. In fact, this loophole is illustrated by the very first request made by the Cochrane researchers who won this great breakthrough with the Ombudsman. They applied for documents on antidepressants: a good place to start, since these drugs have been the focus of some particularly bad behaviour over the years (though we should remember that missing trial data pervades every corner of medicine). What happened next was even more bizarre than the EMA\u2019s three-year battle to withhold information on orlistat and rimonabant.\n\nThe researchers put in their request to the EMA, but were told that the drugs had been approved back in the era when marketing authorisations were given out by individual countries, rather than by the EMA centrally. These local authorisations were then \u2018copied\u2019 to all other nations. The MHRA, the UK drugs regulator, held the information the researchers wanted, so they would have to approach it for a copy. The researchers dutifully wrote to the MHRA, asked for the reports on a drug called fluoxetine, and then waited patiently. Finally the answer came: the MHRA explained that it would be happy to hand over this information, but there was a problem.\n\nThe documents had all been shredded.75\n\nThis was in keeping, it explained, with the agency\u2019s retention policy, which was that such documents were only kept if they were of particular scientific, historical or political interest, and the files didn\u2019t meet those criteria. Let\u2019s just take a moment to think through what the criteria must be. The SSRI antidepressant drugs have seen many scandals on hidden data, and that should be enough on its own, but if you think back to the beginning of this chapter, one of them \u2013 paroxetine \u2013 was involved in an unprecedented, four-year-long investigation into whether criminal charges could be brought against GSK. That investigation into paroxetine was the largest investigation that the MHRA has ever conducted into drug safety: in fact, it was the largest investigation the MHRA has ever conducted, of any kind, ever. Quite apart from that, these original study reports contain vitally important data on safety and efficacy. But the MHRA shredded them all the same, feeling that they were not of sufficient scientific, historical or political interest.76\n\nI can only leave you there.\n\nWhere are we so far?\n\nThe missing data saga is long and complex, and involves patients around the world being put at risk, and some major players which have let us down to an extraordinary extent. Since we are almost at the end of it, this is a good moment to gather together what we\u2019ve seen so far.\n\nTrials are frequently conducted, but then left unpublished, and so are unavailable to doctors and patients. Only half of all trials get published, and those with negative results are twice as likely to go missing as those with positive ones. This means that the evidence on which we base decisions in medicine is systematically biased to overstate the benefits of the treatments we give. Since there is no way to compensate for this missing data, we have no way of knowing the true benefits and risks of the drugs doctors prescribe.\n\nThis is research misconduct on a grand, international scale. The reality of the problem is universally recognised, but nobody has bothered to fix it:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Ethics committees allow companies and individual \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0researchers with a track record of unpublished data to do more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0trials on human participants.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*University administrators and ethics committees permit \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0contracts with industry that explicitly say the sponsor can \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0control the data.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Registers have never been enforced.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Academic journals continue to publish trials that were \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unregistered, despite pretending that they won\u2019t.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Regulators have information that would be vital to improve \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patient care, but are systematically obstructive:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*they have poor systems to share poor summaries of the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information that they do have;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*and they are bizarrely obstructive of people asking for more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Drug companies hold trial results that even regulators don\u2019t \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0see.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Governments have never implemented laws compelling \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0companies to publish data.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Doctors\u2019 and academics\u2019 professional bodies have done nothing.\n\nWhat to do about all this?\n\nYou will need to wait, because in the next section there are even greater horrors to come.\n\nTrying to get trial data from drug companies: the story of Tamiflu\n\nGovernments around the world have spent billions of pounds on stockpiling a drug called Tamiflu. In the UK alone we have spent several hundred million pounds \u2013 the total figure is not yet clear \u2013 and so far we\u2019ve bought enough tablets to treat 80 per cent of the population if an outbreak of bird flu occurs. I\u2019m very sorry if you have the flu, because it\u2019s horrid being ill; but we have not spent all this money to reduce the duration of your symptoms in the event of a pandemic by a few hours (though Tamiflu does do this, fairly satisfactorily). We have spent this money to reduce the rate of \u2018complications\u2019: a medical euphemism, meaning pneumonia and death.\n\nLots of people seem to think Tamiflu will do this. The US Department of Health and Human Services said it would save lives and reduce hospital admissions. The European Medicines Agency said it would reduce complications. The Australian drugs regulator said so too. Roche\u2019s website said it reduces complications by 67 per cent.77 But what is the evidence that Tamiflu really will reduce complications? Answering questions like this is the bread and butter of the Cochrane Collaboration, which you will remember is the vast and independent non-profit international collaboration of academics producing hundreds of systematic reviews on important questions in medicine every year. In 2009 there was concern about a flu pandemic, and an enormous amount of money was being spent on Tamiflu. Because of this, the UK and Australian governments specifically asked the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group to update its earlier reviews on the drug.\n\nCochrane reviews are in a constant review cycle, because evidence changes over time as new trials are published. This should have been a pretty everyday piece of work: the previous review, in 2008, had found some evidence that Tamiflu does indeed reduce the rate of complications. But then a Japanese paediatrician called Keiji Hayashi left a comment that would trigger a revolution in our understanding of how evidence-based medicine should work. This wasn\u2019t in a publication, or even a letter: it was a simple online comment, posted underneath the Tamiflu review on the Cochrane website.\n\nYou\u2019ve summarised the data from all the trials, he explained, but your positive conclusion is really driven by data from just one of the papers you cite, an industry-funded meta-analysis led by an author called Kaiser. This, \u2018the Kaiser paper\u2019, summarises the findings of ten earlier trials, but from these ten trials, only two have ever been published in the scientific literature. For the remaining eight, your only information comes from the brief summary in this secondary, industry source. That\u2019s not reliable enough.\n\nIn case it\u2019s not immediately obvious, this is science at its best. The Cochrane review is readily accessible online; it explains transparently the methods by which it looked for trials, and then analysed them, so any informed reader can pull the review apart, and understand where the conclusions came from. Cochrane provides an easy way for readers to raise criticisms. And, crucially, these criticisms did not fall on deaf ears. Tom Jefferson is an editor at the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group, and the lead author on the 2008 review. He realised immediately that he had made a mistake in blindly trusting the Kaiser data. He said so, without any defensiveness, and then set about getting the information in a straight, workpersonlike fashion. This began a three-year battle, which is still not resolved, but which has thrown stark light on the need for all researchers to have access to clinical study reports on trials wherever possible.\n\nFirst, the Cochrane researchers wrote to the authors of the Kaiser paper, asking for more information. In reply, they were told that this team no longer had the files, and that they should contact Roche, the manufacturer of Tamiflu. So naturally they wrote to Roche and asked for the data.\n\nThis is where the problems began. Roche said it would hand over some data, but the Cochrane reviewers would need to sign a confidentiality agreement. This was an impossibility for any serious scientist: it would prevent them from conducting a systematic review with any reasonable degree of openness and transparency. More than this, the proposed contract also raised serious ethical issues, in that it would have required the Cochrane team to actively withhold information from the reader: it included a clause saying that on signing it, the reviewers would never be allowed to discuss the terms of this secrecy agreement; and more than that, they would be forbidden from ever publicly acknowledging that it even existed. Roche was demanding a secret contract, with secret terms, requiring secrecy about trial data, in a discussion about the safety and efficacy of a drug that has been taken by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Jefferson asked for clarification, and never received a reply.\n\nThen, in October 2009, the company changed tack: they would like to hand the data over, they explained, but another meta-analysis was being conducted elsewhere. Roche had given them the study reports, so Cochrane couldn\u2019t have them. This was a simple non-sequitur: there is no reason why many groups shouldn\u2019t all work on the same question. In fact, quite the opposite: replication is the cornerstone of good science. Roche\u2019s excuse made no sense. Jefferson asked for clarification, but never received a reply.\n\nOne week later, unannounced, Roche sent seven short documents, each around a dozen pages long. These contained excerpts of internal company documents on each of the clinical trials in the Kaiser meta-analysis. This was a start, but it didn\u2019t contain anything like enough information for Cochrane to assess the benefits, or the rate of adverse events, or fully to understand exactly what methods were used in the trials.\n\nAt the same time, it was rapidly becoming clear that there were odd inconsistencies in the information on this drug. Firstly, there was considerable disagreement at the level of the broad conclusions drawn by different organisations. The FDA said there were no benefits on complications, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (in charge of public health in the USA \u2013 some wear nice naval uniforms in honour of their history on the docks) said it did reduce complications. The Japanese regulator made no claim for complications, but the EMA said there was a benefit. In a sensible world, we might think that all these organisations should sing from the same hymn sheet, because all would have access to the same information. Of course, there is also room for occasional, reasonable disagreement, especially where there are close calls: this is precisely why doctors and researchers should have access to all the information about a drug, so that they can make their own judgements.\n\nMeanwhile, reflecting these different judgements, Roche\u2019s own websites said completely different things in different jurisdictions, depending on what the local regulator had said. It\u2019s na\u00efve, perhaps, to expect consistency from a drug company, but from this and other stories it\u2019s clear that industry utterances are driven by the maximum they can get away with in each territory, rather than any consistent review of the evidence.\n\nIn any case, now that their interest had been piqued, the Cochrane researchers also began to notice that there were odd discrepancies between the frequency of adverse events in different databases. Roche\u2019s global safety database held 2,466 neuropsychiatric adverse events, of which 562 were classified as \u2018serious\u2019. But the FDA database for the same period held only 1,805 adverse events in total. The rules vary on what needs to be notified to whom, and where, but even allowing for that, this was odd.\n\nIn any case, since Roche was denying them access to the information needed to conduct a proper review, the Cochrane team concluded that they would have to exclude all the unpublished Kaiser data from their analysis, because the details could not be verified in the normal way. People cannot make treatment and purchasing decisions on the basis of trials if the full methods and results aren\u2019t clear: the devil is often in the detail, as we shall see in Chapter 4, on \u2018bad trials\u2019, so we cannot blindly trust that every study is a fair test of the treatment.\n\nThis is particularly important with Tamiflu, because there are good reasons to think that these trials were not ideal, and that published accounts were incomplete, to say the least. On closer examination, for example, the patients participating were clearly unusual, to the extent that the results may not be very relevant to normal everyday flu patients. In the published accounts, patients in the trials are described as typical flu patients, suffering from normal flu symptoms like cough, fatigue, and so on. We don\u2019t do blood tests on people with flu in routine practice, but when these tests are done \u2013 for surveillance purposes \u2013 then even during peak flu season only about one in three people with \u2018flu\u2019 will actually be infected with the influenza virus, and most of the year only one in eight will really have it. (The rest are sick from something else, maybe just a common cold virus.)\n\nTwo thirds of the trial participants summarised in the Kaiser paper tested positive for flu. This is bizarrely high, and means that the benefits of the drug will be overstated, because it is being tested on perfect patients, the very ones most likely to get better from a drug that selectively attacks the flu virus. In normal practice, which is where the results of these trials will be applied, doctors will be giving the drug to real patients who are diagnosed with \u2018flu-like illness\u2019, which is all you can realistically do in a clinic. Among these real patients, many will not actually have the influenza virus. This means that in the real world, the benefits of Tamiflu on flu will be diluted, and many more people will be exposed to the drug who don\u2019t actually have flu virus in their systems. This, in turn, means that the side effects are likely to creep up in significance, in comparison with any benefits. That is why we strive to ensure that all trials are conducted in normal, everyday, realistic patients: if they are not, their findings may not be relevant to the real world.\n\nSo the Cochrane review was published without the Kaiser data in December 2009, alongside some explanatory material about why the Kaiser results had been excluded, and a small flurry of activity followed. Roche put the short excerpts it had sent over online, and committed to make full study reports available (it still hasn\u2019t done so).\n\nWhat Roche posted was incomplete, but it began a journey for the Cochrane academics of learning a great deal more about the real information that is collected on a trial, and how that can differ from what is given to doctors and patients in the form of brief, published academic papers. At the core of every trial is the raw data: every single record of blood pressure of every patient, the doctors\u2019 notes describing any unusual symptoms, investigators\u2019 notes, and so on. A published academic paper is a short description of the study, usually following a set format: an introductory background; a description of the methods; a summary of the important results; and then finally a discussion, covering the strengths and weaknesses of the design, and the implications of the results for clinical practice.\n\nA clinical study report, or CSR, is the intermediate document that stands between these two, and can be very long, sometimes thousands of pages.78 Anybody working in the pharmaceutical industry is very familiar with these documents, but doctors and academics have rarely heard of them. They contain much more detail on things like the precise plan for analysing the data statistically, detailed descriptions of adverse events, and so on.\n\nThese documents are split into different sections, or \u2018modules\u2019. Roche has shared only \u2018module 1\u2019, for only seven of the ten study reports Cochrane has requested. These modules are missing vitally important information, including the analysis plan, the randomisation details, the study protocol (and the list of deviations from that), and so on. But even these incomplete modules were enough to raise concerns about the universal practice of trusting academic papers to give a complete story about what happened to the patients in a trial.\n\nFor example, looking at the two papers out of ten in the Kaiser review which were published, one says: \u2018There were no drug-related serious adverse events,\u2019 and the other doesn\u2019t mention adverse events. But in the \u2018module 1\u2019 documents on these same two studies, there are ten serious adverse events listed, of which three are classified as being possibly related to Tamiflu.79\n\nAnother published paper describes itself as a trial comparing Tamiflu against placebo. A placebo is an inert tablet, containing no active ingredient, that is visually indistinguishable from the pill containing the real medicine. But the CSR for this trial shows that the real medicine was in a grey and yellow capsule, whereas the placebos were grey and ivory. The \u2018placebo\u2019 tablets also contained something called dehydrocholic acid, a chemical which encourages the gall bladder to empty.80 Nobody has any clear idea of why, and it\u2019s not even mentioned in the academic paper; but it seems that this was not actually an inert, dummy pill placebo.\n\nSimply making a list of all the trials conducted on a subject is vitally important if we want to avoid seeing only a biased summary of the research done on a subject; but in the case of Tamiflu even this proved to be almost impossible. For example, Roche Shanghai informed the Cochrane group of one large trial (ML16369), but Roche Basel seemed not to know of its existence. But by setting out all the trials side by side, the researchers were able to identify peculiar discrepancies: for example, the largest \u2018phase 3\u2019 trial \u2013 one of the large trials that are done to get a drug onto the market \u2013 was never published, and is rarely mentioned in regulatory documents.fn3\n\nThere were other odd discrepancies. Why, for example, was one trial on Tamiflu published in 2010, ten years after it was completed?82 Why did some trials report completely different authors, depending on where they were being discussed?83 And so on.\n\nThe chase continued. In December 2009 Roche had promised: \u2018full study reports will also be made available on a password-protected site within the coming days to physicians and scientists undertaking legitimate analyses\u2019. This never happened. Then an odd game began. In June 2010 Roche said: Oh, we\u2019re sorry, we thought you had what you wanted. In July it announced that it was worried about patient confidentiality (you may remember this from the EMA saga). This was an odd move: for most of the important parts of these documents, privacy is no issue at all. The full trial protocol, and the analysis plan, are both completed before any single patient is ever touched. Roche has never explained why patient privacy prevents it from releasing the study reports. It simply continued to withhold them.\n\nThen in August 2010 it began to make some even more bizarre demands, betraying a disturbing belief that companies are perfectly entitled to control access to information that is needed by doctors and patients around the world to make safe decisions. Firstly, it insisted on seeing the Cochrane reviewers\u2019 full analysis plan. Fine, they said, and posted the whole protocol online. Doing so is completely standard practice at Cochrane, as it should be for any transparent organisation, and allows people to suggest important changes before you begin. There were few surprises, since all Cochrane reports follow a pretty strict manual anyway. Roche continued to withhold its study reports (including, ironically, its own protocols, the very thing it demanded Cochrane should publish, and that Cochrane had published, happily).\n\nBy now Roche had been refusing to publish the study reports for a year. Suddenly, the company began to raise odd personal concerns. It claimed that some Cochrane researchers had made untrue statements about the drug, and about the company, but refused to say who, or what, or where. \u2018Certain members of Cochrane Group involved with the review of the neuraminidase inhibitors,\u2019 it announced, \u2018are unlikely to approach the review with the independence that is both necessary and justified.\u2019 This is an astonishing state of affairs, where a company feels it should be allowed to prevent individual researchers access to data that should be available to all; but still Roche refused to hand over the study reports.\n\nThen it complained that the Cochrane reviewers had begun to copy journalists in on their emails when responding to Roche staff. I was one of the people copied in on these interactions, and I believe that this was exactly the correct thing to do. Roche\u2019s excuses had become perverse, and the company had failed to keep its promise to share all study reports. It\u2019s clear that the modest pressure exerted by researchers in academic journals alone was having little impact on Roche\u2019s refusal to release the data, and this is an important matter of public health, both for the individual case of this Tamiflu data, and for the broader issue of companies and regulators harming patients by withholding information.\n\nThen things became even more perverse. In January 2011 Roche announced that the Cochrane researchers had already been given all the data they need. This was simply untrue. In February it insisted that all the studies requested were published (meaning academic papers, now shown to be misleading on Tamiflu). Then it declared that it would hand over nothing more, saying: \u2018You have all the detail you need to undertake a review.\u2019 But this still wasn\u2019t true: it was still withholding the material it had publicly promised to hand over \u2018within a few days\u2019 in December 2009, a year and a half earlier.\n\nAt the same time, the company was raising the broken arguments we have already seen: it\u2019s the job of regulators to make these decisions about benefit and risk, it said, not academics. Now, this claim fails on two important fronts. Firstly, as with many other drugs, we now know that not even the regulators had seen all the data. In January 2012 Roche claimed that it \u2018has made full clinical study data available to health authorities around the world for their review as part of the licensing process\u2019. But the EMA never received this information for at least fifteen trials. This was because the EMA had never requested it.\n\nAnd that brings us on to our final important realisation: regulators are not infallible. They make outright mistakes, and they make decisions which are open to judgement, and should be subject to second-guessing and checking by many eyes around the world. In the next chapter we will see more examples of how regulators can fail, behind closed doors, but here we will look at one story that illustrates the benefit of \u2018many eyes\u2019 perfectly.\n\nRosiglitazone is a new kind of diabetes drug, and lots of researchers and patients had high hopes that it would be safe and effective.84 Diabetes is common, and more people develop the disease every year. Sufferers have poor control of their blood sugar, and diabetes drugs, alongside dietary changes, are supposed to fix this. Although it\u2019s nice to see your blood sugar being controlled nicely in the numbers from lab tests and machines at home, we don\u2019t control these figures for their own sake: we try to control blood sugar because we hope that this will help reduce the chances of real-world outcomes, like heart attack and death, both of which occur at a higher rate in people with diabetes.\n\nRosiglitazone was first marketed in 1999, and from the outset it was a magnet for disappointing behaviour. In that first year, Dr John Buse from the University of North Carolina discussed an increased risk of heart problems at a pair of academic meetings. The drug\u2019s manufacturer, GSK, made direct contact in an attempt to silence him, then moved on to his head of department. Buse felt pressured to sign various legal documents. To cut a long story short, after wading through documents for several months, in 2007 the US Senate Committee on Finance released a report describing the treatment of Dr Buse as \u2018intimidation\u2019.\n\nBut we are more concerned with the safety and efficacy data. In 2003 the Uppsala Drug Monitoring Group of the World Health Organization contacted GSK about an unusually large number of spontaneous reports associating rosiglitazone with heart problems. GSK conducted two internal meta-analyses of its own data on this, in 2005 and 2006. These showed that the risk was real, but although both GSK and the FDA had these results, neither made any public statement about them, and they were not published until 2008.\n\nDuring this delay, vast numbers of patients were exposed to the drug, but doctors and patients only learned about this serious problem in 2007, when cardiologist Professor Steve Nissen and colleagues published a landmark meta-analysis. This showed a 43 per cent increase in the risk of heart problems in patients on rosiglitazone. Since people with diabetes are already at increased risk of heart problems, and the whole point of treating diabetes is to reduce this risk, that finding was big potatoes. His findings were confirmed in later work, and in 2010 the drug was either taken off the market or restricted, all around the world.\n\nNow, my argument is not that this drug should have been banned sooner, because as perverse as it sounds, doctors do often need inferior drugs for use as a last resort. For example, a patient may develop idiosyncratic side effects on the most effective pills, and be unable to take them any longer. Once this has happened, it may be worth trying a less effective drug, if it is at least better than nothing.\n\nThe concern is that these discussions happened with the data locked behind closed doors, visible only to regulators. In fact, Nissen\u2019s analysis could only be done at all because of a very unusual court judgement. In 2004, when GSK was caught out withholding data showing evidence of serious side effects from paroxetine in children, the UK conducted an unprecedented four-year-long investigation, as we saw earlier. But in the US, the same bad behaviour resulted in a court case over allegations of fraud, the settlement of which, alongside a significant payout, required GSK to commit to posting clinical trial results on a public website.\n\nProfessor Nissen used the rosiglitazone data, when it became available, found worrying signs of harm, and published this to doctors, which is something that the regulators had never done, despite having the information years earlier. (Though before doctors got to read it, Nissen by chance caught GSK discussing a copy of his unpublished paper, which it had obtained improperly.85)\n\nIf this information had all been freely available from the start, regulators might have felt a little more anxious about their decisions, but crucially, doctors and patients could have disagreed with them, and made informed choices. This is why we need wider access to full CSRs, and all trial reports, for all medicines, and this is why it is perverse that Roche should be able even to contemplate deciding which favoured researchers should be allowed to read the documents on Tamiflu.\n\nAstonishingly, a paper published in April 2012 by regulators from the UK and Europe suggests that they might agree to more data sharing, to a limited extent, within limits, for some studies, with caveats, at the appropriate juncture, and in the fullness of time.86 Before feeling any sense of enthusiasm, we should remember that this is a cautious utterance, wrung out after the dismal fights I have already described; that it has not been implemented; that it must be set against a background of broken promises from all players across the whole field of missing data; and that in any case, regulators do not have all the trial data anyway. But it is an interesting start.\n\nTheir two main objections \u2013 if we accept their goodwill at face value \u2013 are interesting, because they lead us to the final problem in the way we tolerate harm to patients from missing trial data. Firstly, they raise the concern that some academics and journalists might use study reports to conduct histrionic or poorly conducted reviews of the data: to this, again, I say, \u2018Let them,\u2019 because these foolish analyses should be conducted, and then rubbished, in public.\n\nWhen UK hospital mortality statistics first became easily accessible to the public, doctors were terrified that they would be unfairly judged: the crude figures can be misinterpreted, after all, because one hospital may have worse figures simply because it is a centre of excellence, and takes in more challenging patients than its neighbours; and there is random variation to be expected in mortality rates anyway, so some hospitals might look unusually good, or bad, simply through the play of chance. Initially, to an extent, these fears were realised: there were a few shrill, unfair stories, and people overinterpreted the results. Now, for the most part, things have settled down, and many lay people are quite able to recognise that crude analyses of such figures are misleading. For drug data, where there is so much danger from withheld information, and so many academics desperate to conduct meaningful analyses, and so many other academics happy to criticise them, releasing the data is the only healthy option.\n\nBut secondly, the EMA raises the spectre of patient confidentiality, and hidden in this concern is one final prize.\n\nSo far I have been talking about access to trial reports, summaries of patients\u2019 outcomes in trials. There is no good reason to believe that this poses any threat to patient confidentiality, and where there are specific narratives that might make a patient identifiable \u2013 a lengthy medical description of one person\u2019s idiosyncratic adverse event in a trial, perhaps \u2013 these can easily be removed, since they appear in a separate part of the document. These CSRs should undoubtedly, without question, be publicly available documents, and this should be enforced retrospectively, going back decades, to the dawn of trials.\n\nBut all trials are ultimately run on individual patients, and the results of those individual patients are all stored and used for the summary analysis at the end of the study. While I would never suggest that these should be posted up on a public website \u2013 it would be easy for patients to be identifiable, from many small features of their histories \u2013 it is surprising that patient-level data is almost never shared with academics.\n\nSharing data of individual patients\u2019 outcomes in clinical trials, rather than just the final summary result, has several significant advantages. Firstly, it\u2019s a safeguard against dubious analytic practices. In the VIGOR trial on the painkiller Vioxx, for example, a bizarre reporting decision was made.87 The aim of the study was to compare Vioxx against an older, cheaper painkiller, to see if it was any less likely to cause stomach problems (this was the hope for Vioxx), and also if it caused more heart attacks (this was the fear). But the date cut-off for measuring heart attacks was much earlier than that for measuring stomach problems. This had the result of making the risks look less significant, relative to the benefits, but it was not declared clearly in the paper, resulting in a giant scandal when it was eventually noticed. If the raw data on patients was shared, games like these would be far easier to spot, and people might be less likely to play them in the first place.\n\nOccasionally \u2013 with vanishing rarity \u2013 researchers are able to obtain raw data, and re-analyse studies that have already been conducted and published. Daniel Coyne, Professor of Medicine at Washington University, was lucky enough to get the data on a key trial for epoetin, a drug given to patients on kidney dialysis, after a four-year-long fight.88 The original academic publication on this study, ten years earlier, had switched the primary outcomes described in the protocol (we will see later how this exaggerates the benefits of treatments), and changed the main statistical analysis strategy (again, a huge source of bias). Coyne was able to analyse the study as the researchers had initially stated they were planning to in their protocol; and when he did, he found that they had dramatically overstated the benefits of the drug. It was a peculiar outcome, as he himself acknowledges: \u2018As strange as it seems, I am now the sole author of the publication on the predefined primary and secondary results of the largest outcomes trial of epoetin in dialysis patients, and I didn\u2019t even participate in the trial.\u2019 There is room, in my view, for a small army of people doing the very same thing, reanalysing all the trials that were incorrectly analysed, in ways that deviated misleadingly from their original protocols.\n\nData sharing would also confer other benefits. It allows people to conduct more exploratory analyses of data, and to better investigate \u2013 for example \u2013 whether a drug is associated with a particular unexpected side effect. It would also allow cautious \u2018subgroup analyses\u2019, to see if a drug is particularly useful, or particularly useless, in particular types of patients.\n\nThe biggest immediate benefit from data sharing is that combining individual patient data into a meta-analysis gives more accurate results than working with the crude summary results at the end of a paper. Let\u2019s imagine that one paper reports survival at three years as the main outcome for a cancer drug, and another reports survival at seven years. To combine these two in a meta-analysis, you\u2019d have a problem. But if you were doing the meta-analysis with access to individual patient data, with treatment details and death dates for all of them, you could do a clean combined calculation for three-year survival.\n\nDarby S, McGale P, Correa C, Taylor C, Arriagada R, Clarke M, Cutter D, Davies C, Ewertz M, Godwin J, Gray R, Pierce L, Whelan T, Wang Y, Peto R.Albain K, Anderson S, Arriagada R, Barlow

Linderholm BK, Chlebowski RT, Caffier H.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of work being done in the area of breast cancer research, where a small number of charismatic and forceful scientists just happen to have driven a pioneering culture of easier collaboration. The summaries they are publishing represent real collaboration, between vast numbers of people, and on vast numbers of patients, producing highly reliable guidance for doctors and patients.\n\nThe process sheds a stark light on the reality of data collaboration on such a large scale. Here, for example, is the author list on an academic paper from the Lancet in November 2011: it\u2019s reporting an immense, definitive, and incredibly useful metaanalysis of breast cancer treatment outcomes, using individual patient data pooled from seventeen different trials. The author list is printed in four-point font size (though I suspect that might go wrong in the e-book edition \u2026) because there are seven hundred individual researchers named in it. I typed each of them in by hand for you.\n\nThis is what medicine should look like. An honest list of all the people involved, free access to information, and all the data pooled together, giving the most accurate information we can manage, to inform real decisions, and so prevent avoidable suffering and death.\n\nWe are a very, very long way away from there.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nWe urgently need to improve access to trial data. In addition to the previous suggestions, there are small changes that would vastly improve access to information, and so improve patient care.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The results of all trials conducted on humans must be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0made available within one year of completion, in summary \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0table form if academic journal publication has not occurred. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This requires the creation of a body that is charged with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0publicly auditing whether or not trials have withheld results at \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0twelve months; and primary legislation that is enforced, as a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0matter of urgency, internationally, with stiff penalties for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0transgression. In my view these penalties should include fines, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but also prison terms for those who are found to be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0responsible for withholding trial data, as patients are harmed \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by this process.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.All systematic reviews \u2013 such as Cochrane reviews \u2013 that draw \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0together trial results on any clinical question should also \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0include a section on the trials which they know have been \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0conducted, but whose results are being withheld. This should \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0state: which completed trials have not reported results; how \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0many patients\u2019 worth of information there is in each unreported \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0trial; the names of the organisations and the individuals who \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0are withholding the data; the efforts the reviewers have made \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to get the information from them. This is trivial extra work, as \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0review teams already attempt to access this kind of data. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Documenting this will draw attention to the problem, and make \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0it easier for doctors and the public to see who is responsible \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for harming patient care in each area of medicine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0All clinical study reports should also be made publicly \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0available, for all the trials that have ever been conducted on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0humans. This will be cheap, as the only costs are in finding one \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0paper copy, scanning it and placing it online, perhaps with a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0check to remove confidential patient information. There is a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0vast mountain of highly relevant data on drugs that is currently \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0being withheld, distorting what we know about treatments in \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0widespread current use. Many of these documents will be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sitting in the dry paper archives of drug companies and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regulators. We need legislation compelling the industry to hand \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0them over. Our failure to fix this is costing lives.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0We need to work on new methods for academics to extract \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0summary information from these documents, as they are more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0detailed than published academic papers. The Cochrane group \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0working on Tamiflu have made great progress here, learning as \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0they go, and this field will need manuals.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05.\u00a0We should work towards all triallists having an obligation to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0share patient-level data wherever possible, with convenient \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0online data warehouses,89 and streamlined systems \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whereby legitimate senior researchers can make requests for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0access, in order to conduct pooled analyses and double-check \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the results reported in published trials.\n\nNone of this is difficult, or impossible. Some of it is technical, for which I apologise. The field of missing data is a tragic and strange one. We have tolerated the emergence of a culture in medicine where information is routinely withheld, and we have blinded ourselves to the unnecessary suffering and death that follows from this. The people we should have been able to trust to handle all this behind the scenes \u2013 the regulators, the politicians, the senior academics, the patient organisations, the professional bodies, the universities, the ethics committees \u2013 have almost all failed us. And so I have had to inflict the details on you, in the hope that you can bring some pressure to bear yourself.\n\nIf you have any ideas about how we can fix this, and how we can force access to trial data \u2013 politically or technically \u2013 please write them up, post them online, and tell me where to find them.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/6635175", "artist_names": "Bars and Melody", "full_title": "Little Missy by\u00a0Bars\u00a0and Melody", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/4b7d97f94b48c12bd37895738a2ba7c7.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4b7d97f94b48c12bd37895738a2ba7c7.640x640x1.jpg", "id": 6635175, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 13201870, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1616709085, "path": "/Bars-and-melody-little-missy-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Bars-and-melody-little-missy-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2021, "month": 1, "day": 15}, "release_date_for_display": "January 15, 2021", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 15, 2021", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/4b7d97f94b48c12bd37895738a2ba7c7.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4b7d97f94b48c12bd37895738a2ba7c7.640x640x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Little Missy", "title_with_featured": "Little Missy", "updated_by_human_at": 1616812646, "url": "https://genius.com/Bars-and-melody-little-missy-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/210746", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/74d15419f5969c5ae5a961d546224774.435x250x19.gif", "id": 210746, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4b7d97f94b48c12bd37895738a2ba7c7.640x640x1.jpg", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Bars and Melody", "slug": "Bars-and-melody", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Bars-and-melody"}, "artist": "Bars and Melody", "lyrics": "Little Missy Lyrics[Intro, Chorus: Leondre Devries]\nBusy little Missy yea she got no time for jokes\nSpirits runnin' thru my veins, I got spirits in my coke\nTelling me that she insane, I can see it in her look\nYeah its blood all of the stains, I got blood all in my throat\nBusy little Missy yea she got no time for jokes\nSpirits runnin' thru my veins, I got spirits in my coke\nTelling me that she insane, I can see it in her look\nYeah its blood all of the stains, I got blood all in my throat\n\n[Verse 1: Charlie Lenehan]\nBusy little Missy got a bad attitude\nAlways leave me on read, and I find that kinda rude\nHands around my neck that girl act like a knoose\nYeah she made all of the d\u0435mons in my brain run loose\nShe a product of me, so I got no \u0435xcuse\n\n[Chorus: Leondre Devries]\nBusy little Missy yea, she got no time for jokes\nSpirits runnin' thru my veins, I got spirits in my coke\nTelling me that she insane, I can see it in her look\nYeah it's blood all of the stains, I got blood all in my throat\nBusy little Missy yea she got no time for jokes\nSpirits runnin' thru my veins, I got spirits in my coke\nTelling me that she insane, I can see it in her look\nYeah its blood all of the stains, I got blood all in my throat\n\n\n[Verse 1:Leondre Devries]\nBad little Missy, yeah she never said she miss me\nAlways hit her line whenever I'm in the city\nYeah I got some issues but at least she said I'm pretty\nYeah she takes my hand but that lady never kiss me\n\n[Verse 2: Charlie Lenehan]\nShe never kiss me\nShe pull my soul so low that's where I wanna go\nI love so cold and that's okay I love the snow\nI'm her favorite game to play she in control\nShe pulled the curtain early on me\nI'm the show\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Leondre Devries]\nBaby I loved the show, but baby I got to go\nI get the call, I leave in the morn, you want me to leave you alone\nBut I got blood in mouth, I wanted to try you out\nSatisfy me;

'Tis now the time\nTo ask of whence you are. Report it.\n\nBELARIUS\nSir,\nIn Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:\nFurther to boast were neither true nor modest,\nUnless I add, we are honest.\nCYMBELINE\nBow your knees.\nArise my knights o' the battle: I create you\nCompanions to our person and will fit you\nWith dignities becoming your estates.\n\nEnter CORNELIUS and Ladies\n\nThere's business in these faces. Why so sadly\nGreet you our victory? you look like Romans,\nAnd not o' the court of Britain.\n\nCORNELIUS\nHail, great king!\nTo sour your happiness, I must report\nThe queen is dead.\n\nCYMBELINE\nWho worse than a physician\nWould this report become? But I consider,\nBy medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death\nWill seize the doctor too. How ended she?\n\nCORNELIUS\nWith horror, madly dying, like her life,\nWhich, being cruel to the world, concluded\nMost cruel to herself. What she confess'd\nI will report, so please you: these her women\nCan trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks\nWere present when she finish'd.\nCYMBELINE\nPrithee, say.\n\nCORNELIUS\nFirst, she confess'd she never loved you, only\nAffected greatness got by you, not you:\nMarried your royalty, was wife to your place;\nAbhorr'd your person.\n\nCYMBELINE\nShe alone knew this;\nAnd, but she spoke it dying, I would not\nBelieve her lips in opening it. Proceed.\n\nCORNELIUS\nYour daughter, whom she bore in hand to love\nWith such integrity, she did confess\nWas as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,\nBut that her flight prevented it, she had\nTa'en off by poison.\n\nCYMBELINE\nO most delicate fiend!\nWho is 't can read a woman? Is there more?\n\nCORNELIUS\nMore, sir, and worse. She did confess she had\nFor you a mortal mineral; which, being took,\nShould by the minute feed on life and lingering\nBy inches waste you: in which time she purposed,\nBy watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to\nO'ercome you with her show, and in time,\nWhen she had fitted you with her craft, to work\nHer son into the adoption of the crown:\nBut, failing of her end by his strange absence,\nGrew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite\nOf heaven and men, her purposes; repented\nThe evils she hatch'd were not effected; so\nDespairing died.\n\nCYMBELINE\nHeard you all this, her women?\n\nFIRST LADY\nWe did, so please your highness.\n\nCYMBELINE\nMine eyes\nWere not in fault, for she was beautiful;\nMine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,\nThat thought her like her seeming; it had\nbeen vicious\nTo have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!\nThat it was folly in me, thou mayst say,\nAnd prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!\n\nEnter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS behind, and IMOGEN\n\nThou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that\nThe Britons have razed out, though with the loss\nOf many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit\nThat their good souls may be appeased with slaughter\nOf you their captives, which ourself have granted:\nSo think of your estate.\n\nCAIUS LUCIUS\nConsider, sir, the chance of war: the day\nWas yours by accident; had it gone with us,\nWe should not, when the blood was cool,\nhave threaten'd\nOur prisoners with the sword. But since the gods\nWill have it thus, that nothing but our lives\nMay be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth\nA Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:\nAugustus lives to think on't: and so much\nFor my peculiar care. This one thing only\nI will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,\nLet him be ransom'd: never master had\nA page so kind, so duteous, diligent,\nSo tender over his occasions, true,\nSo feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join\nWith my request, which I make bold your highness\nCannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,\nThough he have served a Roman: save him, sir,\nAnd spare no blood beside.\n\nCYMBELINE\nI have surely seen him:\nHis favour is familiar to me. Boy,\nThou hast look'd thyself into my grace,\nAnd art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,\nTo say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:\nAnd ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,\nFitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;\nYea, though thou do demand a prisoner,\nThe noblest ta'en.\n\nIMOGEN\nI humbly thank your highness.\n\nCAIUS LUCIUS\nI do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;\nAnd yet I know thou wilt.\n\nIMOGEN\nNo, no: alack,\nThere's other work in hand: I see a thing\nBitter to me as death: your life, good master,\nMust shuffle for itself.\n\nCAIUS LUCIUS\nThe boy disdains me,\nHe leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys\nThat place them on the truth of girls and boys.\nWhy stands he so perplex'd?\n\nCYMBELINE\nWhat wouldst thou, boy?\nI love thee more and more: think more and more\nWhat's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,\nWilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?\n\nIMOGEN\nHe is a Roman; no more kin to me\nThan I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,\nAm something nearer.\n\nCYMBELINE\nWherefore eyest him so?\n\nIMOGEN\nI'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please\nTo give me hearing.\n\nCYMBELINE\nAy, with all my heart,\nAnd lend my best attention. What's thy name?\n\nIMOGEN\nFidele, sir.\n\nCYMBELINE\nThou'rt my good youth, my page;\nI'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.\n\nCYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart\n\nBELARIUS\nIs not this boy revived from death?\n\nARVIRAGUS\nOne sand another\nNot more resembles that sweet rosy lad\nWho died, and was Fidele. What think you?\n\nGUIDERIUS\nThe same dead thing alive.\nBELARIUS\nPeace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;\nCreatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure\nHe would have spoke to us.\n\nGUIDERIUS\nBut we saw him dead.\n\nBELARIUS\nBe silent; let's see further.\n\nPISANIO\n[Aside] It is my mistress:\nSince she is living, let the time run on\nTo good or bad.\n\nCYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward\n\nCYMBELINE\nCome, stand thou by our side;\nMake thy demand aloud.\n\nTo IACHIMO\n\nSir, step you forth;\nGive answer to this boy, and do it freely;\nOr, by our greatness and the grace of it,\nWhich is our honour, bitter torture shall\nWinnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.\n\nIMOGEN\nMy boon is, that this gentleman may render\nOf whom he had this ring.\n\nPOSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n[Aside] What's that to him?\n\nCYMBELINE\nThat diamond upon your finger, say\nHow came it yours?\n\nIACHIMO\nThou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that\nWhich, to be spoke, would torture thee.\n\nCYMBELINE\nHow! me?\n\nIACHIMO\nI am glad to be constrain'd to utter that\nWhich torments me to conceal. By villany\nI got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;\nWhom thou didst banish; and--which more may\ngrieve thee,\nAs it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived\n'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?\n\nCYMBELINE\nAll that belongs to this.\n\nIACHIMO\nThat paragon, thy daughter,--\nFor whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits\nQuail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.\n\nCYMBELINE\nMy daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:\nI had rather thou shouldst live while nature will\nThan die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.\n\nIACHIMO\nUpon a time,--unhappy was the clock\nThat struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed\nThe mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would\nOur viands had been poison'd, or at least\nThose which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--\nWhat should I say? he was too good to be\nWhere ill men were; and was the best of all\nAmongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,\nHearing us praise our loves of Italy\nFor beauty that made barren the swell'd boast\nOf him that best could speak, for feature, laming\nThe shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.\nPostures beyond brief nature, for condition,\nA shop of all the qualities that man\nLoves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,\nFairness which strikes the eye--\n\nCYMBELINE\nI stand on fire:\nCome to the matter.\n\nIACHIMO\nAll too soon I shall,\nUnless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,\nMost like a noble lord in love and one\nThat had a royal lover, took his hint;\nAnd, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein\nHe was as calm as virtue--he began\nHis mistress' picture; which by his tongue\nbeing made,\nAnd then a mind put in't, either our brags\nWere crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description\nProved us unspeaking sots.\n\nCYMBELINE\nNay, nay, to the purpose.\n\nIACHIMO\nYour daughter's chastity--there it begins.\nHe spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,\nAnd she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,\nMade scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him\nPieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore\nUpon his honour'd finger, to attain\nIn suit the place of's bed and win this ring\nBy hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,\nNo lesser of her honour confident\nThan I did truly find her, stakes this ring;\nAnd would so, had it been a carbuncle\nOf Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it\nBeen all the worth of's car. Away to Britain\nPost I in this design: well may you, sir,\nRemember me at court; where I was taught\nOf your chaste daughter the wide difference\n'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd\nOf hope, not longing, mine Italian brain\n'Gan in your duller Britain operate\nMost vilely; for my vantage, excellent:\nAnd, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,\nThat I return'd with simular proof enough\nTo make the noble Leonatus mad,\nBy wounding his belief in her renown\nWith tokens thus, and thus; averting notes\nOf chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--\nO cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks\nOf secret on her person, that he could not\nBut think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,\nI having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--\nMethinks, I see him now--\n\nPOSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n[Advancing] Ay, so thou dost,\nItalian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,\nEgregious murderer, thief, any thing\nThat's due to all the villains past, in being,\nTo come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,\nSome upright justicer! Thou, king, send out\nFor torturers ingenious: it is I\nThat all the abhorred things o' the earth amend\nBy being worse than they. I am Posthumus,\nThat kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--\nThat caused a lesser villain than myself,\nA sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple\nOf virtue was she; yea, and she herself.\nSpit, and throw stone s, cast mire upon me, set\nThe dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain\nBe call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and\nBe villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!\nMy queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,\nImogen, Imogen!\n\nIMOGEN\nPeace, my lord; hear, hear--\n\nPOSTHUMUS LEONATUS\nShall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,\nThere lie thy part.\n\nStriking her: she falls\n\nPISANIO\nO, gentlemen, help!\nMine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!\nYou ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!\nMine honour'd lady!\n\nCYMBELINE\nDoes the world go round?\n\nPOSTHUMUS LEONATUS\nHow come these staggers on me?\n\nPISANIO\nWake, my mistress!\n\nCYMBELINE\nIf this be so, the gods do mean to strike me\nTo death with mortal joy.\n\nPISANIO\nHow fares thy mistress?\n\nIMOGEN\nO, get thee from my sight;\nThou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!\nBreathe not where princes are.\n\nCYMBELINE\nThe tune of Imogen!\n\nPISANIO\nLady,\nThe gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if\nThat box I gave you was not thought by me\nA precious thing: I had it from the queen.\n\nCYMBELINE\nNew matter still?\n\nIMOGEN\nIt poison'd me.\n\nCORNELIUS\nO gods!\nI left out one thing which the queen confess'd.\nWhich must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio\nHave,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection\nWhich I gave him for cordial, she is served\nAs I would serve a rat.'\n\nCYMBELINE\nWhat's this, Comelius?\n\nCORNELIUS\nThe queen, sir, very oft importuned me\nTo temper poisons for her, still pretending\nThe satisfaction of her knowledge only\nIn killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,\nOf no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose\nWas of more danger, did compound for her\nA certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease\nThe present power of life, but in short time\nAll offices of nature should again\nDo their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?\n\nIMOGEN\nMost like I did, for I was dead.\n\nBELARIUS\nMy boys,\nThere was our error.\n\nGUIDERIUS\nThis is, sure, Fidele.\n\nIMOGEN\nWhy did you throw your wedded lady from you?\nThink that you are upon a rock; and now\nThrow me again.\n\nEmbracing him\n\nPOSTHUMUS LEONATUS\nHang there like a fruit, my soul,\nTill the tree die!\n\nCYMBELINE\nHow now, my flesh, my child!\nWhat, makest thou me a dullard in this act?\nWilt thou not speak to me?\n\nIMOGEN\n[Kneeling] Your blessing, sir.\n\nBELARIUS\n[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS] Though you did love\nthis youth, I blame ye not:\nYou had a motive for't.\n\nCYMBELINE\nMy tears that fall\nProve holy water on thee! Imogen,\nThy mother's dead.\n\nIMOGEN\nI am sorry for't, my lord.\n\nCYMBELINE\nO, she was nought; and long of her it was\nThat we meet here so strangely: but her son\nIs gone, we know not how nor where.\n\nPISANIO\nMy lord,\nNow fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,\nUpon my lady's missing, came to me\nWith his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,\nIf I discover'd not which way she was gone,\nIt was my instant death. By accident,\nhad a feigned letter of my master's\nThen in my pocket; which directed him\nTo seek her on the mountains near to Milford;\nWhere, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,\nWhich he enforced from me, away he posts\nWith unchaste purpose and with oath to violate\nMy lady's honour: what became of him\nI further know not.\n\nGUIDERIUS\nLet me end the story:\nI slew him there.\n\nCYMBELINE\nMarry, the gods forfend!\nI would not thy good deeds should from my lips\nPluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,\nDeny't again.\n\nGUIDERIUS\nI have spoke it, and I did it.\nCYMBELINE\nHe was a prince.\n\nGUIDERIUS\nA most incivil one: the wrongs he did me\nWere nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me\nWith language that would make me spurn the sea,\nIf it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;\nAnd am right glad he is not standing here\nTo tell this tale of mine.\n\nCYMBELINE\nI am sorry for thee:\nBy thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must\nEndure our law: thou'rt dead.\n\nIMOGEN\nThat headless man\nI thought had been my lord.\n\nCYMBELINE\nBind the offender,\nAnd take him from our presence.\n\nBELARIUS\nStay, sir king:\nThis man is better than the man he slew,\nAs well descended as thyself; and hath\nMore of thee merited than a band of Clotens\nHad ever scar for.\n\nTo the Guard\n\nLet his arms alone;\nThey were not born for bondage.\n\nCYMBELINE\nWhy, old soldier,\nWilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,\nBy tasting of our wrath? How of descent\nAs good as we?\n\nARVIRAGUS\nIn that he spake too far.\n\nCYMBELINE\nAnd thou shalt die for't.\n\nBELARIUS\nWe will die all three:\nBut I will prove that two on's are as good\nAs I have given out him. My sons, I must,\nFor mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,\nThough, haply, well for you.\n\nARVIRAGUS\nYour danger's ours.\n\nGUIDERIUS\nAnd our good his.\n\nBELARIUS\nHave at it then, by leave.\nThou hadst, great king, a subject who\nWas call'd Belarius.\n\nCYMBELINE\nWhat of him? he is\nA banish'd traitor.\n\nBELARIUS\nHe it is that hath\nAssumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;\nI know not how a traitor.\n\nCYMBELINE\nTake him hence:\nThe whole world shall not save him.\n\nBELARIUS\nNot too hot:\nFirst pay me for the nursing of thy sons;\nAnd let it be confiscate all, so soon\nAs I have received it.\n\nCYMBELINE\nNursing of my sons!\n\nBELARIUS\nI am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:\nEre I arise, I will prefer my sons;\nThen spare not the old father. Mighty sir,\nThese two young gentlemen, that call me father\nAnd think they are my sons, are none of mine;\nThey are the issue of your loins, my liege,\nAnd blood of your begetting.\n\nCYMBELINE\nHow! my issue!\n\nBELARIUS\nSo sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,\nAm that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:\nYour pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment\nItself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd\nWas all the harm I did. These gentle princes--\nFor such and so they are--these twenty years\nHave I train'd up: those arts they have as I\nCould put into them; my breeding was, sir, as\nYour highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,\nWhom for the theft I wedded, stole these children\nUpon my banishment: I moved her to't,\nHaving received the punishment before,\nFor that which I did then: beaten for loyalty\nExcited me to treason: their dear loss,\nThe more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped\nUnto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,\nHere are your sons again; and I must lose\nTwo of the sweet'st companions in the world.\nThe benediction of these covering heavens\nFall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy\nTo inlay heaven with stars.\n\nCYMBELINE\nThou weep'st, and speak'st.\nThe service that you three have done is more\nUnlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:\nIf these be they, I know not how to wish\nA pair of worthier sons.\n\nBELARIUS\nBe pleased awhile.\nThis gentleman, whom I call Polydore,\nMost worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:\nThis gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,\nYour younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd\nIn a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand\nOf his queen mother, which for more probation\nI can with ease produce.\n\nCYMBELINE\nGuiderius had\nUpon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;\nIt was a mark of wonder.\n\nBELARIUS\nThis is he;\nWho hath upon him still that natural stamp:\nIt was wise nature's end in the donation,\nTo be his evidence now.\n\nCYMBELINE\nO, what, am I\nA mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother\nRejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,\nThat, after this strange starting from your orbs,\nmay reign in them now! O Imogen,\nThou hast lost by this a kingdom.\n\nIMOGEN\nNo, my lord;\nI have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,\nHave we thus met? O, never say hereafter\nBut I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,\nWhen I was but your sister; I you brothers,\nWhen ye were so indeed.\n\nCYMBELINE\nDid you e'er meet?\n\nARVIRAGUS\nAy, my good lord.\n\nGUIDERIUS\nAnd at first meeting loved;\nContinued so, until we thought he died.\n\nCORNELIUS\nBy the queen's dram she swallow'd.\n\nCYMBELINE\nO rare instinct!\nWhen shall I hear all through? This fierce\nabridgement\nHath to it circumstantial branches, which\nDistinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?\nAnd when came you to serve our Roman captive?\nHow parted with your brothers? how first met them?\nWhy fled you from the court? and whither? These,\nAnd your three motives to the battle, with\nI know not how much more, should be demanded;\nAnd all the other by-dependencies,\nFrom chance to chance: but nor the time nor place\nWill serve our long inter'gatories. See,\nPosthumus anchors upon Imogen,\nAnd she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye\nOn him, her brother, me, her master, hitting\nEach object with a joy: the counterchange\nIs severally in all. Let's quit this ground,\nAnd smoke the temple with our sacrifices.\n\nTo BELARIUS\n\nThou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.\n\nIMOGEN\nYou are my father too, and did relieve me,\nTo see this gracious season.\n\nCYMBELINE\nAll o'erjoy'd,\nSave these in bonds: let them be joyful too,\nFor they shall taste our comfort.\n\nIMOGEN\nMy good master,\nI will yet do you service.\n\nCAIUS LUCIUS\nHappy be you!\n\nCYMBELINE\nThe forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,\nHe would have well becomed this place, and graced\nThe thankings of a king.\n\nPOSTHUMUS LEONATUS\nI am, sir,\nThe soldier that did company these three\nIn poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for\nThe purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,\nSpeak, Iachimo: I had you down and might\nHave made you finish.\n\nIACHIMO\n[Kneeling] I am down again:\nBut now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,\nAs then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,\nWhich I so often owe: but your ring first;\nAnd here the bracelet of the truest princess\nThat ever swore her faith.\n\nPOSTHUMUS LEONATUS\nKneel not to me:\nThe power that I have on you is, to spare you;\nThe malice towards you to forgive you: live,\nAnd deal with others better.\n\nCYMBELINE\nNobly doom'd!\nWe'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;\nPardon's the word to all.\n\nARVIRAGUS\nYou holp us, sir,\nAs you did mean indeed to be our brother;\nJoy'd are we that you are.\n\nPOSTHUMUS LEONATUS\nYour servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,\nCall forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought\nGreat Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,\nAppear'd to me, with other spritely shows\nOf mine own kindred: when I waked, I found\nThis label on my bosom; whose containing\nIs so from sense in hardness, that I can\nMake no collection of it: let him show\nHis skill in the construction.\n\nCAIUS LUCIUS\nPhilarmonus!\n\nSOOTHSAYER\nHere, my good lord.\n\nCAIUS LUCIUS\nRead, and declare the meaning.\n\nSOOTHSAYER\n[Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself\nunknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a\npiece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar\nshall be lopped branches, which, being dead many\nyears, shall after revive, be jointed to the old\nstock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end\nhis miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in\npeace and plenty.'\nThou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;\nThe fit and apt construction of thy name,\nBeing Leonatus, doth import so much.\n\nTo CYMBELINE\n\nThe piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,\nWhich we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'\nWe term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine\nIs this most constant wife; who, even now,\nAnswering the letter of the oracle,\nUnknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about\nWith this most tender air.\n\nCYMBELINE\nThis hath some seeming.\n\nSOOTHSAYER\nThe lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,\nPersonates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point\nThy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,\nFor many years thought dead, are now revived,\nTo the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue\nPromises Britain peace and plenty.\n\nCYMBELINE\nWell\nMy peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,\nAlthough the victor, we submit to Caesar,\nAnd to the Roman empire; promising\nTo pay our wonted tribute, from the which\nWe were dissuaded by our wicked queen;\nWhom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,\nHave laid most heavy hand.\n\nSOOTHSAYER\nThe fingers of the powers above do tune\nThe harmony of this peace. The vision\nWhich I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke\nOf this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant\nIs full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,\nFrom south to west on wing soaring aloft,\nLessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun\nSo vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,\nThe imperial Caesar, should again unite\nHis favour with the radiant Cymbeline,\nWhich shines here in the west.\n\nCYMBELINE\nLaud we the gods;\nAnd let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils\nFrom our blest altars. Publish we this peace\nTo all our subjects. Set we forward: let\nA Roman and a British ensign wave\nFriendly together: so through Lud's-town march:\nAnd in the temple of great Jupiter\nOur peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.\nSet on there! Never was a war did cease,\nEre bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.\n\nExeuntEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/3406355", "artist_names": "Gerald Haywood", "full_title": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log by\u00a0Gerald\u00a0Haywood", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "id": 3406355, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 3541884, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1538871425, "path": "/Gerald-haywood-2018-haywoodindahood-listening-log-annotated", "pyongs_count": 2, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Gerald-haywood-2018-haywoodindahood-listening-log-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2018, "month": 1, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "January 1, 2018", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 1, 2018", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 26353}, "title": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log", "title_with_featured": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log", "updated_by_human_at": 1667015688, "url": "https://genius.com/Gerald-haywood-2018-haywoodindahood-listening-log-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1065349", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4184eb1c743b380255c43780ed6ef9f7.398x398x1.jpg", "id": 1065349, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4184eb1c743b380255c43780ed6ef9f7.398x398x1.jpg", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Gerald Haywood", "slug": "Gerald-haywood", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Gerald-haywood", "iq": 99371}, "artist": "Gerald Haywood", "lyrics": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log LyricsLast updated: 10/6/2018, 5:16PM MSTOctoberOctober 6Jesse Powell \u2014 Jesse Powell (1996)October 5girl in red \u2014 chapter 1 (2018)\nBlanca \u2014 Shattered (2018)\nLouGotCash (feat.

Ward in the face as a blood sacrifice\nFor the 1% chance it makes Bender come back to life\nThis ain't Aaron climbin' the ladder and gettin' his co-signs\nThis ain't passin' the torch like, \"Damn it would've been different in old times.\"\nThis ain't a debatable or classic, you can nitpick and quote lines\nThis is Diz' versus Gjonaj\nThis is David slingin' his stone whistlin' the wind as it goes by missin' bullseye\nThis is Goliath, snappin' his neck with a twist like a bow tie\nAye may this moment be known in infamy\nThe outlook spells out \"I 3-0'd him instantly\"\nAnd \"outlook\" spelled out has three O's specifically\nIt must be an omen, you know he listenin'\nBro, no way you gettin' A W, you was close initially\nRematch? Get 3-0'd tomorrow, it's already 1-0 officially\nAnd there's three O's in \"tomorrow\", one \"O\" in \"officially\"\nFuck a break down, I don't let emotions get to me\nI'll orchestrate ya death, compose the symphony\nI fathered son, I'll Holy Ghost him literally\nLord please bless this food, three exit wounds, that's a Holy Trinity\nGo with dignity, he's always throwin' fits, no delivery\nCan't control his pitch, feels like I'm coachin' little league\nBro, prideful, just load his Twitter feed\nWhere's this supposed Christian themes?\nOh I get it, he just boasts religiously\nEgotistic, no humility\nFull of himself; Multiplicity\nSold his soul but isn't sold on his own ability\nJesus Christ, if you get your power from the Son (sun) it's solar energy\nBlind faith versus blind rage, we copin' differently\nProtect my profit margin like a prophet marchin'; hold the stick wit' me\nGive your dome divinity\nUse the Hand Of God to part it, like Moses split the sea\nYou ain't built for this, that's a known deficiency\nIf I give him a break, osteoporosis symptoms, he ain't got a bone to pick with me\nBut we can beef like rival clans that die over tribal lands\nWelcome to the Devil's Playground where you die at your idle hands\nThink it's a game, 'til I catch him in sight\nMake him question his life, boy you better think twice\nLike, \"Is that your final answer? Cause you are so close to gettin' this right.\"\nI'll dead Aaron, shut his signal off, dead air him\nDog fights, lead blarin'\nLaunch strikes; defense chairman\nA jet airman like The Red Baron\nHe's not fly, I drop by, he kept starin'\nSo I locked eyes, his inner thoughts die just left barren\nAnd this? This isn't your moment\nThis ain't a goal you've attained\nThis ain't you, lockin' the top contender spot nobody's claimed\nThis is KOTD, keepin' lil' bro in his lane\nIt's J-Pro, throwin' a spike strip on his road to the chain\nThis ain't a classic, you gettin' 30'd now\nDon't need the ratchet, don't need the burner now\nI'll pull out a hatchet, soon as he turn around\nI get to hackin' and hackin'\n'Til they like 'Ganik, \"I think the server's down!\"\nTime!\n[Round 1: A. Ward]\nMy rebuttal game crazy, Greg you know it works\nI'm finna go berserk\nYou put \"O's in words, I put holes in dirt\nLet's talk\nIt's no secret, at the last event we had words\nAnd even after you apologizing, it still didn\u2019t feel right\nYou see, he got drunk and disrespected my deceased family member in real life\nAnd when those type situations arise, as a Christian\nI do my best to stand true\nI showed you grace and mercy back in May\u2026\nTry it again and I\u2019ma show you what these hands do\nLet's talk\nSoon as they sent the Venmo clown, I was ten toes down\nYou couldn\u2019t beat me in two minutes\nYou needed Organik to extend those rounds\nI came to your coast, on your terms, for what?\nTo hear you deny that Christ lives?\nWell after this; you not gon' be mad God didn\u2019t show up to your battles tonight\nYou gon' be pissed off that I DID\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m trashin' what you came with\nIll Will 30'd you at Massacre because half of you\u2019s complacent\nThe fans give you breaks cause of battles in the past when you would slay it\nYou hear \"Illmac\" you think \"legend\"\nHa, I\u2019m laughin' at that statement\nI lay this Mac(k) down\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter what your name is\nFace it, this is where the journey begins\nYou needed help in your last battle in the third for the win\nGotti jumped in \u2013 aw, what a courteous friend\nCall ya shooter, I am my shooter and he can get 30'd again!\nY\u2019all supportin this dude?\nY\u2019all supportin this dude?\nYou might also like{fake chokes}\n\nYeah right, I ain't choke, what I look like comin' up with rounds shorter than you?\nLet's talk\nAgainst Rone he said he repped the Northwest, of course it\u2019s a fluke\nThis year, Carmelo Anthony\u2019s done more for Portland than you\nWhat y\u2019all see in \u2018Mac?\nLegend? I don\u2019t believe in that\nThe beast is back\nI'm too surgical, clamp the hemostats\nThis a vegan snack to the whips that hit Jesus back\nI keep it at least a stack\nI\u2019m the same person everywhere I go like when Liam Neeson acts\nTo be exact; that's just a bunch of multi\u2019s thrown in to increase the stats\nAnd to give y\u2019all the feeling I\u2019m doing something special, it's the Kreatine of Rap\nBut it's Illmac's long build up style that I think is trash\nCause if the Bar never connects for 'Mac, y'all tell me where the Genius at?\nBut wait, it' the legend Illmac\nEvery line brought to the sheet, and authored is heat\nHe\u2019ll start up a scheme with the staff of Moses that parted the seas\nThen he moves to the God of the Greeks\nOne minute he\u2019s on Santa Monica Beach\nThe next line, he's got more presence (presents) than Hanukkah week\nA little Intrigue, a lotta mystique\nAnd all of a sudden as the punchline arrives, the plot of the piece\nHe's got a sword drawn from a sheath\nHis hand is steady enough to carve initials in the bark of a tree\nMy goodness\nWe get it, you can rhyme well\nYou make better music than me\nYou been battling 15 years, I been doin it three\nWe on the same stages, get the same bag\nY\u2019all believe he\u2019s a monster?\nA forefather to this scene? I'm unbelievably honored\nIf I\u2019m standing right here, right now \u2013 equally sponsored\nEither that means I'm really good too or the culture you built is just that easy to conquer\nSo back back\nWho said 'Mac Lethal? It\u2019s a (w)rap fast\nAfter this punch, it ain't a laugh track\nKinfolk droppin\u2019\nAnd his mama looking at 'Mac in a case but can\u2019t have him, she window shoppin'\nI said I know Ill's mechanics, he don't tote steel and blam it\nI'm hungry, like being broke, feeling famished\nWe on the Fresh Coast, in The Bay, it give you that old feel Organik\nBut you put it on Sunday?!\nYeeeeah, on God now I got the homefield advantage\nWhat? You like three foot nothin'?\nYou only here cause Pete was duckin'\nI can get wilder with punches\n[The Saurus]\nLoso ducked me!\n\n[A. Ward]\nWhat? You like three foot nothin'?\nYou only here cause Pete was duckin'\nI can get wilder with punches\nI can get Wilder than or tease (Ortiz) with punches\nBut a venue won't telegraph you should've seen it comin'\nSee it's only the first round\nYou don't Raise The Bar in any verse pal\nMax, on the bench, not getting press he deserves while\nThe weight on his shoulders isn\u2019t lifted cause a Deal never works out\nYou see they said this was a style clash\nI agree, fire/trash\nYou finna be mad as can be\nYou spent a whole round talkin' 'bout God and end up losin' the battle to me\n\n[Round 2: Illmac]\nYou talk about, how I'll whip a sword out, start carvin' a tree\nThat shit was mean dawg\nBut really your career relates to that\nCause initially we seen heart\nMust've just been two love birds chisiling in tree bark\nI didn't wish any of his family members death, but let's just say I did for a second\nI mean according to your religion wouldn't I just be wishin' her Heaven?\nI don't know why that shit would offend him\nI mean unless you think she's going in a different direction\nI don't know, you tell me who's scheme was better\nI mean, picture him like punkin' me like, \"You need to get control of your demons better.\"\nLike I'm really feellin' pressure\nTough guy act, I give you E for \"effort\"\nBut, if you want me to beat the shit outta  you after this battle my dude I got you, I'd be my pleasure\nLook, you know what my favorite part of your round was?\nWatchin' you do this battle rap act that you do\nWhen you force what you think a rapper should do\nBecause being naturally cool comes so fucking unnatural to you\nI mean, have you seen this man prepare?\nEvery city, droppin' sports teams they might be a fan of there\nLike he's a fan of theirs\nCampaigning to the crowd, should've ran from mayor\nLike, \"How 'bout them Oakland uhh Raiders? I'm thinking champs next year?\"\nIt's so pathetic and sad I swear\nBut if you had a spirit animal it would be a pander bear\nYou are a massive square\nYou're like that wanna be cool dad that cares\nPracticing his rappin' accent in the bathroom mirror\nFlippin' around a backwards chair\nSittin' down interruptin' the convo like, \"What's crackin' player?\"\nQuit actin' weird\nWon't make eye contact, he's scared\nLike he can die over a random glare\nBitch man up!\nStares will get you sent to the man upstairs!\nBring the racket though I'll smack this hoe\nMcenroe/Wimbleton throw\nRemovin' scalp from skull like a Navajo Indian\nHammer close, Whack-A-Mole, swing at him, catch the Holy Ghost\nLittle ginger feel the spirit when I slap the soul into him\nYou listenin'?\nHe talks about his faith no stop, but if I do it's different\nHe'll even relate the Bible to violent euphemisms\nIt's a special move it gives you super powers\nHits a phone booth and switched into da-da-da-da Super Christian\nBut as soon as you have a different view than him he turns into a victim\nTweetin', \"Nothing battle rap loves more than a losin' Christian.\"\nBitch, no one hates you cause your little supersitions\nBut that just proves how you view your privilege\nIt's how you use religion\nSee he loves it when it works in his favor then hates it when it's used against him\nLike, \"I 30'd Geechi, I 30'd Geechi.\"\nHere's an example that son said\nHe shamed Geechi for gang affiliations and the angle went unchecked\nThat shit screamed, \"I am priviledged\", now we're back on the subject\nThought he was playin' Gotti and the match was an upset\nMore like playin' God, he's actually upset\nHe's battlin' a white savior complex and ain't landed a punch yet\nAnd I'm just watchin' like, \"Keep going. Fight back.\"\nHe's like, \"My flow bring Christ back.\"\nRockin' a \"Jesus is my homie\" t-shirt\nJesus like, \"Hmmm. I don't know you like that.\"\nSee, you don't get the point\nIt's deeper than the things that he said to Geechi and 'Tez about the streets\nIt's what that idea reflects\nChrist died next to sinners and thieves\nImagine him thinkin' the best way to reach him when his beliefs was to treat them as less\nBut then have the nerve to cry over Tweets, when a fan thinks what he says\nLike he's persecuted by the scene he feels the need to impress\nLike he's the hero in the story that he reads in his head\nIn Hell doin' a PG that never gets released on the web\nIt's 2019...we literally base time off of Jesus's death\nChristianity runs the world, stop actin' like you're being oppressed\nBut I ain't sayin' religion is a scam, just shit I didn't understand\nNobody carried me on ten toes imprinted in the sand\nYeah, God laughs while you fiddle with your plans\nThat's the difference I'm a man\nAlways on the mountain, trimmin' up a branch\nMoses burning bush, diggin' trenches, blisters on my hand\nRoad trippin', in a rental with my mans\nNo more than five over the speed limit when they scan\nPigs will get you if they can\nVaxil, trunk full, makin' five figures off of plants\nBefore you was pissin' in your pants researchin' synonyms for \"Bands\"\nHe wouldn't rip the tag off a mattress, tryin' to stick it to the man\nWhile I'm slicker than the pan glistening with Pam\nLet me put it in scripture for a fan\nThis is Christ's death, you sacrificial as the lamb\nI'm the symbol of a lion with a spirit risen from the land\nGoin' BethleHAM on you, before I cave into your demands\nI'll leave Earth, come back with a body in three\nThat's how biblical I am\nTime\n\n[Round 2: A. Ward]\nApparently, I'm a \"pander bear\" that's fine\nWould make sense except I wore a Kansas City Chief's jersey in Oakland last time\nI'm just prayin' I deliver it well\nYour grandma in the hospital\nI'm prayin' she goes to Heaven\nHer grandson I'm givin' him Hell\nLet's talk\nYou was rappin' ya little heart out, all types of substance\nFew times in that last round you went from Regular to spicy Mustard\nMy goodness you are short kid\nI was in my hotel room streaming the Book Of Ryan before this\nWent from listening to Royce Da 5\u20199 to battlin' Greg The 4\u20196\"\nDwarfism; must be hard in these streets\nLook at the bright side, I mean the kids clothes in the youth section of Target are cheap\nAnd as long as you\u2019re cool with Lightning McQueen from Cars on the sleeves\nYou could prolly rock what?

Willet, the denounced and proscribed of 'prentices, had happened to be at home when his father's courtly guest presented himself before the Maypole door\u2014that is, if it had not perversely chanced to be one of the half-dozen days in the whole year on which he was at liberty to absent himself for as many hours without question or reproach\u2014he would have contrived, by hook or crook, to dive to the very bottom of Mr Chester's mystery, and to come at his purpose with as much certainty as though he had been his confidential adviser. In that fortunate case, the lovers would have had quick warning of the ills that threatened them, and the aid of various timely and wise suggestions to boot; for all Joe's readiness of thought and action, and all his sympathies and good wishes, were enlisted in favour of the young people, and were staunch in devotion to their cause. Whether this disposition arose out of his old prepossessions in favour of the young lady, whose history had surrounded her in his mind, almost from his cradle, with circumstances of unusual interest; or from his attachment towards the young gentleman, into whose confidence he had, through his shrewdness and alacrity, and the rendering of sundry important services as a spy and messenger, almost imperceptibly glided; whether they had their origin in either of these sources, or in the habit natural to youth, or in the constant badgering and worrying of his venerable parent, or in any hidden little love affair of his own which gave him something of a fellow-feeling in the matter, it is needless to inquire\u2014especially as Joe was out of the way, and had no opportunity on that particular occasion of testifying to his sentiments either on one side or the other.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was, in fact, the twenty-fifth of March, which, as most people know to their cost, is, and has been time out of mind, one of those unpleasant epochs termed quarter-days. On this twenty-fifth of March, it was John Willet's pride annually to settle, in hard cash, his account with a certain vintner and distiller in the city of London; to give into whose hands a canvas bag containing its exact amount, and not a penny more or less, was the end and object of a journey for Joe, so surely as the year and day came round.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This journey was performed upon an old grey mare, concerning whom John had an indistinct set of ideas hovering about him, to the effect that she could win a plate or cup if she tried. She never had tried, and probably never would now, being some fourteen or fifteen years of age, short in wind, long in body, and rather the worse for wear in respect of her mane and tail. Notwithstanding these slight defects, John perfectly gloried in the animal; and when she was brought round to the door by Hugh, actually retired into the bar, and there, in a secret grove of lemons, laughed with pride.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'There's a bit of horseflesh, Hugh!' said John, when he had recovered enough self-command to appear at the door again. 'There's a comely creature! There's high mettle! There's bone!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was bone enough beyond all doubt; and so Hugh seemed to think, as he sat sideways in the saddle, lazily doubled up with his chin nearly touching his knees; and heedless of the dangling stirrups and loose bridle-rein, sauntered up and down on the little green before the door.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Mind you take good care of her, sir,' said John, appealing from this insensible person to his son and heir, who now appeared, fully equipped and ready. 'Don't you ride hard.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I should be puzzled to do that, I think, father,' Joe replied, casting a disconsolate look at the animal.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'None of your impudence, sir, if you please,' retorted old John. 'What would you ride, sir? A wild ass or zebra would be too tame for you, wouldn't he, eh sir? You'd like to ride a roaring lion, wouldn't you, sir, eh sir? Hold your tongue, sir.' When Mr Willet, in his differences with his son, had exhausted all the questions that occurred to him, and Joe had said nothing at all in answer, he generally wound up by bidding him hold his tongue.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'And what does the boy mean,' added Mr Willet, after he had stared at him for a little time, in a species of stupefaction, 'by cocking his hat, to such an extent! Are you going to kill the wintner, sir?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No,' said Joe, tartly; 'I'm not. Now your mind's at ease, father.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'With a milintary air, too!' said Mr Willet, surveying him from top to toe; 'with a swaggering, fire-eating, biling-water drinking sort of way with him! And what do you mean by pulling up the crocuses and snowdrops, eh sir?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It's only a little nosegay,' said Joe, reddening. 'There's no harm in that, I hope?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You're a boy of business, you are, sir!' said Mr Willet, disdainfully, 'to go supposing that wintners care for nosegays.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I don't suppose anything of the kind,' returned Joe. 'Let them keep their red noses for bottles and tankards. These are going to Mr Varden's house.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'And do you suppose HE minds such things as crocuses?' demanded John.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I don't know, and to say the truth, I don't care,' said Joe. 'Come, father, give me the money, and in the name of patience let me go.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'There it is, sir,' replied John; 'and take care of it; and mind you don't make too much haste back, but give the mare a long rest.\u2014Do you mind?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Ay, I mind,' returned Joe. 'She'll need it, Heaven knows.'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'And don't you score up too much at the Black Lion,' said John. 'Mind that too.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Then why don't you let me have some money of my own?' retorted Joe, sorrowfully; 'why don't you, father? What do you send me into London for, giving me only the right to call for my dinner at the Black Lion, which you're to pay for next time you go, as if I was not to be trusted with a few shillings? Why do you use me like this? It's not right of you. You can't expect me to be quiet under it.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Let him have money!' cried John, in a drowsy reverie. 'What does he call money\u2014guineas? Hasn't he got money? Over and above the tolls, hasn't he one and sixpence?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'One and sixpence!' repeated his son contemptuously.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes, sir,' returned John, 'one and sixpence. When I was your age, I had never seen so much money, in a heap. A shilling of it is in case of accidents\u2014the mare casting a shoe, or the like of that. The other sixpence is to spend in the diversions of London; and the diversion I recommend is going to the top of the Monument, and sitting there. There's no temptation there, sir\u2014no drink\u2014no young women\u2014no bad characters of any sort\u2014nothing but imagination. That's the way I enjoyed myself when I was your age, sir.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To this, Joe made no answer, but beckoning Hugh, leaped into the saddle and rode away; and a very stalwart, manly horseman he looked, deserving a better charger than it was his fortune to bestride. John stood staring after him, or rather after the grey mare (for he had no eyes for her rider), until man and beast had been out of sight some twenty minutes, when he began to think they were gone, and slowly re-entering the house, fell into a gentle doze.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The unfortunate grey mare, who was the agony of Joe's life, floundered along at her own will and pleasure until the Maypole was no longer visible, and then, contracting her legs into what in a puppet would have been looked upon as a clumsy and awkward imitation of a canter, mended her pace all at once, and did it of her own accord. The acquaintance with her rider's usual mode of proceeding, which suggested this improvement in hers, impelled her likewise to turn up a bye-way, leading\u2014not to London, but through lanes running parallel with the road they had come, and passing within a few hundred yards of the Maypole, which led finally to an inclosure surrounding a large, old, red-brick mansion\u2014the same of which mention was made as the Warren in the first chapter of this history. Coming to a dead stop in a little copse thereabout, she suffered her rider to dismount with right goodwill, and to tie her to the trunk of a tree.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Stay there, old girl,' said Joe, 'and let us see whether there's any little commission for me to-day.' So saying, he left her to browze upon such stunted grass and weeds as happened to grow within the length of her tether, and passing through a wicket gate, entered the grounds on foot.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The pathway, after a very few minutes' walking, brought him close to the house, towards which, and especially towards one particular window, he directed many covert glances. It was a dreary, silent building, with echoing courtyards, desolated turret-chambers, and whole suites of rooms shut up and mouldering to ruin.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The terrace-garden, dark with the shade of overhanging trees, had an air of melancholy that was quite oppressive. Great iron gates, disused for many years, and red with rust, drooping on their hinges and overgrown with long rank grass, seemed as though they tried to sink into the ground, and hide their fallen state among the friendly weeds. The fantastic monsters on the walls, green with age and damp, and covered here and there with moss, looked grim and desolate. There was a sombre aspect even on that part of the mansion which was inhabited and kept in good repair, that struck the beholder with a sense of sadness; of something forlorn and failing, whence cheerfulness was banished. It would have been difficult to imagine a bright fire blazing in the dull and darkened rooms, or to picture any gaiety of heart or revelry that the frowning walls shut in. It seemed a place where such things had been, but could be no more\u2014the very ghost of a house, haunting the old spot in its old outward form, and that was all.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Much of this decayed and sombre look was attributable, no doubt, to the death of its former master, and the temper of its present occupant; but remembering the tale connected with the mansion, it seemed the very place for such a deed, and one that might have been its predestined theatre years upon years ago. Viewed with reference to this legend, the sheet of water where the steward's body had been found appeared to wear a black and sullen character, such as no other pool might own; the bell upon the roof that had told the tale of murder to the midnight wind, became a very phantom whose voice would raise the listener's hair on end; and every leafless bough that nodded to another, had its stealthy whispering of the crime.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joe paced up and down the path, sometimes stopping in affected contemplation of the building or the prospect, sometimes leaning against a tree with an assumed air of idleness and indifference, but always keeping an eye upon the window he had singled out at first. After some quarter of an hour's delay, a small white hand was waved to him for an instant from this casement, and the young man, with a respectful bow, departed; saying under his breath as he crossed his horse again, 'No errand for me to-day!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the air of smartness, the cock of the hat to which John Willet had objected, and the spring nosegay, all betokened some little errand of his own, having a more interesting object than a vintner or even a locksmith. So, indeed, it turned out; for when he had settled with the vintner\u2014whose place of business was down in some deep cellars hard by Thames Street, and who was as purple-faced an old gentleman as if he had all his life supported their arched roof on his head\u2014when he had settled the account, and taken the receipt, and declined tasting more than three glasses of old sherry, to the unbounded astonishment of the purple-faced vintner, who, gimlet in hand, had projected an attack upon at least a score of dusty casks, and who stood transfixed, or morally gimleted as it were, to his own wall\u2014when he had done all this, and disposed besides of a frugal dinner at the Black Lion in Whitechapel; spurning the Monument and John's advice, he turned his steps towards the locksmith's house, attracted by the eyes of blooming Dolly Varden.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joe was by no means a sheepish fellow, but, for all that, when he got to the corner of the street in which the locksmith lived, he could by no means make up his mind to walk straight to the house. First, he resolved to stroll up another street for five minutes, then up another street for five minutes more, and so on until he had lost full half an hour, when he made a bold plunge and found himself with a red face and a beating heart in the smoky workshop.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Joe Willet, or his ghost?' said Varden, rising from the desk at which he was busy with his books, and looking at him under his spectacles. 'Which is it? Joe in the flesh, eh? That's hearty. And how are all the Chigwell company, Joe?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Much as usual, sir\u2014they and I agree as well as ever.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Well, well!' said the locksmith. 'We must be patient, Joe, and bear with old folks' foibles. How's the mare, Joe? Does she do the four miles an hour as easily as ever? Ha, ha, ha! Does she, Joe? Eh!\u2014What have we there, Joe\u2014a nosegay!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A very poor one, sir\u2014I thought Miss Dolly\u2014'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No, no,' said Gabriel, dropping his voice, and shaking his head, 'not Dolly. Give 'em to her mother, Joe. A great deal better give 'em to her mother. Would you mind giving 'em to Mrs Varden, Joe?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh no, sir,' Joe replied, and endeavouring, but not with the greatest possible success, to hide his disappointment. 'I shall be very glad, I'm sure.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'That's right,' said the locksmith, patting him on the back. 'It don't matter who has 'em, Joe?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Not a bit, sir.'\u2014Dear heart, how the words stuck in his throat!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Come in,' said Gabriel. 'I have just been called to tea. She's in the parlour.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'She,' thought Joe. 'Which of 'em I wonder\u2014Mrs or Miss?' The locksmith settled the doubt as neatly as if it had been expressed aloud, by leading him to the door, and saying, 'Martha, my dear, here's young Mr Willet.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, Mrs Varden, regarding the Maypole as a sort of human mantrap, or decoy for husbands; viewing its proprietor, and all who aided and abetted him, in the light of so many poachers among Christian men; and believing, moreover, that the publicans coupled with sinners in Holy Writ were veritable licensed victuallers; was far from being favourably disposed towards her visitor. Wherefore she was taken faint directly; and being duly presented with the crocuses and snowdrops, divined on further consideration that they were the occasion of the languor which had seized upon her spirits. 'I'm afraid I couldn't bear the room another minute,' said the good lady, 'if they remained here. WOULD you excuse my putting them out of window?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joe begged she wouldn't mention it on any account, and smiled feebly as he saw them deposited on the sill outside. If anybody could have known the pains he had taken to make up that despised and misused bunch of flowers!\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I feel it quite a relief to get rid of them, I assure you,' said Mrs Varden. 'I'm better already.' And indeed she did appear to have plucked up her spirits.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joe expressed his gratitude to Providence for this favourable dispensation, and tried to look as if he didn't wonder where Dolly was.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You're sad people at Chigwell, Mr Joseph,' said Mrs V.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I hope not, ma'am,' returned Joe.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You're the cruellest and most inconsiderate people in the world,' said Mrs Varden, bridling. 'I wonder old Mr Willet, having been a married man himself, doesn't know better than to conduct himself as he does. His doing it for profit is no excuse. I would rather pay the money twenty times over, and have Varden come home like a respectable and sober tradesman. If there is one character,' said Mrs Varden with great emphasis, 'that offends and disgusts me more than another, it is a sot.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Come, Martha, my dear,' said the locksmith cheerily, 'let us have tea, and don't let us talk about sots. There are none here, and Joe don't want to hear about them, I dare say.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this crisis, Miggs appeared with toast.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I dare say he does not,' said Mrs Varden; 'and I dare say you do not, Varden. It's a very unpleasant subject, I have no doubt, though I won't say it's personal'\u2014Miggs coughed\u2014'whatever I may be forced to think'\u2014Miggs sneezed expressively. 'You never will know, Varden, and nobody at young Mr Willet's age\u2014you'll excuse me, sir\u2014can be expected to know, what a woman suffers when she is waiting at home under such circumstances. If you don't believe me, as I know you don't, here's Miggs, who is only too often a witness of it\u2014ask her.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh! she were very bad the other night, sir, indeed she were, said Miggs. 'If you hadn't the sweetness of an angel in you, mim, I don't think you could abear it, I raly don't.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Miggs,' said Mrs Varden, 'you're profane.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Begging your pardon, mim,' returned Miggs, with shrill rapidity, 'such was not my intentions, and such I hope is not my character, though I am but a servant.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Answering me, Miggs, and providing yourself,' retorted her mistress, looking round with dignity, 'is one and the same thing. How dare you speak of angels in connection with your sinful fellow-beings\u2014mere'\u2014said Mrs Varden, glancing at herself in a neighbouring mirror, and arranging the ribbon of her cap in a more becoming fashion\u2014'mere worms and grovellers as we are!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I did not intend, mim, if you please, to give offence,' said Miggs, confident in the strength of her compliment, and developing strongly in the throat as usual, 'and I did not expect it would be took as such. I hope I know my own unworthiness, and that I hate and despise myself and all my fellow-creatures as every practicable Christian should.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You'll have the goodness, if you please,' said Mrs Varden, loftily, 'to step upstairs and see if Dolly has finished dressing, and to tell her that the chair that was ordered for her will be here in a minute, and that if she keeps it waiting, I shall send it away that instant.\u2014I'm sorry to see that you don't take your tea, Varden, and that you don't take yours, Mr Joseph; though of course it would be foolish of me to expect that anything that can be had at home, and in the company of females, would please YOU.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This pronoun was understood in the plural sense, and included both gentlemen, upon both of whom it was rather hard and undeserved, for Gabriel had applied himself to the meal with a very promising appetite, until it was spoilt by Mrs Varden herself, and Joe had as great a liking for the female society of the locksmith's house\u2014or for a part of it at all events\u2014as man could well entertain.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he had no opportunity to say anything in his own defence, for at that moment Dolly herself appeared, and struck him quite dumb with her beauty. Never had Dolly looked so handsome as she did then, in all the glow and grace of youth, with all her charms increased a hundredfold by a most becoming dress, by a thousand little coquettish ways which nobody could assume with a better grace, and all the sparkling expectation of that accursed party. It is impossible to tell how Joe hated that party wherever it was, and all the other people who were going to it, whoever they were.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she hardly looked at him\u2014no, hardly looked at him. And when the chair was seen through the open door coming blundering into the workshop, she actually clapped her hands and seemed glad to go. But Joe gave her his arm\u2014there was some comfort in that\u2014and handed her into it. To see her seat herself inside, with her laughing eyes brighter than diamonds, and her hand\u2014surely she had the prettiest hand in the world\u2014on the ledge of the open window, and her little finger provokingly and pertly tilted up, as if it wondered why Joe didn't squeeze or kiss it! To think how well one or two of the modest snowdrops would have become that delicate bodice, and how they were lying neglected outside the parlour window! To see how Miggs looked on with a face expressive of knowing how all this loveliness was got up, and of being in the secret of every string and pin and hook and eye, and of saying it ain't half as real as you think, and I could look quite as well myself if I took the pains! To hear that provoking precious little scream when the chair was hoisted on its poles, and to catch that transient but not-to-be-forgotten vision of the happy face within\u2014what torments and aggravations, and yet what delights were these! The very chairmen seemed favoured rivals as they bore her down the street.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There never was such an alteration in a small room in a small time as in that parlour when they went back to finish tea. So dark, so deserted, so perfectly disenchanted. It seemed such sheer nonsense to be sitting tamely there, when she was at a dance with more lovers than man could calculate fluttering about her\u2014with the whole party doting on and adoring her, and wanting to marry her. Miggs was hovering about too; and the fact of her existence, the mere circumstance of her ever having been born, appeared, after Dolly, such an unaccountable practical joke. It was impossible to talk. It couldn't be done. He had nothing left for it but to stir his tea round, and round, and round, and ruminate on all the fascinations of the locksmith's lovely daughter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gabriel was dull too. It was a part of the certain uncertainty of Mrs Varden's temper, that when they were in this condition, she should be gay and sprightly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I need have a cheerful disposition, I am sure,' said the smiling housewife, 'to preserve any spirits at all; and how I do it I can scarcely tell.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Ah, mim,' sighed Miggs, 'begging your pardon for the interruption, there an't a many like you.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Take away, Miggs,' said Mrs Varden, rising, 'take away, pray. I know I'm a restraint here, and as I wish everybody to enjoy themselves as they best can, I feel I had better go.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No, no, Martha,' cried the locksmith. 'Stop here. I'm sure we shall be very sorry to lose you, eh Joe!' Joe started, and said 'Certainly.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Thank you, Varden, my dear,' returned his wife; 'but I know your wishes better. Tobacco and beer, or spirits, have much greater attractions than any I can boast of, and therefore I shall go and sit upstairs and look out of window, my love. Good night, Mr Joseph. I'm very glad to have seen you, and I only wish I could have provided something more suitable to your taste. Remember me very kindly if you please to old Mr Willet, and tell him that whenever he comes here I have a crow to pluck with him. Good night!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having uttered these words with great sweetness of manner, the good lady dropped a curtsey remarkable for its condescension, and serenely withdrew.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it was for this Joe had looked forward to the twenty-fifth of March for weeks and weeks, and had gathered the flowers with so much care, and had cocked his hat, and made himself so smart! This was the end of all his bold determination, resolved upon for the hundredth time, to speak out to Dolly and tell her how he loved her! To see her for a minute\u2014for but a minute\u2014to find her going out to a party and glad to go; to be looked upon as a common pipe-smoker, beer-bibber, spirit-guzzler, and tosspot! He bade farewell to his friend the locksmith, and hastened to take horse at the Black Lion, thinking as he turned towards home, as many another Joe has thought before and since, that here was an end to all his hopes\u2014that the thing was impossible and never could be\u2014that she didn't care for him\u2014that he was wretched for life\u2014and that the only congenial prospect left him, was to go for a soldier or a sailor, and get some obliging enemy to knock his brains out as soon as possible.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/3758548", "artist_names": "Moko Lab, Blo/B (Ft.

sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice\nBut this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince\nA one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went\nBut this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off\nThe best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk\nOr the stop sign, or the shots flying\nFrom a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine\nCall me Mr. 1-800, all I got is hotlines\nThese niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline\nBiatch\n\n[Verse 24: Young Thug]\nThugger!

Monstar\nDo-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war\nSo rumble, young man, rumble\nYoung killa when he came out the jungle\nYoung dealer in the rains with the bundles\nGets no realer, get chipped when you stumble\nEat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil\nChop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought\nI never leave my life with a lawyer\nEyes wide with my head on the swivel\nChoose a side or get left in the middle\nI just treat with the sand on the beach\nWhen the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat\nRest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef\nMove

the trillest, nigga, die or adapt\nWaste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time\nPublic with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs\nSawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised\nChevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine\nAll my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea\nLooked like Joan, we burned alive\nThought that I would ball 'til I fall, then

pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature\n\n[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]\nMan, they don't wanna see a nigga\nWinning in a mothafucka, happier than a mothafucka\nYou know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka\nWhen you're a dead guy and you on that high\nSo the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka\nAnd a couple young angels hide their halo\nCause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka\nThey don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing\nIn a black tux with cufflinks\nWhen you're the reason that every single girl in the party\nWanna dance and cuff drinks\nWhen you're the reason that shit gets ran\nAnd mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan\nAnd the other niggas show up at your function\nActin' all anti-social, no, a nigga fan\nRun up on your mama puttin' money in her hand\nAnd you do that shit again and again and again\nPull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10\nAnd you really can't defend or depend on your friends\nEx girlfriend wanna key up the Benz\nWhen the Sun

Roshes, feel me?\nThis big beard cover my face\nUntil my mother gets her first crib\nMy hand's on some surf shit, my Spanish mami perfect\nFuck around and get your father's shirt lift\nDrop a thousand on some sake and some urchin\nSwing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson\nHand me the Thompson, I'll spill your clams on the carpet\nThen eat some snails with some garlic, paint the town with a harlot\nCream FILAs and Carhartt, three-wheelin out the car lot\nPut the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly\nI chip a little piece of brick into the Philly\nMy daughter's neck is chilly, my son's neck is chilly\nMy mother wrist so cut look like it got bit by a grizzly\nAnd these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira\nStill rock the slow beats with gold teeth, ain't afraid to hold heat\nControl the Jeep, that's for the slow creep\nYa fuckin' pussy smells like old meat\nIt's me\n\n[Verse 31: Heems]\nHeema the highest human, flyest cummin' in my unit\nI ?, the shorties swoonin',

you should address me as such\nSwear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand\nDestined to be like Superman for as long as you can\nWondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand\nThe worst hand is having the world without a master plan\nI feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth\nDespite sleepless nights and long flights\nAnd I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price\nIf you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright\nI spit magic, so cold and lavish\nBad broads perform sexual acts in traffic\nSo smooth, the saxophone and jazz is\nIt's horrendous what you lack and focus on what you have in the G\nMore than average, I'm nothing to test\nIf it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best\nGive it your all, now women beg me to call\nAnd unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall\nConsider this move so private I've become urban myth\nMy aim is so swift, with this I can't miss\nTop notch,

stripper named Hollywood\nIn Hollywood, glass slipper and she gave me the sloppy goooood\nSo you should tip her if you execute, young leisure suit\nLarry with no extra loot, my ex left me destitute\nSo chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you\nYou want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables\nCity of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?\nInstagram it, I forever rule,

mine said\nLove was just a game\nFind a girl and give her a whirl, then\nMove on, all the same\n\nBut I was never happy\nAlways searching for this one\nThe dream to be my lover\nAnd the dream she'd give me a son\nI've searched this whole world over\n'Bout a hundred times or more\nAlways looking for a girl I could love\nForever more\n\nDream lady, sexy Sadie, oh, I've dreamed\nAll my life of you\nDream lover, there's no other, oh girl\nYou could make all my dreams come true\n\nCHORUS\n\nDream lover, oh, where are you?\nIf I could find you I'd love you true\nDream lover you're in my mind\nOh, lord, why does love have to be so unkind?\n\nBut I found a girl with loving\nOne to share my hopes and dreams\nA friend to stand beside me\nAnd the lover of my dreams\n\nCHORUSSee The
