COMMERCIALS is probably gonna be a 2020 project. \u201cFOR.THE.DEAD.HOMIES.\u201d is the lead single for it.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite song?\nMy favorite song\u2026haha, that\u2019s a tough one. My vibe switches a lot throughout the day. But lately on SoundCloud, I\u2019ve been discovering some artists. There\u2019s an artist by the name of \u201cBOLDiiPARK\u201d with a song called \u201cHRSEPWR\u201d. Found it about a month ago while I was in Wyoming, that shit was bumpin\u2019 and I was just feeling it, had it on repeat for days. Reached out to him to work, and he was down. Another song is by \u201cICYTWAT\u201d called \u201cAINT ON SHIT\u201d. I\u2019ve been with my lil lady bangin\u2019 that shit in the whip. ICYTWAT actually produced my song \u201cU NEED\u201d. Just a lil fun fact.\nWhen did you start making music, and what drew you to it?\nMy earliest memory of me making music was when I was about 9 years old, maybe 10. I wrote a song about my uncle. Him and I were always getting into it, and I recall taking the same structure of the songs I\u2019ll hear on the radio, and I wrote a lil diss track about him. I took it serious around 13 when I released my first mixtape \u201c(2009) No Chorus: The Mixtape\u201d.\n\nMy family drew me to music...My granny will always play some oldies, some soul, reggae, old school hip-hop when I was younger. I used to dance with her a lot when she would play it and smoke her blunts. My dad used to work at Good Guys. It\u2019s basically the OG Best Buy. My pops was into home theater set-ups, and just has a good ear for audio experience. I remember when we used to ride out, he would play music in his car and I was always intrigued with the bass playing and the bangers he would choose. My pops was into hip hop, jazz, and had a lil bit of R&B in his playlists. My aunt had me heavy into R&B\u2026the B2K\u2019s, the Chris Brown\u2019s, Nelly, Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s, etc. My uncle had me into the West Coast shit. He always played the gangsta shit. So just with them, I had a nice variety of music to listen to coming up.\n\nRap stars like Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Pump, Juice WRLD, and many more all made their start on platforms like Soundcloud. Has social media changed the way music is made and distributed?\nI truly believe social media has put a hefty leverage on music distribution. Personally, five or more years ago, I probably would have compromised my independence for some sort of leverage in my career through another source. Today, I\u2019m doing everything 100% myself, collecting royalties, doing the press release, the marketing, etc. Eventually, I\u2019m going to start branching out and gathering ppl.\u2122 for a team but point being, with social media\u2026 I\u2019m able to gain insight into the business side of things quicker and easier.\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m still in favor of word of mouth. It\u2019s stronger, more direct, more likely to have a customer convert from being a potential consumer to a definite consumer, and the message sticks. I can always tweet something and ask my 10% of my strongest followers to retweet, like and share...but what\u2019s the purpose when nobody has no relation to that? It\u2019s more likely to happen if they heard your music being discussed amongst others in a social setting, and then they witness it being virtually displayed. So it\u2019s best to lay out that word of mouth foundation. Gather the organic reach, literally go outside and make people aware of it. Or at least have some evangelists doing the work for you, and then watch how social media will leverage it.\n\nAs demand for rap music increases, so does supply; it seems like everyone and their cousin has a mixtape. How do you set yourself apart in this genre?\nWhat\u2019s funny is that I was having this discussion with my boy WA$E the other day about how rap is becoming well over-saturated with rappers with different genres, everybody is trying to push a certain image or message, like you said. Everyone has mixtape, or a record label, some sort of ties in with somebody in the game to where they can be your manager, it\u2019s just an extremely over-saturated market.\n\nSo how I believe I set myself apart...Recently, I was taking a look at my analytics. I was studying how much my audience engages with every single strip of content I release from day one. I took a look at the comments, as well as the personal messages I receive. A lot of my consumers really appreciate the tone I set for myself. I believe it\u2019s within the lyricism, the brand imaging, the content I\u2019m releasing such as The PPL.\u2122 MAGAZINE. I\u2019ve received a lot of praise just from staying in my lane, and producing the greatest content I can produce. Just them acknowledging my creativity alone, is enough for me to realize that I don\u2019t have to work too hard to set myself apart within this genre. My creative and spiritual energy is powerful enough on it\u2019s own to do that.\n\nBut I\u2019m not going to settle with that. I like to seek challenges. I feel like hip-hop/rap is getting a little lazy. Honestly, I\u2019m still the type to start the whole track over if I fuck up on a verse because I like to deliver. When people listen, they hear the real. They know what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. People can listen to me and pick up on my energy, and know that I put my all into it. I have to focus on them, and let them know they are my evangelist. They\u2019re going to be the ones building up social currency for sharing things about me. So, I believe it\u2019s all about brand imaging and marketing on my end. The PPL.\u2122 is a developing brand with a strong following, and I\u2019m going to be persistent on making sure that marathon continues...RIP NIPSEY\n\nWho are your influences, musical or other?\nDamn, I have quite a few. Musically\u2026 My influences go from Eminem, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Pac, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, Nipsey Hussle, Puffy, Swizz Beats, Timbaland...and that\u2019s just rap. And speaking of such, I need to add another song to that list of my favorites: \u201cHuey Briss \u2013 Break/Bend\u201d, that shit is one of my favorites. And I can go on and on. But outside of music...Steve Jobs, Nikola Tesla, Gary Vee, Tony Stark, Walt Disney, Sam Walton, Bobby Hundreds, James Jebbia, Gianni Versace, Dan Houser, and that\u2019s all I can think of for now.\n\nYou\u2019re a cross-platform artist; we can see that in your influences. It\u2019s not just about the music, but the visuals, the branding, the overall vibe. Could you speak a little about your non-music endeavors?\nMusic is really the foundation to everything else I\u2019m initiating.\n\nSomething I noticed I\u2019m gaining a strong interest for is photography and cinematography. I have a shitload of pictures and videos of random things in my archives. Homies, sceneries, my family, consumption of drugs, sexual shit, music, food, culture, the list goes on. I tend to capture things in the perspectives of angles and motion. An aerial or bird\u2019s eye view footage of the homies gives off a certain feeling, then if you switch angles, and get the homies staring down at the camera, similar to how N.W.A did for their debut album \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d it gives a different feeling to that as well.\n\nThe PPL.\u2122 MAGAZINE is where those hobbies in photography come into play. Earlier this year, I began curating what I like to call an \u201cinteractive digital magazine.\u201d Basically it\u2019s a magazine that can be consumed digitally, with the power of interacting with the sources included within the pages. The majority of some pictures and films myself & others are included in there from different parts of the globe. I\u2019m also looking to gain some director credits on some of the homies videos, I\u2019ve been shooting some scenes and I know I got the angles and the motion on point. I can\u2019t literally hold the camera and shoot my own videos, so I\u2019d like to do that for others. I\u2019m also writing a script. It\u2019s either gonna be a short film, or a mini series. I\u2019m not sure yet. Along with the other endeavors, I\u2019ve been getting into designing fashionable calligraphy for my developing clothing brand: The PPL.\u2122 CLOTHING. Majority of these clothes will be focusing on words, and the imagery surrounded by those words, hoping to get them embroidered & patched. I\u2019ve been into designing words for as far as I can remember. I was more into that than I was designing whole figures. A lot of this costs major money, but I believe that the brand deserves to be launched on a high quality scale, since I\u2019ve developed a quality brand over the months and lil years.\nI\u2019m also looking to get into philanthropy as soon as possible. I have some economic plans I\u2019d like to initiate. Basically, I\u2019m looking to get rid of the value of the dollar. Did you know that in Australia, I believe\u2026there\u2019s a non-profit organization that\u2019s doing positively and largely impactful actions towards treating the homeless? I was reading this article sometime last year, took notes on it, and I must be forgiven ahead of time for not remembering the organization\u2019s name. This guy had somehow made a keycard, similar to a debit card, that\u2019s issued to homeless ppl.\u2122. With this keycard, you can walk up to a vending machine, slide it into a port, and choose from. fresh fruit, hand warmers, socks, gloves, water, things that can be used to alleviate the unfortunate problems the homeless have to deal with. I\u2019d take that vending machine, and literally blow it up into a whole store. Getting rid of the value of the dollar. That\u2019s my lil philanthropy proposal. Hopefully some NPO\u2019s or somebody will get at me. I\u2019ve been doing research on getting rid of the value of the dollar since I was about 18 years old.\n\nCan you explain your \u201c902 Fuck The 5-0\u201c campaign?\n\nThis campaign focuses on the unjustified shootings from police officers, unlawful arrests, the abuse of the justice system from within, the corruption of our government. This is for the countless black men and latinos that have been forced to comply with angry police officers (who not only threaten them with brutal force), just because they fit a stereotypical description of a suspect. This is for the innocent lives that have been taken by a police officer, when they weren't even part of the crime to begin with.\n\n#902fuckthe50 screams out a powerful yell towards the unlawful officers that practice corrupted acts against our neighbors. OUR neighbors. The man you see taking his walk every morning, the mail-man with his regular routes, the lady you see pushing the stroller, the homeless man that collects cans, these are our neighbors. And we need to protect each other.  It screams out a calling to our neighbors and join together and rise for a cause to push a righteous image of unity among each other. The foundation begins at home for me, in Los Angeles, 90250 area. (Incidents like this date back even further with Hawthorne Police) And this message can spread even further in any creative but truest form.\n\nWhat\u2019s your five-year plan? Where do you hope to see yourself?\nMy five-year plan\u2026Sadly, I\u2019ll be 28 five years from now lol. I don\u2019t like getting old. But, shit...I hope to be alive then. A lot of ppl.\u2122 around me have lost their time, and I\u2019m still here. It\u2019s odd. On the contrary, I hope to see myself well-established. Musically, spiritually, mentally, and financially. I look at the age 28 and possibly see myself with some kids, or at least one kid. I\u2019m trying to have children before I turn 30.\n\nBut definitely not right now. I want to have some businesses running. Hopefully more than one. I wanna ball. Like swimming in a pool full of money ballin\u2019. So, right now I\u2019m going to make a lot of sacrifices to get where I\u2019m trying to get lol. Definitely just looking to be a lot more evolved. Everyday I\u2019m looking to enhance an area of my life. \u26051Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/5751829", "artist_names": "J-Naphtali", "full_title": "Bad Boy

If it\u2019s to no \u2014 where she\u2019s going to too. Buf if he\u2019ll go to be a son to France\u2019s she\u2019ll stay daughter of Clare. Bring tansy, throw myrtle, strew rue, rue, rue. She is fading out like Journee\u2019s clothes so you can\u2019t see her now. Still we know how Day the Dyer works, in dims and deeps and dusks and darks. And among the shades that Eve\u2019s now wearing she\u2019ll meet anew fiancy, tryst and trow. Mammy was, Mimmy is, Minuscoline\u2019s to be. In the Dee dips a dame and the dame desires a demselle but the demselle dresses dolly and the dolly does a dulcydamble. The same renew. For though she\u2019s unmerried she\u2019ll after truss up and help that hussyband how to hop. Hip it and trip it and chirrub and sing.

In these days of political defeatism, sexual paranoia and heads-to-the-grindstone order, I find more than just solace in the double-humping vinyl mind travelogues of George Clinton, a man who made politics fun and set it to music with a sense of order that makes Led Zeppelin sound like Bananarama.\n\nYup, we're talking P-Funk, the musical phenomenon that began as a fusion of barbershop harmonies, rock guitar and classical piano which by the mid '70s, had developed into a marauding spacefunk roadshow so awesome that musicians from acts as prestigious as The JBs, Sly & The Family Stone, Earth Wind & Fire and The Ohio Players deserted their posts to join its revolutionary ranks.\n\nApart from developing (within black music) the precedent-shattering principles of Sly Stone and Jimi Hendrix, Clinton's Funk Mob presented themselves through a subversive alternative reality, infiltrating '70s cartoon mythology to replace white patriots with black anarchists. Funkadelia was the fusion of dancing and thinking, sex and drugs, and the Mothership was its chariot of fire, ferrying Clinton's Army through half a helter skelter decade of hit records and sell-out stadium shows.Suck My Soul! \u2013 The Early YearsOur story begins in Kannapulis, North Carolina on July 22nd 1941, with the birth of George Edward Clinton \"out in the sticks behind the pig-pen\". As World War II drew to a close, George's family moved to Washington DC, then on to Virginia, finally coming to rest in Newark, New Jersey in 1952. It was here in 1955 that the teenage George Clinton formed a vocal quintet, the Parliaments, who played local hops for two years before recording a single, 'Poor Willy', for ABC records. The single did nothing, a feat repeated by their follow-up, 'Lonely Island' on New Records.\n\nAt this time the Parliaments were all working in a barber's shop in neighbouring Plainfield, where a group of young patrons \u2013 some seven or eight years their junior \u2013 began to turn up with instruments and jam in the shop. These youngbloods \u2013 amongst them Bernie Worrell, a keyboard graduate from the Boston Conservatory of Music, and guitarist Eddie Hazell \u2013 were later to become the core of Funkadelic.\n\nIn 1960 the Parliaments signed a five year contract with Motown's New York office but, due to friction between the New York and Detroit companies, never had a record released on the label. Clinton joked that they'd had trouble turning up in matching socks, but he did get to work with Holland/Dozier/Holland ('Baby That's A Groove' by Roy Handy is credited to Clinton/Dozier/Holland), and a couple of the Parliaments' unreleased tracks were later covered by The Jackson 5 and The Supremes ('I Bet You' and 'I'm Into Something, I Can't Shake It Loose').\n\nThe Parliaments moved to Detroit to improve the situation with Motown, but by the time their contract had expired they knew they'd be better off elsewhere. Signing to Golden World, they had a minor hit with 'My Girl', but then the company was bought out by Motown, forcing the group to look for another label. LeBaron Taylor, a top executive at Golden World, had just formed a new Detroit label, Revilot, and when the label's first release ('Our Love Is In The Pocket' by Darrell Banks, co-written by Clinton) was a massive hit, Taylor signed the Parliaments. 'I Wanna Testify', the group's first Revilot release (1967), galvanized some long-awaited chart action but, though the follow-ups ('The Goose', 'All Your Goodies Are Gone' and 'Time') all sold fairly well, the label's financial status was unstable.\nRevilot went out of business, selling their masters to Atco, who released the Parliament singles without recording anything new. Faced with another year of enforced inactivity (until their contract expired), the concept of Funkadelic was born. Putting the Parliaments' musicians in the foreground, they recorded a session as Funkadelic (paid for by themselves), and got a deal with Westbound, yet another new Detroit label, who put out 'Music For My Mother' as a single.\n\nMeanwhile, Holland/Dozier/Holland had left Motown to start their own label, Invictus, to which they signed the Parliaments (whose Revilot contract had now expired), thus creating a bizarre situation which has formed the basis of P-Funk's business dealings ever since. The same ten people were now recording for two different companies in the same city but using different names \u2013 and it was all legal! \"Sure, neither company liked it much,\" George explained at the time, \"but we had been caught before in the business, so we felt it safer if we had an escape clause. Funkadelic stays with Westbound and Parliament stays with Invictus and, though they don't really like it, it keeps both companies working hard trying to do better than the other.\"Aaaah...The Name is Bootsy Baby!In Cincinnati in 1968 William 'Bootsy' Collins formed his first band, the Pacesetters \u2013 with his brother Phelps 'Catfish' Collins, Frankie 'Kash' Waddy and Phillipe Wynne \u2013 who were employed by King Records to back artists like Arthur Prysock and Hank Ballard. In 1969 King signed James Brown, who immediately sacked his backing band, and made the Pacesetters the new JBs.\n\nFor three years Bootsy, Catfish, Kash and Wynne lived and toured as the JBs, playing on classic hits like 'Sex Machine' (Bootsy was only 16 at the time), but in '71, tired of \"The Godfather\"'s dictatorial style, they quit and returned to Cincinnati to form the sartorially garish House Guests. The Spinners approached the House Guests, wanting Wynne to become their lead singer, and the others to be their backing band, but only Wynne accepted, and so the House Guests continued along parallel lines to Clinton's Funkadelic.\n\nFunkadelic had released three albums on Westbound \u2013 Funkadelic, Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow and Maggot Brain \u2013 when the inevitable collaboration with the House Guests took place. The results appeared on Funkadelic's 1972 double album America Eats Its Young, with the single 'Philmore' credited to W Collins. P-Funk was born, and from then onwards it was up, up and away.Let's Do The Cosmic Slop!Though it often appeared excessive to the point of overkill, and spawned countless satellite projects, the P-Funk concept was brilliantly simple. Clinton gathered around him an unlimited pool of the best musicians he could find, and signed none of them to a record label. Instead what the labels signed were group names, which meant that P-Funk could pursue as many musical projects as they could think up names for, release as many albums as they could record, and no player would be contractually bound if something went wrong. To top it all, the labels involved (each secretly convinced that Clinton favoured the others) were competing against each other to sell fundamentally the same act.\n\nAlthough at one point Bootsy's Rubber Band became the most commercial wing of Uncle Jam's Army, the main strands of P-Funk were always Parliament and Funkadelic, two distinctly different outfits whose live performances demanded a kind of musical schizophrenia from the players involved. Parliament were the more disciplined, traditionally soulful party, with a blazing horn section, razor sharp gospel harmonizing and an arsenal of spaced-out comic heroes and villains. Funkadelic were the rockier, weirder, more political outlet, with a pair of social X-ray glasses and a raw, intuitive musical feel that Clinton likened to gospel.\n\nOld-fashioned as this may sound, the magic of P-Funk \u2013 behind all the anarchic business scams, the fantastic linguistic swordsmanship and the spaceships \u2013 lay in its musicianship. The concepts and spectacular visual antics of P-Funk took priority over individual egos or rockstar personality-building, but the Mothership contained some of the finest musicians ever to grace a stage. Just look at the core players!\n\nBernie Worrell and Junie Morrison were left-field keyboard wizards, and Eddie Hazell, Mike Hampton and Blackbyrd McKnight were hyper-expressive guitarists who could effortlessly hold their own against the likes of Jimmy Page or Angus Young. Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker and Rick Gardner were the horn section to have (Maceo is the only musician James Brown has ever had the humility to ask back), and no bassist has ever touched what Bootsy was capable of.\n\nAs for the singers, what a goldmine! From the mike-wrecking superbass of Ray Davis to the female Sly Stone/EW&F defectors, via soaring midrangers like the late Glen Goins and Gary Shider, these were major talents. The Rubber Band sprung to the bass/nasal harmonies of Mudbone and P-Nut, and Clinton himself was no vocal slouch, alternating between radio jockular rap and a weirdly emotional falsetto ('We're All Gonna Make It This Time' from America Eats... still gets my tearducts going).\n\nClinton enjoyed the services of these and many other musical giants \u2013 spanning every black musical style from church to Jimi Hendrix \u2013 cementing the whole conglomeration with a psychedelic sense of freedom and adventure. Whilst James Brown fined musicians for playing a note wrong, Clinton didn't rehearse them at all. After witnessing a P-Funk All Stars show in Germany in 1985, a stunned German TV presenter asked George how he could possibly organize a 27-piece band: \"The secret is to get cats who can really play. Then you just have to offer them the possibility of chaos and order on the same plate, and they'll go for it every time.\"\n\nAnyone who has seen the James Brown Show on a good night knows that JB is the pressure-cooking heart of funk, but what he does has never strayed outside the relatively narrow parameters of his unique musical blueprint. Clinton declared that \"nothing is good unless you play with it,\" and set about destroying the soulman superpimp stereotypes, taking funk over the hump to a place where fried ice cream was a reality. If JB was the arrogant King, George was the humanitarian, irreverent Jester, with more fantasy in his little finger than most of his contemporaries put together.\n\nPart of the credit for P-Funk's development must go to two label bosses: Armen Boladian at Westbound, who \u2013 in stark contrast to Berry Gordy's vision of polished, production-line soul \u2013 gave Funkadelic carte blanche (and money) to record whatever they wanted, and Neil Bogart at Casablanca, who backed Parliament all the way (before his death he was planning a full-length feature film of 'The Motor Booty Affair'). With friends like these, Clinton forged a rock'n'soul mind-trip of orchestral proportions, and pumped it out with 30,000 watts of P-Funk power. Funk was never the same again.Think! It Ain't Illegal Yet!The imaginative density of the images, slogans, puns and perceptions that flew from Clinton's freewheeling mind, combined with his prolific output \u2013 Parliament, Funkadelic, Bootsy and George Clinton alone released 32 action-packed studio albums-make it futile even to begin a serious study of P-Funk language and themes in this space. But if you're a P-Funk beginner, take it from me, every record's a lyrical treasure trove. I'll leave the joys of delving and discovering to you.\n\nSongs like 'If You Don't Like The Effects, Don't Produce The Cause', 'Chocolate City', 'The Electric Spanking Of War Babies', 'You Shouldn't Nuf-Bit Fish' and 'R&B Skeletons (In The Closet)' display Clinton's ongoing sociopolitical analyses, but it was George's myriad fictitious alter-egos that really fired the public's imagination. With Dr Funkenstein, Starchild, Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk, Mr Wiggles, Lollipop Man and all the rest, George was putting the black man where white folks least expected to find him, in the White House, as an astronaut, a blond hippy, an army commander, a scientist and even as the Jacques Cousteau of funk.\n\nGeorge's image of Washington DC as \"a chocolate city with vanilla suburbs\" is the most poignant description I've ever heard of the American capital (after 6 pm). I knew, when I visited the city three years ago, that Trouble Funk's 'Drop The Bomb' was a reference to Clinton's uncut funk (as opposed to nuclear war), but still the imprint P-Funk mythology had left on the local music scene stunned me. The Long-haired Sucker's slogans were everywhere.\nAfter interviewing a band whose drummer answered to the name of Sir Nose, I went to see EU at a club where the DJ booth was wallpapered from floor to ceiling with tiny, colourful scraps of P-Funk memorabilia. The group's frontman introduced himself with the words: \"The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill. Sugarbear is the real deal,\" and the audience and group (who later played 'Cosmic Slop') launched into a communal chant of \"If you ain't gonna get it on, take your dead ass home!\" And that was par for the DC course.Some People Say Is There Funk After Death? I Say Is 7 Up?P-Funk's current circle of influence stretches way beyond go go and mainstream funk, to include Philly rap, West Coast electro, Detroit house and white acts like Was (Not was) and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. If this seems surprising, remember that, along with its innovatory, wigged-out appeal, P-Funk was a massive commercial force in the '70s, and will be familiar to anyone who was into dance music at the time.\n\nThough Funkadelic expected to make the bigtime with 'Cosmic Slop' and 'Standing On The Verge Of Getting It On', it wasn't until the internationally-distributed Parliament album Chocolate City (1975) that the Funk Mob's profile rose significantly. But after the release of Mothership Connection later that year, and the spectacular accompanying P-Funk Earth Tour, every Funkadelic, Parliament and Bootsy album went to number one in the international soul charts. Warner Brothers along netted a $30 million profit from Funkadelic, Bootsy and the Brides Of Funkenstein, and by the end of the decade Clinton had his own label Uncle Jam Records, distributed by CBS.\n\nWhilst certain acts had pursued spacefunk themes in tandem with P-Funk \u2013 Masterfleet, War and, most notably, Norman Whitfield's Undisputed Truth \u2013 a generation of younger bands like Raydio, Rick James and the Gap Band, began to thieve their sound lock, stock and barrel. Captain Sky cloned Clinton so thoroughly he should've been paying him royalties and, though Larry Blackmon rarely mentions P-Funk these days, Cameo learnt the tricks of their trade (Lazzer's attention-grabbing codpiece is a direct descendant of Gary Shider's nappy) as first support band on the Flashlight Tour \u2013 which, due to the release of One Nation Under A Groove (Funkadelic's biggest hit ever) halfway through, went on for a year and a half.\n\nSo where did it all come unstuck? What was it that grounded the Mothership? Firstly there was the chaos induced by their phenomenal success. While George's attention had been tied up with his hyperactive recording and touring schedule since '75, certain legal and management associates had been writing themselves enormous cheques from his funds. $900,000 advances would dwindle to $30,000 cash, and sometimes the entourage would complete nationwide tours \u2013 during which they headlined at 60,000 capacity stadium shows \u2013 with just enough money to get home, leaving unpaid tax bills in umpteen states.\n\nSecondly, just after Clinton had cleaned the rotten apples from his organization, he was disastrously stitched-up by Roger Troutman, leader of P-Funk prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Zapp. After the success of the Bootsy-produced Zapp LP, Roger agreed to record a solo album for Uncle Jam, but when it was finished he took the masters and finished artwork (all paid for by CBS) to Warner Brothers, who signed him to a separate solo deal. The Many Facets Of Roger went on to sell over 800,000 copies and spawn the hit single 'I Heard It Through The Grapevine', and CBS were so furious with George (who they wrongly assumed to have been in on the scam) that they canceled Uncle Jam's distribution deal and refused to back his legal action against Warner Brothers.\n\nNow, after just two album releases (The Sweat Band and Wynnejammer by Phillipe Wynne), George's long dreamt-of label was dead, and he had to take his own record company to court. Warner Bros lost the legal action, but it took two years, cost Clinton $2 million, and meant the end of Warner's contracts with Funkadelic, the Brides and Bootsy. Meanwhile, Capitol had delayed the signing of George's solo deal by a year, and Casablanca president Neil Bogard had died, leaving the 'Motor Booty Affair' film unmade and his label to be incorporated into Phonogram, effectively stiffing Parliament.\n\nComputer Games, Clinton's debut LP for Capitol, found him in top form, and yielded the commercial hits 'Loopzilla' and 'Atomic Dog', but after a structural shakedown of the company, he found himself once again signed to an unsympathetic label. In 1984 CBS released a P-Funk All Stars compilation, Urban Dancefloor Guerillas, but by now the Mothership's momentum had fizzled out.\n\nIn 1985 Capitol released the superb Jimmy G & The Tackheads LP (Jimmy being Clinton's brother), failed to promote it and then dropped the group just before LA radio discovered the album. It seemed that no matter how good the records were, or how popular the live shows, P-Funk was doomed never to revive its former glory. The following year Clinton delivered a barnstorming single, 'Do Fries Go With That Shake?', accompanied by a video which illustrated the perfect compatibility of his cartoon sensibility with the promo-clip medium. Again Capitol failed utterly to capitalise on the record's potential, and the two parties parted company by mutual agreement.One Nation On The Move Again! Can Nothing Stop Them Now?Though the individual P-Funkateers have been making a passable living these past years, their collective output has wielded little influence and aroused little media fever. But, on the quiet, P-Funk has been bringing in fresh blood, and sprouting new fighting units like the Hardcore Jollies, the Electric War Babies and the P-Funk Jazz Quintet. Sneak previews of unreleased Bootsy tracks, the forthcoming Tackheads LP and snippets of about 20 albums' worth (I kid you not!) of George's work-in-progress prove that their artistic well is far from dry (since Nubian Nut George has become a murderous rapper). Now at last some of these recordings are to come to light, in a barrage of P-Funk vinyl action as intense as it was a decade ago.\n\nAny day now we'll see the dynamite new albums from Bootsy (on CBS) and the Tackheads \u2013 now, minus Jimmy G, renamed the Incorporated Thang Band \u2013 (on WEA). MCA have signed Funkadelic, The P-Funk All Stars and the Brides (to be renamed), George's son Tracey is being signed to WEA (as Tray-Lewd) and, best of all, George himself has been signed to Paisley Park (who may later take up an option on Parliament). With Prince, one of the only heirs to the P-Funk spirit, at the helm, George may at last have found a label that understands and deserves him.\n\nAll that remains to be seen is how Joe Public will react to the returning Mothership. But, the new Funk Mob's commercial impact aside, one thing's for sure: the Good Doctor's back, proposing another toast to the boogie. I'll funk to that!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1261197", "artist_names": "Carla Thomas", "full_title": "Pick Up the Pieces by\u00a0Carla\u00a0Thomas",

transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him.

Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape.

(He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening.

Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.)

You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer.

The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs.

His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear!

It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished.

Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.)

Lamentations.)\n\nTHE CITIZEN Thank heaven!\n\nBLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\n\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)\n\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us.

Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.\n\n(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)\n\nTHE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!\n\nELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\n\nZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\n\nFLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.\n\nSTEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.\n\n(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)\n\nTHE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!\n\nBLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!\n\nBELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.\n\nBELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.\n\nLYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.\n\nZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

Hillyho!\n\n(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)\n\nSIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!\n\n(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)\n\nTHE CROWD\n\nCard of the races.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.)

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom.

Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.\n\n\nZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!\n\n\nFLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look!

Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on!

After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C.

At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1618370", "artist_names": "Jackie Wilson", "full_title": "Since You Showed Me

All the same we must risk making one this afternoon since we are going to discuss modern tendencies. Directly we speak of tendencies or movements we commit to, the belief that there is some force, in\ufb02uence, outer pressure that is strong enough to stamp itself upon a whole group of different writers so that all their writing has a certain common likeness.\n\n\u2014Virginia Woolf, \u201cThe Leaning Tower,\u201d lecture delivered to the Workers\u2019 Educational Association, Brighton (May 1940)CONTEXTS AND INTELLECTUAL HISTORY 322\nINSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY:\nCAI BEGINNINGS 324\nCOGNITIVE SCIENCE AND AI RESEARCH 325\nKINDS OF DIGITAL MEDIA LEARNING 327\nPIONEERING LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 346\nCHALLENGING QUESTIONS 351\nCONCLUSION 356\nREFERENCES 358\nWith full acknowledgement of the warning from the 1940 lecture by Virginia Woolf, this chapter begins by presenting a theory of mind, knowing only too well, that \u201ca whole group of different\u201d learning theorists cannot \ufb01nd adequate coverage under one umbrella. Nor should they. However, there is a movement occurring, a form of social activism created by the affordances of social media, an infrastructure that was built incrementally during two to three decades of hard scholarly research that brought us to this historic time and place. To honor the convergence of theories and technologies, this paper revisits the Points of Viewing Theory to provide researchers, teachers, and the public with an opportunity to discuss and perhaps change the epistemology of education from its formal structures to more Do-It-Yourself (DIY) learning environments that dig deeper and better into content knowledge. As the saying goes, we live in interesting times. Let\u2019s not make this saying a curse. Let\u2019s \u201cdeschool\u201d society as Ivan Illich suggested in 1971 and design more equitable systems of learning across mediated platforms.\n\nThe Points of Viewing Theory (POV-T) is the foundation on which this chapter on computers, the Internet, social media, embodied cognition, and interactive digital media learning environments, including games for learning, is constructed. According to this theory developed by Ricki Goldman (formerly Ricki Goldman-LSegall) learners actively layer their viewpoints and their interpretations to elicit patterns, themes, and groupings of ideas that lead to a deep understanding of the content under investigation and to reach agreements\u2014if only partial (Goldman, 2007; Goldman-Segall, 1996a, 1998a). POV-T is not limited to making meaning with from a solitary standpoint. Indeed, the purpose of applying POV-T is to enable learners to learn from one another by seeing each other\u2019s viewpoints through perspective-taking as well as to be able to see their own changing perspectives on a subject in diverse contexts and settings. As Rowland points out: \u201cWe come to know through interpretation, dialog, and negotiation of meaning with...others, through a conversation with manipulation of the materials of a situation\u201d (Rowland, 2004, p. 43).\n\nThe theory, \ufb01rst developed by Goldman in the 1990s, also strengthens content knowledge by layering the ideas of participants and stakeholders in a shared learning environment using a range of methods, tools, and \u201cdocuments.\u201d POV-T also provides a framework for \ufb01nding underlying patterns that lead to agreements. Tools that make evident this theory are called perspectivity technologies because they provide a platform for multiloguing (Goldman-Segall, 1994), a place and space for building cultures or communities of practice where one \u201ccatches sight\u201d of the other while participating in learning. Given the problematics of living in a complex global society facing enormous cultural, social, environmental, and economic differences of opinion, this theory is critical for communicating with each other and reaching what Ivan Illich calls conviviality (1973), Clifford Geertz calls commensurability (1973), and Goldman-Segall (1995) calls con\ufb01gurational validity\u2014a form of thick communication, which emerges from using media tools to layer views and perspectives into agreements.\n\nPOV-T incorporates how each person at different times and contexts will understand the same content whether it is a process, event, document in any media, or action \u201cwith new eyes.\u201d Research on what Black (2010) calls the embodied/grounded cognitive perspective takes advantage not only of our visual perceptual systems for learning, but also our entire full body perceptual systems. Recent brain scanning research has shown that many cognitive tasks that were thought to be purely symbolic actually involved a multisensory perceptual simulation. The best preparation for such task requires a fully embodied learning experience. The use of computer game-like learning environments (such as the Wii and Kinect) will continue to open the doors for exploration into how the social mind makes sense of experiences. Moreover, given the rise of social media and games for learning, as well as the recent \ufb01ndings on the plasticity of mental interpretations, the brain\u2019s capacity for mental mirroring, and the intimate relationship between emotion and social intelligence that shows how minds can be recon\ufb01gured with changes to embodied experiences, the Points of Viewing Theory, a foundational theory of minds presented in this chapter, is the one that can move forward our understanding of learning with computers from the advent of early instructionist approaches to more recent constructionist and socioconstructionist applications.\n\nIn this chapter, the authors explore a range of concepts and tools that have been designed for learning. The authors expect that readers will create new con\ufb01gurations as they read the text. Indeed, that is the idea behind the theory\u2014to learn from both a layering of each other\u2019s ideas as well as from the diverse perspectives each of us, as solitary readers (if there is such a thing) can make meaning of different contexts to build knowledge, together.\n\nCONTEXTS AND INTELLECTUAL HISTORY\n\nWe start by unfolding how the Points of Viewing Theory provides us with a lens from which to better connect the writings of past and present leading theorists. We do this to tease out some of the sticky webs that confuse policy makers and academicians, as well as to envision future directions. The underlying theme running through this chapter is that many routes combining a vast array of perspectives are needed to shape an educationally sound approach to learning and teaching with digital media technologies. There is no one \ufb01x, no one solution. Rather, there must be an openness to appreciate diversity and a layering of points of viewing.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the age-old debate between empiricism and idealism shifted: science could be used to not only observe the external world with microscopes and telescopes, but also to change, condition, and control behavior. Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov experimented with dogs, calling his theory conditioning. Dogs \u201clearned\u201d to salivate to the sound of a bell that had previously accompanied their eating, even without receiving the food. Pavlov\u2019s theory of conditioning played a central role in inspiring John B. Watson, who is often cited as the founder of behaviorist psychology. In 1913, Watson, while continuing to work with animals, applied Pavlov\u2019s theories to children, believing that people act according to the stimulation of their nervous system and can just as easily as dogs be conditioned to learn. A turbulent personal turn of events\u2014leading to his dismissal from Johns Hopkins University\u2014extended Watson\u2019s behaviorist approach into the domain of marketing. He landed a prime job as vice-president of J. Walter Thompson, one of the largest U.S. advertising companies, and helped change the course of advertising forever (Daniels, 2000). As media, education, and business enter a convergent course in this 21st century with new tools for learning and the new knowledge industry, behaviorist theories remain a strong and silent partner y.\n\nA leading proponent of behaviorism, Edward Thorndike, with his 1899 article on \u201cAnimal Intelligence\u201d and subsequent book Educational Psychology in 1903, is often called the founder of the \ufb01eld of educational psychology. His educational psychology book made recommendations for teaching students, based on his research on animals (the Law of Effect and the Law of Exercise that establish connections between stimuli and responses). (He conducted studies with students, and not only animals, using this same basic framework.) The leading behaviorist in the educational domain, Burrhus Frederic (B.F.) Skinner, contributed the idea of operant conditioning\u2014how positive and negative reinforcement (reward and punishment) can be used as stimuli to shape how humans respond. With this variation, the theory of behavior modi\ufb01cation was born. All human actions are seen to be shaped (caused) by the stimulus of the external world on the body. In short, there is no reasoning mind creating reality, merely a hard-wired system that responds to what it experiences from external sources. Infamous for designing the glass \u201cAir Crib,\u201d which his daughter\u2014observed, measured, and \u201ctaught\u201d how to behave\u2014spent time living in, Skinner not only practiced what he preached, but also led the way for even more elaborate experiments to prove how educators could shape, reinforce, and manipulate humans through repeated drills. Much of this early work resurfaced in electronic learning systems today.\n\nWhat was salient in the behaviorist approach was that the proponents addressed the role of external stimuli\u2014that our bodies send messages to the brain that can be interpreted. What was missed was selectivity of the brain in interpreting how perceptions affect not only behavior, but create new perspectives layered on both internal predispositions and previously acquired interpreted experiences. In this chapter we propose that interactions among genetics, experience, and ongoing perceptual reactions along with what is felt in the whole body and interpreted in the mind are paramount to learning.\n\nIn short, even with the advent of new man-machine studies in the post\u2013World War II period, the role of perspectivity has been missing as a key part of the interpretive executive functioning of the brain Nevertheless, with the advent of the computer, intrepid behavioral scientists persisted in designing and using drill-and-practice methods to improve memorization tasks (e.g., Suppes, 1966). They turned to an examination of the role and ef\ufb01cacy of computers and technology in education, a subject understood in a behaviorist research agenda that valued measurable results and formal experimental methods, as Koschmann (1996, pp. 5\u20136) notes in his critique of the period. Accordingly, proponents of Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s asked how the computer (an external stimulus) affects (modi\ufb01es) the individual (a hard-wired learning system). Their research questions focused on how the process of learning could be improved by using the computer.\n\nWe see these classic debates between empiricism and idealism as being connected with bifurcation and a dualistic world view. It was not possible at the time to understand how the working of the brain, a network of perceptions, could be connected with perspectives, the interpretations that people as individuals and as a society, make. In short, an embodied notion of how learning is not internally nor externally \u201clocated.\u201d A holistic view of the world did not seem possible then, and for many scholars today, unfortunately, it still is an enigma.\n\nAn alternative approach to CAI is rooted in studying the individual mind and conducting experiments on how the mind works. The mind as a site of research (and not just idealization or speculation) has its modern roots in the work of Jean Piaget (b. 1896), a natural scientist trained in zoology but most renowned for his work as a developmental psychologist and epistemologist. After becoming disillusioned with standardized testing methodology at the Sorbonne in France, Piaget returned to Geneva in 1921 to dedicate the rest of his academic life to studying the child\u2019s conception of time (Piaget, 1969), space (Piaget & Inhelder, 1956), number (Piaget 1952) and the world (Piaget, 1930). Although the idea that children could do things at one age that they could not do at another was not new, it was Piaget who was able to lay out a blueprint for children\u2019s conceptual development at different stages of their lives. For example, the classic theory of conservation eludes the young child: a tall glass contains more water than a short one even if the young child pours the same water from one glass into the other. Until Piaget, no one had conducted a body of experiments asking children to think about these phenomena and then mapped the diverse views that children use to solve problems into categories. By closely observing, recording his observations, and applying these to an emerging developmental theory of mind, Piaget and his team of researchers in Geneva developed the famous hierarchy of thinking stages: sensori-motor, preoperational, concrete, and formal. Piaget did not limit all thinking into these four rigid categories but rather used them as a way to deepen discussion on how children learn.\nWhat is fundamentally different in Piaget\u2019s conception of mind is that unlike the behaviorist view that the external world affects the individual\u2014a uni-directional approach with no input from the individual\u2014the process of constructivist learning occurs in the mind of the child encountering, exploring, and theorizing about the world as the world is encountered as it moved through preset stages of life. The child\u2019s mind assimilates new events into existing cognitive structures and the cognitive structures accommodate the new event, changing the existing structures in a continually interactive process. Schema are formed as the child assimilates new events and moves from a state of disequilibrium to equilibrium, a state only to be put back into disequilibrium every time the child meets new experiences that cannot \ufb01t the existing schema. Beers (2001) has called the assimilation/accommodation process a dialectical inter-action among person, objects of creation (artifacts), and the curricular world in which the artifacts are created.\n\nHowever, Piaget also believed that learning is a spontaneous, individual cognitive process, distinct from the sort of socialized and nonspontaneous instruction one might \ufb01nd in formal education, and that these two are in a somewhat antagonistic relationship. Critiquing Piaget\u2019s constructivism, the great Soviet psychologist L. S. Vygotsky wrote: We believe that the two processes\u2014the development of spontaneous and of nonspontaneous concepts\u2014are related and constantly in\ufb02uence each other. They are parts of a single process: the development of concept formation, which is affected by varying external and internal conditions but is essentially a unitary process, not a con\ufb02ict of antagonistic, mutually exclusive forms of mentation. (Vygotsky, 1962, p. 85)Vygotsky heralded a departure from individual mind to social mind, and, as under his in\ufb02uence, educational theorizing moved away from its individual-focused origins and toward more socially or culturally situated perspectives. The paradigmatic approaches of key theorists in learning technology re\ufb02ect this change as contributions from anthropology and social psychology gained momentum throughout the social sciences. The works of Vygotsky and the Soviet cultural-historical school (notably A. R. Luria and A. N. Leontiev), when translated into English, began to have a major in\ufb02uence, especially through the interpretations and stewardship of educational psychologists like Sylvia Scribner, Jerome Bruner, and Michael Cole (Bruner, 1990; Cole & Engestrom, 1993; Cole & Wertsch, \u00a81996; Scribner & Cole, 1981). Vygotsky focused on the role of social context and mediating tools (language, writing, etc.) in the development of the individual, and argued that one cannot study the mind of a child without examining the \u201csocial milieu, both institutional and interpersonal\u201d in which she \ufb01nds herself (Katz & Lesgold, 1993). Vygotsky\u2019s in\ufb02uence, along with that of pragmatist philosopher John Dewey\u2019s seminal Democracy in Education (1916), opened up the study of technology in learning beyond individual cognition, thereby revealing its role in fostering social interaction and the betterment of a diverse, interconnected society. The ground in the last decade of the 20th century thus became fertile for a growing range of new media and computational environments for learning, teaching, and research based on new advances in brainbased cognitive science coupled with a socially mediated and distributed approach to the acqusition of knowledge (Pea & Bransford et al., 2000). This critical dichotomy between postpositivism and interpretivism would provide the philosophical inspiration for learning sciences research on technology in the \ufb01rst decade of the 21st century. But the path to social constructionism at the end of the 20th century \ufb01rst took a circuitous route through computeraided instruction.\n\nINSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY:\nCAI BEGINNINGS\n\nAn examination of the theoretical roots of computers in education exposes its behaviorist beginnings: The computer could reinforce activities that would bring about more ef\ufb01cient learning. For some, this meant \u201ccheaper,\u201d for others, \u201cfaster,\u201d and for yet others, it meant without needing a teacher (see Bromley, 1998, for a discussion). The oldest such tradition of computing in education is Computer-Aided Instruction, or CAI. This approach dates back to the early 1960s, notably in two research projects, at Stanford under Patrick Suppes (1966), and the PLATO project at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under Donald Bitzer and Dan Alpert (1970). Both projects utilized the then-new \u201ctime-sharing\u201d computer systems to create learning opportunities for individual students. The potential existed for a time-sharing system to serve hundreds or even thousands of students simultaneously, and this economy of scale was one of the main drivers of early CAI research. A learner could sit at a terminal and engage in a textual dialogue with the computer system: question and answer. As such, CAI can be situated mostly within the behavioral paradigm (Koschmann, 1996, p. 6), though its research is also informed by cognitive science (e.g., Suppes applied new cognitive learning and memory theories to guide the interactions with students).\n\nThe Stanford CAI project explored elementary school mathematics and science education, and the researchers worked with local schools to produce a formidable amount of research data (Suppes, Jerman, & Brian, 1968; Suppes & Morningstar, 1972). Suppes began with tutorial instruction as the key model, and saw that the computer could provide individualized tutoring on a far greater scale than was economically possible before. Suppes envisioned computer tutoring on three levels: the simplest is drill-and-practice work, in which the computer administers a question-and-answer session with the student, judging responses correct or incorrect, and keeping track of data from the sessions. The second level was a more direct instructional approach: The computer would give information to the student, and then quiz the student on the information, possibly allowing for different constructions or expressions of the same information. In this sense, the computer acts much like a textbook. The third level was to be more sophisticated dialogic systems, in which a more traditional tutor-tutee relationship could be emulated (Suppes, 1966). Clearly, the simple drill-and practice model is the easiest to actually implement, and as such the bulk of the early Stanford research uses this model, especially in the context of elementary school arithmetic (Suppes et al., 1968).\n\nThe research results from the Stanford experiments are not surprising: students do tend to improve over time with practice. For the time (the 1960s), however, to be able to automate the process was a signi\ufb01cant achievement. More interesting from our perspective are the re\ufb02ections Suppes offers, regarding the design of the human-computer interface: How and when should feedback be given? How can the system be tailored to different cognitive styles? How best to leverage the unprecedented amount of quantitative data the system collected about each student\u2019s performance and progress? (Suppes, 1966). These questions still form the cornerstone of much educational technology research.\n\nThe PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations) project at UIUC had a somewhat different focus (Alpert & Bitzer, 1970). Over several incarnations of the PLATO system through the 1960s, Bitzer, Alpert, and their team worked at the problems of integrating CAI into university teaching on a large scale, as indeed it began to be from the late 1960s. The task of taking what was then enormously expensive equipment and systems and making it economically viable in order to have individualized tutoring for students drove the development of the systems, and led PLATO to a long career in CAI\u2014in fact, the direct descendants of the original PLATO system are still being used and developed. The PLATO project introduced some of the \ufb01rst instances of computer-based manipulables, student-to-student conferencing, and computer-based \u201cdistance\u201d education (Woolley, 1994).\n\nFrom these beginnings, CAI and the models it provides for educational technology are now the oldest tradition in educational computing. While only partly integrated in the school system, CAI is widely used in corporate training environments, in remedial programs, and has had something of a resurgence with the advent of the World Wide Web as online training has become popular. It is worth noting that the company Suppes started with Richard Atkinson at Stanford in 1967, Computer Curriculum Corporation, and NovaNet, a PLATO descendant spun off from UIUC in 1993 were both recently acquired by Pearson Education, the world\u2019s largest educational publisher (Pearson Education, 2000).COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND AI RESEARCH\nIn order to historically situate the development of learning technology, it is also important to appreciate the impact of the \u201ccognitive revolution\u201d (Gardner, 1985) on both education and technology.\n\nFor our purposes, the contribution of cognitive science is twofold. First, the advent of the digital computer in the 1940s led quickly to research on arti\ufb01cial intelligence(AI). By the 1950s, AI was already a substantial research program at universities like Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. And while AI research has not yet\u2014nor, we believe, is likely to\u2014produced an arti\ufb01cial mind, the legacy of AI research has had an enormous in\ufb02uence on our presentday computing paradigms, from information management to feedback and control systems and from personal computing to the notion of programming languages. All derive in large part from a full half-century of research in AI.\n\nSecond, cognitive science\u2014speci\ufb01cally the contributions of Piagetian developmental psychology and AI research\u2014gave the world the \ufb01rst practical models of mind, thinking, and learning. Prior to the cognitive revolution, our understanding of thinking was oriented either psychoanalytically or philosophically, out of the Western traditions of metaphysics and epistemology, or empirically, via behaviorism. In the latter case, as mentioned earlier, cognition was regarded as a black box between stimulus and response. Since no empirical study of the contents of this box was possible, speculation as to what went on inside was both discouraged and ignored. Cognitive science, especially by way of AI research, opened the box. For the \ufb01rst time, researchers could work from a model of mind and mental processes. In 1957, AI pioneer Herbert Simon went so far as to predict that AI would soon provide the substantive model for psychological theory, in the same way that Newton\u2019s calculus had once done for physics (Turkle, 1984, p. 244). Despite the subsequent humbling of AI\u2019s early enthusiasm, the effect this thinking has had on research in psychology and education and even the popular imagination (consider the commonplace notion of one\u2019s \u201cshort term memory\u201d) is vast.\n\nThe most signi\ufb01cant thread or thrust of early AI research was Allen Newell and Herbert Simon\u2019s \u201cinformation processing\u201d model at Carnegie-Mellon University. This research sought to develop a generalized problem solving mechanism, based on the idea that problems in the world could be represented as internal states in a machine and operated on algorithmically. Newell and Simon saw the mind as a \u201cphysical symbol system\u201d or \u201cinformation processing system\u201d (Simon, 1981 [1969], p. 27), and believed that such a system is the \u201cnecessary and suf\ufb01cient means\u201d for intelligence (p. 28). One of the venerable traditions of this model is the chess-playing computer, long bandied as exemplary of intelligence. Ironically, world chess master Gary Kasparov\u2019s historic defeat to IBM\u2019s \u201cDeep Blue\u201d supercomputer in 1997 had far less rhetorical punch than AI critic (and chess novice) Hubert Dreyfus\u2019 defeat in 1965, but the legacy of the information processing approach cannot be underestimated.\n\nYet it would be unfair to equate all of classical AI research with Newell and Simon\u2019s approach. Signi\ufb01cantly, research programs at Stanford and MIT, though perhaps lower pro\ufb01le, made signi\ufb01cant contributions to the \ufb01eld. Two threads in particular are worthy of comment here. One was the development of \u201cexpert systems,\u201d concerned with the problem of knowledge representation\u2014 for example Edward Feigenbaum\u2019s DENDRAL, a system that contained large amounts of domain-speci\ufb01c information in biology. Another was Terry Winograd\u2019s 1970 program, SHRDLU, which \ufb01rst tackled the issue of indexicality and reference in an arti\ufb01cial microworld (Gardner,1985). As Gardner points out, these developments demonstrated that Newell and Simon\u2019s \u201cgeneralized\u201d problem-solving approach would give way to more situated, domain speci\ufb01c approaches.\nThe culmination of this approach results in the Cognitive Tutors out of Carnegie Mellon University. These are both a successful product widely used in schools  www.carnegielearning.com) and an active ongoing research project (coordinated through the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center: www.learnlab.org). The Cognitive Tutors apply John Anderson\u2019s ACTR (Anderson, 1993) cognitive architecture (which is descended from Newell and Simon\u2019s) to represent the knowledge to be taught (mostly If-Then production rules) then this knowledge is represented in the tutor so that it can understand what the student is doing when solving problems and provide \u201cintelligence\u201d feedback (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 1995). These tutors show impressive results in tests compared to classroom instruction and when compared to traditional CAI (like the Suppes kind): they do around one effect size (one standard deviation) better than classroom instruction\u2014tradition CAI does 0.3 effect size better than classroom instruction so the Cognitive Tutors are 3 times as effective as traditional CAI (J. Kulik & C. Kulik, 1991). However, these Cognitive Tutors are effective at teaching how to solve problems in areas like high school algebra and geometry; there is some question remaining whether they can also teach an understanding of why these solution methods work.\n\nAt MIT in the 1980s, Marvin Minsky\u2019s work led to a theory of the \u201csociety of minds\u201d\u2014that, rather than intelligence being constituted in a straightforward representational and algorithmic way, intelligence is seen as the emergent property of a complex of subsystems working independently (Minsky, 1986). The notion of emergent AI, more recently explored through massively parallel computers, has with the availability of greater computing power in the 1980s and 1990s become the mainstream of AI research (Turkle, 1995, pp. 126\u2013127). Interestingly, Gardner (1985) points out that the majority of computing\u2014and therefore AI\u2014 research has been located within the paradigm de\ufb01ned by Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and George Boole in the 19th century. Babbage and Lovelace are commonly credited with the basic idea\nof the programmable computer; Lady Ada Agusta, Countess of Lovelace (also known as Ada Lovelace), in famous quote in Note 6 of her translation of the 1842 paper by L. F. Menabrea\u2014written more than 170 years ago, called Sketch of the Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage, neatly sums it up:The analytical engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.George Boole\u2019s contribution was the notion that a system of binary states (0 and 1) could suf\ufb01ce for the representation and transformation of logical propositions. But computing research began to \ufb01nd and transcend the limits of this approach. The rise of emergent AI was characterized as \u201cwaking up from the Boolean dream\u201d (Douglas Hofstadter, quoted in Turkle, p., 135). In this model, intelligence is seen as a property emergent from, or at least observable in, systems of suf\ufb01cient complexity. Intelligence is thus not de\ufb01ned by programmed rules, but by adaptive behavior within an environment.\n\nFrom internal representation to situated action. The idea of taking contextual factors seriously became important outside of pure AI research as well. A notable example was the reception given to Joseph Weizenbaum\u2019s famous program, ELIZA. When it \ufb01rst appeared in 1966, ELIZA was not intended as serious AI; it was an experiment in creating a simple conversational interface to the computer\u2014outputting canned statements in response to certain \u201ctrigger\u201d phrases inputted by a user. But ELIZA, with her re\ufb02ective responses sounding a bit like a Rogerian analyst, became something of a celebrity\u2014much to Weizenbaum\u2019s horror (Turkle, 1995, p. 105). The popular press and even some psychiatrists took ELIZA quite seriously. Weizenbaum argued against ELIZA\u2019s use as a psychiatric tool, and against mixing up human beings and computers in general, but ELIZA\u2019s fame has endured. The interface and relationship that ELIZA demonstrates has proved signi\ufb01cant in and of itself, regardless of what computational sophistication may or may not lie behind it.\n\nAnother contextualist effort took place at Xerox\u2019 Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in the 1970s, where a team led by Alan Kay developed the foundation for the \u201cpersonal computing\u201d paradigm we know today. Kay\u2019s team is most famous for developing the mouse-and-windows interface\u2014which Brenda Laurel (1990) later called the direct manipulation interface. However, at a more fundamental level, the Xerox PARC researchers de\ufb01ned a model of computing that branched away from a formalist, rulesdriven approach, and toward a notion of the computer as curriculum: an environment for designing, creating, and using digital tools. This approach partly came from explicitly thinking of children as the designers of computing technology. Kay wrote:We were thinking about learning as being one of the mainn effects we wanted to have happen. Early on, this led to a 90-degree rotation of the purpose of the user interface from \u201caccess to functionality\u201d to \u201cenvironment in which users learn by doing.\u201d This new stance could now respond to the echoes of Montessori and Dewey, particularly the former, and got me, on rereading Jerome Bruner, to think beyond the children\u2019s curriculum to a \u201ccurriculum of user interface.\u201d (Kay, 1996, p. 552)In the late 1980s, Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores\u2019 Understanding Computers and  ognition: A New Foundation for Design (1986) heralded a new direction in AI and intelligent systems design. Instead of a rationalist, computational model of mind, Winograd and Flores described the emergence of a decentered and situated approach. The book drew on the phenomenological thinking of Martin Heidegger, the biology of perception work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, and the speech-act theory of John Austin and John Searle to call for a situated model of mind-in-the-world, capable of (or dependent on) commitment and intentionality in real relationships. Winograd and Flores\u2019 work raised signi\ufb01cant questions about the assumptions of a functionalist, representational model of cognition, arguing that such a view is based on highly questionable assumptions about the nature of human thought and action.\n\nIn short, the question of how these AI and cognitive science developments have affected the role of technology in the educational arena can be summed up in the ongoing debate between instructionist \u201ctutoring\u201d systems and constructivist \u201ctoolkits.\u201d While the earliest applications of AI to instructional systems attempted to operate by creating a model of knowledge or a problem domain and then managing a student\u2019s progress in terms of deviation from that model (Suppes, 1966; Wenger, 1987), later and arguably more sophisticated construction systems looked more like toolkits for exploring and re\ufb02ecting on one\u2019s thinking in a particular realm (Papert, 1980; Brown & Burton, 1978;Lajoi and Derry, 1993).\n\nKINDS OF DIGITAL MEDIA LEARNING\n\nWhen theorizing about the role of digital media learning environments in learning, the tendency is often to use an instrumentalist and instructionist approach\u2014the computer, for example, is a useful tool for gathering or presenting information (which is often and incorrectly equated with knowledge). Even within the constructionist paradigm, the social dimension of the learning experience is forgotten, focusing only on the individual child. And, even when we remember the Vygotskian zone of proximal development (ZPD) with its emphasis on the socially mediated context of learning, we tend to overlook the differences that individuals themselves have in their learning styles when they approach the learning experience. And even when we consider group and individual differences, we fail to examine that individuals themselves try out many styles depending on the knowledge domain being studied and the context within which they are participating. And, most importantly, even when the idea that individuals have diverse points of viewing the world is acknowledged, technologists and new media designers often do little to construct learning environments that truly encourage social construction and knowledge creation.\n\nDesigning and building tools as perspectivity technologies, we argue, enables learners to participate as members of communities experiencing and creating new worlds from the points of viewing of their diverse personal identities while contributing to the public good of the digital commons. Using perspectivity technologies, learners\u2014like stars in a constellation\u2014are connected to each other within a force that enables them to change their position and viewpoint yet stay linked within the larger and also moveable construct of the total con\ufb01guration of many constellations, galaxies, and universes. It is within the elastic tension among all the players in the community\u2014the learner, the teacher, the content, the artifacts created, and most importantly the context of the forces within which they communicate\u2014that new knowledge in, around, and about the world is created.\n\nThe next section has been organized less chronologically and more functionally, examining technologies from a variety of perspectives: as information sources, curricular areas, communications media, tools, environments, partners, scaffolds, and \ufb01nally, as perspectivity toolkits.\n\nWe also return to the importance of using the Points of Viewing Theory as a framework for designing new media applications and tools. These assorted technology approaches are not intended to be mutually exclusive; they are headers that often illustrate one aspect of a technology from a particular angle. How a technology should be characterized depends on how it used in situ. A learning technology may be designed in a monological fashion while in the context of use it becomes dialogical with the presence of human actors (Bakhtin, 1981; Wegerif, 2007). And vice versa\u2014technologies designed from a social constructionist framework may \ufb01nd their promise betrayed if used to serve instructionist goals and a single prevailing world view. With the explosion of ubiquitous learning with handheld devices in recent years, eroding the\ntraditional distinction between formal and informal learning, the potential for complex, meaningful, dialogically rich learning is greater than it has ever been (Burbules, Q1 2009). Within this context, it is essential to consider how perspectivity technologies can better accommodate these changes and provide a guiding light for future research and development.\n\nDigital Media for Information\n\nWhen we investigate how meaning is made, we can no longer assume that actual social meanings, materially made, consist only in the verbal-semantic and linguistic contextualizations (paradigmatic, syntagmatic, intertextual) by which we have previously de\ufb01ned them. We must now consider that meaning-in-use organizes, orients, and presents, directly or implicitly, through the resources of multiple semiotic systems. (Lemke, 1998)\n\nAccess to information has been the dominant mythology of computers in education for many educators. Not taking the time to consider how new media texts bring with them new ways of understanding them, educators and educational technologists have often tried to add computers to learning as one would add salt to a meal. The idea of technology as information source has captured the imagination of school administrators, teachers, and parents hoping that problems of education could be solved by providing each student with access to the most current knowledge (Graves, 1999). It is no different these days: legislators and policy makers are still trying to bridge the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d As of 2012, the state of Maine is the only state in the United States with an Internet-connected computer on every desktop.\n\nAlthough a growing number of postmodern theorists and semioticians see computers and new media technologies astexts to deconstruct (Landow, 1992; Lemke, 2001), it is more common to see computers viewed as textbooks. In spite of Lemke\u2019s reminder that these new media texts require translation and not only digestion, the computer is commonly seen as merely a more ef\ufb01cient method of providing instruction and training, with information equated with knowledge. Learners working with courseware are presented with information and then tested or questioned on it, much as they would using traditional textbooks. The computer can automatically mark student responses to questions and govern whether or not the student moves on to the next section, freeing the teacher from this task\u2014an economic advantage noted by many educational technology thinkers.\n\nIn the late 1980s, multimedia\u2014audio, graphics, and video\u2014dominated the educational technology landscape. Curriculum and learning resources, \ufb01rst distributed as textbook and accompanying \ufb02oppy-disc, began to be distributed on videodisc or CD-ROM, media formats able to handle large amounts of multiple media information. In the best cases, multimedia resources employed hypertext or hypermedia (Landow, 1992; Swan, 1994) as navigation schemes, encouraging nonlinear traversal of content. Hypermedia, as such, represented a signi\ufb01cant break with traditional, linear instructional design models, encouraging users to explore resources by following links between discrete chunks of information rather than simply following a programmed course. One of the best early exemplars was Apple Computer\u2019s classic Visual Almanac: An Interactive Multimedia Kit (1989), which enabled students to explore rich multimedia vignettes about interesting natural phenomena as well as events from history and\nthe arts.\n\nThe rise of Internet and search engines such as Google has stimulated the production of computer-based curriculum resources once again. As a sort of universal multimedia platform, the web\u2019s ability to reach a huge audience very inexpensively has led to its widespread adoption in schools, training centers, corporations, and, signi\ufb01cantly, the home. More than packaged curriculum, however, the use of the Internet and World Wide Web as an open-ended research tool has had an enormous impact on classrooms. Since the software for browsing the web is free (or nearly free) and the technology and skills required to use it are so widespread, the costs of using the web as a research tool are largely limited to the costs of hardware and connectivity. This makes it an obvious choice for teachers and administrators often unsure of how to best allocate technology funds. The popular reputation of the web as a universal library or as access to the world\u2019s information (much more so that its reputation as a den of pornographers and pedophiles) has led to a popular mythology of children reaching \u201cbeyond the classroom walls\u201d to\ntap directly into rich information sources, communicate with scientists and experts, and expand their horizons to a global view. Of course, such discourse needs to be examined in the light of day: the web is a source of bad information as well as good, and we must also remember that downloading is not equivalent to learning. As early as 2000, Roger Schank observed that,\n\n[A]ccess to the Web is often cited as being very important to education, for example, but is it? The problem in the schools is not that the libraries are insuf\ufb01cient. The Web is, at its best, an improvement on information access. It provides a better library for kids, but the library wasn\u2019t what was broken. (Schank, 2000)\n\nIndeed he made a good point that the problem is elsewhere, yet within a short decade the \u201cpossibility\u201d of better use of the access to a universe of materials has arrived. In a similar vein, \u201ccorrespondence schools\u201d\u2014both university-based and private businesses dating back to the 19th century\u2014are mirrored in today\u2019s crop of online distance learning providers (Noble, 1999).\n\nIn the classic distance education model, a student enrolls, receives curriculum materials in the mail, works through the material and submits assignments to an \u201cinstructor\u201d or \u201ctutor\u201d by mail. Hopefully, the student completes everything successfully and receives accreditation. Adding computers and networks to this model changes little, except for lowering the costs of delivery and management substantially (consider the cost savings of replacing human tutor/markers with an AI system). Again, in one decade it is not uncommon for leading universities to offer high-quality online degrees. Most programs have some courses that are available to students and the \u201cpush-back\u201d from resistant faculty who associated DoIt-Yourself (DIY) learning has all but disappeared. Anya Kamenetz\u2019s 2010 DIYU: Edupunks, Edupreneurs, and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education became an instant read across higher education with blogs and tweets that raised fear throughout the academic establishment.\n\nThe title of a May 3, 2010, article in the Chronicle of Higher Education by Seth Godin was \u201cThe Coming Meltdown in Higher Education (as Seen by a Marketer).\u201d Jay Cross and colleagues  from the Internet Time Alliance, created the 2010 version of his \u201cunbook,\u201d which he and his friends call Working Smarter: Informal Learning in the Cloud. Updates to the unbook can be found regularly by Cross and friends at www.internettime.com. Despite this current groundswell, the basic pedagogical questions about education remain: To what extent do learners in isolation actually learn? The introduction of electronic communication and conferencing systems into distance education environments has no doubt be shown to improve student\u2019s experiences (Hiltz & Goldman, 2004), and this has certainly been a widespread Q2 development, but the economic and educational challenges driving online learning still make it an ambivalent choice for both students and educators concerned with the learning process and accreditation. It will take a new system of evaluation of credentials before institutional bricks and mortar will become even close to obsolete. After two decades of knowing introducing technologies into day-today work and study, institutions of higher education are \ufb01nally responding with full force to create new kinds of learning environments that include formal and informal learning (ateliers and open community labs) as well as online mixed with face-to-face (f2f) classroom learning.\n\nThe next major hurdle will be addressing global learning, a subject that New York University, for example, has moved into with full force with branches in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, not to mention satellite programs and infrastructure in Buenos Aires, Paris, London, Florence, Acra, Singapore, Prague, London, Tel Aviv, and more recently, Madrid. Digital Media for Literacy in STEM Economic urgency and a chronic labor shortage in IT (Information Technologies) and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) professions and the increasingly changing needs for updating computers and networks in the workplace continue to drive the demands for gaining design and computational literacy.\n\nLearning in both formal and informal settings, including businesses and schools, requires access to information and people who can design, built, and create curricular learning environments in disciplinary and cross-disciplinary areas. Although the \ufb01eld of technology studies as a program area has existed in high schools and universities since the 1970s, it is interesting how much variation there is in the curriculum, across grade levels, from region to region, and from school to school\u2014perhaps increasingly so as years go by. Apart from the U.S. College Board\u2019s Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Curriculum, which is focused on professional computer programming, what one school or teacher implements as the \u201ccomputer science\u201d or \u201cinformation technology\u201d curriculum is highly varied, and probably dependent on individual teachers\u2019 notions and attitudes toward what is important.\n\nThe range includes straightforward computer programming (as in the AP curriculum), multimedia production (Roschelle, Kaput, Stroup, & Kahn, 1998), technology management (Wolfson & Willinsky, 1998), exploratory learning (Harel & Papert, 1991), textbook learning about bits and bytes, and so on. Standards are hard to come by because the \ufb01eld is so varied and changing. A most straightforward conclusion one may draw from looking at our economy, workplace, and prospects for the future is that computer-based technologies are  increasingly part of how we work. It follows simply that knowing how to effectively use computers is a requirement for many jobs or careers. This basic idea drives the \u201cjob skills\u201d approach to computers in education. In this model, computer hardware and software, particularly of\ufb01ce productivity and data processing software are the cornerstone of technology curriculum, because skill with these applications is what \u201cemployers are looking for.\u201d One can \ufb01nd this model at work in most high schools and it is dominant in retraining and economic development programs.\n\nAnd although its simple logic is easy to grasp, perhaps this model is a reminder that simple  ideas can be limiting. Heeding this dilemma, Seymour Papert, invoking curriculum theorist Paolo Freire, writes,If \u201ccomputer skill\u201d is interpreted in the narrow sense of technical knowledge about computers, there is nothing the children can learn now that is worth banking. By the time they grow up, the computer skills required in the workplace will have evolved into something fundamentally different. But what makes the argument truly ridiculous is that the very idea of banking computer knowledge for use one day in the workplace undermines the only really important \u201ccomputer skill\u201d: the skill and habit of using the computer in doing whatever one is doing. (Papert, 1992, p. 51)Papert\u2019s critique of computer skills leads to a discussion of \u201ccomputer literacy,\u201d a term almost as old as computers themselves, and one that is notoriously elusive. As far back as 1985, Douglas Noble noted that no one is sure what exactly computer literacy is, but everyone seems to agree that it is good for us (Noble, 1985, p. 64).\n\nSharon Derry and Daniel Zalles (2011) go beyond a theory of literacy to exploring how literacy is important for scienti\ufb01c civic reasoning. They propose \u201cthat active, collective citizenship through responsible civic reasoning, empowered by tools of science and technology, is an important educational goal of our time.\u201d They challenge the public to explore the connection between societal phenomenon and discipline-based science, using a sixstep approach: (1) seeking consensus around what is worth studying; (2) leveraging the power structures to ensure adequate funding; (3) operationalizing systematic research; (4) employing a \u201cculture of principled, unbiased, constructive critical discourse\u201d; (5) \ufb01nding evidence for setting policy and taking civic action; and (6) evaluating effectiveness. In short, they argue that a civil society requires that children be literate/\ufb02uent with both civics and technologies.\n\nWe suggest that the two books by John Willinsky, The New Literacy (1990) and The Access Principle: The Case of Open Access to Research and Scholarship (2006) expand on the idea that one needs to be \u201cliterate in literacy\u201d (p. 236), a phrase we now change to literate in digital literacies. Willinsky\u2019s The New Literacy emerges from the roots of popular culture, the Progressive Education Movement and even further back to the Romantics. It is grounded in the critical and yet inspirational work that can be reached through the thoughtful inquiry of teachers and students working together to rede\ufb01ne a new kind of learning place. In essence, the school becomes the language of this new literacy. Fifteen years later in The Access Principle, Willinsky focuses more on how we come to know and share what we know in open access digital environments.\n\nPointing to a long history to make knowledge public, Willinsky encourages the movement of cloistered knowledges held in most part by institutional repositories toward the democratization of knowledge.[A]n open access to scholarly publishing is not simply a side issues, a matter of bussiness plans and delivery systems, in the pursuit of truth.... Rather, the potential expansion in the circulation of ideas is much about the quality of truth pursued in such settings. I would argue that the global scale of knowledge\u2019s circulation is critical to its very claim as knowledge. (2006, p. 34).Certainly, Willinsky could not have predicted what came to be called the Arab Spring in 2011. In this time of protest against the existing regimes in individual countries (Tunesia, Egypt, Syria, etc.) that are embodied in the \ufb01ght for greater freedom across the Arab world, we can see how easy to use and accessible mobile technologies as well as social media software such as Twitter and Facebook gave access to information that led to communities sharing their perspectives and critiquing existing traditions of truth through a more negotiated understanding of what was felt and understood on the ground. Although it is unclear how the quality of truth can ever be reached in complex international con\ufb02icts, perhaps, what can be found in these contested spaces is incremental agreements that bring about verisimilitude, understanding, and a more general acceptance that differences of experiences and viewpoints can be negotiated through access to knowledge, resources, and power to make changes for the good of society, a quest that the Points of Viewing Theory was designed to facilitate. If Michel Foucault\u2019s book Power/Knowledge (1980) ever needed a rereading, it is in this particular time when our media tools help both laypeople and professionals interpret information in the quest to build a more just society.\n\nStill, in this chapter, we must address what the nature of computer literacy with new media technology in STEM learning in education is. Early attempts to de\ufb01ne computer literacy come from such in\ufb02uential \ufb01gures as J. C. R. Licklider, one of the founders of what is now the Internet, and whose notion of computer literacy drew much on John Dewey\u2019s ideas about a democratic populus of informed citizens. As computers became almost ubiquitous in the \ufb01rst decade of the 21st century, people began what now seems like a lifelong exploration to understand the role of these new technologies in their lives. The inevitable reduction of \u201ccomputer literacy\u201d to a laundry list of knowledge and skills (compare with E. D. Hirsch\u2019s controversial Cultural Literacy) prompted Papert to respond with appeals to the richness of what \u201cliteracy\u201d means:When we say \u201cX is a very literate person,\u201d we do not mean that X is highly skilled at deciphering phonics. At the least, we imply that X knows literature, but beyond this we mean that X has certain ways of understanding the world that derive from an acquaintance with literary culture. In the same way, the term computer literacy should refer to the kinds of knowing that derive from computer culture. (1992, p. 52, italics added)Other contributions to the notion of digital literacy remain rooted in the particular perspectives of their contributors. Alan Kay (1996) wrote of an \u201cauthoring literacy.\u201d Journalist Paul Gilster (2000) talked about \u201cdigital literacy.\u201d Andrea diSessa (1998; 2000), creator of the Boxer environment,  wrote extensively on \u201ccomputational literacy,\u201d a notion he projected that will rise above the banality of earlier conceptions.\n\nClearly, by computational literacy I do not mean a casual familiarity with a machine that  computes. In retrospect, I \ufb01nd it remarkable that society has allowed such a shameful debasing of the term literacy in its conventional use in connection with computers. (diSessa 2000, p. 5) Spiro, Collins, and Ramchandran (2007), an educational pioneer of how learning changes with hypermedia, multimedia, and now web-base interactive media, explained how learners become literate using the global and well-known approach called Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT). Using the following analogy of \u201ccrisscrossing landscapes,\u201d they weave a way for learners to gain \u201cdeep learning\u201d in knowledge domains that are \u201cillstructured.\u201d When one criss-crosses landscapes of knowledge in many directions (the main instructional metaphor of CFT, drawn from Wittgenstein, a revisiting is not a repeating. The result is knowledge representations whose strength is determined not by a single conceptual thread running through all or most parts of the domain\u2019s representation, but rather from the overlapping of many shorter conceptual \u201c\ufb01bers\u201d (Wittgenstein, 1953), as be\ufb01ts an ill-structured domain. (Spiro, Collins, & Ramchandran, 2007, p. 96)\n\nThe dif\ufb01culty of coming to terms with computer or digital literacy in any straightforward way has led Mary Bryson and Suzanne de Castell (1998) to identify the \u201cmiracle worker\u201d discourse that results, in which \u201cexperts\u201d are called on to step into a situation and implement the wonders that technology promises.[W]e hear that what is essential for the implementation and integration of technology in the classroom is that teachers should become \u201ccomfortable\u201d using it...we have a master code capable of utilizing in one platform what for the entire history of our species thus far has been irreducibly different kinds of things... every conceivable form of information can now be combined with every other kind to create a different form of communication, and what we seek is comfort and familiarity? (de Castell, Bryson, & Jenson, 2000, italics added)Familiarity and comfort, indeed! Bring on the affordances, they are proposing! However dif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne, some sense of \u201cliteracy\u201d is going to be an inescapable part of thinking about digital technology and learning. If we move beyond a simple instrumental view of the computer and what it can do, and take seriously how it changes the ways in which we relate to our world, then the issue of how we relate to such technologies, in the complex sense of a literacy, will remain crucial.\n\nDigital Media as Thinking Tool\nDavid Jonassen is perhaps best known in the educational technology domain as the educator connected with bringing to prominence the idea of computer as mind tool (1996, 2005). Breaking rank with his previous instructionist approach detailing what he termed frames for instruction (Duffy; Jonassen, 1992), Jonassen\u2019s later work re\ufb02ects the inspiration of leading constructionist thinkers like Seymour Papert. One of the classic quotations on the use of the computer as a tool from Papert\u2019s landmark book, Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas (1980), is:For me, the phrase \u201ccomputer as pencil\u201d evokes the kind of uses I imagine children of the future making of computers. Pencils are used for scribbling as well as writing, doodling as well as drawing, for illicit notes as well as for of\ufb01cial assignments. (Papert, 210)Although Papert did not predict Facebook and Twitter, he did say that technologies of the future would enable \u201cillicit notes.\u201d Although it is easy to think of the computer as a simple tool\u2014a  technological device that we use to accomplish a certain task as we use a pen, abacus, canvas, ledger book, \ufb01le cabinet, and so on\u2014a tool can be much more than just a better pencil. It can be a vehicle for interacting with our intelligence\u2014a thinking tool and a creative tool. For example, a popular notion is that learning mathematics facilitates abstract and analytic thinking. This does not mean that mathematics can be equated with abstract thinking. The computer as a tool enables learners of mathematics to play with the elements that create the structures of the discipline. To use Papert\u2019s example, children using the Logo programming language explore mathematics and geometry by manipulating a virtual \u201cturtle\u201d on the screen to act out movements that form geometric entities (Papert, 1980). Children programming in Logo think differently about their thinking, becoming epistemologists. As Papert would say, Logo is not just a better pencil for doing mathematics but a tool for thinking more deeply about mathematics, by creating procedures and programs, structures within structures, constructed, deconstructed, and reconstructed into larger wholes.\n\nPapert led a groundbreaking series of research projects that brought computing technology to schoolchildren using Logo. In Mindstorms, Papert explained that Logo puts children in charge of creating computational objects\u2014originally, by programming a mechanical \u201cturtle\u201d (a 1.5-foot-round object that could be programmed to move on the \ufb02oor and could draw a line on paper as it moved around), and then later a \u201cvirtual\u201d turtle that moved on the computer screen. A proteg\u00b4 e of Jean Piaget, Papert was concerned with the dif\ufb01cult transition from \u201cconcrete\u201d to \u201cformal\u201d thinking. Papert saw the computer as the tool that could make the abstract concrete:Stated most simply, my conjecture is that the computer can concretize (and personalize) the formal. Seen in this light, it is not just another powerful educational tool. It is unique in providing us with the means for addressing what Piaget and many others see as the obstacle which is overcome in the passage from child to adult thinking. (Papert, 1980, p. 21)Beyond Piaget\u2019s notion of constructivism, the theory of constructionism focused its lens less on the stages of thought production and more on the artifacts that learners build as creative expressions of their understanding.\n\nPapert understood the computer as not merely being a tool (in the sense of a hammer) but as an object-to-think-with that facilitates novel ways of thinking. Constructionism\u2014the N word as opposed to the V word\u2014 shares constructivism\u2019s connotation of learning as building knowledge structures irrespective of the circumstances of the learning. It then adds the idea that this happens especially felicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a public entity, whether it\u2019s a sand castle on the beach or a theory of the universe. (Papert,1991, p. 1)\n\nBy the late 1980s, the research conducted by the Learning and Epistemology Research Group at MIT was one of the most in\ufb02uential forces in learning technology research. A large-scale intensive research project called Project Headlight was conducted at the Hennigan School in Boston, studying all manner of phenomena around the experience of schoolchildren and Logo-equipped computers. A snapshot of this research is found in the edited volume, Constructionism (Harel & Papert, 1991), which covers the perspectives of sixteen researchers. For example, Aaron Falbel and Ricki Goldman-Segall situated their research in Illich\u2019s theory of conviviality as described in Tools for Conviviality (Illich, 1973)\u2014a theory that, in its simplest form, recommends tools be simple to use, accessible to all, and bene\ufb01cial for humankind. Falbel worked with children to create animation from original drawings and to think of themselves as convivial learners (Falbel, 19XX). Goldman-Segall conducted a three-year\ndigital video ethnography of children\u2019s thinking styles in computer-rich learning cultures and created a computerbased video analysis tool called Learning Constellations to analyze her video cases (1990). In Judy Sachter\u2019s work, children explored their understanding of  three-dimensional rotation and computer graphics, leading the way for understanding how children understand gaming (Sachter, 19XX).\n\nAt the same time, Mitchell Resnick, Steve Ocko, and Fred Martin designed smart LEGO bricks (crickets) controlled by Logo ((Martin, 1995; Martin & Resnick, 1993; Resnick & Ocko, 1991). These Lego objects could be programmed to move according to Logo commands. Researcher Nira Granott asked adult learners to deconstruct how and why these Lego robotic creatures moved in the way they did. Her goal was to understand the construction of internal cognitive structures that allow an interactive relationship between creator and user (Granott,1991). Granott\u2019s theory of how diverse individuals understand the complex movements of Lego/Logo \u201ccreatures\u201d was woven into a new fabric, which Resnick\u2014working with Lego/Logo robots\u2014called distributed constructionism (Resnick, 1991, 1994). Uri Wilensky, with Resnick, deepened the theoretical framework around the behavior of complex systems, introducing a \u201clevels\u201d framework (Resnick & Wilensky, 1998; Wilensky & Reisman, 2006; Wilensky & Resnick, 1999).\n\nTo model, describe, predict and explain emergent phenomena in complex systems, Resnick and Wilensky designed StarLogo; Wilensky has more recently designed the more widely used successor, NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999) which also includes a module for conducting participatory simulations (Wilensky & Stroup, 1999). Wilensky, a mathematician concerned with expanding mathematics education, connected it more to science education and to probability (Wilensky, 1993), is often cited for his asking a simple question to young people: How do geese \ufb02y in formation? The answers that young people give show how interesting yet dif\ufb01cult emergent phenomena are to describe.\n\nMathematics was an important frame for much of the research conducted in Project Headlight. Papert himself was a noted mathematician. In one study at the Hennigan School, Idit Harel worked with groups of children creating games in Logo for other children to use in learning about fractions (1991). The idea that children could be designers of their own learning  environments was developed further by Yasmin Kafai who introduced computer design to understand how girls and boys think when playing and designing games, a topic of great interest to video game designers (Kafai, 1993, 1996). Kafai spent more than a decade creating a range of video game environments for girls and boys to design environments for learning (and now works with more tactile digial textures). Kafai connected the world of playing and designing to the life of the classroom in a number of studies in the 1990s and early 2000s. Here current work at the University of Pennsylvania focuses on topics connected with the Learning Sciences, constructionism, games, virtual worlds, and gender.\n\nSeymour Papert\u2019s legacy continues to grow and morph as his \ufb01rst generation of students from the early years at the MIT Media Lab expand their research in various academic and industry homes: Uri Wilensky at Northwestern University, Idit Harel at her company, WorldWideWorkshop, Carol Strohecker at the University of North Carolina, Edith Ackermann at MIT, Yasmin Kafai at the University of Pennsylvania, Mitchel Resnick at MIT, Ricki Goldman at New York University, Nira Granott at the University of Texas, Dallas, Fred Martin at University of Massachusetts, Lowell, Susan Imholz at Pepperdine, Yasmin Kafai at University of Pennsylvania, and David Schaffer at University at Wisconsin, Madison. Sustained for over thirty years now, this community of researchers has studied a range of learning environments using games, tools, robots, and video data analysis systems using a Papertian constructionist perspective that continues to spread among new generations of scholars.\n\nConstructionism may have taken on a more social, ecological and distributed approach than Papert \ufb01rst proposed, but these changes are to be expected given the changes in technologies in this same period.\n\nDigital Media for Scaffolding\n\nThe computer asscaffold is yet another alternative to tool, environment, or partner. This version makes reference to Vygotsky\u2019s construct of the zone of proximal development (ZPD).[T]he distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 86)The scaffold metaphor originally referred to the role of the teacher, embodying the characteristics of providing support, providing a supportive tool, extending the learner\u2019s range, allowing the learner to accomplish tasks not otherwise possible, and being selectively usable (Green\ufb01eld, 1984, p. 118). Vygotsky\u2019s construct has been picked up by designers of educational software, in particular the CSILE project at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE).\n\nAt OISE, Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter worked toward developing a collaborative knowledge-building environment and asked how learners (children) could be given relatively more control over the ZPD through directing the kinds of questions that drive educational inquiry (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1991). The CSILE environment provided a scaffolded conferencing and notetaking environment in which learners themselves could be in charge of the questioning and inquiry of collaborative work\u2014something more traditionally controlled by the teacher\u2014in such a way that kept the endeavor from degenerating into chaos.\n\nAnother example of technological scaffolding comes from George Landow\u2019s research into using hypertext and hypermedia\u2014nonlinear, reader-driven text and media\u2014in the study of English literature (Landow & Delany, 1993). In Landow\u2019s research, a student could gain more information about some aspect of Shakespeare, for example, by following any number of links presented in an electronic document. A major component of Landow\u2019s work was his belief in providing students with the context of the subject matter. The technological scaffolding provides a way of managing that context\u2014so that it is not so large, or complicated, or daunting that it prevents learners from exploring, but \ufb02exible and inviting enough to encourage exploration beyond the original text. The question facing future researchers of these non-linear and alternately structures technologies may be this: Can the computer environment create a place in which the context or the culture, as anthropologist Clifford Geertz (1973) would say, is felt, understood, and can be communicated to others? More controversially, perhaps, can these technologies be designed and guided by the learners themselves without losing the richness that direct engagement with experts and teachers can offer them?\n\nDigital Media for Cognitive Partnering\n\nSomewhere amid conceiving of computing technology as arti\ufb01cial mind and conceiving of it as communications medium is the notion of computer as partner. This somewhat more romanticized version of \u201ctechnology as tool\u201d puts more emphasis on the communicative and interactive aspects of computing. A computer is more than a tool like the pencil that one writes with because, in some sense, it writes back. And although this idea has surely existed since early AI and ITS research, it wasn\u2019t until an important article in the early 1990s (Salomon, Perkins, & Globerson, 1991) that the idea of computers as \u201cpartners in cognition\u201d was truly elaborated.\n\nAs early as the 1970s, Gavriel Salomon had been exploring the use of media (television in particular) and its effect upon childhood cognition (Salomon, 1979). Well versed in Marshall McLuhan\u2019s (1964) adage, the medium is the message, later to become the medium is the massage, Salomon has built a bridge between those who propose an instrumentalist view of media (media effects theory) and those who understand media to be a cultural artifact in and of itself. Along these lines, in 1991, Salomon, David Perkins, and Tamar Globerson drew a very important distinction:Effects with technology obtained during partnership with it, and effects of it in terms of the transferable cognitive residue that this partnership leaves behind in the form of better mastery of \u201cskills and strategies.\u201d (Salomon, Perkins, & Globerson, 1991, p. 2)Their article came at a time when the effects of computers on learners were being roundly criticized (Pea & Kurland, 1987; Sloan, 1985), and helped break new ground toward a more distributed view of knowledge and learning (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1996 [1989]; Pea, 1985 &1993). To conceive of the computer as a partner in cognition\u2014or learning, or work\u2014is to admit it into the cultural milieu, to foreground the idea that the machine, in some way has agency or at least in\ufb02uence in our thinking.\n\nIf we ascribe agency to the machine, we are going some way toward anthropomorphizing it, a topic Sherry Turkle has written about extensively (Turkle, 1984, 1995). Goldman-Segall writes of her partnership with digital research tools as \u201ca partnership of intimacy and immediacy\u201d (1998a, p. 33). MIT interface theorist Andrew Lippman de\ufb01ned interactivity as mutual activity and  interruptibility (Brand, 1987), and Alluquere Rosanne Stone goes further, referring to the partnership with machines as \u201ca prosthetic device\u201d for constructing desire (Stone, 1995). Computers are, as Alan Kay envisioned in the early 1970s, personal machines.\n\nThe notion of computers as cognitive partners is further exempli\ufb01ed in research conducted by anthropologist Lucy Suchman at Xerox. Suchman\u2019s Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human- Machine Communication explored the difference between rational, purposive plans, and circumstantial, negotiated, situated actions. Rather than actions being imperfect copies of rational plans, Suchman showed how \u201cplans\u201d are idealized representations of real-world actions. With this in mind, Suchman argued that, rather than working toward more and more elaborate computational models of purposive action, researchers give priority to the contextual situatedness of practice:A basic research goal for studies of situated action, therefore, is to explicate the relationship between structures of action and the resources and constraints afforded by physical and social circumstances. (Suchman, 1987, p. 179)Suchman\u2019s colleagues at Xerox PARC in the 1980s designed tools as structures within working contexts; innovative technologies such as collaborative design boards, real-time virtual meeting spaces, and video conferencing between co-workers were a few of the environments at PARC where people could scaffold their existing practices.\n\nMedia for Social Constructionism\n\nHistorically, constructivist learning theories were rooted in the epistemologies of social  on structivist philosopher John Dewey, social psychologist Lev Vygotsky, developmental and cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner. Knowledge of the world is seen to be constructed through experience; the role of education is to guide the learner through experiences that provide opportunities to construct knowledge about the world. In Piaget\u2019s version, this process is structured by the sequence of developmental stages. In Vygostsky\u2019s cultural-historical version, the process is mediated by the tools and contexts of the child\u2019s sociocultural environment. As a result of the in\ufb02uence of Vygotsky\u2019s work, researchers in a variety of institutions view the computer and new media technologies as environments, drawing on the notion that learning happens best for children when they are engaged in creating personally meaningful digital media artifacts and sharing them publicly. Learning and Epistemology Group, the Center for Children and Technology, Vanderbilt\u2019s Cognition and Technology Group, TERC, the Concord Consortium in Boston, Georgia Tech, and SRI are just a few of the exemplary research settings involved in the exploration of learning and teaching using technologies as learning environments during the 1990s. Several of these communities (SRI International, Stanford, Berkeley, and the Concord Consortium) formed an association called CILT, the Center for Innovation in Learning and Teaching, which became a hub for researchers from many institutions. More recently, a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center called LIFE (Learning in Informal and Formal Environments), was established. It is hosted at the University of Washington in partnership with Stanford University and SRI International.\n\nThe range of methodological perspectives employed in these various research institutions, however, is as diverse as might be expected. Moreover, the discussion about what constitutes good research varied from community to community with some using mostly qualitative methods and others using quantitative measures and methods. Qualitative research methods, with their emphasis on case studies and in-depth analyses, best describe the conclusions of a study that is constructionist by design. Constructionists tend to be interested in digging around in the complexity of a small set of events while instructionists tend to focus on the organization of a larger set of variables. An instructionist tends to \ufb01rst look at a whole system and then break the whole into smaller units to be learned or processed; constructionists build up. They put together small units and combine micro-procedures into the elements\u2014or chunks\u2014of larger structures and wholes. This does not mean that constructionists do not have plans as they tinker or play with computational objects. Far from it; constructionists have plans which are in continual \ufb02ux as the parts of any whole program are built, assembled, and integrated (Suchman, 1987). Even the smallest change in a procedure can dramatically alter the outcome of a program. The designer/constructionist \u201ctweaks\u201d code at both top and bottom levels in the in\ufb01nite re\ufb01nement of an artifact.\n\nWhen individuals and groups create digital media artifacts, those artifacts then inhabit the learning environment, creating an ecology that we share with one another and with our media constructions. Technology can be seen as an expressive tool that allows learners to manipulate objects-to-think-with and through exploration and re\ufb02ection to come to more formal understandings of systems and relationships. Technology is thus not just an instrument we use within an environment, but is part of the social and ecological environment itself.\n\nDigital Media for Collaborative and Distance Learning\n\nThe most signi\ufb01cant advancement of collaborative learning with computers is the development of the ComputerSupported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) community, which hosts a bi-annual conference and a journal called the International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning. In a 1996 article, Timothy Koschmann suggested that the major educational technology paradigm of the late 1990s would be CSCL, a close relative of the emerging \ufb01eld of computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW). Educational technology, Koschmann pointed out, is now concerned with collaborative activities, largely using networks and computer conferencing facilities. Whether CSCL constitutes a paradigm shift is a question that is yet to be answered, but Koschmann\u2019s identi\ufb01cation of the trend is well noted. Two oft-cited research papers by Margaret Riel (and colleagues) into this category: Margaret Riel, James Levin, and colleagues on \u201cteleprenticeship\u201d (Levin, Riel, Miyake, & Cohen, 1987) and \u201clearning circles\u201d (Riel, 1993, 1996). Learning circles connected many students at great distances\u2014classroom to classroom as much as student to student\u2014in large-scale collaborative learning.\n\nHiltz and Turoff\u2019s Network Nation (1978), although originally concerned mostly with business communications and management science, explored teaching and learning with network technologies, applying their insights to practical problems of teaching and learning online. In general, the more the course is oriented to teaching basic skills (such as deriving mathematical proofs), the more the lecture is needed in some form as an ef\ufb01cient means of delivering illustrations of skills. However, the more the course involves pragmatics, such as interpretations of case studies, the more valuable is the CMC [Computer Mediated Communication] mode of delivery. (Hiltz & Turoff, 1993 [1978], p. 471)\n\n(Looking a bit further back in time, one needs to re\ufb02ect for a moment on the earliest beginnings of this research. It is often credited to the work of Douglas Engelbart at SRI in the 1960s (Bootstrap Institute, 1994). Englebart\u2019s work centered on the oNLine System (NLS), a combination of hardware and software that facilitated the \ufb01rst networked collaborative computing, setting the stage for workgroup computing, document management systems, electronic mail, and the \ufb01eld of computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW).\n\nThe \ufb01rst computer conference management information system, EMISARI, was created by Murray Turoff while working in the U.S. Of\ufb01ce of Emergency Preparedness in the late 1960s and was used for monitoring disruptions and managing crises. Turoff continued developing networked, collaborative computing at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in the 1970s working with Starr Roxanne Hiltz. Turoff and Hiltz founded the \ufb01eld of computer-mediated communication (CMC) with their landmark book, The Network Nation (1993 [1978]). The book describes a new world of computer conferencing and communications, and is to this day impressive in its comprehensive insightfulness. Hiltz and Turoff\u2019s work inspired a generation of computer mediated communication researchers, notably including technology theorist Andrew Feenberg (1987) at San Diego State University, and Virtual-U founder Linda Harasim (1990, 1993) at Simon Fraser University.\n\nParallel to the early development of CMC, research in CAI (Computer Assisted Learning) began to take seriously the possibilities of connecting students over networks. As mentioned earlier, the PLATO system at the University of Illinois was probably the \ufb01rst large-scale distributed CAI\nsystem. PLATO was a large time-sharing system, designed (and indeed economically required) to support thousands of users connecting from networked terminals. In the 1970s, PLATO began to offer peer-to-peer conferencing features, making it one of the \ufb01rst online educational\ncommunities (Woolley, 1994).\n\nDistance education researchers were interested in CMC, too, as an adjunct to or replacement for more traditional modes of communication, such as audio teleconferencing and the postal service. The British Open University was an early testbed of online conferencing. A. W. Bates (1988), and Alexander Romiszowski and Johan de Haas (1989) were looking into the opportunities presented by Q5 computer conferencing and the challenges of conducting groups in these text-only environments. Bates has written extensively about the management and planning of technology-based distance education, drawing on two decades of experience building \u201copen learning\u201d systems in the United Kingdom and Canada (Bates, 1995).\n\nIn the 1990s, Hiltz wrote extensively about Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) and education. Her 1994 book, The Virtual Classroom, elaborates a methodology for conducting education in computer-mediated environments emphasizing the importance of assignments using group collaboration to improve motivation. Hiltz hoped that students would share their assignments with the community rather than being \u201cmailed\u201d to the instructor. Hiltz was surely on a pioneering player in online learning during the late 1980s and early 1990s inspiring researchers around the world to realize the promise of \u201canyplace, anytime\u201d learning (Harasim, 1993) and study the dynamics of teachers and learners in online asynchronous conferencing systems.\n\nRoxanne Hiltz and Ricki Goldman (2005), in their collaboration on an edited book called Learning Together Online: Research on Asynchronous Learning Networks discuss the past, present, and future educational research on Asynchronous Networked Learning (ALN) community. In their \ufb01nal chapter the researchers remind us that being part of a social network is about growing a culture of learners. Using the example of jazz players, they note that,[W]hile some artists say they \ufb01nd that the required social networking keeps them away from their real passion, creating their works, many maintain that the continual push and pull with...the social world of their artistry enables them to see things with a greater perspective when returning to their work. What we are describing is a culture where the learners drive to create is appreciated, the artifacts that are created have a public sphere to be shown in, and the system is supported because it offers important values to the healthfulness of society. In short, cultures are created supporting members\u2019 activities and these cultures then produce sub-cultures while affecting changes to the overall culture. (Goldman & Hiltz, 2005.)In the early 1990s, students, teachers, and researchers around the world began to engage in networked collaborative projects. At the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS) at Northwestern University, the Collaborative Visualization (Co-Vis) project involved groups of young people in different schools conducting experiments and gathering scienti\ufb01c data on weather patterns (Edelson, Pea, & Gomez, 1996). Research at the Multimedia Ethnographic Research Lab (MERLin) at the University of British Columbia focused on how young people, teachers, and researchers conducted ethnographic investigations on a complex environmental crisis at Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island (Goldman-Segall, 1994), with the aim of communicating with other young people in diverse locations. The Global Forest project was centered on a CDROM database of video but used the World Wide Web to allow participants from around the world to share diverse points of viewing and interpretation of the video data. At the TERC research center, large-scale collaborative projects were designed in conjunction with the National Geographic Society Kids Network (Feldman, Konold, & Q6 Coulter, 2000; Tinker, 1996).\n\nThe TERC project was concerned with \u201cnetwork science\u201d and as with Riel\u2019s learning circles, multiple classrooms collaborated together, in this case gathering environmental science data and sharing in its analysis. For example, in the NGS Kids Network Acid Rain unit, students collect data about acid rain in their own communities, submit these data to the central database, and retrieve the full set of data collected by hundreds of schools. When examined by students, the full set of data may reveal patterns of acidity in rainfall that no individual class is able discover by itself based on its own data. Over time, the grid of student measurements would have the potential to be much more \ufb01nely grained than anything available to scientists, and this would become a potential resource for scientists to use. (Feldman, Konold, & Coulter, 2000, p. 7) One of the most interesting developments in CMC since the advent of the Internet is immersive virtual reality environments\u2014particularly MUDs and MOOs\u2014within which learners can meet, interact, and collaboratively work on research or constructed artifacts (Bruckman,\n1998; Dede, 1994; Haynes & Holmevik, 1998).\n\nVirtual environments, along with the popular but less interesting \u201cchat\u201d systems on the Internet, add synchronous communications to the synchronous modes so extensively researched and written about since Hiltz and Turoff\u2019s early work. One could position these immersive, virtual environments as perspectivity technologies as they create spaces for participants to create and share their worlds. There were many who predicted the cultural, social, economic, and educational impact of the Internet as a site for collaboration. Indeed, from the standpoint of the 21st century, most nonmaterial collaborations and works created collaboratively, in some way, involve the Internet. The result is that all education computing is a communications system, involving distributed systems, peerto-peer communication, telementoring, or some similar construct\u2014quite as Roxanne Star Hiltz and Murray Turoff predicted in the 1970s. Along with \u201csocial media\u201d as a common activity, perspectivity technologies (technologies which enable, encourage, and expand users\u2019 points of viewing) can be designed to create more democratic, interactive, convivial, and contextual communication that involve stakeholders\u2019 decisions (Goldman-Segall, 2000;Goldman & Dong, 2009). Goldman and Dong also discus the POV-T in relation to multimedia representations for teaching, learning, and research in socially networked\nlearning environments.\n\nThe Internet has clearly opened up enormous possibilities for shared learning. The emergence of broad standards for Internet software has lent a stability and relative simplicity to learning software. Moreover, the current widespread availability and use of Internet technologies could be said to mark the end of CMC as a research \ufb01eld unto itself, as it practically merges CMC with all manner of other conceptualizations of new media technological devices: CAI, intelligent tutoring systems, simulations, robotics, smart boards, wireless communications, wearable technologies, pervasive technologies, and even smart appliances.\n\nDigital Media as Perspectivity-Sharing\n\nSocial media and interactive video and computer games are engaging because they involve the perspectives and opinions of users who contribute to their networked communities. Using Perspectivity Technologies learners/participants become collaborators, curators, creators, and builders, layering their viewpoints and becoming connected with each other in ways that enable commensurability. Commensurabilty is a state where understanding of each other\u2019s cultures is reached, if only temporarily. One could trace the \ufb01rst glimmer of perspectivity technologies to Xerox\u2019 PARC in the 1970s. There, Alan Kay was inventing what we now recognize as the \u201cpersonal computer,\u201d a small, customizable device with substantial\ncomputing power, mass storage, and the ability to handle multiple media formats. Kay\u2019s advances, while simply pedestrian today, were at the time revolutionary. Kay\u2019s vision of small, self-contained personal computers was without precedent, as was his vision of how they would be used: as personalized media construction toolkits that would usher in a new kind of literacy. With this literacy would start the discourse between technology as scienti\ufb01c tool and technology as personal expression. The particular aim of [Xerox\u2019 Learning Research Group] was to \ufb01nd the equivalent of writing\u2014that is, learning and thinking by doing in a medium\u2014our new \u201cpocket universe.\u201d (Kay, 1996, p. 552)\n\nAt Bank Street College in the 1980s, a video and videodisc project called \u201cThe Voyage of the Mimi\u201d immersed learners in scienti\ufb01c exploration of whales and Mayan cultures. Learners identi\ufb01ed strongly with the student characters in the video stories. Similarly, the Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (CTGV) were working on video-based units in an attempt to involve students in scienti\ufb01c inquiry (Martin, 1987). \u201cThe Adventures of Jasper Woodbury\u201d was a series of videodisc-based adventures, which provided students with engaging content and contexts for solving mysteries and mathematical problems (Vanderbilt Learning Technology Center website). While both of these environments were outstanding exemplars of students using various media forms to get to know the people and the culture within the story structures, the lasting contribution is not only one of enhanced mathematical or social studies understanding, but rather a connection to people who are engaged in real-life inquiry.\n\nWith an AI orientation, computer scientist, inventor, and educator Elliot Soloway at the University of Michigan built tools to enable learners to create personal hypermedia documents, reminiscent of Kay\u2019s personalized media construction toolkits. Soloway and his colleagues continue to\nstudy project-based science through the design of sophisticated technologies developed for distributed knowledge construction since their landmark article called \u201cThe casebook of project practices: An example of an interactive multimedia system for professional development\u201d (Krajcik, Soloway, Blumenfeld, Marx, Ladewski, Bos & Hayes, 1996). Complementary pioneering work started by Marcia Linn at Berkeley analyzed the cognition of students who wrote programs in the computer language LISP, and Andrea diSessa, also at Berkeley, who studied students learning physics using his program called Boxer.\n\nFor diSessa, physics deals with,[A] rather large number of fragments rather than one or even any small number of integrated structures one might call \u201ctheories.\u201d Many of these fragments can be understood as simple abstractions from common experiences that are taken as relatively primitive in the sense that they generally need no explanation; they simply happen. (diSessa,1988, p. 52)Andrea diSessa\u2019s theory of physics resonates strongly with the notion of bricolage, a term \ufb01rst used by the French structural anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss (1968) to describe a person who builds from pieces and does not have a speci\ufb01c plan at the onset of the project. Levi-Strauss was often used as a point of departure for cognitive scientists interested in the analysis of fragments rather than in building broad generalizations from top-down rationalist structures. By the 1990s, French social theory has indeed in\ufb01ltrated the cognitive paradigm, legitimizing cultural analysis.\n\nStrongly in\ufb02uenced by the notion of bricolage, Goldman-Segall\u2019s (now Goldman) early digital ethnographies of children\u2019s thinking (1990, 1991, 1998) and more recent collaborative studies with her colleagues about girls\u2019 prototyping video games to promote mathematics learning in low socio-economic communities are rich examples of perspectivity theory. In these works, Goldman establishes unique partnerships among viewer, author, and media texts; a set of partnerships that revolves around, and is revolved around, the constant recognition of cultural connections as core factors in using new-media technologies.\n\nSituating her digital ethnographic work in Clifford Geertz\u2019s notion of the thick description, Goldman explores the tenuous, and often permeable, layered relations between creator, user, and media artifact through an online environment for video analysis (1989, 1998). A video segment, for example, is the representation of a moment in the making of cultures. A video object is a cultural object and also a \u201cpersonal subject-to think-with,\u201d something to turn around and reshape together. And, just as we change it through our manipulation, so it changes both our cultural possibilities and us. A fuller description of this theory can be found in the volume, Video Research in the Learning Sciences (Goldman, Pea, Barron & Derry, 2007), published with 67 learning science video researchers.\n\nAnother example of a perspectivity technology is described in the doctoral work of Maggie Beers who explored preservice teachers\u2019 learning modern languages to build and critique digital artifacts connecting self and other (Beers, 2001; Beers & Goldman-Segall, 2001). Beers has shown how groups of preservice teachers create video artifacts as representations of their various cultures in order to share and understand each others\u2019 perspectives as an integral part of learning a foreign language. The self becomes a strong reference point for understanding others while engaged in many contexts with media tools and artifacts.\n\nAnother exemplary application of perspectivity theory is demonstrated by Gerry Stahl. Stahl has been working on the idea of perspective and technology at the University of Colorado for more than a decade. His WebGuide forms the technical foundation into an investigation of the role of artifacts in collaborative knowledge building for deepening perspective. Drawing on Vygotsky\u2019s theories of cultural mediation, Stahl\u2019s work develops models of collaborative knowledge building, and the role of shared cultural artifacts\u2014and particularly digital media artifacts\u2014in that process (Stahl, 1999).\n\nIn sum, perspectivity technologies enhance, motivate, and provide new opportunities for learning, teaching, and research because they address how the personal point of view connects with evolving discourse communities. Perspectivity thinking tools enable knowledge-based cultures to grow, creating both real and virtual communities within the learning environment to share information, to alter the self/other relationship, and to open the door to a deeper, richer partnership with our technologies and one another. Just as a language changes as speakers alter the original form, so does the nature of discourse-communities change as cultures spread and variations of meanings are coconstructed.\n\nDigital Media for Playing and Learning With Games\n\nVideo and computer games are popular and motivating environments, and there have been calls to use them as a way to get students more engaged in education and to use them as effective environments for learning (e.g., Prensky, 2007). James Gee (2007) makes the case that video games have many of the characteristics that learning science researchers often recommend for the design of effective learning environments. When well-designed digital games represent conceptual play spaces in which learners/players can work in teams or by themselves to creatively solve problems, develop and test hypotheses, and investigate the game system and its rules (Barab, Sadler, Heiselt, Hickey, & Zuiker, 2007; Shaffer, 2006), learners can play at their own pace, set their own goals, and regulate their own exploration behaviors in an environment that also engages them on behavioral, cognitive, and emotional levels (Domagk, Schwartz, & Plass, 2010). However, the results from studies of how people learn content from and with video games are mixed. This suggests that careful research is needed to show under what conditions games are effective for learning.\n\nWhat we do know at this time is that experimental research has shown strong improvements of basic perceptual and cognitive processes as a result of playing certain video games. Several studies have shown that action games, that is, video games that require players to divide their attention over multiple targets (e.g., Halo), result in signi\ufb01cant increases in players\u2019 contrast sensitivity, as well as in the players\u2019 ability to do divided attention tasks, which is a basic attention cognitive skill (Green & Bavelier, 2003; Green\ufb01eld, deWinstanley, Kilpatrick, & Kaye, 1994). Play of video games using visual and spatial skills (e.g., Tetris) also increases those basic cognitive processes (Subrahmanyam & Green\ufb01eld, 1994); and, play of action video games (e.g., Unreal Tournament) results in increased spatial resolution and visual acuity (Green & Bavelier, 2007).\n\nTo understand the bene\ufb01t of using video games in a learning context, one needs to examine their potential future function in the learning process. Heuristics of existing games suggest four such functions: (1) prepare for future learning, (2) teach new knowledge or skills, (3) automate existing knowledge or skills, and (4) acquire 21st-century skills (Plass, Perlin, & Isbister, 2010). Preparation for future learning. Games to prepare for future learning do not aim to teach speci\ufb01c knowledge or skills, but to provide learners with a shared experience based on which content can be taught. Game genres typically used for such games therefore include adventure\ngames, open-ended simulation games, and role-playing games where students have an opportunity to take on different perspectives through role playing. Research by Hammer and Black (2009) suggests that the best use of video games in content (and perhaps other) learning might be in providing experience with the subject matter that will lead to better future learning of related material from a more formal learning setting.\n\nIn one study, Hammer and Black looked at expert players of the Civilization history simulation game and found that these expert players did not know any more about the historical content contained in the game than expert players of another unrelated game (Sim City) did. So far, this is consistent with the comparison research on content learning with video games. However, this study also examined how much the expert Civilization players would learn from reading a college textbook chapter on related historical content, and found that the Civilization players learned much more from reading the chapter than the expert players of the Sim City comparison game. Thus, having the experience of grappling with historical issues in the game may have provided the players with a set of experiences, as John Dewey (1938) said, that better prepared them for future learning from a more formal learning approach (Bransford & Schwartz, 2001).\n\nA related approach is the Teachable Agents Project at Vanderbilt. Using the Teachable Agents system, students learn by creating a concept map for a topic (e.g., river ecology) that then becomes what their online agent (avatar) knows about the topic. The system then puts questions to the agent and the students can see how well they know the topic by how well the agent does (and revise their and their agents\u2019 knowledge by changing the concept map and trying again). There is even a version where students\u2019 agents can \u201cplay\u201d against each other in a simulated TV quiz show, so that the students can see which concept maps work the best. Experimental research studies showed that students learning with Teachable Agents learned better (especially causal chains) than alternative approaches like standard classroom instruction and using concept maps. Teach new knowledge and skills. A strong case can be made that most if not all games teach the learner new knowledge or skills (Gee, 2007). However, the effectiveness or ef\ufb01cacy of games for learning at a large scale has not yet been suf\ufb01ciently investigated. Disagreement among researchers exists whether the very features that make games motivating and engaging\u2014the use of narratives to provide context and relevance, the design of emotional experiences, opportunities for discovery and exploration, and the use of compelling visual representations\u2014 facilitate learning or whether they introduce extraneous cognitive processing demands on working memory that suppress learning (Kirschner, Sweller, &Clark, 2006).\n\nStudies that have compared learning academic content (as opposed to attention and visual-spatial cognitive skills) have shown negative results for learning from video games. For example, Egenfeldt-Nielsen (2005) compared learning about European history from playing a history simulation game to learning the same content in a classroom, and found that students learned more from the classroom. Similarly, Mayer, MacNamara, and Adams (2011) found that students learned more about ecology by merely going through PowerPoint slides than they did from playing an ecology simulation game. On the other hand, qualitative and observational studies have showed student learning from video games (Barab, Zuiker, Warren, Hickey, Ingram-Goble, Kwon, & Herring., 2007; Squire, 2004). These results suggest that more sophisticated research methods have to be employed that use both qualitative and quantitative data in an interwoven way, such as through the adoption of POV-T (1998), to investigate the effectiveness of games for the acquisition of new knowledge and skills.\n\nThe game-plus approach is de\ufb01ned entails game learning in conjunction with other activities. Consistent with this games-plus approach, Steinkuehler and Duncan\u2019s (2009) found that players of Massively Multiplayer Online Games like World of Warcraft show informal scienti\ufb01c reasoning skills in online discussion forums that are supplements to the games and where players share their experiences. Another study consistent with this approach is Ahn (2007) and Black (2011) who looked at college undergraduates learning from an entrepreneurship simulation game (from Harvard Business School) as part of an entrepreneurship college course. The study found that students learned much more from playing the game (multiple times) when they also re\ufb02ected on and articulated their business and game-playing strategies, and related them to background readings in textbooks for the course (this is like the college textbook reading in the Hammer and Black study). They did not learn nearly as much from the game play if they did not re\ufb02ect on how it relates to this background reading.\n\nAll of the video game studies covered so far involve students learning from playing video games. However, a different, but effective, approach to video games and learning is to have students learn by creating video games themselves. Early studies by Harel (1991) and Kafai (1995) showed that students learned more about both fractions and computer programming (the Logo programming language designed for kids) if they created educational software or computer games to teach other students about fractions than they did if they learned about fractions and computer programming separately. Building on this work, Harel (now Harel Caperton) has established an online social networking environment called World Wide Workshop for kids to learn by creating online games (www.worldwideworkshop.org/). In related more recent work, Fadjo and Black (2011) have found that having students act out what they want their video game avatars to do, then programming a simple video game in which the avatars perform these actions (see discussion of embodied cognition in this chapter), is a more effective way for students to learn the programming and math skills than having them learn in alternative ways.\n\nIn a games and gender study involving the game Rapunsel, designed to teach middle school girls how to program by using a Java-like language to customize the avatars in the game, the strongest impact of the game was not on cognitive learning outcomes. After using the game for only four sessions, students\u2019 general self-ef\ufb01cacy, programming-related self-ef\ufb01cacy, and self-esteem increased signi\ufb01cantly, suggesting that games are able to impact learners\u2019 identity formation in a way that positively changes their attitudes toward their ability to perform science-related tasks (Plass, Goldman, Flanagan, & Perlin, 2009).\n\nAutomate existing knowledge or skills. The majority of games used for learning do not aim to teach signi\ufb01can't new knowledge or skills, but are designed to help the learner automate existing skills, such as basic arithmetic, algebra, Newtonian mechanics, history, or others. Game genres used for such games therefore typically include puzzle games, platformers, labyrinth games, and race games, often implemented as relatively short mini games. Research has shown that such games provide a venue for players to use their knowledge of biological and physical science topics, such as the water cycle (Lim, Nonis, & Hedberg, 2006) and principles of electromagnetism (Squire, Barnett, Grant, & Higginbotham, 2004), as well as math topics, such as measurement, whole numbers, equations, and graphing (Ke & Grabowski, 2007).\n\nChildren as young as six years of age have been found to develop stronger numeracy skills after playing computer games that provide practice in number sense and counting (Rasanen, Salminen, Wilson, Aunio, & Dehaene, 2009). At the high school level, videogames have been found to be effective tools for the reinforcement of algebra skills in an immersive three dimensional environment (Kebritchi, Hirumi, & Bai, 2010) as well as computer science concepts integrated into a labyrinth game (Papastergiou, 2009).\n\nAcquire 21st-century skills. Many games do not aim to teach academic knowledge or skills, or to automate existing knowledge or skills, but rather focus on the development of skills that has collectively have come to be known as 21st-century Skills, although most of them have been recognized for many decades, if not centuries, to be important predictors of success in life. These skills include creative problem solving, communication skills, team collaboration, emotional intelligence, and many others. Game genres typically used for such games include adventure games and role-playing games with large numbers of players, which are known as MMOs (Massive Multiplayer Games). Studies have shown that such games facilitate the acquisition of systems based reasoning and social knowledge construction (Steinkuehler & Duncan, 2009), collaborative problem solving (Squire, 2004), and civic thinking (Bagley & Shaffer, 2009).\n\nAll of the studies cited above assume that the games used in the investigations were well designed to facilitate learning. However, as Plass, Homer, and Hayward (2009) have shown, the design of games for learning is a highly complex and dif\ufb01cult process for which very little theory based, empirically validated guidance for designers exist. Another line of research has therefore been concerned with the identi\ufb01cation of design patterns for effective games for learning. This research, which is in part based on research of the design of effective simulations, has shown that icons are effective visual representations of key information, especially for younger learners and learners with low prior knowledge in the subject matter (Homer & Plass, 2010; Plass, Homer, Milne, Jordan, Kalyuga, Kim, & Lee, 2009;).\n\nOther research has investigated the mode of play for games teaching math skills, comparing collaborative play and competitive play to a single player version of a game. Results indicate that players enjoy playing with others more (in collaborative or competitive mode) and solve more problems in the competitive mode, but that they acquire a higher math \ufb02uency, an expression of the acquired math skills, when playing by themselves. A \ufb01nal study investigated the use of different learning mechanics in a game to teach middle school geometry. Players were asked to solve missing angles in order to clear the path for their avatar to free a peer from imprisonment. One mechanic was designed to require the player to compute the correct value of the missing angle and enter this number as response, whereas another mechanic asked\nlearners to identify which rule (e.g., complementary angles rule, supplementary angles rule, opposite angles rule, or the like) they would apply to solve the problem. Results suggest that computing the correct angles value was more situationally interesting than identifying the correct rule.\n\nHowever, participants in the rule condition were found to perform better in the game than those in the number condition. Results further suggest that in the number condition, but not the rule condition, playing more levels in the game diminishes the gain from pretest to posttest (Plass, Homer, Hayward et al., 2011). Games are an emerging medium for learning that requires research concerning both its effectiveness for learning and related design patterns. This research topic would bene\ufb01t from mixed methods, or what Goldman and colleagues call Quisitive Research (Goldman, Crosby, Swan & Shea, 2005; Goldman-Segall, 1996, Goldman,2007). In quisitive research perspectives from a fuller range of stakeholders use both quantitative and qualitative research methods along with emerging digital text and video tools for data analysis in order to investigate this topic further.\n\nEmotion, Empathy, Affective Computing, and Pespective-Taking\n\nThe history of emotional and social learning can be said to date back to the works by John Dewey\u2019s Experience in Education. It became a \u201cmantra\u201d of the Civil Rights Movement as well as the progressive, cooperative, and the whole child movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, the cluster of terms being used includes: social and emotional, empathetic learning, affective computing, and perpective-taking learning. According to Zins and Elias (2006):[S]ocial and emotional learning (SEL) is the capacity to recognize and manage emotions, solve problems effectively, and establish positive relationships with others...SEL is the process of acquiring and effectively applying the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to recognize and manage emotions; developing caring and concern for others; making responsible decisions; establishing positive relationships; and handling challenging situations capably. (Zin & Elias, 2006, p. 1)A series of research projects under computer scientist, Rosalind Picard, are aimed at investigating the emotional and environmental aspects of digital technologies. This work on \u201caffective computing\u201d (Picard, 1997, 2010) researches areas that include computer recognition of human affect, computer synthesis of affect, wearable computers, and affective interaction with computers. (See www.media.mit.edu/affect/). Needless to add, emotional learning has been of interest in the use of persuasive technologies in political and product advertising campaigns, as Ian Bogost (2007) points out. In educational research on gaming, interest in the emotional aspect of designing games for social good and as well as on developing historical empathy are currently at the forefront of renewed interest in emotions and learning.\n\nBelman and Flanagan (2010) argue that \u201cgames are particularly well-suited to supporting educational or activist programs in which the fostering of empathy is a key method or goal.\u201d As we discussed in the previous section, there is growing interest in harnessing the power of games for education. Belman and Flanagan ask: Why not design games to advance empathy and social activism? Some software interaction designers and academics have proposed that engaging players on the emotional level is a key element of their use. Sasha Barab and his colQ7 leagues (2005) designed Quest Atlantis, for example, which promotes children\u2019s educational and activist pursuits by engaging them with a fantasy that resonates at an emotional meta-level of cognition. Belman and Flanagan suggest that activist designers would \ufb01nd it useful to encourage empathetic play, a mode of play in which players intentionally try to infer the thoughts and feelings of people or groups represented in the game, and/or they prepare themselves for an emotional response, for example by looking for similarities between themselves and characters in the game. (Belman & Flanagan, 2010, p. 5-15)\n\nTaking a curricular and epistemological perspective, James Diamond, asks: How does game play in a history video game in\ufb02uence students\u2019 achievement of historical empathy? Although historical empathy is a construct that connotes \u201cperspective taking-in-historical-context\u201d, Diamond includes theory of mind in the construct. Using the video game, Mission US, he describes not only if players\u2019 abilities to achieve historical empathy change in the course of game play, but how students play and if their playing can inform future designs of games constructed to help students contextualize other people\u2019s thinking and behaviors (Diamond, 2012). Ashby and Lee (Ashby & Lee, 1987; Lee & Ashby, 2001)\u2014who are often cited as the pioneers of work on empathy in history education\u2014would be pleased to read this emerging work by Diamond.\n\nEmotional learning, including empthy development, is a major thematic for the future of educational research with digital media environments. Moreover, emotional learning along with social learning using social media, and embodied learning using interactive Wii and Kinectlike environments constitute the convergence of, not only new digital media technologies, but also a new paradigm of learning that depends upon the willingness of learners to share viewpoints and knowledge with each other. As Picard (2010), in an article titled \u201cEmotion Research by the People, for the People\u201d asks, how do we remind ourselves as researchers that the public as well must become part of the scholarly discourse, and that together we explore this new domain called emotional learning and perspective-taking.Today when a child teaches a distinguished scientist to upload video on the Internet, when non- researchers can participate in scienti\ufb01c labeling from home, and when gathering autonomic nervous system data 24/7 is as easy as slipping on a sweatband, emotion research is ready for a major leap forward. Ordinary people can gather data, upload it, compare their patterns, share what they learn, and if they wish, share it with scientists for emotion research. Research can be done by the people, for the people. Of course scientists still have to be involved: there is no substitute for deep scholarly study across experiments and for the rigorous development and test of new hypotheses and theories. At the same time, there is no longer any excuse for leaving people out of \ufb01ndings. Emotion research can bene\ufb01t all its participants, scientists and laypeople, instead of becoming academic in the modern de\ufb01nition. (Picard, 2010, italics added)Digital Media for Embodied Cognition/Learning\n\nSome of the current criticisms of traditional formal learning suggest that: learning can be fragile and lacking in depth; learning does not become a part of the way the student thinks about and interacts with the everyday world; and students too often forget what they have learned after the end of the learning events if it does not get applied to relevant situations outside the learning setting. In the 2010s, as new technological environments such as Wiis and Kinect allow for a more physical interaction, this technology along with an embodied cognition approach may provide a new approach on what it means to learn.\n\nAlong with the increased interest in emotions, the nervous system, neurobiology, as well as tools for leaving traces of our activities and emotional responses, cognitive science has also taken on this term to use Gibbs\u2019 (2006) statement that \u201cconceptual systems and thought processes are shaped by body-based interactions and experiences in the world\u201d (Kwah and Goldman., 2011). In this same paper, they add that emotional experiences in\ufb02uence cognition and must play a role in engagement in learning. As Gibbs so aptly wrote: \u201cThe brain is certainly part of an integrated dynamic system devoted to the momentby-moment embodied dynamic of everyday life\u201d (p. 9). He goes on to claim that \u201cthe regularities in people\u2019s kinesthetic-tactile experience not only constitutes the core of their self-conceptions as persons, but form the foundation for higher-order cognition (p. 15). We emphasize that an embodied approach can provide guidance for the design of new kinds of learning environments that can make knowledge more accessible, useable, and bene\ufb01cial for society, in accordance with the three tenets of Ivan Illich\u2019 de\ufb01nition of convivial tools (1973). For the purpose of this paper on the advances of digital media and how they affect learning, it mean that embodied digital media tools and environments can provide an alternative to the scenario of designing learning for the\nsolitary person sitting in front of a monitor.\n\nOne increasingly prominent approach to cognition is called embodied or perceptually grounded learning approach.This approach proposes that a full understanding of something involves being able to create a mental perceptual simulation of it when retrieving the information or reasoning about it (Barsalou, 2008; Glenberg, 1997). Both behavior and neuroimaging results have shown that many psychological phenomena that were thought to be purely symbolic show perceptual effects. For example, property veri\ufb01cation (e.g., retrieving the fact that a horse has a mane) was thought to involve a search from a concept node (horse) to a property node (mane) in a symbolic propositional network and thus the time to answer and errors was determined by how many network links needed to be searched and how many other distracting links were present. However, embodied cognition research shows that perceptual variables like size (e.g., more important properties are retrieved faster) affect veri\ufb01cation times and errors.\n\nAlso, neuroimaging results (e.g., fMRI) show that perceptual areas of the brain (involving shape, color, size, sound, and touch) also become active during this task, not just the symbolic areas. Thus, if one is familiar with horses and manes then doing even this simple property veri\ufb01cation\ninvolves a perceptual simulation. Glenberg, Gutierrez, Levin, Japuntich, and Kaschak (2004) discuss teaching reading comprehension by using a grounded cognition approach. These studies found that using toy farmers, workers, animals and objects increased their understanding and memory of the story they read. Further, if the students also imagined these actions for another related story after acting it out with the toys, they seemed to acquire the skill of forming the imaginary world of the story (Black, 2007) when reading other stories, and this increased their understanding and memory of these stories. Thus, this grounded cognition approach increased the students reading comprehension. These studies also seem to indicate that there are three steps involved in a grounded cognition approach to learning something: have an embodied experience; learn to imagine that embodied experience, and imagine the experience when learning from symbolic materials. Interestingly, it has also been shown that moving objects corresponding to story characters on a computer screen works just as well as moving toy objects in the physical environment (Glenberg, Goldberg, & Zhu, 2009).\n\nAn example of using an embodied cognition approach to designing learning environments and the learning advantages of doing so is provided by the graphic computer simulations with movement and animation that Han and Black (in press) used in perceptually enhancing the  learning experience. Chan and Black (2006) found that graphic computer simulations involving movement and animation were a good way to learn functional relations between system entities. Han and Black (in press) have enhanced the movement part of these interactive graphic simulations by adding haptic force feedback to the movement using graphic and sound simulations. Here the student moves the gears shown in the screen by moving a joy stick, and\nthen bar graphics on the screen show the input and output force levels for the two gears.\n\nAllowing the student to directly manipulate the gears enhances the students\u2019 learning, and enriching the movement experience by adding force feedback increases the students\u2019 performance even more. Thus the richer the perceptual experience, and therefore the mental perceptual simulation acquired, the better the student learning and understanding. Q9 Black, Segal, Vitale, & Fadjo (in press) reported on a number of embodied cognition technology learning environment projects and concluded that the richer the perceptual environment using multiple sensory modalities (e.g., using visuals, voiceovers, and movement) during initial learning the better the student learning. Secondly, they found that utilizing movements (e.g., gestures) that are conceptually congruent with the knowledge being learned increases student performance, learning, understanding, and motivation. A third \ufb01nding was that students who directly experience a phenomenon through activities like acting it out by moving their own bodies, learn about the topic in a more general way, which also increases learning, understanding, and motivation as does fourth, embodying their understanding in surrogates and then observing the surrogate behavior through activities like programming video-game-like virtual environments with avatar surrogates (with the Scratch programming environment) and\nprogramming robot surrogates like the LEGO NXT. Other recent technological developments, such as the Wii, offer mathematics-education researchers new ways of investigating deep cognitive and epistemological questions pertaining to the nature of knowing, learning, and teaching.\n\nFor example, in Gerofsky\u2019s study of secondary school students\u2019 learning about the features of graphs, such as roots, extrema, symmetries, asymptotes, re\ufb02ections over certain lines, domain and range, she found that embodied work appears to contribute to secondary school students\u2019 mathematical engagement and understanding (Gerofsky, 2011). She notes that:An integrated pedagogy that moves back and forth among explicit teaching of new concepts, embodied exploration of the \u201cfeel\u201d and \u201csound\u201d of mathematical graphs, and sessions of mathematical inquiry and problem solving would appear to be an ideal kind of balanced program to promote mathematical understanding. Another increasingly prominent approach to embodied cognition has been proposed by Dror Abrahamson, director of Embodied Design Research Lab at University of California, Berkeley.\nThe EDRL research group uses design-based research and video analysis to study embodied mathematics learning, along with a growing group of researchers in a variety of research universities and labs (Antle, Corness, & Droumeva, 2009; Cress, Fischer, Moeller, Sauter, & Nuerk, 2010; Dam, 2011; Goldman et al., 2011; Howison, Trninic, Reinholz, & Abrahamson, 2011; Leong & Horn, 2011; Kwah & Goldman, 2011; Nemirovsky, Tierney, & Wright, 1998). Abrahamson\u2019s research group creates useful empirical settings to pursue the (somewhat controversial) grounded-cognition conjecture that mathematical reasoning is not encoded and processed in the mind in the form of amodal symbols, but rather is enacted and evoked as embodied, dynamical, multimodal schemes. This conjecture can be traced back to the work of phenomenology philosophers (Heidegger, 1962; MerleauPonty, 1958/2005), yet it is converging with perspectives and empirical \ufb01ndings from the cognitive and learning sciences (Barsalou, 2010; Bruner, Oliver, & Green\ufb01eld, 1966; Dourish, 2001; Goldin, 1987; Hommel, Musseler, Aschersleben, & Prinz, 2001; Nu\u00b4nez, Edwards, & Matos, 1999; Piaget & Inhelder, 1969; Skemp, 1983).\n\nIn one type of embodied-interaction design being investigated by Abrahamson and collaborators (Abrahamson, Trninic, Gutierrez, Huth, & Lee, 2011; Petrick & Martin, 2011), students interact with the Mathematical Imagery Trainer for Proportion (hence, \u201cMIT-P\u201d). The MIT-P is an embodied-interaction system designed to foster the development of perceptuomotor schemas grounding notions of proportion. Participants use both hands to remote-control a pair of virtual objects on a computer display monitor, one object per each hand, in attempts to \u201cmake the screen green.\u201d The screen will be green only if the hands rise proportionately, in accordance with an unknown ratio set on the instructor\u2019s console. Once students determine qualitative interaction principles, such as that \u201cthe higher you go, you need a bigger distance between the hands,\u201d mathematical instruments are interpolated onto the screen, such as a Cartesian grid and numerals. Students develop the cognitive foundations of proportions via objectifying and articulating their amathematical solution strategies using the available semiotic resources (Bamberger & diSessa, 2003; Bartolini Bussi & Mariotti, 2008; Radford, 2003).\n\nAs such, Abrahamson\u2019s MIT tasks are de\ufb01ned in terms of a speci\ufb01ed goal state of an interactive system, which the student is to effect, that is, a target phenomenal invariance that the student is to generate. As a learning activity, this task is dramatically different from traditional schoolwork,\nbecause the solution method is unknown to the child. Moreover, this task is different from what mathematicians do, because there is no theorem to prove. Rather, this task is closest to forms of inquiry that scientists engage, for example a botanist who \ufb01rst encounters a specimen of an unknown species and is trying to understand its properties, or a chemist who has discovered a new element and is attempting to determine its reactions to various agitations. But then again, scientists who discover an undocumented phenomenon or material do not know a priori its potential behaviors that they have yet to witness (e.g., green), so that their interactions with the phenomenon are not oriented toward generating any speci\ufb01ed goal state. As such, the MIT task is rather unique.\n\nIn addition to analyses of student unmediated discovery (Abrahamson et al., 2011), researchers have examined the design from the perspectives of human computer interaction (Howison et al., 2011), design heuristics (AbraQ10 hamson & Trninic, 2011), and design process (Trninic,\nReinholz, Howison, & Abrahamson, 2010). Yet another approach to understanding embodied learning includes a close look at classroom gestures, perspectivity (Goldman-Segall & Maxwell, 2003, and \u201ccubist compositions\u201d (Nemirovsky et al 1998.). Nemirovsky, who was inspired by his work with Seymour Papert\u2019s notion of becoming the turtle when learning programming, along with Ferrara propose that mathematical reasoning proceeds through a process of imagining a situation from various viewpoints, through a form of \u201ccubist composition\u201d en route to articulating the rules and principles that unify knowledge of the whole. In their studies, they found that gestures were an essential modality for composing these partial perspectives of the whole.\n\nThe perspective of the gesture has received little attention in studies of gestures in classroom learning with the exception of studies by Crowder and colleagues (Crowder, 1996; Crowder & Warburton, 1995). Crowder\u2019s studies indicated that \ufb01rst- and third-person perspectives in\ngesture re\ufb02ected different knowledge orientations with a subjective, exploratory approach to knowing re\ufb02ected in \ufb01rst-person perspectives, and a summative approach re\ufb02ected in the third person. Many representational gestures convey a sense of being performed from a \ufb01rstor third-person perspective, what has been termed the \u201ccharacter viewpoint\u201d (McNeill, 1992). Crowder\u2019s work as well as McNeill\u2019s resonates closely with the theoretical underpinnings of Edith Ackermann\u2019s focus on perspectivetaking (Ackermann, 1995). In that same period, Goldman- Q11 Segall took a similar view on the need for subjective, \ufb01rst-person perspective as a way to reach con\ufb01gurational validity (1995)\u2014multiple viewpoints that become robust by \u201clooking through layers\u201d of interpretation (1996). Students learn to program by building physical artifacts that represent a \ufb01rst-person embodied object/subject-to-thinkwith. Enabling children to not only create their \ufb01rst-person viewpoints, but also critically share their collective viewpoints, building thick interpretations (2008, p. 24; 1998;).\n\nFor example, demonstrating the embodied understanding of children learning to make circles in the Logo programming language, Goldman-Segall\u2019s \ufb01lm called \u201cThe Growth of a Culture\u201d (1988) shows a group of girls making a circle with their bodies. When asked to make a circle as the Logo turtle would, Tnisha did not turn 360 degrees from one standpoint, but rather walked around the circle as the turtle icon in Logo would have done: forward 50, right angle 90\ndegrees, over and over again. At the same time, she looked into the camera saying that the circle is \u201cright here,\u201d while she gently pounded her left chest with her right palm of her\nhand. Papert in a \ufb01lmed documentary by Goldman-Segall (1990) said his classic line that young children learn to program and to think mathematically through becoming the turtle. Clearly, Papert was pointing toward what we are calling, empathic embodiments.\n\nIn a more recent exploratory case study in a junior high school programming class, Kwah & Goldman (2011) observed, interviewed, and videotaped teacher gestures during instruction as well as both teacher and student gestures during problem-solving interactions. They found\nthat \u201ca teacher\u2019s gestures are \ufb02exible constructions that enable programming concepts to be visibly modeled from multiple perspectives.\u201d (p. 1) More interesting, given that gestures are visible actions, students shared (mirrored), as artifacts of embodied imagery, the teacher\u2019s gestures while explaining the same ideas to their peers. While Kwah and Goldman are not, from this exploratory study, generalizing that students mirroring of teacher gestures increases learning, this research does indicate that gestures can serve as an aid for teachers to explain complex ideas of programming not as accessible to learners in more abstract ways. In short, understanding which gestures can promote understanding could become part of a cognitive toolkit for teachers that would bene\ufb01t student learning. In conclusion, although embodied interaction is the keystone activity in a multibillion-dollar gaming industry, sometimes called Body Movement-Controlled Video Games (BMCVGs), it is still little understood from a learning-sciences perspective, yet appears to promise rewarding design-based research into the nature of knowing, teaching, and learning.\n\nPIONEERING LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS\n\nIn this age of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and a host of other social media environments, games for learning environments, and handheld smart device to augment learning and create  communities, it is dif\ufb01cult to select the educational tools and decide which were the most pioneering ones that led to the kinds of tools and environments we use every day. Handheld computational devices are now ubiquitous and continually changing with each new \u201cApp.\u201d People of almost every age, socioeconomic, and ethnic background, country, and gender are texting, tweeting, and sharing private photos and videos. Websites and online tools are used continuously to share, promote, and \ufb02ame. They have become part of the mediated reality within which work, study, and play are mediated.\n\nOn buses, subways, trains, planes, and while crossing city intersections, people are connecting with each other. If there is one thing the Arab Spring that \ufb01rst erupted in Tunisia on January 9, 2011\u2014with protesters confronting the regime of the president Zine el Abidine Ben Ali\u2014taught us, it is that people have access to mobile handheld devices that are not only phones, but have the capacity to communicate instantly, create groups, share images and text, and whatever else can be found somewhere on the web in seconds, engaging in a new form of public-centric journalism and curatorialship. The average person with effort can become a knowledge maker, a\ntrendsetter, an investigator, and an expert who has curatorial power, if only over certain domains. A compelling personal narrative or story has become the vehicle for power, even political power as it is played out every day, not only by presidential hopefuls, but by leaders of repressive and violent groups. At this time, the quality of learning with these social media devices is not easy to evaluate\u2014the major critique being that the networked population is distracting itself to death, a play on the title of Neil Postman\u2019s book in 1985, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. Other critiques are that\nmultitasking, the method of moving around the various applications with different purposes, leads to shallow concentration and lack of focus. Others argue that the human mind is capable and ready for this kind of activity. That boredom is the real villain of learning. Others argue\nthat social media, games, and sur\ufb01ng the web expand our ability to learn, help us keep in touch with communities and individuals, and promote new ways to socialize, \ufb01nd partners, and select friend recommended hotels, run businesses, and shop. There is some truth to both sides of each of these arguments, as one might expect. Early adopters are enthusiastic about what is coming down the pike and fall into each new device with few complaints.\n\nLuddites refuse to give up their vinyl albums and enjoy the time and space that the lack of constantly learning the next application affords. Added to those extremes, there is every shade between the two poles. More and more, parents, teachers, and users create methods to control time online and keep balance in the lives of their children and their own lives. In short, the jury is still out about the effectiveness of using social media as a learning device in spite of the fact that it seems like a seductive augmentation tool for accessing an in\ufb01nite amount of information and fun.\n\nThe authors of this chapter now focus on the historical roots of these current digital media environments, making the case that the earlier software were precursors to social media and games for learning. This next section is a selection of some of the pioneering and perspectival technological systems developed to aid, enhance, and inspire learning and research using one or more elements of the Points of Viewing Theory. This montage is an authorial selection, not a representation of all pioneering systems for learning. It provides the reader with a snapshot of precursor tools rooted in the role of learners to build their own environments and become partners in the learning and research process.\n\nLOGO\nLogo, one of the oldest and most in\ufb02uential educational technology endeavors, dates back to 1967. Logo is a dialect of the AI research language LISP, and was developed by Wally Feurzig\u2019s team at BBN, working with Papert. This program made computer programming accessible to children, not through dumbing down computer science, but by carefully managing the relationship between abstract and concrete. Logo gave children the means to concretize mathematics and geometry via the computer, which made them into explorers in the \ufb01eld of math. As mentioned before, Papert believed that if the best way to learn French is not to go to French class, but rather to spend time in France, then the best way to learn mathematics would be in some sort of \u201cMathland\u201d (Papert, 1980, p. 6). Logo provided a microworld operating in terms of mathematical and geometric ideas. By experimenting with controlling a programmable \u201cturtle,\u201d children had direct, concrete experience of how mathematical and geometric constructs work. Through re\ufb02ection on their experiments, they would then come to more formalized understandings of these constructs. Children became epistemologists thinking about their thinking about mathematics by living in and creating computer cultures.\n\nWith the growing availability of personal computers in the late 1970s and 1980s, the Logo turtle was moved onscreen, and the notion of the turtle in its abstract world called a microworld, a notion that has been the lasting legacy of the Logo research (Papert, 1980). The Logo movement was popular in schools in the 1980s, and versions of the language were developed for different computer systems. Some implementations of Logo departed from geometry microworlds, and were designed to address other goals, such as the teaching of computer programming (Harvey, 1997). Implementations of Logo are freely distributed on the Internet. See www.cs.berkeley.edu/\u223cbh/logo.html. The Logo Foundation at http:/el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/logo-foundation/ has continued to expand the culture of Logo over the years.\n\nSqueak\nSqueak is the direct descendant of Alan Kay\u2019s Dynabook research at Xerox PARC; the Dynabook was built the 1970s. Squeak is a multimedia personal computing environment based on the SmallTalk object-oriented programming language that formed the basis of Kay\u2019s investigations into \u201cpersonal\u201d computing (Kay, 1996). It is notable in that it is freely distributed on the Internet, runs on almost every conceivable computing platform, and is entirely decomposable\u2014while one can create new media tools and presentations as with other environments, one can also tinker with the underlying operation of the system\u2014how windows appear, or how networking protocols are implemented. A small but enthusiastic user community supports and extends the Squeak environment, creating such tools as web browsers, music synthesizers, three-dimensional graphics toolkits, and so on entirely within Squeak. See www.squeak.org.\n\nBoxer\nBoxer is a \u201ccomputational medium\u201d\u2014a combination of a programming language, a microworld environment, and a set of libraries and tools for building tools for exploring problem solving with computers. Developed by diSessa, Boxer blends the Logo work of Papert (1980) and the \u201cmutable medium\u201d notion of Kay (1996) in a \ufb02exible computing toolkit. diSessa\u2019s work has been ongoing since the 1980s, when he conceived of an environment to extend the Logo research into a more robust and \ufb02exible environment in which to explore physics concepts (diSessa, 2000). Boxer is freely distributed on the Internet.\n\nHyperCard\n\nIt is important to remember that in 1987 Apple Computer was exploring multimedia as the fundamental rationale for people wanting Macintosh computers. But, as there was little multimedia software available in the late 1980s, Apple decided to bundle a multimedia authoring toolkit with every Macintosh computer. This toolkit was HyperCard, and it proved to be an enormously popular with a wide variety of users, and especially in schools. HyperCard emulates a sort of magical stack of 3 \u00d7 5 index cards, and its multimedia documents were thus called stacks. An author could add text, images, audio, and even video components to cards and then use a simple and elegant scripting language to tie these cards together or perform certain behaviors. Two broad categories of use emerged in HyperCard: the \ufb01rst was collecting and enjoying predesigned stacks; the second was authoring one\u2019s own. In the online bulletin board systems of the early 1990s, HyperCard authors exchanged great volumes of \u201cstackware.\u201d Educators were some of the most enthusiastic users, either creating content for students (a stellar example of this is Apple\u2019s Visual Almanac, which married videodisc-based content with a HyperCard control interface) or encouraging students to create their own. Others used HyperCard to create scaffolds and tools for learners to use in their own media construction. A good snapshot of this HyperCard authoring culture is described in Ambron and Hooper\u2019s Learning with Interactive Multimedia (1990). HyperCard development at Apple languished in the mid-1990s and disappeared in the 2000s.\n\nConstellations/WebConstellations/Orion 1.0/Orion 2.0\n\nBuilding on the HyperCard platform, Learning Constellations (Goldman-Segall, 1989) was a collaborative video annotation tool that builds on the metaphor of stars (video chunks) and constellations (collections). Star video chunks could be combined to make constellations, but different users may place the same star in different contexts, depending on their understanding by viewing data from various perspectives. Learning Constellations was a datasharing system, promoting Goldman-Segall\u2019s notion of con\ufb01gurational validity by allowing different users to compare and exchange views on how they contextualize the same information differently in order to reach valid conclusions about the data (Goldman-Segall, 1995; Goldman-Segall & Rao, 1998). It also features collaborative ranking and annotation of data nodes. While other video analysis tools were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s, (Harrison & Baecker, 1992; Kennedy 1989; Mackay, 1989; Roschelle, Pea, & Trigg, 1990), Learning Constellations (aka Constellations) was the \ufb01rst video date analysis tool to analyze a robust video ethnographic data (Goldman-Segall, 1989, 1990, 1991).\n\nContinuing to use the HyperCard plaftorm, GoldmanSegall developed a updated version of Learning Constellations as a stand-alone application in 1993. She added a signi\ufb01cance measure to layer descriptions and \u201crate attributes\u201d the themes and keywords (Goldman-Segall, 1993). In 1998, the tool went online as a web-based collaborative video analysis tool called WebConstellations (Goldman-Segall, 1998c, 1999; Goldman-Segall & Rao, 1998). Every media type\u2014website page, text document, video chunk, or photo could become a star chunk and could be tagged, rated, and juxtaposed for comparative analysis. The most recent version, Orion 2.0 returned back to its original functionality of being a tool only video chunking, sorting, analysis, ethnographic theory-building and story-making. As a perspectivity technology, individuals enter into Orion, creating their own home page and inviting others to join in the analysis. Taking a lead in feature development, by 2007 each user could have a number of simultaneous projects with diverse research communities, in somewhat the same way that social media now enables groups to work.\n\nAdventures of Jasper Woodbury\n\nJasper Woodbury is the name of a character in a series of adventure stories that the (CTGV) use as the basis for \u201canchored instruction.\u201d The stories, presented on videodisc or CD-ROM are carefully crafted mysteries that present problems to be solved by groups of learners. Since the video can be randomly accessed, learners are encouraged to re-explore parts of the story in order to gather clues and develop theories about the problem to be solved. The Jasper series \ufb01rst appeared in the 1980s and there are now 12 stories (Cognition and Technology Group at\nVanderbilt University, 1997).\n\nCSILE/Knowledge Forum\n\nCSILE\u2014Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environment\u2014was developed by Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) in the 1980s. CSILE is a collaborative, problem-based, knowledge-building environment. Learners can collaborate on data collection, analysis of \ufb01ndings, constructing and presenting conclusions by exchanging structured \u201cnotes,\u201d and attaching further questions, contributions, and so on to preexisting notes. CSILE was originally conceived to provide a dynamic scaffold for knowledge construction\u2014one that would let the learners themselves direct the inquiry process (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1991). CSILE is now commercially developed and licensed as Knowledge Forum.\n\nStarLogo and NetLogo\n\nStarLogo and NetLogo are parallel-computing versions of Logo. By manipulating multiple (thousands), distributed \u201cturtles,\u201d learners can work with interactive models of complex interactions, population dynamics, and other decentralized systems. Developed by Mitchel Resnick, Uri Wilensky and a team of researchers at MIT, StarLogo was conceived as a tool to move learners\u2019 thinking \u201cbeyond the centralized mind-set\u201d and to study how people make sense of complex systems (Resnick 1991, 1994; Wilensky & Resnick, 1999). NetLogo\u2014an environment developed by Wilensky at the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at Northwestern University is in widespread use both in education and\nresearch. Both of these are freely available on the Internet. See http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ and www.media.mit.edu/starlogo.\n\nMaMaMedia/World Wide Workshop\n\nThe World Wide Workshop is a global foundation for developing open-source applications of social media technology and game production, to enhance learning, innovation, entrepreneurship, and an understanding of the world in economically disadvantaged and technologically underserved communities (www.worldwideworkshop.org). An organization founded in 2004 by MIT Media Lab graduate and entrepreneur Idit Harel, World Wide Workshop addresses the problem of closing the digital divide and transforming education by reaching low socioeconomic youth in low-performing schools with learning networks and by taking a systemic approach to education innovation and reform. In 2006, the World Wide Workshop launched the Globaloria Learning Network (www.Globaloria.org). The Globaloria Learning Network (www.Globaloria.org) is a \u201cblended learning lab\u201d that provides a year-long digital curriculum, tools, resources, student and educator data tracking, and professional development for educators to engage, motivate and advance students\u2019 STEM learning through game design.\n\nYoung people in middle school and high school ages are immersed in blended learning (combining online and onsite), becoming game designers and mastering creative computational skills and core content knowledge. Academic researchers from several countries work with the\nWorld Wide Workshop to study constructionist digital literacy, motivation and engagement, and how new technology innovation can inform, engage and transform students, teachers, schools and communities.\n\nThe underlying constructionist digital literacy approach stems from her MIT Media Lab research and was also present in an earlier company Harel founded in the 1990s called MaMaMedia. The rationale of MaMaMedia was to enable kids and their parents to participate in web experiences that are creative, safe, constructionist by nature, and educational. Harel\u2019s book, Children Designers (Harel, 1991), lays the foundation for MaMaMedia, and for research in understanding how children in rich online environments construct software and design math games with representations of their thinking. MaMaMedia enabled girls and boys to be online playing games, learning how participate in the vast MaMaMedia community.\nMOOSE Crossing\n\nGeorgia Tech researcher Amy Bruckman created MOOSE Crossing as part of her doctoral work at the MIT Media Lab. MOOSE Crossing can be characterized as an breakthrough combination of Papert\u2019s Logo/ microworlds, the \u201cmutable media\u201d notions of Alan Kay (Kay, 1996), and a MOO (Haynes & Holmevik, 1998)\u2014a real-time, collaborative, immersive virtual environment. MOOSE Crossing is a microworld that learners can themselves enter, designing and programming the virtual environment from within. It becomes a lived-in text that one shares\nwith other readers/writers/designers. Bruckman (1998) stated that this early innovation, MOOSE Crossing, was \u201ccommunity support for constructionist learning.\u201d Indeed, it was.\n\nCalling a software system a place gives users a radically different set of expectations. People are familiar with a wide variety of types of places, and have a sense of what to do there...Instead of asking What do I do with this software?, people ask themselves, What do I do in this place? The second question has a very different set of answers than the \ufb01rst. (Bruckman, 1998, p. 49)\n\nBruckman\u2019s thesis is that community and constructionist learning go hand in hand. Her ethnographic accounts of learners inside the environment reveals very close, very personal bonds emerging between children in the process of designing and building their world in MOOSE Crossing. \u201cThe emotional support,\u201d she writes, \u201cis inseparable from the technical support. Receiving help from someone you would tell your secret nickname to is clearly very different from receiving help from a computer program or a schoolteacher\u201d (p. 128).\n\nSimCalc\n\nSimCalc\u2019s tagline is \u201cDemocratizing Access to the Mathematics of Change,\u201d and the goal is to make the understanding of change accessible to more learners than the small minority who take calculus classes. SimCalc, a project at the University of Massachusetts under James Kaput working with Jeremy Roschelle, and Ricardo Nemirovky, is a simulation and visualization system for learners to explore calculus concepts in a problembased model, one that avoids traditional problems with mathematical representation (Kaput, Roschelle, & Stroup,\n1998). The core software, called MathWorlds (echoing Papert\u2019s \u201cMathland\u201d idea) allows learners to manipulate variables and see results via real- time visualizations with both animated characters and more traditional graphs. SimCalc is freely available on the Internet. See www.simcalc.umassd.edu/\n\nParticipatory Sims\n\nParticipatory Sims, a project overseen by Uri Wilensky and Walter Stroup at Northwestern University, is a distributed computing environment built on the foundations of LOGO that encourages learners to collaboratively explore complex simulations. The Participatory Sims project centers on HubNet, a \u201cClassroom-based Network of Handheld Devices and Up-front Computer,\u201d which allows learners to participate in models of dynamic systems (Resnick, 1996) in a live, classroom environment. \u201cThe emergent behavior (see Figure 1) of the system and its relation to individual participant actions and strategies can then become the object of collective discussion and analysis\u201d (Wilensky & Stroup, 1999). See www.ccl.sesp.northwestern.edu/ps/index.html\n\nCoVis\n\nCoVis\u2014\u201cCollaborative Visualization\u201d\u2014a project that ran from Northwestern University in the 1990s, was clearly a strong predictor of what was to follow in education. It focused on science learning through projects using a telecommunications infrastructure, scienti\ufb01c visualization tools, and software to support collaboration between diverse schools in distributed locations (Edelson et al.,1996). Much of learners\u2019 investigation centred on atmospheric and environmental studies, allowing wide-scale (across the United States) data sharing. Learners could then use sophisticated data analysis tools to visualize and draw conclusions. CoVis made use of a variety of networked software: collaborative \u201cnotebooks,\u201d distributed databases, system visualization tools, as well as the WWW and electronic mail. The goal in the CoVis project was for young people to study topics in much the same way as professional scientists do.\n\nNational Geographic Kids Network\n\nAnother example of an early perspectivity environment in the late 1980s and 1990s was the National Geographic Kids Network. A number of very large-scale research projects explored the possibilities of connecting multiple classrooms across the United States for data sharing and collaborative inquiry (Feldman et al., 2000). Programs like National Geographic Kids Network (NGKNet), an NSFfunded collaboration between the National Geographic Society and educational technology research center TERC reached thousands of classrooms and tens of thousands of students (p. 30). TERC\u2019s NGKNet provided curriculum plans and resources around issues like acid rain, and tools, which facilitated large-scale data collection, sharing, and analysis of results. Other projects, like Classroom BirdWatch and EnergyNet focused on issues with comparable global signi\ufb01cance and local implications, turning large numbers of learners into a community of practice doing distributed scienti\ufb01c investigation. Feldman, Konold, and\nCoulter note that these large-scale projects question the notion of the individual child as scientist, pointing instead toward interesting models of collaborative engagement in\nscience, technology, and society issues (pp. 142\u2013143). Needless to say this work still continues to impress. See http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/\n\nTapped In\n\nTapped In is a Multi-User Online Educational Workspace (MEOW) for teachers and education professionals. The Tapped In project, led by Mark Schlager at SRI, began in the late 1990s as a MOO (textual VR) environment for synchronous collaboration and has since grown into a sophisticated (Web + MOO) multimedia environment for both synchronous and asynchronous work, with a large and active user population (Schlager & Schank, 1997). Q12\n\nTapped In uses similar technological infrastructure to MOOSE Crossing, but has a different kind of community of practice at work within it; Tapped In functions more like an ongoing teaching conference, with many weekly or monthly events, workshops, and happenings. Tapped In is an exemplary model of a multimode collaborative environment. See www.tappedin.sri.com/\n\nCoWeb\n\nAt Georgia Tech, Mark Guzdial and colleagues at the Collaborative Software Laboratory (CSL) created a variety of software environments building on the original educational computing vision of Alan Kay in the 1970s (Kay, 1996); the computer can be a tool for composing and experiencing dynamic media. Growing from Guzdial\u2019s previous work on theCaMILE project (Guzdial, 1997)\u2014a web-based \u201canchored collaboration\u201d environment, CSL\u2019s CoWeb project explores possibilities in designing and using collaborative media tools online (Guzdial, 1999). CoWeb and other CSL work is largely based on the Squeak environment, a direct descendant of Alan Kay\u2019s research at Xerox PARC in the 1970s.\n\nWebGuide\n\nWebGuide, a web-based, collaborative knowledgeconstruction tool, was created by Gerry Stahl and colleagues at the University of Colorado (Stahl, 1999). WebGuide is designed to facilitate personal and collaborative understanding through mediating perspectivity via cultural artifacts. WebGuide acts as a scaffold for group understanding. WebGuide is a structured conferencing system supporting rich interlinking and information reuse/recontextualization, as well as multiple views on the structure of the information set. Learners contribute information from individual perspectives, but this information can later be negotiated and re-collected in multiple contexts construct.\n\nCHALLENGING QUESTIONS\nModels of Mind or Culture Creation?\n\nFrom the vantage point of the mid-1990s, Jerome Bruner looked back on the cognitive revolution of the late 1950s, which he helped to shape, and re\ufb02ected on a lost opportunity. Bruner had imagined that the new cognitive paradigm would bring the search for meaning to the fore, distinguishing it from the behaviorism that preceded it (Bruner, 1990, p. 2). And yet, Bruner writes, the revolution went awry, not because it failed, but because it succeeded:Very early on, for example, emphasis began shifting from \u201cmeaning\u201d to \u201cinformation,\u201d from the construction of meaning to the processing of information. These are profoundly different matters. The key factor in the shift was the introduction of computation as the ruling metaphor and computability as a necessary criterion of a good theoretical model. (p. 4)The information-processing model of cognition became so dominant, Bruner argues, and the role of meaning and meaning-making ended up as much in disfavor as it had been in behaviorism. \u201cIn place of stimuli and responses, there was input and output,\u201d and hard empiricism ruled again, with a new vocabulary, but with the same disdain for mentalism (p. 7). Bruner\u2019s career as a theorist is itself instructive. Heralded by Gardner and others as one of the leading lights of 1950s cognitivism, Bruner has since the 1980s been one of a small but vocal group calling for a return to the role of culture in understanding the mind. This movement has been tangled up closely with the evolution of educational technology over the same period, perhaps illuminated in a pair of titles that bookend one researcher\u2019s decade-long trajectory: Etienne Wenger\u2019s (1987) Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Tutoring Systems: Computational and Cognitive Approaches to the Communication of Knowledge and his (1998) Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity.\n\nParadigm Shift With Digital Media or Incremental Changes?\n\nIn his 1996 article, \u201cParadigm Shifts and Instructional Technology: An Introduction,\u201d Timothy Koschmann began by identifying four de\ufb01ning paradigms of technology in education. In roughly chronological (but certainly overlapping) order, these are: Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI), characterized by drill-and-practice and programmed instruction systems; Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which drew on arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) research in order to create automated systems, which could evaluate a learner\u2019s progress and tailor instruction accordingly; the Logo-asLatin paradigm, led by Seymour Papert\u2019s \u201cmicroworld\u201d and children-as-programmers efforts; and \ufb01nally, ComputerSupported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), a \u201csocially oriented, constructivist\u201d approach that focuses on learners in practice, in groups. Koschmann invoked Thomas Kuhn\u2019s (1996) controversial notion of the incommensurability of competing paradigms:Kuhn held that the effect of a paradigm shift is to produce a divided community of researchers no longer able to debate their respective positions, owing to fundamental differences in terminology, conceptual frameworks, and views on what constitutes the legitimate questions of science. (Koschmann,1996, p. 2)Koschmann\u2019s analysis may well be accurate. The literature surrounding the effects learning technology produces certainly displays examples of this incommensurability, even within the writings of individual theorists. A counter perspective to Kuhn\u2019s view of paradigmatic shifts in scienti\ufb01c understanding was offered by Stephen Toulmin (1972), who argued that conceptual change must Q13 not be understood as a globally uni\ufb01ed, systematic shift in attitudes in beliefs about science; rather, it was a fragmented process, which was highly contextualized and dependent on local scienti\ufb01c practices. According to Toulmin, knowledge develops in a more piecemeal fashion rather than through seismic leaps; \u2018competing\u2019 paradigms continue to exert considerable in\ufb02uence on our understanding. Andrea diSessa (2006), arguing for a reappraisal Toulmin\u2019s neglected work on conceptual change, applied it to how the \u201cintuitive ideas\u201d which young learners brought to a physics lesson were crucial resources for developing \u201cknowledge in pieces,\u201d or the weaving of various threads of ideas into a \u201cdifferent, stronger, and more normative conceptual fabric\u201d (diSessa, 2006, p. 273). The application of these ideas to learning technologies casts doubt upon the notions of internal coherence of individual paradigms and their representative designers, as well as their impermeability to each other.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Papert\u2019s work with teaching children to program in Logo was originally concerned with bridging the gap between Piaget\u2019s concrete and formal thinking stages, particularly with respect to mathematics and geometry. But over time, Papert\u2019s work with children and Logo began to be talked about as \u201ccomputer cultures\u201d (Papert, 1980, pp. 22\u2013 23): Logo gave its practitioners a vocabulary, a framework, and a set of tools for a particular kind of learning through exploration. Papert envisaged a computer culture where children could express themselves as epistemologists, challenging the nature of established knowledge. But while Papert\u2019s ideas and the practice of Logo learning in classrooms contributed signi\ufb01cantly to the esprit de temps of the 1980s, it was dif\ufb01cult for many mainstream educational researchers and practitioners to adopt the mindset he believed would revolutionize learning.\n\nA large-scale research project to evaluate the claims of Logo in classrooms was undertaken by researcher Roy Pea (when he was at Bank Street College) and his colleagues in the mid-1980s. The Bank Street studies came to some critical conclusions about the work Papert and his colleagues were doing (Pea & Kurland, 1987 [1984]; Q14 Pea, Kurland, & Hawkins, 1987; Pea, 1987). Basically, the Bank Street studies concluded with a cautious note: they concluded that no signi\ufb01cant effects on cognitive development could be con\ufb01rmed, and called for much more extensive and rigorous research amid the excitement and hype. The wider effect of the Bank Street publications fed into something of a popular backlash against Logo in the schools. A 1984 article in the magazine, Popular Psychology summarized the Bank Street studies, and suggested bluntly that Logo had not delivered on Papert\u2019s promises.\n\nPapert responded to this critique (Papert, 1987 [1985]), arguing that the framing of research questions was overly simplistic. Papert chided his critics for looking for cognitive effects by isolating variables as if classrooms were \u201ctreatment\u201d studies. Rather than asking \u201ctechnocentric\u201d\nquestions like \u201cWhat is THE effect of THE computer?\u201d(p. 23), Papert called for an examination of the culturebuilding implications of Logo practice, and for something he called computer criticism, which he proposed as akin to literary criticism.\n\nPea and others responded (Pea, 1987b), claiming that Papert had unfairly characterized the Bank Street research (Papert had responded only to the Psychology Today article, not to the original literature), and arguing that as researchers they had a responsibility to adhere to accepted scienti\ufb01c methods for evaluating the claims of new technology. The effect of this exchange was to illuminate the vastly different perspectives of these researchers. Where Papert was talking about the open-ended promise of computer cultures, Pea and his colleagues, developmental psychologists, were evaluating the work from the standpoint of demonstrable changes in cognition (Pea & Kurland1987 [1984]). While Papert accused his critics of reductionism, Davy (1985) likened Papert to the proverbial man who looks for his keys under the streetlight \u201cbecause the light is better there.\u201d\n\nGavriel Salomon and Howard Gardner responded to this debate with an article that searched for middle ground (Salomon & Gardner, 1986): an analogy, they pointed out, could be drawn from research into television and mass media, a much older pursuit than educational computing, and one in which Salomon was an acclaimed scholar. Salomon and Gardner argued that one could not search for independent variables in such a complex area; instead, they called for a more holistic, exploratory research program, one that took more than the overt effects of the technology into account.\n\nIndeed, in 1991, Salomon and colleagues David Perkins and Tamar Globerson published a groundbreaking article that shed more light on the issue (Salomon et al., 1991). To consider the \u201ceffects of\u201d a technology, one had to consider what was changed after a learner had used a technology\u2014but in the absence of it. The questions that arise from this are whether there is any \u201ccognitive residue\u201d from the prior experience, and whether there is transfer between tasks. This is a different set of questions than arise from investigating the \u201ceffects with\u201d technology, which demand a more decentered, systemwide approach, looking at the learner in partnership with technology.\n\nWhile it contributed important new constructs and vocabulary to the issue, the Salomon, Perkins, and Globerson article is still deeply rooted in a traditional cognitive science perspective, like much of Pea\u2019s research, taking \ufb01rst the individual mind as the site of cognition. Salomon,\nPerkins, and Globerson, all trained in cognitive psychology, warn against taking the \u201ceffects with\u201d approach too far, noting that computers in education are still far from ubiquitous, and that the search for the \u201ceffects of\u201d is still key. From the perspective of today\u2019s ubiquitous computing technologies, which have taken the \u201ceffects with\u201d study of technology \u201cout of the lab,\u201d and into countless informal settings, a less rigid cognitive orientation is now the norm for understanding technology\u2019s diffuse, yet constitutive effects on human interaction and community building. The most visible example is the revolution in online social networks, online game play, and social\nmedia in general.\n\nIn a 1993 article, Pea responded to Salomon et al. (1991) from yet a different angle. Pea, now dean at Northwestern and working closely with his Learning Sciences colleagues, wrote on \u201cdistributed intelligence,\u201d and argued against taking the individual mind as the locus of cognition, criticizing Salomon and colleagues\u2019 individualist notions of cognitive residue:The language used by Salomon et al. (1991) to characterize the concepts involved in how they think about distributed intelligence is, by contrast, entity-oriented\u2014a language of containers holding things. (Pea 1993, p. 79) Pea, reviewing literature on situated learning by Brown et al. (1996 [1980]), Lave (1988), Wenger and Lave (1991), Greeno (1997) and by Winograd and Flores (1986), changed from the standard individualist framework of cognitive science to a more \u201csituative perspective\u201d while Salomon (1993) maintained that cognition must reside in the individual mind. Neither Salomon nor Pea in this exchange were comfortable with the notion of culture-making as a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d to mind, artifacts, and such empirically identi\ufb01able constructs. However, Pea\u2019s work on distributed cognition had a great impact on future studies on cognition in the context of emerging media technologies.\n\nThe question needs to be asked, are these advances made with the introduction of digital media technologies representative of a paradigm shift or are they merely a conversation among differing points of viewing, based on different measures and methods of studying the problem. Indeed, it seems that the proof is in the pudding. A cultural shift has occcured. The next step it to harness the scholarship to create a vision for seriously changing how learning can be re-created with more engagement and involvement with all the stakeholders. To be able to \ufb01nd the patterns in current research so that less time is spent in debates and more on reaching agreements.\n\nDevelopmental or Narrative Appoaches to Learning Theory?\n\nUnderstanding the nature of technology-based learning systems greatly depends on one\u2019s conceptualization of how learning occurs; is learning linear and developmental, or a more \ufb02uid and even random \u201csystem\u201d of making meaning of experience? Proponents of stage theory have tried to show how maturation takes place in logical causal sequences or stages according to observable stages in growth patterns\u2014the \ufb01nal stage being the highest and most coveted. Developmental theories, such as Freud\u2019s oral, anal and genital (Freud, 1952), Erikson\u2019s eight stages of psychological growth from basic trust to generativity (Erikson, 1950), or Piaget\u2019s stages from sensori-motor to formal operational thinking (see Grubner & Voneche, 1977), are based on the belief that the human organism must pass through these stages at critical periods in its development in order to reach full healthy integrated maturation, be it psychological, physical, spiritual, or intellectual. Strict adherence to developmentalism, particularly its unidirectional conception, has been signi\ufb01cantly challenged by Gilligan (1982), Gardner (1985), Fox Keller Q15 (1983), and Papert (1986), not to mention a wave of postmodern theorists\u2014proposing theories which address the fundamental issues underlying how we come to terms with understanding our thinking. One such challenge, raised\nby Ivan Illich and Barry Sanders (1984), re\ufb02ects on the Q16 prehistorical signi\ufb01cance of the narrative voice. Thinking about thinking as essentially evolving stages of development requires the kind of calibration only possible in a world of static rules and universal truths. They point out\nthat narrative thinking is rather a weaving of different layers or versions of stories that defy developmentalism.\n\nNarratives are never \ufb01xed in time or place. Before the written word and [p]rior to history...there is a narrative that unfolds, not in accordance with the rules of art and knowledge, but out of divine enthusiasm and deep emotion. Corresponding to this prior time is a different truth\u2014namely, myth. In this truly oral culture, before phonetic writing, there can be no words and therefore no text, no original, to which tradition can refer, no subject matter that can be passed on. A new rendering is never just a new version, but always a new song. (p. 4) Illich and Sanders contend that the prehistoric mode of thinking was a relativistic experience; that what was expressed at any given moment in time changed from the previous time it was expressed. There could be no \ufb01xed recall, nor \u201ctruth\u201d as we de\ufb01ne it today. This concept of knowledge as a continually changing truth, dependent on both communal interpretation and storytellers\u2019 innovation, dramatically changed with the introduction of writing.\n\nThe moment a story could be written down, it could be referred to. Memory changed from being an image of a former indivisible time to being a method of retrieving a \ufb01xed, repeatable piece or section of an experience. In other words, narrative intelligence is not acquired developmentally in stages, but rather, phenomenologically and emotionally, through experience. The development of prehistoric thinking (with image and imagination) through historical thinking (with writing and conceptual schemes) has also been called posthistorical thinking (Flusser, 2004).Q17 Beginning with photography and on through networked computing devices, new\nimage-based media, while born in conceptual thought, has enabled learners to tap into their \u201cimaginal capacity\u201d to re\ufb02ect on their own learning processes and rede\ufb01ne the world through multiple representations of knowledge, also changing the notion of a \ufb01xed truth.\n\nAnother notion to Illich and Sanders emerges in Carol Gilligan\u2019s research on gender and moral development (1982). Gilligan makes the case that the \u201cdifferent voice\u201d women bring includes an ethic of care, a tie between relationship and responsibility (1982, p. 173). Gilligan set the stage for a new mode of research, which includes intimacy and relationship rather than separation and objectivity, the tenets of traditional empiricism. Evelyn Fox Keller, a leading critic of the masculinization of science, heralded the relational model as a legitimate alternative for doing science. She pointed out that science is a deeply personal as well as a social activity (1985), historically preferential to a male and objectivist manner of thinking. Combining Thomas Kuhn\u2019s ideas about the nature of scienti\ufb01c thinking with Freud\u2019s analysis of the different relationship between young boys and their mothers and between girls and their mothers, Fox Keller analyzed underlying reasons for scienti\ufb01c objectivism. She claimed that boys are encouraged to separate from their mothers, and, girls to maintain attachments, in\ufb02uencing the manner in which the two genders relate to physical objects. The young boy, in competition with his father for his mother\u2019s attentions, learns to compete in order to succeed. Girls, not having to separate from their mothers, \ufb01nd that becoming personally involved\u2014getting a feeling for the organism, as Barbara McClintock (Fox Keller, 1985) would say\u2014is a preferred mode of making sense of their relationship with the physical world. Q18\n\nAs a result, girls may do science in a more connected style, seeking relationships with, rather than dissecting, what they investigate. Girls seek to understand meaning through these personal attachments. Just as science is not the purely cognitive endeavor we once thought it, neither is it as impersonal as we thought: science is a deeply personal as well as a social activity. (1985, p. 7) Obviously, we will never know if a scienti\ufb01c discipline would really be different if it had been driven by more relational or narrative in\ufb02uences. Yet we may want to ask how people with a tendency toward relational or narrative thinking can be both invited into the study of the sciences and be encouraged to contribute to its theoretical foundations. And, we may want to ask how new media and technologies expand how we study what we study, thereby inviting a range of epistemologically diverse thinkers into the mainstream of intellectual pursuits.\n\nBricolage and/or the Ecology of Digital Media\nTechnologies\n\nIn her \ufb01rst book, The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit (1984), Sherry Turkle explored the different styles of mastery that she observed in boys and girls in Logo classrooms. Returning to this topic, Turkle and Papert, in their 1991 article, \u201cEpistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete,\u201d outline two poles of technological mastery: hard and soft. Hard mastery, identi\ufb01ed with top-down, rationalist thinking, was observed in a majority of boys. Soft mastery, identi\ufb01ed with relational thinking and Claude Levi-Strauss\u2019s notion of \u00b4 bricolage, was observed in a majority of girls working with computers in a Boston elementary school (Turkle & Papert 1991, pp. 167\u2013168). The identi\ufb01cation of soft mastery and bricolage in programming was a turning point that led to a deeper examination of \u201cthe concrete,\u201d a subject woefully undervalued in contemporary life, and especially in math and science education.\n\nStanford scholar, Brigid Barron (2006) found that \u201clearners use strategies consistent with the bricoleur image described by Turkle, building on the concept introduced by Levi-Strauss [1966] where information is \ufb02exibly gathered and put together for new purposes.\u201d Barron revisited the role of the bricoleur to expand on what Nardi and O\u2019Day (1999) call information ecologies. Not only are information ecologies a product of both relational and material resources as Nardi and O\u2019Day suggest, but also, according to Barron, dynamic learning systems include a range of multiple in\ufb02uences that are dovetail well with understanding learning in formal and informal learning settings. She concludes with a call for changes.\n\nThe reports from the young learners shared...suggest that we should expect interest in learning to originate within and outside school and that adolescents have a signi\ufb01cant role to play in sustaining their own development. As researchers interested in human development, we are in a vital position to help envision what self-sustaining learning ecologies might look like and investigate how resourcefulness might be nurtured. (Barron, 2006, p. 221) Turkle and Papert\u2019s use the terms bricoleur and the notion of hard and soft to explain different approaches to computation, extends to other important domains: ecological stances, feminism, and ethnography of science and computation (1991, p. 372). They propose that hard and soft styles of creating knowledge and understanding systems as equally signi\ufb01cant to concrete thinking will gain respectability in the scienti\ufb01c community by attending more to the softer concrete way of thinking.\n\nThe development of a new computer culture would require more than technological progress and more than environments where there is permission to work with highly personal approaches. It would require a new and softer construction of the technological, with a new set of intellectual and emotional values more like those we apply to harpsichords than hammers. (Ibid, p. 184) Goldman-Segall offered a dynamic and \ufb02exible conceptualization of diversity of thinking called thinking attitudes (Goldman-Segall, 2008). These attitudes imply positionality and orientation, and are situated in time and place. She de\ufb01ned thinking attitudes as a transitional position held for a shorter period of time, one that is \ufb02uid and \ufb02exible (p. 245) This notion of thinking attitudes includes: meta/physical, historical, ethical, and pedagogical attitudes. Meta/physical attitudes address the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s the story?\u201d They explore how children address causality, intention, existence, and truth. The meta/physical attitudes in adolescents are turning points, referring to the worlds of invention and imagination\u2014attitudes that are rooted in the physical situatedness of their interactions with the world. Historical attitudes address how things began. They encompass learning from the past and making sense of it. Ethical attitudes include our actions in relation to desire and external norms. Balancing right and wrong is particularly challenging. These attitudes address questions such as: \u201cWhat is fair?\u201d To a great extent, pedagogical (or activist) attitudes overlap with ethical attitudes. Pedagogical attitudes are concerned with such questions as \u201cWhat can we do? How do we change? How do we teach others to learn from what we did?\u201d Video excerpts available on the web: www.pointsofviewing.com\n\nThis dynamic epistemological theory of learning led to ways of knowing that include gender\ufb02exing: boys may take on thinking attitudes that are traditionally associated with those of girls, and vice versa (Goldman-Segall, 1996b, 1998a. 1998c). The underlying theme here is the primacy of situated points of viewing, rather than essential qualities. Learners become ethnographers, observing and engaging with the cultural environments in which they participate. She also recommends knowledge framing (1998). Framing is rooted in several diverse but interwoven contexts: Frames\u2014in contrast to the more essentialist notion of styles\u2014include the context set by the framer, what is framed, as well as what is left out of the frame. In other words, for learning, it is more important to have \ufb02exible thinking attitudes about the content knowledge so that the frames that are applied to that cluster of knowledge are appropriate and useful in understanding the domain under investigation. Related uses of framing can be found in the work by Marvin Minsky\u2019s on arti\ufb01cial intelligence (1986), Howard Gardner on multiple intelligences (1985), Erving Goffman on everyday sociology (1986), and Trinh Minh T. Ha on cinematography (1992).\n\nDistributed Cognition and Situated Learning\n\nOver the next decade, the focus had changed from understanding the mind of one child to understanding the situated minds of learners in collaborative teams. Simultaneously, learning environment theories moved to social constructionism, to problem-based learning (PBL) environments spearheaded by Cindy Hmelo-Silver and Howard Barrows, (2006), as well as to rich-media cases of teaching practices. The 1989 article by John Seely Brown, Alan Collins, and Paul Duguid called \u201cSituated Cognition and the Culture of Learning\u201d (1996 [1989]) is generally credited with introducing the concepts and vocabulary of situated cognition to the educational community. This in\ufb02uential article, drawing on research at Xerox PARC and at the Institute for Research on Learning (IRL), expressed the authors\u2019 concern with the limits to which conceptual knowledge can be abstracted from the situations in which it is situated and learned (p. 19), as is common practice in classrooms. Building upon the experiential emphasis of pragmatist thinkers like John Dewey and on the social contexts of learning of Russian activity theorists like Vygotsky and Leontiev, Brown and his colleagues proposed the notion of cognitive apprenticeship. In a cognitive apprenticeship model, knowledge and learning are seen as situated in practice: \u201cSituations might be said to co-produce knowledge through activity. Learning and cognition, it is now possible to argue, are fundamentally situated\u201d (p. 20). This idea is carried forward to an examination of tools and the way in which they are learned and used:Learning how to use a tool involves far more than can be accounted for in any set of explicit rules. The occasions and conditions for use arise directly out of the context of activities of each community that uses the tool, framed by the way members of each community see the world. The community and its viewpoint, quite as much as the tool itself, determine how a tool is used. (Brown et al., p. 23)\n\nThe work that brings the situated perspective \ufb01rmly home to the learning environment is Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger\u2019s Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation (1991), which goes signi\ufb01cantly beyond Brown\u2019s cognitive apprenticeship model. Core to Lave and Wenger\u2019s work is the idea of knowledge as distributed or stretched across a community of practice\u2014what Salomon later called the \u201cradical situated perspective\u201d (Salomon, 1993).\n\nIn our view, learning is not merely situated in practice\u2014as if it were some independently rei\ufb01able process that just happened to be located somewhere; learning is an integral part of generative social practice in the lived-in world\u2026Legitimate peripheral participation is proposed as a descriptor of engagement in social practice that entails learning as an integral constituent. (Lave & Wenger, 1991, p. 35) This perspective \ufb02ips the argument over: it is not that learning happens best when it is situated (as if there were learning settings that aren\u2019t situated), but rather, learning is an integral part of all situated practice. So, rather than asking\u2014as Bransford and colleagues at Vanderbilt had\u2014\u201cHow can we create authentic learning situations?\u201d they ask \u201cWhat is the nature of communities of practice?\u201d and \u201cHow do newcomers and old-timers relate and interact within communities of practice?\u201d Lave and Wenger answer these questions through elaborating the nature of communities of practice in what they term legitimate peripheral participation.\n\nBy this we mean to draw attention to the point that learners inevitably participate in communities of practitioners and that mastery of knowledge and skill requires newcomers to move toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. (p. 29)\n\nLave and Wenger also elaborate on the involvement of cultural artifacts and technologies within communities of practice. As knowledge is stretched over a community of practice, it is also embodied in the material culture of that community, both in the mechanisms of practice and in the shared history of the community:Participation involving technology is especially signi\ufb01cant because the artifacts used within a cultural practice carry a substantial portion of that practices heritage \u2026Thus, understanding the technology of practice is more than learning to use tools; it is a way to connect with the history of the practice and to participate more directly in cultural life. (p. 101)\n\nArtifacts and technology are not just instrumental in embodying practice; they also help constitute the structure of the community. As Goldman-Segall, in her 1998 book, Points of Viewing Children\u2019s Thinking: A Digital Ethnographer\u2019s Journey, reminds us,The [tools we know have] are not just tools used by our culture; they are tools used for making culture. They are partners that have their own contribution to make with regard to how we build a cultural understanding of the world around us.... Readers of our socially constructed texts can either be silent lurkers or decide to make their presence known to us. Layers build. Patterns emerge, friendships or enmities grow, and digital inquiry becomes a re\ufb02exive practice\u2014with an emphasis on \ufb02exing, stretching, and strengthening our inquiry. (pp. 268\u2013269)\n\nSituated cognition, then, becomes perspectival knowledge, and the tools and artifacts we create become what Goldman coined \u201cperspectivity technologies\u201d: viewpoints, frames, lenses, and \ufb01lters; re\ufb02ections of selves with others. To understand the signi\ufb01cance of perspectivity in the role of learning, one has to turn to recent studies on the other side of the coin\u2014perception. This renewed interest in perceptually grounded research, or embodiment, encompasses the continually interacting parts of making meaning.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this chapter, the Points of Viewing Theory was applied to an already rich understanding of the use of computers, the Internet, and digital media. The range of possible contributors was so broad that we decided to focus only on those theories and tools that were directly connected with the notion of perspectival knowledge construction and perspectivity technologies. To those researchers whose work is not described in this chapter, we regret that we did not \ufb01nd the opportunity to include your work.\n\nPerspectivity technologies (Goldman, 2007) represent the next phase of thinking with our technology partners. Not only will we build them, shape them, and use them. They will also affect, in\ufb02uence, and shape us. They will become, if some researchers have their way, part of our bodies, not only augmenting our relationships but becoming members in their own right. As robotic objects become robotic subjects, we will have to consider how Steven Spielberg\u2019s robot in the movie AI felt when interacting with humans\u2014and hopefully we will be kinder to ourselves and to our robots. Thus, a perspectivity technology is not only a technology that enables us to better see each other\u2019s viewpoints and make decisions based on multiple points of viewing. It is also concerned with the creation and design of technologies that add perspectives. Technologies have built-in \ufb01lters. To explain this brie\ufb02y, one need only think of how recording an event with pen and paper, an audiotape recorder, and a digital video recorder each provide different perspectives of the same event. The technology provides an important \ufb01lter or lens. A viewpoint, one could say. And although that viewpoint is deeply in\ufb02uenced by who the \ufb01lmmaker is, or who the reporter is, there is a perspective that is contributed by the technology. A camera tells a different story than the audio or text tool.\n\nAs we use new media as communication devices, they affect how we communicate; they participate by being what they are, having a capacity to shape the story. Beyond the media is the message theme of Marshall McLuhan (1964), we are now deeply entrenched in a participatory relationship with our new media technologies because they have become part of our perspective, our consciousness, and our way of life. The level of interaction with our virtual creatures (technologies) transforms our relationships. We are never completely alone. We are connected through media devices even if we cannot see them. They see us.\n\nThat said, what has changed in learning? It might seem we have moved a long way from believing that learning is putting certain curriculum inside of students\u2019 heads and then testing them for how well they have learned that material. Yet, instructionism is still alive and well. From kindergarten to higher education, students are still being trained to be able to pass tests that will provide them with entrance into higher education. In spite of learning theories moving from behaviorism to cognitivism to distributed and situated cognition, educators are caught in the quagmire of preparing students for their future education instead of trying to make the present educational, engaging, and challenging fun. Teachers are caught in an entangled web of uncertainty as they scramble to learn the new tools of the trade (the Internet, distance learning environments, etc), learn the content they have to teach, and then organize the learning into modules that will \ufb01t into the next set of learning modules.\n\nThe irony is that when we think of who our best teachers were, they were the teachers who were able to elicit something within us and help us connect our lives to others\u2019 lives. Not a technology thing! The lives of poets, mathematicians, physicists, and the \ufb01sher down at the docks. These teachers created a sense of community in the classroom. We became part of a discovery process that had no end. Ideas came together that had not yet been put together\u2014at least in our own minds. We felt we invented something new. And indeed we and others\nwithin these learning environments did invent new ideas in our minds. Yet, people say that this cannot happen to most students in most classes and the best we can do is to teach the curriculum, provide a safe learning environment, and test people for what we wanted them to learn. This is not good enough. And if students do not become partners in their learning now, technologies will create islands of despair as more and more students stop learning how to be creative citizens interested in each other, in difference, and in understanding complexity. And technology could open up a gulf between people as well as lack of boundaries between work and play. In Sherry Turkle\u2019s book, Alone Together (2011) she explores these problematics of computer use reminding us about a serious problem facing a technologically seduced society. She argues that we are losing our sense of community, that being together in online environments, such as Facebook for example, can create more aloneness.\n\nConnectivity technologies once promised to give us more boundaries between work and leisure. But as the cell phone and smartphone eroded the bounndaries between work and leisure, all the time in the world was not enough. Even when we are not \u201cat work,\u201d we experience ourselves \u201con call\u201d; pressed, we want to edit out complexity and \u201ccut to the chase.\u201d (Turkle, 2001, p. 12) These comments have raised some online readers to \u201cpush-back,\u201d to use a common vernacular. In an online discussion, W\u0142odzimierz Sobkowiak, a professor of English philology at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland asks:Why should communities of necessity be \u201cconstituted by physical proximity only\u201d is beyond me, frankly, so I\u2019ll not even try to analyze this claim [by Turkle]...I can assure the reader that the shared concerns, real consequences, and common responsibilities\u2019 present in those environments are felt as not a bit less real than in the so-called Real Life. (Retrieved on August 15, 2011, from http://grou.ps/zajek/blogs/item/sherry-turkle-alonetogether)\n\nAlthough technologies have become many things for many people, they can be designed for the creative sharing of perspectives and viewpoints that lead to building better communities of practice in our schools and in our societies. Since the attack on the World Trade Center more than a decade ago on September 11, 2001, we have come to realize that the world is not what we thought it was. We know so little about each other. We know so little about the world. Our educational lenses have focused too long on educational goals that acted as blinders to the world around us. We thought we did not need to understand each other and out diverse perspectives on the world.\n\nThat one view of knowledge was enough. Yet, what we know and what we make is always a re\ufb02ection of our beliefs and assumptions about the world. We need to build new bridges in a socially constructed interconnected world where people have access to each other\u2019s customs, languages, and world views. And, we must rely on our technologies to build connections with peoples we do not know so that the gulf between us lessens. Perspectival knowledge, knowledge gleaned from being able to see others\u2019 perspectives, enables students, educators, and the public at large to take a second and third look at the many lenses which make up the human experience, even if from a distance. The purpose is not to always approve of what we see, but to learn how to put different worldviews into a new con\ufb01guration and uncover paths we might not yet see. And we might, if we are brave enough, respect students not only for what has been taught them after they have taken prescribed courses and completed assignments, but also respect them the moment they walk through the door\u2014or through the online portal as they engage in the formal or informal learning habitat.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAbrahamson, D., Trninic, D., Gutierrez, J.

WAYNE MANOR - SUNSET\n\nA beautiful, sprawling suburban estate at sunset.  Classic wrought-iron\ngates protect a winding driveway which snakes its way up through a\nneatly manicured lawn.\n\nINT. WAYNE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nALFRED PENNYWORTH, the Wayne family butler, fluffs up a cushion in the\nlarge, elegant living room.  A kind-looking man in his late forties\nwith dark moustache and hair, he epitomizes the proper British moor\ndomo, dressed in a morning coat and striped vest.\n\nAlfred turns, straightens up a pile of thick-looking papers on the\nliving room table.  He picks up the top one, looks at it critically,\nbut with satisfaction.\n\nINSERT SHOT - CAMPAIGN POSTER\n\nThe thick-looking papers are, in fact, political campaign posters.\nThey feature the face of a handsome, fortyish man, with the block\nlettered caption: DR. THOMAS WAYNE FOR CITY COUNCIL - A BETTER TOMORROW\nFOR GOTHAM.\nDR. WAYNE'S VOICE\nBruce?  Hurry up, son, we're going\nto be late.  Martha?\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nAlfred turns to look at DR. THOMAS WAYNE (the man on the poster) enters\nthe room.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nNow where's Martha?  Alfred, have\nyou seen Mrs. Wayne?\n\nALFRED\nI believe she was headed for Master\nBruce's laboratory. Sir.\n\nDr. Wayne checks his watch, exits, muttering.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nThat nymphomaniacal hamster of his\nmust have given birth again...\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\nDr. Wayne heads down the hallway towards a door.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nCome on, everybody, the movie starts\nin less than an hour.  Let's not\nkeep you next city councilman\nwaiting...\n\nINT. BRUCE'S LAB\n\nDr. Wayne opens the door.  The makeshift lab room has a large work\ntable crammed with beakers, test tubes, and other scientific equipment.\nBRUCE WYANE, aged ten, sits behind a microscope, peers down intently at\na specimen on a slide.  He does not look up as his father enters.\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(crossing)\nSon, whatever you're looking at\ncouldn't possible be as pretty as\nAudrey Hepburn, so...\n\nDr. Wayne puts his hand on Bruce's shoulder.  Incredibly enough - it\npasses right through it!  He recoils, shocked, reaches out to touch the\nbody's head.  His hand cuts right through the skull.  Giggling is\nHEARD, O.S.\n\nYoung Bruce stands behind the door with his mother, MARTHA, a beautiful\nwoman in her mid-thirties.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's called a \"holograph,\" dad.  Two\nInterconnecting laser beams...\n(pointing)\nThere and there.  Pretty neat, huh?\n\nDr. Wayne stares at the laser tubes, totally nonplussed.\n\nMARTHA\nWell, don't look at me.  My side\nof the family still can't figure out\nwhy it gets dark at night.  Ready to\ngo?\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(eyes narrowing)\nHow can I be sure you're the real\nthing?\n\nMartha kisses him warmly.  He looks back, impressed.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nSomewhat lifelike, I'll admit...\n\nMARTH\nThat's all?  Then hold on to your\nsocks, buster...\n\nShe kisses him again with passion.  Bruce turns away with the typical\nself-consciousness of a pre-adolescent.\n\nBRUCE\nOh, guy...\n\nHis parents break.  Dr. Wayne looks down at him.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nBruce, you may be the brightest ten\nyear old in Gotham City, or any-\nwhere else, for that matter.  But I\nfeel I ought to let you in on some-\nthing.\n(at Martha)\nThis - is definitely not a guy.\n\nINT. PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT\n\nA huge 35mm motion picture projector springs to life.\n\nINT. THEATER\n\nThe shifting colored rays of a projected film knife though the\nblackness of the theater.\n\nSCREEN VOICE\nSister, you make a beautiful nun.\n\nANGLE ON MOVIE SCREEN\n\nThe screen is filled by the face of AUDREY HEPBURN, dressed as a nun.\nWe are watched The Nun's Story, as are:\n\nANGLE ON WAYNE FAMILY IN SEATS\n\nDr. Wayne, Martha, and Bruce, who downs the remains of his box of Good\nand Plenty.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MOVIE THEATER & STREET - NIGHT\n\nRumblings of distant thunder echo through the night sky.  The Wayne\nfamily exits the theater, heads down a deserted street.  Suddenly - a\nflash of lightning.  A closer, louder clap of thunder.  Dr. Wayne takes\nMartha's arm.  Bruce straggles behind, staring at the pavement.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nI wish I hadn't parked so far away.\nWe're going to get soaked.\n\nMARTHA\n(over her shoulder)\nDo try and keep up, Bruce.  What on\nearth are you staring at, anyway?\n\nBRUCE\nThe cracks, Mom.  It's bad luck to\nstep on one.\n(does so)\nOh, darnit...\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nHold it, you people.  Freeze!\n\nA large man (JOE CHILL) partially hidden by shadows, points a gun at\nthem.  He stands in the sunken entrance to a deserted brownstone house,\ngestures with his weapon.\n\nCHILL\nGet down in here.  Now.\n\nMARTHA\n(terrified)\nThomas...\n\nDR. WAYNE\nYou're welcome to our money.  Any-\nthing we have.  Okay?\n\nChill stares coldly.  Dr. Wayne pulls out his money, takes off his\nwatch.  Martha and Bruce watch, petrified.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nHere...just be careful with that\ngun, will you?  It could go off...\n\nCHILL\nYou know something, Doc?  You're\nright.\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(expression changing)\nDoc?  How did you know I was a...\n\nThere is a deafening roar as Chill fires the gun, lifting Dr. Wayne off\nhis feet, hurling him backwards.\n\nBRUCE\nDaddy!!\n\nMartha screams.  A bolt of lightning flashes.  Chill turns.\n\nCHILL\nLet's have that necklace, lady...\n\nMARTHA\nOh, my God!\n\nMartha tries to escape but is jerked back by Chill's hand as it closes\non her necklace.  Bruce runs at Chill, grabs him by the leg, tries to\npull him down.\n\nBRUCE\nLeave my mommy alone!  Mommy!\nMommy!\n\nChill fires again!  The necklace snaps free as Martha is jerked\nbackwards, then crumples next to her husband.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nHe kneels over his mother's body, pauses in shock, then looks up: the\nbarrel of Chill's gun comes into frame.\n\nCLOSE ON CHILL\n\nThe necklace in one hand, his gun in the other.  He looks down at\nBruce, his expression suddenly changing.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHe stares at Chill, his jaw inadvertently twitching with rage.  A LOUD\nCLAP OF THUNDER rolls across the sky.  Bruce's eyes have become steel,\nvisible fury shooting forth from them in an almost demonic fashion.\n\nChill's gun hand suddenly starts to tremble.  Incredibly, the savage\nface of this young boy has unnerved him.\n\nCHILL\nStop...lookin' at me like that, kid...\n(no response)\nStop looking at me like that!\n\nSuddenly - A FLASH OF LIGHTNING!  Rain begins to fall in sheets.\nChill, runs up to the street, disappears into the rain-swept darkness.\n\nANGLE ON APARTMENT BUILDING\n\nLIGHTS have flicked on in the apartment building across the street.\nFACELESS WITNESSES stand silhouetted in the windows, gazing down at the\ntragedy across the street.\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN on one particular window.  A SHADOWY FIGURE half-\nemerges from the darkness, his face still hidden from us.  All that is\nvisible is an oversized pair of striped pants and a large white daisy\nstuck through the coat lapel.  The Shadowy Figure pauses, then reaches\nout an arm and slowly lowers the window shade.\n\nFrom behind the shade - an insane, maniacal giggle starts to rise.\nTiny at first, but gradually building to a sudden explosion of\ncascading, frightening glee!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nKneeling in the rain across the street, paralyzed with shock and grief.\nHe looks up from the bodies of his parents as a COUPLE approaches along\nthe pavement above.\n\nBRUCE'S VOICE\nHelp...oh, please help me...\n\nThe couple stop, stare down at the scene.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's...my mom and dad.  Please...I\nthink they're dead.\n\nThe couple exchange a quick, horrified glance, then hurry off down the\nstreet.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nSobbing uncontrollably now, tears mixing with the rain.  In the\ndistance: the low whine of an approaching siren.  CAMERA RISES into the\nnight sky:\n\nA FLASHING BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS ACROSS THE SCREEN: the residue\nremains in the night sky - a searing yellow dot.  ANOTHER BOLT OF\nLIGHTNING - another yellow dot.  Then a deafening clap of thunder as\nthe gray-black clouds arrange themselves into a dark and eerie\nsilhouette.  The siren grows louder, piercing shrilly through the\nrumblings of the storm.  The SILHOUETTE becomes more familiar now, as\nthe billowing clouds form themselves into a dark cape.  The dots of\nlightning begin to pulsate as they evolve into two searing yellow eyes.\n\nThis then, is the signal of the future presence of the Dark Redeemer of\nthe Night.  The Black Wraith.  The Avenger of Countless Wrongs...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t THE BATMAN\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE\nTHROUGH TO:\n\nEXT. HILLSIDE CEMETERY NEAR GOTHAM - DAY\n\nA beautiful rolling hill overlooking Gotham City.  As CAMERA TRACKS\nthrough the trees, tombstones begin to appear.  We are in the middle of\nan immaculate pastoral graveyard.  Down below in the distance an\nendless line of black limousines snakes its way up a winding road.\nCAMERA CONTINUES TO TRACK, finally HOLDING ON:\n\nThe unfilled graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne.  Dark-suited FUNERAL\nATTENDANTS wait silently by the caskets.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM CITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT\n\nA hot sun showers a blazing glow on the throbbing metropolis of Gotham\nCity, choked with cars, buses, PEDESTRIANS, and the attendant\npollution.  A great American city going through the routine\nperformances of its daily mundane chores.\n\nEXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on an oversized pair of striped pants standing in front of\na corner newsstand.\n\nVOICE\nA copy of the Trib, please.\n\nCLOSE ON GOTHAM TRIBUNE\n\nAn edition of the Gotham Tribune is handed over.  The headlines scream:\nDR. & MRS. THOMAS WAYNE GUNNED DOWN IN SENSELESS ROBBERY/KILLING.\n\"Political hopeful was well ahead in latest polls.\"\n\nAn insane giggle rises, O.S.  CAMERA PANS UP from the front page to the\nhorrified face of a NEWS VENDOR, staring in disbelief at the person\nreading the Tribune.\n\nCLOSE ON JOKER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nWe see the hideous face of THE JOKER.  A revolting perversion of a\nhuman being with a chalk-white complexion, ruby red lips, and a\nstartling shock of green hair.  He continues to giggle as he reads.  A\nCONFEDERATE stands behind.  The Vendor continues to stare as The Joker\nsuddenly notices.\n\nJOKER\nSomething wrong?\n\nVENDOR\nYour...face.  It's...\n\nJOKER\nFamiliar?  Maybe we met in Toledo.\n\nVENDOR\nI never been to Toledo.\n\nJOKER\nNeither have I.  Must have been two\nother guys.\n(taking one out)\nHave a cigar?\n\nVENDOR\nGee, thanks.\n\nThe Vendor takes the cigar, lights it.  The Joker and his Confederate\nmove off down the street.\n\nJOKER\nWant to hear a good one?  What's\nblack and white and dead all over?\n\nCONFEDERATE\nA newspaper, Boss, but ain't it\nblack and white and read all over?\n\nSuddenly - there is a tremendous explosion!\n\nANGLE ON CORNER NEWSSTAND\n\nThe corner newsstand has virtually disappeared.  Thousands of pages\ndrift down through the air into the debris.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nNo...\n\nEXT. HILLSIDE CEMETERY - DAY\n\nThe procession of limousines has started back down the hill from the\nfuneral.  Alfred stands alone by a black Rolls Royce, looks off sadly\nas:\n\nYoung Bruce Wayne gently places a flower on each of his parent's\ngraves, then turns.  His eyes are glassed over, but tears do not fall.\nHe crosses to Alfred who puts a protective arm around him.\n\nALFRED\nIt's unfair, of course.  But some-\ntimes, Master Bruce, one simply has\nto...accept conditions as they are,\nand...make the best of them.\n\nBRUCE\n(softly)\nWhy?\n\nALFRED\nWhy?  Why, because...\n(nice smile)\nI don't know, really.\n\nBRUCE\n(deadly)\nNeither do I.\n\nAlfred helps the boy into the car.  The Rolls Royce heads back down the\nhill toward Gotham City.\n\nINT. THORNE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\nTelephones RING!  Typewriters CLACK!  A campaign poster features the\nface of RUPERT THORNE, an earnest-looking man with a granite-hard face.\nUnderneath is a logo: Rupert Thorne: He'll make our streets safe\nagain.\"\n\nThe headquarters is a beehive of activity.  AIDES rush back and forth\nas a door marked Private bursts open and Thorne appears.  Hr grins with\nan oily manner.\n\nTHORNE\n(to AIDE)\nAre they all out there?\n\nAIDE\nWe're waiting for The Evening\nSentinel, Mr. Thorne...\n\nTHORNE\nScrew The Sentinel.  I gotta make\nThe six o'clock news.\n(adjusts his tie)\nWhat's the name of Wayne's kid?\n\nAIDE\nBruce.\n\nThorne nods, heads for the door, mumbling to himself.\n\nTHORNE\nOur hearts go out to the Wayne\nFamily, particularly their young\nSon, Bruce...Bruce...Bruce...\n\nEXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\nA throng of REPORTERS and TV remote units snap to attention as Thorne\nappears on the steps of his campaign headquarters.  He silences a\ncacophony of overlapping questions with upraised hands, terminally\nsincere.\n\nTHORNE\nI didn't want to win like this.  Not\nthrough tragedy.  But it's cruelly\nironic...\n\nEXT. GOTHAM - DAY\n\nA more downbeat section of Gotham's business district.  CAMERA CLOSES\non a specific building: The Monarch Playing Card Company.  THORNE'S\nVOICE CONTINUES OVER:\n\nTHORNE'S VOICE\n...that a good man like Thomas Wayne\nwho spoke up so forcefully for the\nrights of criminals should himself\nbecome the ultimate victim.\n\nINT. JOKER'S LAIR - DAY\n\nA huge room, garishly decorated in a clown motif.  The wallpaper is one\ncontiguous deck of cards.  There are harlequin chairs, jesters, and\nopen Jack-In-The-Box, etc.\n\nA MAN sits in a chair at the end of the room, facing away from CAMERA.\nHe watches Thorne on a TV set.\n\nTHORNE\n(from TV)\nBut his murderer will be caught and\nexecuted, I promise you!  It's time\nthe scum of our society see that we\nmean to have law and order on the\nstreets of Gotham City!\n\nSuddenly - the set goes mute.  The Man in the chair swivels around\nslowly: It is JOE CHILL!\n\nThe Joker stands at the entrance to the room, lowers a remote control\nbox.  He grins at Chill.  Chill stares back nervously, clearly\nfrightened by The Joker's maniacal presence.\n\nCHILL\nI was...headed for the airport.\nThey said you wanted to see me.\nSomething...wrong?\n\nJOKER\nWrong?  I thought we'd celebrate.  I\nthought you'd like to join me in a\ndrink.\n\nCHILL\n(visibly relieved)\nWhy not...\n\nThe Joker leads him to a table, suddenly glowers darkly.\n\nJOKER\nYou know, I'm disappointed in you,\nJoe.  Very disappointed.\n\nCHILL\n(swallowing)\nYou...are?\n\nJOKER\nI said, \"Would you like to join me\nin a drink.\"  Then you're supposed\nto say, \"Sure there'll be room\nenough for both of us?\"\n(giggle)\nGet it?\n(louder giggle)\n\"Room enough...\"\n\nCHILL\nYeah...sure...I get it now...\n\nJOKER\nYou're a quick study, Joe.\n\nThe Joker claps him on the back as they sit at the table.  The\nConfederate enters with two glasses on a tray.  One contains a clear\nliquid.  The other - a bilious, thick yellow concoction.  The Joker\nedges it across the table toward Chill who eyes it suspiciously.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nDrink up.\n\nChill examines the yellow liquid, wary.\n\nCHILL\nHow come...you ain't drinkin' this...\n\nJOKER\nGood question.  I like lemonade...\n\nHe takes it from Chill, hands him the clear liquid.  They both down\ntheir drinks.  The Joker giggles insanely.\n\nCHILL\nWhat's...so funny...?\n\nJOKER\nMan walks into a doctor's office,\nsays, \"Are you the doctor's nurse?\"\nshe says, \"Yes.\"  He says, \"Oh, is\nthe doctor sick?\"\n\nThe Joker slams the table in glee, out of control.\n\nCHILL\nNo offense, Joker, but that's not\nvery...\n\nChill stops.  The corners of his mouth twitch, then rise involuntarily.\nHe snickers.  Again.  Starts to giggle.  The Joker's eyes narrow.  His\nsmile becomes cruel.\n\nJOKER\nThe doctor says, \"I can sure you.  The\ndisease is hereditary.\"  The patient\nsays, \"Then send the bill to my father.\"\n\nChill instantly explodes with laughter!\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nHe says, \"Help me, Doctor, I've got\namnesia.\"  Doctor says, \"How long\nhave you had it?\"  He says, \"How\nlong have I had what?\"\n\nChill is on his feet now, convulsed in glee.  He sinks to his knees,\nout of control, then collapses on the floor.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nAnd this one will kill you!  I just got\nback from a pleasure trip.  I drove my\nmother-in-law to the airport...\n\nCLOSE ON CHILL\n\nDead.  His mouth frozen in a grotesque grin.

He\ngazes at the impressive array.\n\nALFRED\nOne hardly knows where to begin.\n\nBRUCE\nThose rings seem simple enough.\n\nBruce crosses to the rings, leaps, catches hold, tries to hoist himself\nup.

He tries again, then drops to the floor in a\nheap.\n\nALFRED\nPerhaps if we lowered them.\n\nBRUCE\n(grim stare)\nIf you'll excuse me now, Alfred.\nI'll see you at dinner.\n\nALFRED\nYes, Sir.\n\nAlfred leaves, closing the door.  Bruce turns, glares up at the rings\nlike deadly enemies.  He jumps again, catches hold, starts to hoist\nhimself up, straining with the effort.  The veins standing out on his\nforehead.  Slowly, painfully, he begins to inch himself higher and\nhigher.\n\nINT KARATE STUDIO - DAY\n\nBruce is dressed in a martial arts outfit, tensely faces a thick pine\nboard being held by a Japanese INSTRUCTOR.\n\nINSTRUCTOR\n...but you must believe, really\nbelieve you can do it.

Bruce drops to one knee, this time\nalmost catching it as the steel tip rips away a piece of the heavy\npadding on his hand.\n\nCLOSE ON ALFRED AT WINDOW\n\nAlfred watches from a window, shaking his head, appalled, now returns\nto his housekeeping.\n\nINT. EXERCISE ROOM - DAY\n\nBruce is on the rings again.  By now using them with considerable\nexpertise, swinging his body in somersaults, then performing the\ndifficult \"Iron Cross\" maneuver.  He pauses at full extension, then\nswings back, launches himself towards the parallel bars.\n\nCatching the bars expertly, he performs a complicated routine, pausing\nat the top to look across the room:\n\nA thin balance beam sits below, ten feet away.\n\nBruce swings back one more time on the upper parallel bar, then flies\nthrough the air for the beam!  His feet land on top for one split,\ntenuous second.  He teeters - then crashes heavily to the floor.\nShaking his head to clear the cobwebs, he stares back at the beam,\ndetermined.\n\nEXT.

He flips one over his head, flips the other\nwhile simultaneously spinning around to face the Instructor who closes\nranks from behind.\n\nThe fight is furiously expert - hands and feet working like windmills.\nBruce is parrying every thrust the\nInstructor has to offer, countering every move, but is nonetheless\nbeing backed into a corner.\n\nThe Instructor moves in for the kill as Bruce suddenly vaults up and\nover him in a seven-foot backflip!  Grabbing the man's black belt from\nbehind for leverage, he hoists the Instructor over his head, then sends\nthe bewildered man flying through the air, crashing onto the mat in a\nheap.\n\nBruce looks over, suddenly concerned.  He holds the Instructor's black\nbelt in his hands.  The Instructor is half-dazed, in some pain.  His\neyes suddenly pop open - he grins broadly back at Bruce.\n\nINSTRUCTOR\nThat's okay.  Keep it.\n\nINT. BALLET STUDIO - DAY\n\nA line of beautiful young would-be BALLERINAS perform the various\npositions at the bar in a dance studio to the musical strains of Swan\nLake.

With that in\nmind, I suggest you accept the lad's\n\"lucky guesses\" as instructions.\n\nBRUCE\nLet's hold on to our oil stocks for\nnow.  I see a chance of gasoline\nprices rising to sixty, even seventy\ncents a gallon.\n\nBROKER\n(tolerant smile)\nWhy not a dollar?\n\nBRUCE\nAnd I'd like to transfer our mutual\nfunds into the development of the\ncomputer chip.

EXERCISE ROOM - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS past the balancing beam, parallel bars, and exercise rings\nto Bruce, who faces them confidently, but this time with a big\ndifference - HE IS BLINDFOLDED.  He takes a tentative step forward,\ngauging his distance, then leaps up into the air - grabbing the rings\nwith perfect accuracy!  He performs a series of difficult routines with\nclockwork precision, then swings through the air to the parallel bars,\nlatching on to the lower one, then propelling himself up to the higher\none.  His gyrations become faster, gaining speed and momentum.\nSuddenly - he launches himself toward the balance beam!\n\nBruce lands on the end of the beam like a cat - keeping his balance,\nhaving calculated the exact distance to the inch.  He steps forward\nwith total security, travels the length of the beam with the ease of a\npedestrian.  Reaching the end, he does a complete forward somersault,\nlands solidly on his feet.

YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - NIGHT\n\nSeen through dim half-light:  his childhood lab is coated with dust - a\nroom obviously left unused for years.  We hear A KEY TURNING IN THE\nLOCK.  The door to the lab swings open.  Bruce trains a flashlight on\nthe interior of the musty room.  He enters, finds a light switch, flips\nit on.\n\nThe lab table is much as we remember it, crammed with old test tubes,\nbeakers, etc.  Bruce crosses, stares down, lost in his past, then\nswitches on the holograph machine.  He stares - stunned and amazed as:\n\nTHE HOLOGRAPH FIGURE OF TEN-YEAR-OLD BRUCE WAYNE SPRINGS TO LIFE!  An\nexact visual reproduction of the Child who used to be.  The Young Boy\npeers down through a cobwebbed microscope in precisely the position we\nfirst saw him.\n\nBruce's eyes fill with tears - he shuts them tightly as he hears a\nVOICE from long ago.\n\nYOUNG BRUCE'S VOICE\nIt's called a holograph, Dad.\nPretty neat, huh?\n\nOne laser beam suddenly shorts out with age:  the image of Young Bruce\ndisappears.  The second beam continues to burn, its energy directed at\na disintegrating basement wall.\n\nBruce slumps at the other side of the table, oblivious, his face buried\nin his hands.\n\nOVERLAPPING IMAGES AND VOICE START TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.\n\nMartha Wayne\t\t\t   - giggling with Young Bruce, then kissing\nher husband passionately.\n\nDR. WAYNE'S VOICE\nThis - is definitely not a guy.\n\nThomas Wayne\t\t\t  - his face twisted in anguish as Chill's\nbullet blows.\n\nMARTHA'S VOICE\nOh, my God!  No!!\n\nA SHARP CRACK!\t    - As a piece of something crumbles away.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nLooking up.  Staring across the room:\n\nThe remaining laser beam has eaten away a piece of the basement wall -\nthere is a dull ECHOING THUD as the plaster hits the bottom of some\nunseen cavernous space below.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nRising.  Crossing curiously to the hole in the wall.  Training his\nflashlight torch through it.\n\nANGLE DOWN HOLE - HIS P.O.V.\n\nAN IMMENSE CAVERN trails down and away into the blackness.  A network\nof aged timbers intersect themselves, shoring up the side of the\nfoundation.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring.  Playing his flashlight against the visible parts of the\nunderground cavity.  He picks up a beaker from the lab table, then lets\nit fall through the hole.  There is an interminable wait.  Finally -\nthe impact of SHATTERING GLASS.\n\nANGLE BACK THROUGH HOLE\n\nSeen from inside:  the torch beam shines.  Suddenly - a long length of\nrope is tossed through.  Bruce appears in the opening.  He wriggles\nthrough, hanging on to the rope.\n\nBruce expertly shimmies down the rope, a man completely at home in an\naction he knows well.  The beam from the torch dances across the walls\nof the cavern:  high-ribbed, jagged walls, suggesting some sort of\nlabyrinth beyond.  The rope has played out.  Bruce hangs by the end,\nlooks down, lets himself fall to the cavern floor below.\n\nHe rises, plays the torch against the sides of the cave.\n\nANGLE ON BEAM - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe beam searches into crannies, exploring dark gray walls.  It comes\nacross a large patch of solid black.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nLooking curiously.\n\nBACK TO BLACK PATCH\n\nAs the beam hits the black patch fully - dozens of yellow eyes appear.\nThe entire mass LAUNCHES ITSELF INTO CAMERA with a terrifying screech\nand the sound of beating wings.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHis jaw drops, stunned, as THE COLONY OF BATS swarm over him!  He\nstumbles, protecting his face.  The torch drops to the floor.  Its\nshaft of light dances crazily around the cavern.\n\nFrom O.S. - a low moan is heard from Bruce.  It rises, gathers in\nvolume and intensity, gradually becoming a deep, booming guttural roar\n- at once a scream of total pain and a cry of defiance.  The terrified\nbats scream back in a maze of hot and cold light bouncing off beating\nblack wings.\n\nINT. ALFRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe wind and rain batter against Alfred's partially open bedroom\nwindow.  Mixed with the sounds - a strong echo of the roar from the\ncavern.  Alfred's eyes pop open.  He rises groggily, makes his way to\nthe window, closes it.  CAMERA HOLDS on window, PANS UP to the moon.\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nEXT. CEMETERY - CLOSE ON MOON - NIGHT\n\nA FLASHING LIGHTNING BOLT:  CAMERA PANS DOWN from the moon through the\nraging storm to the graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne in the country\ncemetery, high on the hill.\n\nKneeling between them is Bruce - fists clenched, head bowed, tiny\nrivulets of water running off his face and body - totally lost in\nsilent prayer.\n\nBRUCE'S VOICE\nI've worked hard to make you proud of\nme.  To become the kind of person\nwhose presence could make a difference\nin the world.  But one man can only do\nonly so much, Father.  Mother, to-\nnight I saw the sign I thought would\nnever come.  Now - for the first time\nI realize I must...be...more...than\na man.\n\nA FLASHING LIGHTNING BOLT WIPES THE SCREEN!\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT\n\nThe remaining gossamer wisp of a transparent cloud pulls away from a\nglowing FULL MOON over Gotham City.\n\nINT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\nAn express train roars through a seedy subway station.\n\nINT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT\n\nA well-scrubbed TEENAGE COUPLE sit together holding hands.  The BOY is\ndressed in a dinner jacket, the GIRL is a chiffon party dress with a\nprominent orchid corsage pinned to it.  They exchange a nervous glance,\nlooking across the car at:\n\nA TOUGH-LOOKING THUG who sits opposite them, his muscular arms bulging\nthrough a torn windbreaker.  He grins across at the nervous Teenagers\nmenacingly, exposing yellow teeth, then sneaks a sideways look at:  A\nTHICKLY-BUILT TRUCKDRIVER-TYPE who stares straight ahead.\n\nThese are the only four people in the car.\n\nThe subway slows for the next stop.  The Truckdriver-Type rises\ndisinterestedly, crosses the car, looks down at the Teenagers who are\nnone too happy with his departure.\n\nTRUCKDRIVER-TYPE\nHave a nice time at the prom, kids?\n\nBOY\nYes, thank you, Sir.\n\nThe subway doors hiss open.  The Truckdriver-Type smiles and exits.\nThe Teenagers looks across the car worried.\n\nThe car pulls out of the station.  The Thug rises, crosses the car,\ngrabs hold of a vertical pole to steady himself, smirks down at the\nTeenagers.\n\nTHUG\nYou smell good enough to eat, Sweet-\nheart.\n\nBOY\n(nervous bravado)\nIf you've got something to say,\nMister, talk to me, okay?\n\nTHUG\nI was talking to you - Sweetheart.\n\nA knife drops out of the Thug's sleeve into his hand, its razor-sharp\nblade glinting in the light.  The Teenagers freeze with terror.\n\nTHUG (CONT'D)\nMaybe it's that flower that smells\nso good.\n\nThe Thug plucks the corsage off the trembling Girl's bodice, holds it\nup to his nose, inhales deeply, shaking his head.\n\nTHUG (CONT'D)\nNope.  Still can't place it.\n\nVOICE\nFunny.  I can smell you from way\nover here.\n\nThe Thug wheels, stares off at the end of the car, his jaw dropping\nopen.  The Teenagers' eyes bulge in disbelief.\n\nCLOSE ON CHEST\n\nA golden circle with the black figure of a bat sits in the middle of a\nsteel-gray skin-tight fabric stretched across a massively muscled\nchest.\n\nVOICE\nGive the lady back her flower.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Thug looks his unseen adversary up and down cautiously, unsure of\nwhether to laugh or obey.\n\nTHUG\nOkay...sure.  Just wanted to have a\nlittle fun.  I...\n\nWith a sudden lightning move he flips the switchblade in his hand,\nsending it whizzing in the direction of the Voice.\n\nCLOSE ON KNIFE\n\nThe knife whistles through the air TOWARD CAMERA.  Suddenly a black-\ngloved hand miraculously snatches it out of mid-air, spinning it, then\nsends it flying back!\nThe switchblade pierces the corsage, jerking it out of the Thug's hand,\nsticking it into the wall where it quivers behind him.  The Thug\nfreezes, turning white.\n\nVOICE\nNow then.  I think you said you\nwanted to have a little fun.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\nThe express wheezes to a stop at the next station.  A MIDDLE-AGED\nCOUPLE waits for the doors to open, then enter the car.  They suddenly\nstop, staring in amazement:\n\nThe Thug stands spread-eagled in the middle of the car, both wrists\ncuffed to overhanging metal handholds.  The center vertical pole\ndisappears up one pants leg, finally reappearing out of the collar of\nhis shirt.\n\nThe teenage Boy passes the amazed Couple, confidently dusting his\nhands.  He reaches back for the Girl who sniffs her corsage, then\nfollows him out of the car.\n\nEXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nGotham Police Headquarters.  CAMERA TRACKS PAST cubicles and offices,\nCLACKING, RINGING, DETECTIVES interrogating SUSPECTS, etc., catching up\nwith DAVID GORDON, the Commissioner of Police, a gruff-looking man in\nhis middle fifties who pauses to light a cheap cigarette.\n\nHeading toward him from the other direction:  SERGEANT HALEY, a smooth-\nfaced kissass in his thirties.\n\nGORDON\nWhat's up Haley?\n\nHALEY\nPretty slow, Commissioner.  Half a\ndozen muggings, some kids on PCP,\nand...oh, yeah.  Looks like we got a\ntransvestite prowling the southside\nsubway system.\n\nGORDON\nFull moon tonight.  Pervo heaven.\n\nGordon walks through his office door, Haley following.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThe extremely cluttered office of an immensely overworked civil\nservant.\n\nHALEY\nFrom his description, this guy could\nmake it as a float in the Rose\nParade.  Big black cape, black\nboots, black hood over his head...\n\nA squawk box intercom crackles on Gordon's desk.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nHostage situation, Commissioner.\nMan holding two women near 3rd and\nGrand.  SWAT's on the way.\n\nHALEY\n...and get this - a big yellow moon\non his chest with a cockamamy bat in\nthe middle.\n\nGORDON\n(into intercom)\nGet my car.  I'm going down there.\n\nHALEY\nFunny thing is, the guy takes on\nthis big goon with a knife...\n\nGORDON\n(chomping cigar)\nYou come along too, Haley.  I may need\nto swap someone for those women.\n\nEXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY & STREET - NIGHT\n\nPolice cars barricade a major avenue, their spotlights trained on a\ndead-end alley.  A SWAT LIEUTENANT speaks through a mike.\n\nSWAT LT.\nCome on out of there, Wells!  Come\nout of we're coming in after you!\n\nWELLS' VOICE\nI got hostages!  You get one minute\nto clear out or I blow'em away!\n\nFrom behind:  Commissioner Gordon's car screeches to a stop.  Gordon\npiles out, followed by Haley.\n\nGORDON\nHow bad is it, Lieutenant?\n\nSWAT LT.\nWe're screwed, Sir.  That's a dead-\nend alley in there.  No way to get\nbehind him.\n\nEXT. DEAD-END ALLEY\n\nA pockmarked thug (WELLS) holds one YOUNG WOMAN roughly, trains his gun\non ANOTHER.  He squints out into the light.\n\nWELLS\nThirty seconds, Pig!  Then I spill\none lady's brains on the street!\nTwenty-five...\n\nCAMERA PANS DOWN to the pavement behind Wells.\n\nWELLS (V.O.)

Please!\n\nWells cocks the gun, sticks it at her head.\n\nWELLS\nFive!  Four!...\n\nVOICE\nThree...two...one...\n\nWells spins in astonishment:\n\nAn ominous hulking shadow looms in the darkness behind him.  TWO\nPULSATING YELLOW EYES pierce through the blackness.\n\nVOICE\nI just counted you out, Wells.\n\nWells fires!  The Shadow swings the manhole cover up as the bullet\nricochets off it harmlessly.  Wells prepares to fire again.  The\nmanhole cover suddenly explodes out of the darkness!  One swing of a\nmassively muscled arm - one sickening \"clang\" - and it's over.\n\nANGLE ON STREET\n\nSWAT LT.\nLet's go!\n\nThe Police rush toward the alley, Gordon and Haley bringing up the\nrear, as the two Women emerge.\n\nWOMAN\nWOMAN #2\nHe saved us!  A giant black\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   Eight\nfee tall!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   monster from the\nsewers!\n\nThe Police storm into the alley as Gordon and Haley comfort the panting\nWomen.\n\nWOMAN\nWOMAN #3\t\t\t\t\t    He had black wings...\nAnd...and yellow eyes...\n\nGORDON\nWell, of course he did...You can\nboth calm down now, ladies.

Haley cocks his head\nquestioningly at Gordon as they proceed into the alley.\n\nGORDON\nForget it.  That airhead from the\nsubway could never have made it to\nthe north side of town this fast.\n\nHALEY\nMaybe there's more than one of them.\nMaybe we're dealing with some sort\nof secret society of cross-dressers.\n\nWells is led past them, still groggy, as they arrive at the open\nmanhole and peer down into the forbidding blackness.\n\nGORDON\nGet after him, Haley.\n\nHALEY\n(gulping)\nMe, Sir?\n\nGORDON\nWell, you're the only one with an\naccurate description!\n\nHaley reluctantly lowers himself into the open manhole as Gordon turns,\nyells down the alleyway.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nComb the area!  I want every squad\ncar available!  We're looking for\nthe mother of all psychos in a party\ncostume!\n\nGordon turns back, looks down into the empty manhole where Haley has\nnow disappeared.\n\nHALEY'S VOICE\n(from manhole)\nYou don't think he...bites, do you,\nSir?\n\nEXT. GOTHAM APARTMENT HOUSE - HIGH SHOT - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA LOOKS DOWN from the roof of a Gotham skyscraper at the windows\nof a forty-story apartment house below.\n\nCAMERA HOLDS on a pair of glass doors leading out to a rosetta-carved\nstone balcony.  Clearly visible through the doors:  AN ELDERLY COUPLE\nlie face down on the floor of their living room, guarded by a masked\nBURGLAR holding a shotgun.  ANOTHER BURGLAR has managed to open a wall\nsafe and begins stuffing valuables into a gunny sack.\n\nCAMERA ZOOMS BACK!\n\nWe are some thirty stories higher across a wide avenue.\n\nA black-gloved hand ENTERS FRAME, holding a thin, clear nylon cord with\na tiny barbed fishhook on the end.\n\nThe other gloved hand steadies a gleaming titanium rifle barrel with an\ninfrared scope.  The fishhook is threaded through the chamber.\n\nA flap is opened in a thick, compartmentalized black belt.  The\nmoonlight glints off a cylindrical silver gas cartridge.\n\nANGLE ACROSS STREET THROUGH SCOPE\n\nSeen through the magnified infrared scope:  the cross hairs of the\nrifle sight settle in on the head of the Burglar holding the shotgun.\n\nThe cross hairs pause - then suddenly lower to the balcony.  The rifle\nFIRES with an audible \"hiss\" of compressed gas.\n\nANGLE ON ROSETTA BALCONY\n\nAs the fishhook whistles through a hole in the rosetta stone framework\nof the balcony.  On impact with the floor it pops open - expanding to\nten times its size, having now become an effective grappling hook.\n\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe Burglar with the shotgun turns at the muffled metallic NOISE, looks\nthrough the glass doors at the empty balcony.\n\nEXT. BALCONY FLOOR\n\nThe grappling hook inches across the balcony floor, catching a firm\nhold against the stone.\n\nEXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - NIGHT\n\nThe nylon cord has been pulled taut - it disappears down into the\nblackness at a dizzying height, some four hundred feet above the avenue\nand crisscrossing traffic lights below.\n\nBlack-gloved hands take hold of the cord, testing it.\n\nEXT. SKY - NIGHT\n\nAn ominous BLACK SHADOW, cape billowing out behind in an eerie\nsilhouette, passes in front of the glowing yellow ball of the full\nmoon.\n\nANGLE DOWN CORD AT BALCONY\n\nThe balcony and double glass doors WHISTLE UP AT CAMERA at a dizzying\nspeed, growing larger by the millisecond!\n\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe Burglar has finished his work at the safe.  He nods to the other\nBurglar who grins, then cocks his shotgun, pointing it down at the\nhelpless Couple on the floor.\n\nThe flicker of an outside SHADOW flits across the room - the Burglar\nblinks, wheels with his shotgun!\n\nSuddenly:  the double doors explode with a hail of shattering glass!\nAlmost simultaneously - the shotgun FIRES!\n\nINT. GORDON'S CAR - NIGHT\n\nA surly Gordon looks over as his intercom crackles.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nCommissioner, this is Sergeant\nHavemeyer.  I'm on the fortieth\nfloor of the Gotham Arms.  Our boy\nhas struck again.  Cape, boots, hood\n-- the whole drill.\n\nGORDON\n(snatches intercom)\nWhen?\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nJust now.  The owners tripped a\nsilent alarm.  We responded and\nheard a gunshot as we were running\ndown the hallway.  The victims are\nfine.  Sonofabitch cold-cocked both\nperpetrators.\n\nGORDON\nAtta boy, Havemeyer.  Hold him for\nquestioning till I get there.\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nCan't do that, Sir.

I want your urine checked\nfor drugs!\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nYes, Sir.\n\nGordon slams down the intercom in disgust.\n\nGORDON\nMaybe it's something in the water.\nMaybe the whole city's on drugs.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT\n\nPolice SIRENS everywhere.  A squad car rolls slowly down the street,\nits spotlight searching the doorways and alleys.\n\nINT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT\n\nThe COP DRIVER yawns, turns to his PARTNER who works the spotlight, now\nnotices something.\n\nCOP DRIVER\nWhat's that?\n\nPARTNER\nWino...\n(out the window)\nGo back to sleep, Ace!\n\nSuddenly:  A WHISTLING SOUND through the air!  The two Cops blink, snap\ntheir heads forward as the searchlight is trained on:\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN - THEIR  P.O.V.\n\nTHE BATMAN! - Seen in his majestic totality for the very first time.  A\ntruly awesome figure from his black cowl to his gleaming black boots.\nHis huge, dark cape billows out ominously behind him.\n\nBACK TO SQUAD CAR\n\nCOP DRIVER\nHolee shit...\n\nPARTNER\nLet's get him!\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe squad car lurches forward!

It too fills the alleyway.  There's no place\nto hide.\n\nANGLE ON SQUAD CAR #1\n\nFilling frame - the Cops grinning.\n\nANGLE ON SQUAD CAR #2\n\nFilling frame - the Cops grinning.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nHe stands his ground.  Then - curiously - runs directly at the first\nsquad car.\n\nANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SQUAD CAR #1\n\nCOP #1\nWhat the...?\n\nBACK TO BATMAN - SLOW MOTION SHOT\n\nWith a perfectly timed leap, Batman vaults onto the hood of the car in\na somersault and does a complete 360 - up the windshield - over the\nroof - off the trunk - lands on the pavement with the grave of a cat.\n\nANGLE ON TWO POLICE CARS\n\nThey crash head-on with a sickening sound of crunching metal and flying\nglass.  Two groggy Police exit, front doors falling off, try to clear\ntheir heads.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAWN\n\nThe first orange rays of the morning sun stab upwards through the\nclouds over Wayne Manor.\n\nINT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - DAY\n\nYoung Bruce Wayne's lab room remains much as we remember it, except\nthat the gaping hole in the wall caused by the laser has been\nreinforced and shaped into a doorway.  A make-shift ladder-like\nstairway leads down into the cavern below.\n\nFOOTSTEPS are heard climbing the ladder from deep within the cave.\nAfter a moment, Bruce appears, stripped to the waist, still wearing his\nutility belt and the bottom half of his Batman suit.  His chest and\nstomach are nicked with small cuts and bruises from his previous\nnight's work.  His forehead glistens with sweat born of utter\nexhaustion.  He sits heavily on a cot, buries his face in his hands,\nlooks up suddenly as the door to the lab opens.\n\nAlfred enters, stares silently, first appalled by Bruce's physical\ncondition, then shaking his head with sympathy.  Bruce stares back,\neyes heavy with lack of sleep.\n\nBRUCE\nYou...think I'm crazy, don't you?\nCertifiably insane.\n\nALFRED\n(pause; smile)\nA bit...eccentric, perhaps.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's...what I have to do, Alfred.\nAfter all those years of searching\n-- it was always what I had to do.\n\nALFRED\nIf I may be permitted, Sir...\n(with difficulty)\nI've...never had any children of my\nown.

GOTHAM COUNTRY CLUB - DAY\n\nBruce lies on a deck chair by the swimming pool of the Gotham Country\nClub, his body coated with sun oil.  He listens to Gordon's TV press\nconference on a tiny transistor set next to him.  His eyes flutter open\nwith amusement.\n\nTV REPORTER\nWell considering the fact he apprehended\nfour criminals last night, shouldn't we\nbe calling him...a good Samaritan?\n\nGORDON\nSure.  If you feel like calling John\nHinkley a political activist.\n\nBruce's eyes suddenly bulge wider.  He gazes across the swimming pool,\ntransfixed by what he sees.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER - BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nA stunning-looking woman (SILVER ST. CLOUD) steps out onto the high\nboard of the pool, dressed in a daringly-cut shiny white latex tank\nsuit.  A shining mane of glistening silver hair cascades down across\nher shoulders.  She pauses, a shimmering white diamond in the sun.\n\nREPORTER'S VOICE\nCommissioner, it might surprise you\nto know that several polls taken\ntoday show more than eighty percent\nof those interviewed approve of\nthis...vigilante and what he did...\n\nSilver glances over in Bruce's direction.  Curiously enough, she seems\nto smile at him and wave.\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nWell I can't account for public\ntaste, bit I'd like to warn any\npotential copy cats who may be out\nthere that...\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce is stunned and confused, but starts to lift his hand to wave back\nwhen:\n\nTHORNE'S VOICE\nIf brains were bodies, she'd look\njust the same.  Can you believe it?\n\nBruce swivels, lowering his hand.  Thorne stands behind him, waves back\nat Silver who executes a complicated but perfect dive into the pool.\nShe starts to swim across in their direction as Throne grins down at\nBruce.\n\nTHORNE\nName's Silver St. Cloud.  Phi Beta\nKappa, Masters Degree in Political\nScience.  Just arrived in Gotham to\nfinish her doctorate on municipal\ngovernment and guess which City\ncouncilman drew her as an intern?\n\nBRUCE\n(staring)\nTaught her much so far?\n\nTHORNE\n(chuckle)\nNot as much as I plan to.\n\nSilver reaches the edge of the pool.  Thorne starts to help her out as\nBruce continues to start.\n\nSILVER\nThe water's glorious, Rupert.

Not like Mr. Wayne over\nhere...\n(chuckle)\nRight, Bruce?\n(turns)\nSilver St. Cloud - Bruce Wayne.\n\nBruce looks up, totally mesmerized by the sight of her.  She gazes down\nwith a devastating smile, the sun sparkling off the beads of water on\nher face.  She is instantly and equally smitten as they lock eyes.\n\nSILVER\nPlease don't get up.\n\nBRUCE\n(lost)\nHmm?\n\nSILVER\nI said - please don't get up.\n\nBRUCE\nOh.\n(starts to get up)\nSorry...\n\nSILVER\nThat's all right.

A DANCE BAND plays off to the side,\nunder a banner reading \"Happy Birthday to the Finest of Gotham's\nFinest.\"\n\nBruce Wayne greets his arriving GUESTS, his neck craning around in vain\nfor a sight of Silver.\n\nGordon stands by the bar, downs a double scotch, scowls at GUESTS who\ntalks animatedly to him while flapping his arms like wings - doing a\ncrude imitation of the Batman.  The Guest howls with laughter, moves\noff as Gordon orders another drink and Bruce joins him with a\nsympathetic smile.\n\nBRUCE\nThey're giving you a pretty hard time\nabout that Batman, aren't they...\n\nGordon nods, tosses back his drink angrily.\n\nGORDON\nI'd give up half my pension to be\nstanding face to face with that\ncaped fruitcake right now.\n(looks off; stares)\nNow there's a sight to make an old\nman's eyes water.\n\nSilver St. Cloud approaches them, threading her way through the\nappreciative glances of the Guests, dressed in a sparkling, metallic\nevening gown, the light bouncing off it like tiny bursts of shooting\nstars.

A LOUD FANFARE is played.  All conversation stops as the\nfront door opens.\n\nNow entering Wayne Manor:  the Two Keystone Kops, in their twenties'\ncostumes with handlebar moustaches.  They dance their way to the center\nof the room in a prearranged routine, singing in harmony from Pirates\nof Penzance.\n\nKOPS\nWhen a felon's not engaged in his\nemployment,\nOr maturing his felonious little\nplans,\nHis capacity for innocent enjoyment\nIs just as great as any honest\nman's...\nOh, a policeman's lot is not a happy\none...\n\nThe Guests applaud loudly.  Gordon joins Bruce and Silver as the Kops\nbreak into a vaudeville routine.\n\nKOP\nExcuse me, Sir.  Have you seen a\npoliceman around here?\n\nKOP #2\nWhy no, I haven't.\n\nKOP\n(drawing gun)\nGood.  Then give me your watch.\n\nSeveral Guests laugh.  Bruce winces at the bad joke.\n\nKOP #2\nBut this watch isn't worth anything.\nIt only has a sentimental value.\n\nKOP\nWell give it to me anyway.  I feel\nlike a good cry.\n\nGordon laughs loudly as the Kop turns to him.\n\nKOP (CONT'D)\nNow, Commissioner, if we could\nborrow your watch for a moment...\n\nGORDON\n(taking it off)\nSure.  Be careful with it, okay?\n\nThe Kop smiles, takes the watch, dangles it from his hand.  Kop #2\nsilently sidles in behind Bruce and Silver.\n\nKOP\nHere's a good one:  what's a police-\nman's favorite way to kill time?\n\nGORDON\n(grinning)\nI'll bite.  What is a policeman's\nfavorite way to kill time?\n\nThe Kop grins, pull his gun - FIRES!  Gordon's watch is smashed to\nsmithereens.  Kop #2's gun suddenly at the back of Silver's head,\nhammer cocked.\n\nKOP #2\nUp against the wall, everybody!\nMove!!\n\nThe Guests scream as six more Kops burst through the front door\ncarrying automatic weapons.  Bruce, Silver, and Gordon are herded back\nagainst the wall with the others.\n\nThe KOP grins, then suddenly starts to giggle insanely.  He takes off\nhis helmet, as a shock of GREEN HAIR is exposed!  He wipes his lips\nclean which now become ruby red.  Cackling in glee, THE JOKER faces his\nvictims, his gaze suddenly becoming cruel and cold.\n\nJOKER\nOne at a time, your money and your\njewels, and no one's head'll wind\nup looking like the Commissioner's\nwatch, capisce?\n\nKOP #3\nHey, boss!  Look!\n\nThe Joker turns.  Kop #3 and a PARTNER have set Gordon's huge birthday\ncake on the floor, now wade through it, stomping up and down, kicking\nthe insides across the room.\n\nKOP #3\nWe're doing the cake walk!\n\nThe Joker giggles, then shoots a satanically maniacal look at the\nGuests who instantly begin stripping off their jewelry, taking out\nwallets, etc. as more Kops pass by with a gunny sack.  The Joker walks\ndown the line, stopping to level a searching and curious gaze into the\neyes of:\n\nBruce Wayne, between Gordon and Silver, his face set, eyes steely,\nstaring at the Joker.  His jaw twitches.\n\nSilver watches him, noticing the twitch.  She gives him a tiny,\nsympathetic smile, then turns to face:\n\nKop #2, who has moved down the line to Silver.  He looks her up and\ndown hungrily as she stares back in defiance.  His fingers slowly reach\nup to grip her necklace, then linger.\n\nKOP #2\nIn your case, lady, I'd like to\nrip the rest off and leave this on.\n\nSuddenly:  BRUCE'S FIST FLASHES INTO FRAME!  Kop #2 is knocked backward\nthrough the air as another Kop lunges at Bruce who grabs the gunny sack\nfilled with jewelry and bashes him in the face!  The Kop crumples to\nthe floor as Bruce wheels to face the Joker and sees:\n\nThe Joker, grinning cruelly, the barrel of his gun pressing up under\nSilver's chin.  Her eyes are welded shut with fear.\n\nJOKER\nNow that was extremely bad manners,\nMr. Wayne.  Especially from someone...\n(gestures)\n...to the Manor born...\n(giggles)\nSo why don't you rejoin the lady here,\nor if you like...\n(cocks gun; glowers)\nI can send part of her over to you.\n\nBruce hesitates, then rejoins the line.  The Joker lowers his gun,\nturns to stare at a painting on the wall as a Kop holds out the open\ngunny sack to Gordon.\n\nGORDON\n(to Joker)\nI'll see you rot in the gas chamber\nfor this.\n\nThe Joker smiles, ignoring him, looking at the portrait painting which\nis of a distinguished older man.  He removes it from the wall.  An\nindignant Alfred speaks up from farther down the line of Guests.\n\nALFRED\nBe careful, you clot!  That portrait\ngoes back to Mr. Wayne's grandfather!\n\nJOKER\nWhy?  Is there something wrong with\nit?\n\nThe Joker cackles, punching the painting out of its frame.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nBruce stares silently.  His jaw twitches with anger born of\nhumiliation.  Silver notices again.\n\nSILVER\n(whisper)\nLook on the bright side.  You're\nadorable when your jaw twitches.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Joker crosses to Gordon with the empty picture frame.  Another Kop\npoints a camera as the Joker holds the frame up to encircle his and\nGordon's face.\n\nJOKER\n(giggling)\nI've always wanted to frame a Police\nCommissioner...\n\nCLOSE ON JOKER'S AND GORDON'S FACES\n\nGordon shuts his eyes in disgrace.

The\nphone line seems to have been cut.\n\nGORDON\nI'll report it myself, Alfred.\nRight before I cut my throat.\n\nHe tries to check his watch, stares at an empty wrist, sighs, then\njoins the stream of departing Guests as Bruce looks over at Silver\nglumly.\n\nBRUCE\nWell.  Good-night.  I guess...\n\nSILVER\n(sudden grin)\nWhy don't be silly.

The snickering instantly dies away.  Muttering\ndisgustedly, Gordon enters his office.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThe office is lit only be a small desk lamp.  Strung up behind the desk\nis a crudely-made banner reading:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO OUT COMMISH - FROM\nALL YOUR BOYS IN BLUE.\n\nGordon shakes his head sadly, crosses to a cabinet, pours himself an\nenormous glass of Scotch, then crosses with the bottle to the open\noffice window.

How would you describe me?\n\nSILVER\n(staring back)\nI don't think you're harmless.  And\nI don't think anyone who's looked\nstraight in your eyes could say so.\n\nBruce's jaw twitches involuntarily.  Silver grins.  He leans in, kisses\nher lingeringly on the mouth.  They break.  He gazes into her\ndisoriented eyes.\n\nBRUCE\nFrightened?\n\nSILVER\nTerrified...but don't worry...\n(soft smile)\nAs a kid they always had to drag me\noff the roller coaster.\n\nThey kiss again, passionately.

It flies over to his bed, hops up into his lap.\n\nA STATUESQUE WOMAN (EMPRESS) enters, carrying a tureen of shrimp\nembedded in ice.  She wears a tight wool body stocking, a muffler\nwrapped around her neck.\n\nEMPRESS\nHere, sweetie.  Eat them while they're\nnice and frozen.  Feel better?\n\nPENGUIN\nA smidge.\n\nThe Penguin removes his thermometer, looks at it.\n\nPENGUIN (O.S.)\nSixty-five degrees.  Normal.  I\ncan't understand it...\n\nHe takes a bite of frozen shrimp, removes the ice pack from his head,\nslips it inside his robe.  He leans in, tugs on the Empress' muffler\ngently, smiles.\n\nPENGUIN (CONT'D)\nFeel life...feathering the nest for\na while?\n\nEMPRESS\nIf you'll let me turn the thermostat\nup to forty.  That was our deal,\nremember?\n\nHe strokes her face tenderly, makes his clucking sound.  Shivers runs\nup and down her body.\n\nPENGUIN\nConfess.  Where you're with me, it's\nalways Honolulu in your heart.\n\nEMPRESS\nAre you kidding?  It's so cold in here\na flasher would have described himself.\n\nThere is a KNOCK from the doorway.  A seven-foot, sallow-looking BUTLER\n(MARIBOU) with a vulture-like face appears.\n\nMARIBOU\nExcuse me, Mr. Penguin.  Your\nluncheon guest has arrived.\n\nPENGUIN\nThank you, Maribou...\n\nMARIBOU\nMay I take your luncheon order now,\nSir?\n\nThe pigeon coos from the Penguin's lap.  He looks down.\n\nPENGUIN\nWhy, yes, Maribou.  Yes, you may...\n\nHis hand wanders BELOW FRAME.  We hear the sound of a neck snapping.\nThe Empress turns away in disgust.\n\nINT. PENGUIN'S DINING ROOM - DAY\n\nAn elegant dining room.  At one end of a checkered black-and-white\ntable:  the Penguin.  Dressed in white tie and tails, he pops an icy\ncodfish ball into his mouth.\n\nPENGUIN\nEven for a criminal as phenomenally\ngifted as I - this is indeed an\nhonor, Sir.\n\nAt the other end - the Joker, teeth chattering, not touching his food.\nWrapped in a heavy overcoat with muffler and earmuffs, he blows into\nhis hands.  Four sets of candelabra are drawn in around him for warmth.\n\nJOKER\nNice little meat locker you got here.\nWho'd you buy it from, Bird's Eye?\n\nA frozen giggle collapses.  The Penguin blinks stoically.\n\nPENGUIN\nI'm heart-broken you haven't touched\nyour food.  I had that clown fish\ncooked especially for you.\n(gestures)\nDo you prefer codfish balls?\n\nJOKER\nI don't know.  I never attended any.\n\nAn insane chuckle rises, then dies, teeth chattering.\n\nJOKER\nBut seriously, Big Bird...\n(eyes narrowing)\nI need a favor.\n\nPENGUIN\nOutside of possibly offering you a\nbrain scan - how may I be of help?\n\nJOKER\n(philosophical)\nI've worked hard to make Gotham a city\nwe could all be proud of.  The kind of\nplace where an ambitious young hood\ncould come home after a hard day\ndealing drugs and get some peaceful\nsleep at night.  But all that was B.B.\n\nPENGUIN\nBefore Batman.\n\nJOKER\nRimshot.  I'd like to send that\ncowled cop-lover on a little trip\ntomorrow night.\n(leans in)\nBut I'm going to need you to pro-\nvide the flight insurance.\n(giggle)\nWhich reminds me.  Do you know what\nyou get when you make love to the\nwrong canary?\n\nPENGUIN\n(sigh)\nI haven't a clue.\n\nJOKER\nTwerpes!\n\nHe explodes with laughter.  The Penguin stares blankly.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nNot only that - but the disease is\ncompletely untweetable!\n\nThe Penguin winces sadly, lowers his eyes as the Joker slams his semi-\nfrozen clown fish against his plate, his body wracked by uncontrollable\nguffaws.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - DAY\n\nAlfred holds an aerosol wax can and a cloth.  He polishes an enormous\nwhite animal tooth.\n\nALFRED\nWith all this extra cleaning to do,\nSir, do you mind if I engage addi-\ntional staff for the mansion?\n\nAn acetylene torch whines in reply.\n\nWIDE ANGLE - BATCAVE\n\nWe see the Batcave for the first time:  The gothic cavern walls are now\nspotless.  Alfred stands on a ladder, polishing a tooth of a mechanical\nTyrannosaurus Rex.  Next to it is the giant penny.  This, along with\nother exhibits, is the trophy section.\n\nCAMERA PANS:  One area of the cave is devoted to exercise - weights,\nNautilus machines, rings - even a trapeze.  The acetylene torch whines.\n\nCAMERA PANS:  Another section features a myriad of complicated machines\nand a fully equipped crime lab.\n\nPAST the crime lab:  Bruce lies on his back under a partially\nconstructed futuristic automobile.  He trains an acetylene torch\nagainst one section as the sparks fly.  It's just the shell of a car\nnow - other sections and odd electronic devices are strewn about the\narea.  Bruce shuts off his torch, removes a faceplate, reaches back for\na long cylindrical network of crisscrossing cables.  He starts to fit\nit onto one underside edge of the chassis.\n\nBRUCE\nI'm sorry, Alfred.  Did you say\nsomething?\n\nALFRED\n(noticing cylinder)\nWhat on earth is all that metallic\nspaghetti in aid of?\n\nBRUCE\nThere's a Magnum pistol in the table\ndrawer over there.  Take it out,\nwould you?\n\nAlfred descends the ladder as Bruce rises, crosses to two larger\nversions of the cabled cylinders.  They stand upright, some eight feet\napart from each other.  Bruce leans down, opens the top of a large\ntransformer box.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nI've connected two mega-transformer\nleads to form a force field of a\nmillion volts.\n\nBruce flips a switch - dazzling blue light begins to dance between the\ncable cylinders.  Alfred turns with the gun in his hands as Bruce calls\nto him from behind the sparkling wall of blue light.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nShoot me.\n\nALFRED\nPardon?\n\nBRUCE\nShoot to kill.  Aim for the heart.\n\nALFRED\nI...assume this apparatus has been\nthoroughly tested, Sir?\n\nBRUCE\nWe're doing it right now.\n\nAlfred stares incredulously, the gun shaking in his hand.\n\nALFRED\nSir...if you've miscalculated...\n\nBRUCE\nBe a good soldier, Alfred.\n(pause)\nShoot.  Now!\n\nAlfred straightens his arm, his finger squeezing the trigger.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\n(suddenly)\nWait!\n\nTOO LATE:  Alfred fires!  The bullet bounces off the blue wall of\nlight, then ricochets back at Alfred, pinging into the cavern wall next\nto his head!  Alfred hits the deck as the lead cartridge continues a\nseemingly endless path of ricochets until there is sudden silence.\n\nAlfred rises, sweat dripping from his brow.  Bruce grins, turning off\nthe blue light.\n\nBRUCE\nI forgot to tell you to duck.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM CITY HALL - NIGHT\n\nA taxi pulls up to the darkened City Hall.  Silver exits, starts up the\nsteps.\n\nINT. CITY HALL - NIGHT\n\nSilver enters, crosses the lobby to the elevators.  A GUARD looks up\nfrom his night desk.\n\nGUARD\nJust a minute, Miss...\n\nSILVER\nIt's okay, Victor, it's...\n(sees him)\nWhere's Victor?\n\nGUARD\nVictor's...sick tonight.  What's\nyour name?\n\nSILVER\nSt. Cloud.  I'm on Councilman\nThorne's staff.  Just catching up on\na little back work.\n\nGUARD\nThe doors are all locked up there,\nMiss, and...I'm not authorized to\nopen them.\n\nSilver dangles her key with a pleasant smile, passes by him, enters the\nelevator.  The doors close.  The nervous Guard picks up a house phone.\n\nGUARD\nThere's a girl named Silver St. Cloud on\nher way up.  I tried to stop her...\n\nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA LOOKS DOWN from the main gears of the elevator at a seemingly\nendless shaft of cables.  The car carrying Silver rises quickly, jerks\nto a stop at one of the top floors.\n\nINT. CITY HALL CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nSilver exits the elevator, starts down the corridor for her office\ndoor.  She passes Thorne's office, then stops, hearing MUFFLED VOICES\nfrom inside.\n\nSILVER\nRupert?...\n\nThere is a sudden silence.  Silver cocks her head curiously.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nRupert, it's Silver...\n\nSilver opens the door, suddenly recoils, aghast:\n\nANGLE ON THORNE - HER P.O.V.\n\nThorne sits behind his desk, bound and gagged, tied to the chair.  His\neyes bulge in terror as Silver rushes in.\n\nSILVER\nRupert, what happened!\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nYou like that gag?\n\nSilver wheels to face the Joker behind her!\n\nJOKER\nWell, here's an even better one!\n\nA stream of clear liquid shoots out from a plastic flower on the\nJoker's coat lapel, drenching Silver's face as she recoils, stunned,\nthen instantly drops to the floor.  The Joker giggles as Thorne rises\nfrom behind the desk, the ropes dropping off him like spaghetti.  He\ntakes the gag out of his mouth, looks down at Silver, nervous and\nagitated.\n\nTHORNE\nI can't get her involved.  This\nchanges everything.\n\nJOKER\nThis changes nothing.\n(looks down; appre-\nciative smile)\nIn fact, it might even give that\nblack-caped creep an added incentive\nto walk into our trap.\n\nTHORNE\n(concerned)\nHow long before she wakes up?\n\nJOKER\nHalf an hour.\n(wicked grin)\nNever, if you prefer...\n\nTHORNE\n(glaring coldly)\nThis better work out.  I warn you,\nJoker - don't disappoint me.\n\nJOKER\n(crossing to door)\nPlease.  If everyone in this country\nworked as efficiently as I do, we'd\nbe back on the road to prosperity.\n(turns; stops)\nOh.  And starting tomorrow - after\nthe Batman's funeral - don't you\ndisappoint me, understood?\n\nThe Joker smiles cruelly, giggles, then disappears.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA PANS the cavernous Batcave.  We HEAR the low, powerful, whining\nGRIND of what seem to be turbine engines.  It rises in pitch and\nintensity, growing richer and more deafening than a 747.\n\nThe blasting SOUND is coming from behind a corner of the cave, its\nsource unseen.  But up against one wall, in a cubicle niche:\n\nA RED TELEPHONE PULSATES WITH GLOWING LIGHT!\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred walks down the hallway dressed for bed, stifles a yawn, notices\nsomething through the open study door.\n\nANGLE ON STUDY DOOR - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe light coming from the study seems to pulsate as well, first dying,\nthen rising.  Dying, then rising.\n\nINT. STUDY - NIGHT\n\nThe pulsating light comes from a desk lamp.  Alfred enters, crosses,\npresses a hidden button under the desk:\n\nA bottom drawer pops open, revealing a glowing red extension of the\nBatphone in the cave.\n\nAlfred shoves the drawer back, hurries out of the study.\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nAlfred crosses the living room, heading for a tall grandfather's clock\nat one end.  He reaches behind the clock.  We HEAR a switch \"CLICK.\"\nAlfred reaches behind, swivels the clock away from the wall.\n\nThe SOUND of the ENGINE WHINE becomes immediately audible.  Alfred\nhurries through the opening in the wall.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT\n\nKnifing up into the blackness over the skyline of Gotham City - THE\nGLEAMING BATSIGNAL!\n\nINT. THORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThe office has been ransacked.  Drawers overturned, bookcases emptied,\nwith piles of paper and debris strewn across the floor.\n\nSilver sits in a chair, conscious but still groggy.  Thorne paces\nangrily in front of Gordon, kicking trash left and right as the Batman\nwatches from inside the doorway, his eyes darting back and forth.\n\nTHORNE\nIt's unbelievable!  The Joker!\nRight here in my office!\n(at Silver)\nHe could have killed her!\n(realizes)\nHe could have killed me, for God's\nsake!\n\nBATMAN\nI wonder why he didn't...\n\nBatman crosses, eyes riveted on Silver.  She feels his magnetic gaze on\nher, now stares back, fascinated by him.\n\nTHORNE\nYou sound disappointed!\n\nGORDON\nCalm down, Rupert!  We've got a long\nnight ahead of us.\n\nTHORNE\nWhat's this we crap?\n\nGORDON\nWell, you're the only one who'd know\nwhat was missing.\n(turns)\nI'll send for a squad car to drive\nyou home, Miss St. Cloud.\n\nSilver nods at Gordon, then looks back into the dark, magnetically\nintimidating gaze of the Batman.\n\nSILVER\nPerhaps...the Batman would be kind\nenough to see me home.\n\nTHORNE\nWhat?\n\nBatman stares back at Silver with no apparent reaction.  She smiles\nunsteadily, not sure of herself.\n\nSILVER\nIf I'm not too far out of your way.\n\nBATMAN\n(pause)\nI can't imagine such a place exists,\nMiss St. Cloud.\n\nTHORNE\nOh, brother...\n\nSilver blushes, then rises, offers Batman her arm.\n\nSILVER\nGood-night, Rupert...\n\nTHORNE\nWait!...\n\nBatman leads Silver out the door.  Thorne's face trembles with rage and\nfrustration as Gordon looks over curiously.\n\nGORDON\nRelax, Rupert.  Who could she be\nsafer with?\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN on Thorne's troubled face.\n\nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nBatman leads Silver to the elevator, presses the button.\n\nSILVER\nWe're taking the elevator?\n\nBATMAN\nDoesn't everybody?\n\nSILVER\nWhy did I have this feeling we'd be\ndropping out a window together, or\nsomething exotic like that...\n\nThe elevator arrives.  They enter.\n\nINT. TOP OF ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT\n\nThe main gears of the elevator shaft start to churn.  Suddenly:  the\nbeam from a welding torch appears, rapidly cutting away at one of the\ncables.\n\nCAMERA PANS:  The Penguin hangs suspended in the shaft, supported in\nmid-air by the whirling ribs of a HUGE UMBRELLA hooked to the back of\nhis belt.  He trains the torch on the cable, looks down, \"clucks\"\ncontently.\n\nSuddenly:  THE CABLE SNAPS!\n\nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT\n\nA jarring jolt.  The elevator suddenly drops!  Silver screams as she\nand Batman are momentarily pushed up into the air.  Batman grabs onto a\nlight fixture in the roof, bashes the ceiling escape hatch away.\n\nANGLE ON ELEVATOR\n\nPlummeting down the shaft.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nHe reaches into his utility belt, pulls out a nail-like piece of curved\nmetal attached to a nylon cord.  It pops open into a large, four-\npronged fish hook.\n\nBATMAN\nGrab my belt!  Hang on!\n\nANGLE IN SHAFT\n\nThe hook flies out of the top of the sinking elevator heading for the\nwall of the shaft.  It grazes down the shaft wall, catches on one set\nof gears which allow the doors to open on each individual floor.  The\nnylon cord goes taut.\n\nBACK TO ELEVATOR\n\nSilver hangs on as Batman hooks his arm around her.  The two of them\nshoot upwards through the escape hatch.\n\nANGLE ON ELEVATOR\n\nStill plummeting.  It hits the ground with an ear-splitting, sickening\ncrash.\n\nINT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nA WASHERWOMAN standing by the elevator doors, with her mop and pail,\npresses the \"down\" button.  It opens.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman and Silver hang by the cord in the shaft, her arms locked around\nhim in a death grip.  She stares, goggle-eyed.\n\nBATMAN\n(at Silver)\nNext time - remind me to try the\nwindow.\n\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\nBatman and Silver walk down a deserted street.  She is a wreck -\ntrembling, ripped dress, with streaks of cable grease on her face and\nhair.\n\nBATMAN\nI'm parked in the alleyway.  Didn't\nwant to attract attention.\n\nSILVER\nA bit late for that, isn't it?\n\nSuddenly:  THE ROAR OF ENGINES IS HEARD FROM THE SKY!  Batman and\nSilver's heads snap up:\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN'S GANG - THEIR P.O.V.\n\nTHREE PENGUIN CONFEDERATES whizz down at them through the night sky\nwearing jetpacks!  Orange flames shoot out from behind their propelling\nrigs as they maneuver through the air, now heading into a synchronized\npower dive.\n\nThe Penguin hovers above, still supported by his whirling umbrella-\ncopter.\n\nA hail of MACHINE GUN BULLETS spews forth from guns mounted on top of\ntheir packs - the flyers close in on Batman and Silver like attacking\nfighter planes.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN AND SILVER\n\nBatman dives behind a row of garbage cans, pushing a screaming Silver\ndown in front of him as the fusillade ricochets off the cans and\nbuilding walls.\n\nThe flying formation zooms back up into the sky again, preparing to\nmake another pass.  Batman turns to a trembling Silver who is paralyzed\nwith fear.\n\nBATMAN\nStay here!  It's me they want...\n\nSILVER\nDon't leave me!!\n\nBatman turns and looks:  she is a quaking mess.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nOh, please?

A sleek,\npowerful, futuristic panther of a car - jet black with a domed\ninterior.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nThe interior is a glistening, intricate maze of computers, screens, and\ncomplicated electrical systems.  Silver's eyes are frozen open in\nastonishment.

There is one.\n\nANGLE ON SKY\n\nThe Penguin and his three Jetpack Bandits zoom down at the car, their\nmounted machine guns BLAZING.  Bandit #1 powers forward, spewing\nbullets as he comes.\n\nINT.

They soar higher to avoid their own fire.\n\nBACK ON BATMOBILE\n\nSpeeding down an avenue along the side of the park.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nSilver looks over hopefully.\n\nSILVER\nI guess we frightened them off.\n\nBatman shakes his head, flips another switch:  A small radar screen\nlights up.  Three blinking LIGHT BLIPS are still following them.\nBatman suddenly looks ahead, eyes widening.\n\nANOTHER CAR heads directly at them, guns blazing!\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nI think I'll keep my mouth shut.\n\nANGLE ON STREET\n\nThe HOOD CAR swerves off the street into the park.  The Batmobile\nsqueals into a 180 and roars after it.\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN SKY\n\nThe Penguin watches from the sky with satisfaction.\n\nPENGUIN\nHe's taken the bait...\n\nHe motions two Bandits to fly off in another direction, then:  swivels\nin mid-air, points Bandit #3 down at the Batmobile.\n\nPENGUIN (CONT'D)\nThe tires, you Cretin!  Go for the tires!\n\nANGLE ON PARK ROAD\n\nThe Batmobile pursues the Hood Car through the park as Bandit #3 looms\nup from behind, guns blazing.\n\nINT.

A giant horseshoe\nmagnet swivels, pointing out behind the car!\n\nANGLE ON BANDIT #3\n\nScreaming, wide-eyed, as the force of the powerful magnet spins him in\nmid-air and he is sucked into the trunk by his jetpack.

PARK - ANGLE ON CURVE - NIGHT\n\nA Bandit watches near a curve in the park road as the Hood Car roars\nby.

PARKING BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nThe Batmobile roars around hairpin turns, ascending the levels of the\nparking building like a sportscar.\n\nThe Hood Cars screech after him, gaining speed.  They pursue Batman\nhigher and higher, threading the narrow openings through the lines of\nparked cars, tearing off side mirrors, doors, and fenders on their way\nby.\n\nANGLE ON HIGHER LEVEL\n\nThe Batmobile, reaching the level just under the roof, squeals around a\ncorner, catches the fender of a parked car, and spins out of control!\n\nBatman slams on the brakes as the Batmobile skids and turns to face:\n\nThe two Hood Cars, which have stopped so that they are completely\nblocking off the exit ramps, up and down.

You\nmust have been terrified.\n\nSILVER\nWell, I've thought of a way you can\nmake it up to me.\n\nBatman looks at her curiously.  She suddenly kisses him, deeply.  He\nallows it, unwilling or unable to pull away.\n\nCLOSE-UP\n\nSilver's eyes open.  She knows - or thinks she does.\n\nThey break.  Silver smiles mysteriously, whistles under her breath,\nenters her apartment.\n\nINT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nShe leans against the door, sighs.

The audience stares back.  His eyes narrow.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nBut I digress.  You see, I'm in the\nprocess of developing a new series...\n(evil smile)\n...of killings.  All original, all\ndifferent, believe me, folks, you're\ngonna die laughing.  And there's only\none man who can cancel my little show\nthe Batman.  Because from now\non, each time he appears in public,\nevery time he's seen anywhere - one\nprominent citizen of Gotham will die.\n(to camera)\nI'm tired of fighting you, Batman,\nso the people are going to do it for\nme.

I can't chance it.\n\nBruce turns away in disgust, his mind racing.\n\nALFRED\n(sympathetic)\nWell...perhaps a night on the town\nas Bruce Wayne might be therapeutic\nfor you after all.  You do have\ntickets for the gala opening of the\nopera.  I was planning on using one\nmyself, but if you'd prefer a more\nlively and decorative companion I\nquite understand.\n\nBRUCE\nYou know what?

GOTHAM OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nDozens of shiny limousines disgorge Gotham's formally dressed ELITE in\nfront of the opera house.  Photographer's flashbulbs indicate that it\nis indeed a gala opening.  The billboard marquee advertises:\nI PAGLIACCI.\n\nCAMERA PANS to one arriving limo and we hear a TELEPHONE RINGING over\nthe scene.  Silver's VOICE answers it.\n\nSILVER'S VOICE\nHi.  This is Silver.  I'm not home\nright now, but if you'd leave a\nmessage at the \"beep,\" I'll get back\nto you as soon as I can.\n\nThe limo pulls up to the front of the opera house.  Silver exits in a\nshimmering evening gown.  AT THE SOUND OF THE \"BEEP\" we see her escort:\nRupert Thorne.  They make their way inside past a battery of\nphotographers.\n\nINT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nA maze of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE mingles in the lobby, exchanging greetings\nand appreciative glances.  An ARMY ARCHERD-type comments on the passing\nparade for local television.\n\nARMY ARCHERD\n...I'm telling you, they're all\nhere tonight, folks!

Gazing in frustration.\n\nBACK TO SILVER\n\nShe locks eyes with Bruce as Rupert slides his arm around Army\nArcherd's shoulder.\n\nARMY ARCHERD\nI didn't realize you were an opera\nfan, Councilman...\n\nTHORNE\nTo tell the truth, I'm not, Army,\nbut any elected official with as\nmany Italian constituents as I have\nwould be darn well advised to give\nit a try.\n\nRupert laughs heartily as suddenly:  A HUGE COMMOTION is heard outside!\nMUFFLED GASPS give way to FRANTIC MURMURS, then local silence as:  The\nBatman appears in the doorway!\n\nRupert stares, wide-eyed.  Archerd blinks in disbelief as the Crowd\nparts and Batman enters the lobby.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nFrozen.  He exchanges an incredulous glance with Alfred.\n\nCLOSE ON SILVER\n\nTotally taken aback.  Her gaze flicks from Bruce to Batman to Bruce to\nBatman like someone watching a tennis match.\n\nANGLE ON GORDON AT TOP OF STAIRS\n\nGordon stands in a group at the top of the stairs to the mezzanine,\nlooking down in dismay.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Batman joins Rupert and Archerd at the microphone with a cold and\ndistant air.  (His resemblance to Bruce is uncanny.)  Archerd swallows\nnervously.\n\nARCHERD\nYou're...taking quite a chance,\nshowing up in public like this,\naren't you, Batman?\n\nBATMAN\nThe way I see it, we're all taking\nquite a chance if we let a sick\ncriminal mind like the Joker paralyze\nthis entire community with fear.\n\nAn angry MUTTERING is heard from within the Crowd.\n\nCROWD MEMBER\nSure.  He's not the one who's\ngoing to get killed...\n\nBatman's head snaps around angrily at the remark.\n\nBATMAN\nStep forward and say that to my\nface, if you've got the guts!\n\nThe Crowd hangs back, confused and frightened.  More angry muttering is\nheard, now mixed in with boos.\n\nCROWD #2\nCROWD #3\n\t\t\t\t\t Get him out of here!\nGo home, Batman!\n\nThe boos grow louder and defiant, as Gordon hurries to the fake\nBatman's side and Thorne smiles thinly at the imposter.\n\nTHORNE\nIt seems you're not exactly the\npeople's choice anymore, Batman...\n\nGORDON\n(at Batman)\nC'mon.  Let me get you out of here\nbefore these gentle people tear you\nup into little pieces...\n\nGordon leads a reluctant Batman away through the jeering Crowd.

I've got half the police in\nthis city on their way over here!\nSo if you'll all take your seats...\n\nCROWD #6\nCROWD #7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Is he crazy?\nLet's get out of here!\n\nTHORNE\n(into mike)\nWait!!\n\nThere is a hush.  A stern-faced Thorne plays to his audience for all\nhe's worth.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nWhat the Batman just did was inex-\ncusable.  Perhaps even criminal.\nBut he's right about one thing.  No\ncheap hoodlum is going to intimidate\nRupert Thorne while I still have the\nsaliva to spit on him!  My ticket\nsays seat E-6, and that's where I'm\nparking my keyster for the next\nfew hours!\n(pause; low voice)\nAnd I call upon His Honor, the\nMayor, to join me in the audience.\n\nThe Crowd looks over to the side of the lobby:\n\nGOTHAM'S MAYOR emerges from a group of onlookers.  A grey-haired man\nwho is visibly terrified, he swallows hard.\n\nMAYOR\nCouncilman Thorne is right, of\ncourse.  And I expect every other\ndecent citizen of Gotham City to\nstand up and be counted.\n\nThe Mayor silently starts up the stairs to the mezzanine.  After a\nbeat, Thorne theatrically extends his arm to Silver who hesitates, then\nreluctantly joins him.  They start for the orchestra section as others\nin the Crowd begin to follow.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nWatching Silver disappear.  His jaw twitches.\n\nINT. OPERA MEZZANINE - NIGHT\n\nBruce and Alfred head for their box.  The Mayor approaches from the\nother direction, now escorted by Gordon and a phalanx of Police.

I hope it's the right\none.\n\nThe Mayor nods grimly, enters his box.  The Police form a guard by the\ndoor.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S BOX - NIGHT\n\nAs Bruce and Alfred enter.  Gordon stands in their box, a radio\nreceiver in his ear.  A loud ovation is heard.\n\nWIDE SHOT - AUDIENCE\n\nThe audience is on its feet, facing away from the stage, applauding the\nMayor in his box.  The Mayor lifts his arms in a victory salute.  The\napplause dies down.  The lights dim.  The Overture to I Pagliacci is\nheard, O.S.   CAMERA RISES past the Mayor and his party to the hanging\nchandelier directly above him.  The fixture consists of huge crystal\nteardrops.\n\nEXTREME CLOSE ON CHANDELIER\n\nOne of the crystals is filled with a clear liquid.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce and Alfred settle into their chairs.  Gordon mumbles into his\nradio receiver, ever watchful.\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nINT. OPERA HOUSE - ANGLE ON STAGE\n\nThe Leading Man (CANIO), dressed as a clown, sings the aria \"Vesti La\nGiubba\".  A passionate, sad piece.  He kneels in front of a large\ngaily-painted drum.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nAlfred nods off in his chair.  Bruce elbows him gently.\n\nBACK TO CANIO\n\nApproaching the high point of the aria.  With a magnificent voice, he\nreaches for a \"High C\", hits it strongly and purely, holds on to the\nnote.\n\nANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX\n\nThe Mayor and his party exchange impressed glances.  CAMERA PUSHES IN\nON the chandelier teardrop.  It trembles from the force of the High C -\nnow cracks.  The liquid drips down into the box.\n\nBACK TO STAGE\n\nThe sad aria is ending.  Canio is on his knees, sobbing.  He sings\npianissimo, milking every heart-breaking second.  Suddenly - O.S. - a\nchuckle.  Then the sound of laughter.  Canio peers angrily into the\naudience.\n\nANGLE ON AUDIENCE\n\nConfused, then irritated, as the laughter grows louder.\n\nANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX\n\nThe Mayor and his Party guffaw loudly, pounding their chairs in glee.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nBruce rises from his seat, concerned.\n\nBACK TO MAYOR\n\nTears of laughter stream down the Mayor's cheeks.  He is on his feet\nnow, totally out of control.  The others flop over their chairs,\nroaring helplessly.\n\nBACK TO CANIO\n\nHe walks off the stage in disgust.\n\nBACK TO MAYOR'S BOX\n\nWith a sudden, final burst of insane giggling - all four men collapse.\nThe Mayor hangs over the edge of his box, dead - a grotesque grin\nfrozen on his face.\n\nANGLE ON AUDIENCE\n\nGasping.  Panicking.  As:\n\nANGLE ON STAGE\n\nThe huge clown drum suddenly rips apart from the center.  The Joker\nsteps out, dressed as an obese soprano.\n\nJOKER\nWait!  The opera's not over till the\nfat lady sings!\n\nThe Joker hits his own version of a High C as:\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nOpen fire!\n\nThe lights go out.  Gunfire and screaming are heard in the darkness.\nTotal pandemonium.\n\nINSERT SHOT - GOTHAM TRIBUNE\n\nThe Gotham Tribune cartwheels into frame:  CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME MAKES\nGOOD ON BOAST.

Thinking.  He passes the huge crime computer, pauses,\nlooks down, punches some keys.\n\nANGLE ON COMPUTER SCREEN\n\nA series of CRIMINAL MUG SHOTS flashes across the screen, law-breakers\nof every variety, finally stopping at:\n\nThe face of the Joker - grinning down menacingly.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring back.  Face set.  Jaw twitching.\n\nThe screen suddenly goes blank.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nAlfred has turned off the computer.  Bruce stares numbly.\n\nALFRED\nSir, I...\n(swallows)\nPerhaps...this isn't the only way.\nPerhaps this is all meant to signal\na...a new beginning for you.  After\nall, you're an intelligent, enter-\nprising young man with every capa-\nbility in the world to...\n\nBruce puts his hand on Alfred's shoulder.\n\nBRUCE\nI...know you love me very much, and I'm\ndeeply grateful, but I wish you'd get\nout of here now, and leave me alone.\n\nAlfred pauses, then nods, walks off dejectedly.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nHe wanders through the cave with glassy eyes, passing a table near the\nBatmobile.  On it - a new version of the battering ram.  Bruce picks it\nup, smiles bitterly, carries it in one hand as he continues to wander,\npassing the crime lab section.\n\nSuddenly - he lashes out - sends the battering ram flying through a set\nof glass beakers filled with chemicals.  Swinging it wildly now, he\ndestroys a section of the crime lab, then sinks heavily into a chair,\nhead bowed.\n\nEXTREME WIDE ANGLE\n\nThe cavernous Batcave.  The tiny, slumped figure of Bruce.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - WIDE ANGLE - DAY\n\nThe hot noonday sun drenches the spacious grounds of Wayne Manor.

WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nAlfred watches from the window, concerned, as O.S., the TELEPHONE\nstarts to RING.\n\nEXT. RUNNING TRACK - DAY\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on Bruce's grimly determined face, oblivious to the\nrivulets of sweat which pour down freely.  His body is encased in\nseveral layers of exercise clothes, deeply stained by perspiration,\nthat turn him into a human pressure cooker.  His legs churn like\ndisassociated pistons.\n\nBACK TO ALFRED\n\nThe telephone continues to RING.  Alfred turns, still distracted by the\nsight of Bruce and answers it.\n\nALFRED\n(into phone)\nMr. Wayne's residence...I'm sorry, he's\nnot available...No, as I told you previ-\nously, I don't know when that would be,\nbut if you'd care to leave another\nmessage...\n\nINT.

Gotham needs an effective\nnetwork of daycare centers, and\ntomorrow night's charity opening of\nthe circus seems like a good place\nto start.\n\nThe Constituents thank her profusely.  Silver crosses to her\nSECRETARY's desk with a hopeful look.\n\nSILVER\nAny luck?\n\nSECRETARY\nNada.  Mr. Wayne seems to be perma-\nnently...unavailable.\n\nEXT.

In it:  Bruce swims laps, knifing through the water\nwith powerful strokes.\n\nEXT. POOL - CLOSE ON BRUCE - NIGHT\n\nBruce churns through the water, eyes glazed with a total single-\nmindedness.  His speed is Olympian.  As he tilts his head to take\nanother gulp of air, he suddenly stops dead in the water as he sees:\n\nANGLE ON SILVER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nSilver emerges from the darkness, her glistening hair cascading down\nover an evening dress.  She carries a wooden tray with two glasses of\nchampagne on it, smiles as she faces a stunned Bruce who stands waist-\nhigh in the water.\n\nSILVER\nYou know, Bruce, you simply must\npick up your phone messages.\n\nBRUCE\n(careful pause)\nIf I did - what would they say?\n\nSILVER\nThat we were supposed to have dinner\ntonight.\n\nSilver smiles, kicks off her shoes.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nFor some strange reason, I thought you\nmight suddenly have an evening free.\n\n\nBRUCE\nSilver...look...\n(with difficulty)\nI...hope you won't misunderstand\nwhat I'm about to say...\n\nSILVER\nThere aren't going to be any more\nMisunderstandings between us, Bruce.\nAnd I warn you.\n\nSilver slowly and calmly begins walking down the steps into the pool,\ncarrying the tray with her.  The water rises above the hemline of her\nevening dress, heading up for her waist as she advance toward as\nastonished Bruce.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nI can be a very determined person.\n\nSilver arrives at Bruce, the water now up to her chest, letting the\nwooden tray with the champagne float on the surface next to them.  She\nhands him a glass, takes the other herself, raises it, stares deeply\ninto his eyes.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nTo no more misunderstandings.\n\nBruce smiles in spite of himself, tosses back his champagne, then\nstudies her unwavering gaze carefully.  Flipping the glass over his\nhead, he suddenly pulls her toward him, locking her in a passionate,\nhungry kiss.\n\nThey finally break.  Silver purrs, whispers into his ear.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nThere...see what I mean about mis-\nunderstandings?\n\nBRUCE\nNo.  What?\n\nSILVER\nWell just now - a moment ago - I\nthought you were being rude, not\ngetting out of the pool to say hello.\n(looks down; grins)\nI didn't realize you weren't wearing\na bathing suit.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nBruce lies naked under powder-blue silk sheets.  A lovely hand comes\nINTO FRAME, gently strokes his cheek.\n\nSILVER (O.S.)\nWhen I think of how many nights I've\nreached across an empty pillow, hoping\nmy hand would find that face...\n\nThen - a shining mane of hair as Silver, also naked, wraps him in a\ntight embrace.  They kiss.\n\nBRUCE\nThere's so much to explain.  And I'm\nnot quite sure I ever can.\n\nSILVER\nI don't need explanations.  I just\nwant whatever it was to evaporate.\nto simple disappear...\n\nShe rolls over, looks at him carefully.  A Police siren is heard\nfaintly in the distance.  Bruce blinks.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nDid you ever meet him?\n\nBRUCE\nWho?\n\nSILVER\nThe Batman.\n(smiles)\nEvery time I hear a siren.  I think\nof the Batman.\n\nBRUCE\nI...ran into him a few times.  Here\nand there.\n\nSilver smiles down tenderly, studying him.\n\nSILVER\nYou know...that night at the opera.  I\nnever believed that the real Batman\nwould show up like that in public -\nnot when he knew someone else's life\nwas on the line.\n\nBRUCE\n(deadly stare)\nYou're right.  He wouldn't.\n\nBruce suddenly breaks eye contact, unsure if she thinks she's talking\nabout Batman or to Batman.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nYou...met him too one night, didn't\nyou?  Commissiner Gordon told me he\ntook you home or something.\n\nSILVER\n(smiles; remembers)\nOr something.\n(pause)\nWhat can I say?  He was dashing, re-\nsourceful, strong - very sweet in\nhis own special way - all the\nthings you'd expect from the Batman.\n(grins)\nThe next morning I told Rupert I'd\nfallen madly in love with him.\n\nBRUCE\nYou don't say.\n\nSILVER\n(penetrating gaze)\nAnd what's more - I told Rupert I\nwas sure that the Batman...had\nfallen in love with me.\n\nThey look deeply into each other's eyes.

The Granny Clown edges over toward\nthe cage containing the big cats.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nOne Clown runs up the aisle past them with what seems to be a bucket of\nwater, spots Silver, flings the contents of the bucket at her!  Bruce\nand Silver flinch as a SHOWER OF CONFETTI blankets them to general\nlaughter and applause.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nNow let me direct your attention to\nthe trapeze and high wire.  Out\nstars of the evening - The Flying\nGraysons!\n\nANGLE ON GRAYSONS\n\nA family of aerialists.  The older Graysons, trim and athletic, stand\non one platform.

He\ntakes hold of a trapeze, swings down.\n\nANGLE ON STANDS\n\nThe Clown who poured the confetti on Bruce and Silver watches through\npancake makeup with more than a passing interest.  Protruding from\nunderneath a large silly hat:  we see the edges of a startling green\nshock of hair.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick Grayson swings on the trapeze in a long, powerful arc, executes a\ndifficult flip into the arms of his father.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBRUCE\nRemarkable.

He is the only flier\nin the world to accomplish this feet!\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nA DRUM ROLL is heard.  Dick swings down, picking up momentum, then back\nup, then down again.  On his third pass, he tries it:  revolves\ndizzyingly - MAKING FOUR COMPLETE SOMERSAULTS IN MID-AIR!  (Note:\nThere is, actually, only one person in the world who can do this, with\nRingling Bros.)  Dick completes the impossible feat to wild applause.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nOn their feet, applauding enthusiastically with the Crowd.\n\nANGLE ON CLOWN (JOKER)\n\nThe Clown (Joker) giggles under his breath, lifts one billowing sleeve\nof his oversized costume, begins to unbutton it.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nThe Graysons will now perform their\nworld-famous maneuver on the high-\nwire - passing each other and\nexchanging positions - all without\na net!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nBoth starring up, wide-eyed.\n\nANGLE ON GRAYSONS\n\nThe older Graysons stand at either end of a high wire some seventy feet\noff the ground.

It\nhesitates, then takes off!\n\nBACK TO GRAYSONS\n\nThey're face to face now, on the wire, preparing to pass each other\nabove the hushed Crowd.  Suddenly - the falcon flies into view, lands\nheavily on one end of the male Grayson's pole with a SHRIEK!  The\nsurprised man teeters - the wire trembles - the falcon suddenly flies\nat his face!  Both Grayson's tumble off the wire together, plummet\ndownward.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nAs his parents hit the ground heavily in front of him.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nSilver screams in horror.  Bruce stares unbelievingly.\n\nANGLE NEAR BIG CAT CAGE\n\nSuddenly:  the Granny Clown standing by the big cat cage rips his mask\naway!  The dress falls to the ground, revealing:\n\nTHE BATMAN!\n\nQUICK CUTS\n\n1. The Crowd gasps.\n\n2. Bruce gapes in disbelief as Silver watches him.\n\n3. Dick Grayson looks over from the bodies of his parents.\n\n4. The Joker grins.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nThe Batman stares coldly, speaks in a icily clear voice.\n\nBATMAN\nI've risked my life to help this\ncity.  I stood up for what I knew\nwas right because I thought you\npeople were willing to stand with\nme.  Well, now you can pay for your\ncowardice.  Now I don't care how\nmany have to die.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND CROWD\n\nAn angry MURMURING rumbles through the Crowd.\n\nCROWD #1\nCROWD #2\n\t\t  Stop him!\nDon't let him get away!\n\nBruce vaults into the aisle, lunges down the steps after the fake\nBatman as:\n\nCLOSE ON JOKER\n\nThe Joker takes off his huge clown nose, throws it into the arena - a\ngiant smoke bomb!\n\nAll over the arena, OTHER CLOWNS follow suit.  The big top has become a\nscene of impenetrable chaos as:\n\nTHE FAKE BATMAN OPENS THE DOOR TO THE BIG CATS CAGE!  Lions, tigers, et\nal., bound off their perches for freedom, rushing out of the cage to\nthe SCREAMS of the Crowd.\n\nThe fake Batman disappears into an enveloping wall of smoke.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nKnifing his way through the panicked Spectators, lunging through the\nsmoke after the fake Batman.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nSilver stumbles after Bruce through the pandemonium, reaching the empty\ncat cage, gasping for breath with teary eyes.\n\nSILVER\nBruce...?  Bruce!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nNearby.  Spotting her.  Eyes widening in horror!\n\nBRUCE\nSilver, look out!\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nA HUGE TIGER SNARLS, preparing to spring at her!  It launches itself\ninto mid-air as:\n\nBruce flies at Silver from the other direction, pulling her down to the\nground as the enormous cat sails over them, banging its head into the\ncage bars, knocking itself senseless.\n\nBruce pulls Silver to her feet, wraps a protective arm around her,\nleads her off through the smoky panic and confusion.\n\nANGLE ON DICK GRAYSON\n\nDick kneels protectively over the bodies of his parents, oblivious to\nthe insanity around him.  Spectators and Animals rush past in all\ndirections as he removes his aerialist's cape, then gently covers the\nfaces of his Mother and Father.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA LOOKS DOWN on the aftermath.  Police cars and ambulances\neverywhere.  Smoke still drifts from the big top.  Dazed PATRONS mill\naround looking for lost family members.\n\nANGLE NEAR BIG TOP ENTRANCE\n\nSilver emerges from a medical tent marked by a red cross, sporting a\nheavily bandaged hand.  She spots Alfred and the Rolls Royce near the\nentrance to the big top, walks over.\n\nSILVER\nThe doctor says no more crap games\nfor a week or so, Alfred...\n(stops; looks)\nWhere's Bruce?\n\nALFRED\n(hesitantly)\nMr. Wayne wondered...if you'd be good\nenough to let me drive you home.\n\nSILVER\nDrive me...\n\nShe looks off into the big top:\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE - HER P.O.V.\n\nBruce stands motionless in the dark shadows at one end of the tent.  He\nstares across the arena:\n\nANGLE ON DICK - BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nDick Grayson sits alone in the corner, head bowed.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce's eyes are filled with tears.\n\nBACK TO SILVER\n\nSilver watches, somehow feeling the deep significance of the moment\nwithout the specifics.  She turns to Alfred quietly, nods, gets in the\ncar.\n\nINT. TENT - CLOSE ON DICK\n\nDick is slumped, his head still bowed.  Tears roll down his cheeks.\nSuddenly - a dark shadow inches across his face, almost blacking it\nout.  He looks up.\n\nBruce stands over him, peering down, looking deeply into him with a\nmesmerizing stare.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat will you do now, son?\n\nDICK\nI...don't know.  They were my only\nfamily.  I...I...\n\nHe bursts into tears.  Bruce grabs him, holds him tightly.\n\nBRUCE\nI know exactly how you feel, son.\nYou may not believe that - but I do.\n\nBruce gazes down darkly, almost hypnotically, his eyes revealing the\ntruth.  Dick looks up slowly, riveted.\n\nSuddenly:  WE HEAR the sound of ANGRY MURMURING from a CROWD - then,\nthe RAPPING of a Judge's gavel, silencing them.\n\nINT. GOTHAM COURTHOUSE - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS DOWN from the symbol of Justice with her scales, painted on\nthe Gotham Courthouse ceiling.\n\nJUDGE (O.S.)\nI find you guilty of wanton negli-\ngence against society.  Of knowingly\ncausing the death of an innocent\nhuman being.\n\nA black-robbed JUDGE reads the verdict to a courthouse full of\nSPECTATORS, but an empty defense table.  The witness chair is also\nempty.  Alone at the prosecution table - Rupert Thorne.\n\nJUDGE (CONT'D)\nOf usurping the authority of those\nlegally sworn in to uphold law and\norder.  The time has come to be rid\nof you and your reckless vigilantism.\n\nBruce and Gordon sit in the front row.  Bruce's eyes reveal more\nemotion than he would care to.  The Judge turns to face the empty\nwitness chair.\n\nJUDGE (CONT'D)\nBatman - you have been tried in\nabsentia and found guilty of murder.\nYou are sentenced to death.\n(looks)\nMayor Thorne...\n\nThorne rises, pompous and grave.\n\nTHORNE\nYour Honor, this is a tragic day in\nthe history of Gotham.  A once-\nadmired champion of the people has\nnow become a threat to their very\nexistence.  A lethal weapon dealing\nin indiscriminate death.  Therefore,\nto prevent further carnage, I've in-\nstructed Commissioner Gordon and his\ndepartment to bring in the Batman by\nwhatever means necessary.\n\nThorne sits.  The stunned Spectators begin to murmur loudly.\n\nGORDON\nThe Batman.  A killer.  Who'd\nbelieve it...?\nBRUCE\nI still don't.\n\nGORDON\nBruce I deal in facts.  And the simple\nfact is - you're looking at one poor\nsonofabitch who made a deal with the\ndevil.\n\nBruce stares blankly at the witness chair.  The Judge pounds his gavel\nfor silence.  CAMERA ZOOMS IN on the gavel.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. SECOND COURTROOM - DAY\n\nCAMERA PULLS BACK from another gavel rapping in another courtroom,\nrevealing the face of a more benign JUDGE.\n\nJUDGE #2\n...therefore, by the power invested\nin this Court...\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nBruce and Dick Grayson stand facing the Judge.\n\nJUDGE #2\nI hereby declare Richard Grayson to\nbe the legally designated ward of\nMr. Bruce Wayne.\n(smiles)\nAnd may I add in passing - you're a\nvery fortunate young man.\n\nBRUCE\nThank you, Your Honor.

Alfred hurries to\nopen the front door as Bruce and Dick exit the car.  Dick stares up at\nthe sprawling residence in awe.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nAs Dick enters with Bruce:  the towering hallway of Wayne Manor is\nfilled with balloons and a banner reading:  \"WELCOME HOME, DICK.\"\nSilver grins down from the staircase.\n\nDick drinks it all in, slightly uneasy and embarrassed.  He wanders\ninto the enormous living room, unsure, visually adjusting himself to\nhis new, outsized life.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS ACROSS a fully outfitted trapeze and ring set on the lawn\nof Wayne Manor.  Bruce gazes up proudly at it, looks over to Dick for\nhis reaction.\n\nDick looks up at the apparatus somewhat apprehensively, then flashes\nBruce a self-conscious smile.  Bruce understands, claps a hand on his\nshoulder, leads him away.\n\nEXT. POOLSIDE - DAY\n\nDick lies sunning himself on a chaise by the pool.  Suddenly, a large,\nwet beach ball lands on his stomach.  He pops up, looks off toward the\npool:\n\nBruce and Silver laugh from inside the pool, gesture at Dick to come\nand join them.  He gives them a half-hearted smile, shakes his head,\nthen tosses the ball back.\n\nSilver looks at Bruce with concern.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR DINING ROOM - DAY\n\nDick toys with his food at lunch, looks over nicely at Bruce who is\ntalking non-stop from across the table.\n\nBRUCE\n...later on we'll pick up Silver and\ngo to that new magic musical every-\none's talking about.  We can't stay\nout too later - don't forget we've\nfor that doubleheader tomorrow...\n\nDICK\nSounds great.\n\nBRUCE\n(pause)\nIs something wrong, Dick?\n\nDick lowers his eyes, not wanting to respond.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nWe're all trying just a little too\nhard around here to make you feel at\nhome, right?\n\nDICK\n(with difficulty)\nIt's not that.  You've been wonder-\nful to me.  It's my fault you've\nhad to try so hard.  It's...\n(eyes misting)\nIt's just that I still hurt so much\nsometimes...and then I remember, and\nI get so filled with...hate again.\n\nBRUCE\nHate?\n\nDick's eyes harden.  His face sets with a cold look, not unlike that of\na young Bruce Wayne when he faced Joe Chill.\n\nDICK\nI made a promise to myself the day my\nparents died.  A promise that someday\n-- somehow - I'm going to keep.\n\nBruce's eyes flick over carefully.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat did you promise?\n\nDICK\nI'm going to kill the Batman.\n\nThere is a long silence.  Bruce smiles tentatively.\n\nBRUCE\nThat's a pretty tall order.\n\nDICK\nWe'll see.  I have the rest of my\nlife to get it done.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat if he's...skipped town?  Given\nthe whole thing up?  Died, even.  No\none ever knew who he was in the\nfirst place.  You can't dedicate\nyour whole life to killing a ghost.\n\nDICK\nI thought you'd understand when you\ntold me how your parents were\nkilled.  Didn't you feel the same way?\n\nBRUCE\n(avoiding his gaze)\nWell I was younger than you are,\nand...\n\nDICK\n(pressing him)\nDidn't you hate?  Didn't you want\nto do something about it?\n\nBRUCE\n(pause)\nYes.  For a while.  But then I...\n(looks down)\n...realized how fruitless it was.\n\nDICK\nWell that's not going to happen to\nme!\n\nDick rises from the table, looks over with total, piercing sincerity,\nhis eyes misting over again.\n\nDICK (CONT'D)\nListen, I'm...grateful for every-\nthing you've done for me - and for\nall you intend to do.  But if you\ncan't live with my promise, accept\nit, support it, even - then maybe\nwe've both made a mistake.\n(eyes glistening)\nMay I be excused now?\n\nBruce stares back, deeply moved, almost whispers.\n\nBRUCE\nYes.  Of course you can.\n\nDick hurries out the door.  Bruce grits his teeth, crumples up his\nnapkin, squeezing it into a tiny ball.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nDamn.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM INTERSECTION - NIGHT\n\nRupert Thorne walks briskly down the street, hat tipped low over his\nface, coat collar turned up against the night wind.  He arrives at a\ndeserted intersection, checks the cross street signs, then glances down\nat his watch impatiently.\n\nANGLE ON SIDE OF BUILDING\n\nTucked under a high ledge of a nearby building:  a mounted camera lens\nswivels, the moonlight glinting off its surface.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nRubbing his hands together.  Looking around at the empty streets,\nirritated.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nYou're late.\n\nThorne's head snaps around at he VOICE.  He sees nothing.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nWe shouldn't be seen together any-\nmore, Mr. Mayor.  You can't afford\nthe risk.\n\nThorne stares:  the Joker's Voice is coming from inside a short,\nstanding mailbox on the corner.\n\nThorne hesitates, then slowly moves to the mailbox, tilts back the\nletter slot, mutters, looking around nervously.\n\nTHORNE\nI feel like a Goddamn idiot...\n\nINT. JOKER'S LAIR - NIGHT\n\nThe Joker speaks into a microphone attached to a tiny transmitting set.\n\nA VIDEO SCREEN above shows Thorne standing by the mailbox.\n\nNOTE:  THIS SCENE TO BE INTERCUT AS REQUIRED:\n\nJOKER\nThat's what I felt like twenty years\nago, Thorne.  When I decided to start\noff your political career with a\n\"bang.\"  Remember Thomas Wayne?\n\nTHORNE\n(cold pause)\nEvery time I see his son.\n\nJOKER\nNo regrets now, Mr. Mayor.  It's\ntaken me too long to maneuver us\ninto a position of total control in\nthis city.  I've got the judges\nlined up, the public at your feet...\n(cold pause)\nYou owe me, Rupert Thorne.\n\nTHORNE\nIt's a two-way street.  Once I\nrelieve Commissioner Gordon of his\nduties, you'll have a free rein in\nGotham - less my cut.  And now that\nit's legal to shoot the Batman...\n\nJOKER\nWe have to find him first.  So far,\nit's been like looking for a virgin\nin a maternity ward.\n\nTHORNE\nThen don't find him.  Let him find\nYou.\n\nJOKER\nHow?  If the real Batman wouldn't\neven appear at the opera to save the\nMayor...\n\nTHORNE\nThe Batman wasn't in love with the\nMayor.  He is in love...with a\ncertain young lady.  Or so she tells\nme and I've never known her to lie.\n\nJOKER\nWhat is she, a mute?\n\nTHORNE\n(deadly)\nCareful.  You may be talking about\nthe future Mrs. Thorne.  I...want\nyou to kidnap her.\n\nJOKER\nNow take my wife - please...\n\nTHORNE\nThe girl is not to be harmed.  Once\nyou've killed Batman and made your\nescape - I'll call the police and\nrescue her.\n\nJOKER\nHer knight in shining armor.\n\nTHORNE\nSomething like that.\n\nJOKER\nI underestimated you, Thorne.  I always\nknew you were corrupt, but I had no\nidea you'd turn out to be such a\ndelightfully repellent human being.\n\nThe Joker cackles insanely.  Thorne spots someone coming, closes the\nslot, hurries off.\n\nAfter a beat, an ANCIENT WOMAN approaches the mailbox with a handful of\nletters.  She lowers the slot.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\n(outraged)\nDo you mind?  I'll never get these\npictures developed!\n\nThe Woman SCREAMS!  Her letters go flying up in the air as she hustles\ndown the street.  The insane giggle of the Joker trails off into the\nnight.\n\nINT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nSilver is dressed in a lacy, powder-blue slip, exits her dressing room,\ncombing her hair.  The DOORBELL RINGS.\n\nSILVER\n(crossing)\nWho is it?\n\nVOICE\n(through door)\nGotham Florists, lady.  For a Miss\nSt. Cloud.\n\nSilver looks through the peephole.\n\nANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE\n\nA DELIVERY BOY waits, head down, holding a bouquet.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nSilver opens the doors slightly, sticks her arm out.  The Delivery Boy\nthrusts the bouquet in her hand.\n\nDELIVERY BOY\nSay it with flowers...\n\nSILVER\nWhat a surprise!...\n\nShe inhales the aroma of the bouquet deeply.  Her eyes become glassy.\nShe drops to the floor.\n\nDELIVERY BOY\nWhat a straight man!\n\nHe swings the door open.  It is the Joker.\n\nINT. POLICE HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nThorne strides purposefully down the hallway, followed by a reluctant\nSergeant Haley.\n\nHALEY\n...I don't know, Your Honor.  I\nmean, you're the Mayor and all that\n-- but I work for the Commissioner.\n\nTHORNE\nAs of tomorrow morning, no one works\nfor the Commissioner.  I'm relieving\nhim of his duties.\n\nThey have arrived at Gordon's door.  Haley is shocked.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI assume you'll be staying on, Ser-\ngeant - as a loyal member of the\nforce?\n\nHALEY\nI...hope to, Sir.\n\nTHORNE\nThen open it.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nHaley's key opens the door.  They enter.  Thorne looks around, spots\nthe red phone connected to the Batcave.\n\nTHORNE\nAnyone have the bright idea to run a\ntrace on this.\n\nHALEY\nYes, sir.  First day it was installed.\nBut all we ever got back was an echo\nof our own number.  Guy's amazing,\nisn't he?\n\nTHORNE\nOh, he's a crafty one, all right.\nThanks, Haley.  That's all.\n\nINT.

WAYNE MANOR STUDY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred is tidying up the study, turns as Dick appears.\n\nDICK\nAll right if I make a sandwich in\nthe kitchen, Alfred?\n\nALFRED\nWhy certainly, Master Grayson.  If I\nmay be of help...\n\nDICK\n(grin)\nI think I can handle it.  Thanks.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nBruce sits at the computer, runs through a criminal history of the\nJoker on the video screen.  He pauses, looks off.\n\nANGLE ON BATPHONE\n\nThe red Batphone lights up, then dies.  Lights up, then dies.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring.  Unsure.\n\nINT. WAYNE STUDY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred reaches to turn off the desk lamp.  Suddenly, the light from the\nlamp rises, then dies.  Rises, then dies.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThorne sits, Batphone in hand, waits.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce crosses to the phone.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred presses the button under the desk.  The bottom drawer pops open.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce picks up the phone, listens.\n\nBACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE\n\nTHORNE\nBatman?\n(no reply)\nBatman - if you're there - this is\nMayor Rupert Thorne.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce listens silently, frowning.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred holds the extension, listens in as well.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nNOTE:  THIS CONVERSATION TO BE INTERCUT BETWEEN THORNE, BRUCE, AND\nALFRED AS REQUIRED:\n\nTHORNE\nThis...isn't easy for me, Batman,\nconsidering what I've said and done\nwhere you're concerned.  But I love\nSilver St. Cloud very much - and I\nhave reason to believe you do too.\n\nBruce and Alfred react in their respective locations.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI...dropped by to have a drink with\nher tonight.  The door was open,\nthere were signs of a struggle, and\nshe was gone.  The Joker left a\nplaying card - addressed to you.\n\nBruce's face sets darkly.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\n\"Dear Batman.  Crime fighters may come\nand go, but I carry on in the Great\nAmerican Tradition of violence.  I'm\ncalling my little caper, Slaughter In\nSilver.  Sorry I have to run now.\nWrite if you get work.\"\n\nBruce's eyes narrow, thinking.  Thorne's voice begins to crack\nemotionally over the phone.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI...don't know where they took her\n...or why the note was left for you.\nI only know that Silver means more\nthan my life to me, and I beg you to\nfind her and save her.  You're her\nonly chance, Batman, I...\n\nThorne's voice dies away theatrically.  He hangs up.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce hangs up, stares coldly.  His jaw twitches.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred hangs up in the study, worried.\n\nBACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE\n\nThorne takes a deep breath, smiles, rises, exits.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nDick has made his sandwich, closes the refrigerator door, starts off\nfor the hallway.\n\nANGLE ON HALLWAY ENTRANCE\n\nDick enters the dark hallway, starts for the stairs as he sees:\n\nANGLE ON ALFRED - HIS P.O.V.\n\nAlfred rushes out of the study, heading for the living room.  He slips,\nfalls heavily, picks himself up, oblivious to the pain, rushes into the\nliving room.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nWatching.  He starts for the stairs, then stops, now curiously heads\nfor the living room himself.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nDick enters, look around in amazement:  Alfred is nowhere to be seen!\nHis eyes scan the room for any other exit.\n\nANGLE ON GRANDFATHER CLOCK - DICK'S P.O.V.\n\nThe tall grandfather clock stands against one wall.  A thin shaft of\nlight seems to be emanating from behind it.\n\nDick advances to the clock, looks down, puzzled.  It seems to be\nstanding at a slight angle away from the wall.  Exploring the edge of\nthe clock with his hand, he starts to pull back.  The clock swivels,\nrevealing:\n\nANGLE DOWN INTO BATCAVE - DICK'S P.O.V.\n\nThe Batcave - with all its trophies, computers - in all its regal\nsplendor.  Alfred is standing near the gleaming Batmobile, looks off\nwith concern.\n\nNow emerging from the shadows - THE BATMAN!  Dressed in his full\nregalia, heading quickly toward Alfred and the Batmobile.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nStaring down, his jaw slack.  Stunned.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nBatman crosses to Alfred, who stares with deadly concern.\n\nALFRED\nDon't go, Sir.\n\nBATMAN\nPlease get out of my way, Alfred.\n\nALFRED\nSince when have you trusted Rupert\nThorne?  You don't even know where\nyou're meant to be going.\n\nBATMAN\nThe clues in the note were obvious.\nThe \"Great American Tradition\" line?\nThat's the name of this year's series\nof exhibits at the Gotham Museum.\nAnd \"Write if you get work\"?  This\nmonth it's on American writers and\nWriting.\n\nALFRED\nIf the clues are that obvious, they\nmust want you to come.  It's a\ntrap, can't you see that?\n\nBATMAN\nThat boy up there thinks the Batman\nkilled his parents.  I told him he\ncouldn't live his whole life chasing\na ghost.  What I realize now is - I\ncan't live the rest of my life\nbeing a ghost.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nListening at the top of the stairs.  Thunderstruck.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nBatman puts an arm on Alfred's shoulder.\n\nBATMAN\nIf I come back, old friend, I'll\nexplain things to Dick.  Tell him\nthe truth and have the Joker to\nprove it.\n(pause)\nAnd if I don't - take care of him,\nAlfred.  He'll be in much better\nhands than he has been in mine.\n\nAlfred silently steps aside as Batman enters the Batmobile, roars off\nthrough the cave.\n\nAlfred pauses sadly, then turns back, heading for the staircase again.\nHe looks up.\n\nANGLE ON DICK - ALFRED'S P.O.V.\n\nDick stands at the top of the stairs, staring down, grimly determined,\nhis face carved in granite.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM ROOFTOPS - NIGHT\n\nBatman's silhouette as he leaps and glides effortlessly across the tops\nof buildings.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\nThe deserted museum with the billboard:  GREAT AMERICAN TRADITIONS.\nThis month:  American Writers and Writing.\n\nEXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT\n\nThe museum roof is a network of vaulted glass skylights.  TWO THUGS\nstand on a surrounding catwalk.\n\nCLOSE ON CATWALK\n\nA sharp metallic \"ping\" is heard across the catwalk.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Thugs look up.  One pulls a gun.\n\nTHUG\nThe Batman...\n\nBATMAN'S VOICE\nCount on it.\n\nThey wheel.  Batman stands directly behind them.  He grabs the first\nThug, swivels him as the second Thug fires - killing his partner.\nBatman shoves the dead man into the second Thug, as both bodies crash\ndown through the glass skylight.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - UP ANGLE - NIGHT\n\nThe bodies explode through the glass, falling some sixty feet to the\nfloor.  Then - total silence.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStaring down through the broken glass.  Listening.  He pulls a tiny\nrevolver from his belt.  A barbed metal dart sticks out of the barrel.\nBatman aims it through the hole, fires.\n\nANGLE ON MUSEUM RAFTERS\n\nThe dart embeds itself deeply into a rafter.  Attached to it is a white\nnylon cord.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nSecuring the other end of the cord.  He hooks himself to it with a\nclip, glides through the opening in the glass.\n\nBACK TO RAFTERS\n\nBatman shoots silently along the cord to a rafter, lands gracefully,\nlooks down.\n\nANGLE DOWN ON MUSEUM - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThrough the dim, eerie light.  This exhibit (like the one including the\ngiant penny) consists of huge, outsized version of everyday items.  In\nthis case - the tools of a writer's trade:  enormous pencils, erasers,\nquill pens, fountain pens, ink wells, a ten-foot-high pencil sharpener,\ntall volumes of famous American novels, etc.\n\nIn the center of the display - a giant electric typewriter, some thirty\nfeet wide.  A huge sheet of blank white paper is rolled up on it.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStaring down curiously through the silent darkness.  His gaze starts to\nwander, then suddenly spots something.\n\nBACK TO TYPEWRITER\n\nA FIGURE attached to the typewriter now moves.  It is Silver, hooked\nonto the ribbon near the center of the page.  She moans, still\nrecovering from the effects of the drugs.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nEyes widening.  He hooks one end of a nylon cord to a rafter, launches\nhimself, swinging down toward Silver.\n\nBACK TO RAFTER\n\nA hand with a knife reaches out, slices through the cord!\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nNow plummeting like a rock.  He falls into the typewriter in front of\nSilver, his cape suddenly catching on something, partially ripping it,\njerking him to a stop.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe lights are turned on.  Emerging from behind or under the various\nexhibits:  thirty or forty GOONS.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman hangs helplessly from the circular element ball which prints out\nthe characters on the page.  His cape is caught on the projected edge\nof one of the giant letters.  He stares ahead, unable to extricate\nhimself.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nThe glaring lights have brought Silver back to consciousness.  Hooked\nto the huge ribbon near the center of the page, she suddenly spots\nBatman across from her.\n\nSILVER\n(horrified)\nOh, my God...\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nStepping out onto the end of the carriage - the Joker!\n\nJOKER\nI knew you'd drop in, Batman.\nYou're that type of guy.\n(insane giggle)\nGet it?  Type?\n\nThe forty Goons circle in around the typewriter.  The Joker nods to two\nof them.\n\nCLOSE ON SWITCH\n\nTwo Goons give a mighty heave, flip the \"ON\" lever.  A loud hum is\nheard as the typewriter activates.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nRupert Thorne hides in the shadows behind a large pencil box, watches\nthe scene.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nYou know, you're nothing to write\nhome about, Batman - but let's give\nit a try.\n\nThe Joker points a gun down at the keyboard.\n\nJOKER\nWhat letter could be hiding under\nyour cape?  A \"D', maybe?\n\nThe Joker fires:\n\nCLOSE ON LETTER \"D\"\n\nThe bullet hits the letter \"D\", depressing it.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nThe element ball carrying Batman shifts, hurtles toward the page with\nblinding speed.  It \"cracks\" against the paper sharply, imprinting a\n\"D\".  Batman's head has stopped mere inches from the page.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nEyes welded shut - terrified.  The printing of the letter has advanced\nthe ribbon.  She is perilously close to the exact center of the page.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nNot the \"D\".  Hmm.  The most common\nletter is \"E\"...\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nThe Joker fires!  Batman flies toward the page, this time nearly\nsquashed on the other side.  A giant \"E\" has been imprinted.  Silver\nadvances one more position on the ribbon.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nAn \"A\", maybe...\n\nThe element ball spins, hurtles toward the paper again.  It splats into\nthe page, narrowly missing Batman, pushing Silver along again.\nImmediately - another shot - the ball whizzes back, prints another \"D\".\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nI know I tried the \"D\" before, but I\nsimply couldn't resist.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe message on the page reads \"DEAD\".  The trembling Silver is only one\nletter away from being obliterated.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStruggling, but helpless.  His eyes flash nervously.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nAlarmed as he sees what could happen to Silver.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nI know what letter is hidden under\nyour cape, by the way.  It's \"B\" -\nfor Batman.  But you see, I've got a\nproblem.  If I hit the letter \"B\",\nMiss St. Cloud will die, and I pro-\nmised not to kill her.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nGrim.  Pulling a gun.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nTo \"B\" or not to \"B\"...That seems to\nbe the question.  Well, I suppose\npromises - like laws - are made to\nbe broken.\n\nVOICE\nI made a promise, too, Joker.  The\nnight you killed my parents.\n\nQUICK CUTS:\n\nThorne looks up.  Silver looks up.  Batman looks up.  The Joker looks\nup.\n\nANGLE ON ROBIN - THEIR P.O.V.\n\nDick Grayson stands high in the rafters.\n\nDICK\nI promised to wipe filthy crud like\nyou off the face of the earth.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nShoot him!\n\nThere is a hail of gunfire as Dick flies down through the air toward\nthe typewriter.\n\nDick lands on the \"TAB\" key.  The carriage releases, shoots across the\ntypewriter, carrying the Joker with it.  He flies off the end, crashes\nsickeningly into the wall, drops to the floor, unconscious.\n\nDick bounces off the \"TAB\", flies across the keyboard, lands on the\n\"SHIFT\" key.\n\nDICK\nThat ought to give you a lift,\nBatman!\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nThe \"SHIFT\" swivels the element ball 180-degress to expose the capital\nletters.  Batman is swung to the front, grabs the carriage, pulls\nhimself up, looks down as Dick launches himself into a pile of Goons\nlike a human dynamo.\n\nBATMAN\nLeave a few for me, son!\n\nBatman leaps off the carriage, joins Dick in the fray.\n\nNOTE:  The fight which follows will be outrageous and thrilling, but\nshould look physically believable.  The Dynamic Duo will overpower the\ngang using the following elements and devices:\n\nA. Dick flinging Goons back into the pointed tips of quill pens.\n\nB. Batman lifting a fountain pen lever, firing a river of ink at an\nonrushing group.\n\nC. Both of them using springy, huge erasers as launching platforms.\n\nD. Oversized volumes of literature slamming shut on the villains.\n\nE. Enormous bookmarks and letter openers swung as clubs, knocking out\nthree or four crooks at a time.\n\nF. Heavies being hurled into huge, deep ink wells, turning them sopping\nblack wet, unable to climb out again.\n\nG. Dick bashing a pair of Thugs back into the side of the giant pencil\nsharpener.  They slam back against the \"ON\" button, activating it.\n\nDuring the chaos, Rupert Thorne has made his way down the typewriter's\nsteel bar which holds the paper to the roller.  He unhooks Silver,\nlifts her to safety.\n\nSILVER\nRupert?  What...\n\nTHORNE\nDon't talk.  Let's go.\n\nThe fight continues as Rupert and Silver run down the bar, drop off the\ntypewriter, cross the floor through the furious melee, heading for the\ndoor.  Batman rounds the corner of a giant book.  Silver spots him,\nstops.\n\nSILVER\nBatman?...Batman!...\n\nThorne yanks at her.  She tries to pull away, sees two Goons coming up\nbehind Batman.\n\nSILVER\nBruce!  Look out!\n\nBatman ducks, rolls, trips the Goons, knocks their heads together.\nSilver rushes toward him as Thorne pulls a gun, realizing.\n\nTHORNE\nBruce...Bruce Wayne...\n\nBATMAN\nSilver!  Get away!\n\nDick has bashed a Goon backwards - he careens across the floor, hits\nSilver from the side, knocking her into Batman as Thorne fires.\n\nCLOSE ON SILVER\n\nBlood spurts quickly across the lacy back of Silver's powder-blue slip.\nBatman hooks an arm around her, stares into her dying face, struck\ndumb.\n\nSILVER\n(trembling)\nI'm...right...aren't I...Bruce.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nHorrified.  He turns, runs.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nGiving chase.  Dodging bullets as Thorne fires at him.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nLowering Silver to the floor.  She's barely breathing.  Thorne's\ngunfire echoes through the museum.  Batman's jaw twitches.  His eyes\nflash with rage.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick rounds the corner of a giant prop some ten feet high off the\nfloor.  Thorne waits for him on the next prop - gun poised and ready.\nDick spots him, freezes.\n\nTHORNE\nI don't know what part you play in\nall this, kid.  But it's turned out\nto be a one-night stand.\n\nBATMAN'S VOICE\n(roaring with rage)\nMay God damn you, Rupert Thorne!\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nBatman has placed a huge, viciously sharp thumbtack in a giant rubber\nband pulled taut.  He lets it fly.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nThe thumbtack spears Thorne in the chest, topples him back across the\nprop - which is the giant pencil sharpener - he falls into the hole:  A\ndisappearing scream is cut short as Thorne is ground to death.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman kneels, cradles Silver's head in his lap.  Her eyes flutter open\npainfully.  She tries to smile.\n\nSILVER\nHello...Bruce...\n\nHe stares down, eyes filled with tears.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nMaybe...it's better, you know?\nI'd...just...get in the way...\n\nBATMAN\n(low whisper)\nDon't...\n\nSILVER\nI could...never really have you, and\n...I could never fall in love with\nsomeone else.\n\nHer eyelids tremble.  One of his tears hits her cheek softly.  She\nreaches up, gently caresses his chin.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nPoor...darling...you're the one...\nwho's...left behind...\n\nHer eyes close.  Her face relaxes, dead.  Tears stream heavily down\nBatman's cowl.\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nINT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\nCommissioner Gordon supervises the aftermath and cleanup,  The Joker,\nstill groggy, handcuffed, is yanked along by a COP.\n\nJOKER\nTake it easy, okay?  I get winded\nopening clams.\n\nHe is led away.  Gordon stares across the room.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman stands by Silver's body which has been placed on a gurney.  TWO\nPARAMEDICS cover her face with a blanket.\n\nBATMAN\nWait.\n\nThey stop.  He reaches in, pulls back the blanket, stares down at her\nface.  Gordon has crossed to join him.\n\nGORDON\nWhat a Goddamn shame.  You know\nwho's going to be really broken up\nabout this - Bruce Wayne.\n\nBatman turns, glances at Gordon blankly.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nThey were real close, you know.  Or\nmaybe you didn't.\n\nGordon turns, paces thoughtfully.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nBut at least you're back, I'm\nback, and all's right with this\ncrazy world for a second.  Now I\ndon't know where the hell this kid\nthey're talking about went to,\nbut...\n\nHe turns, looks.  Batman has disappeared.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - DAWN\n\nThe gurney carrying Silver's body is loaded into an ambulance.  It\ntakes off, red lights flashing, siren wailing.  The rising sun is just\nbeginning to crack the clouds on the horizon.  CAMERA WIDENS, STARTS TO\nRISE:\n\nThe ambulance becomes a tiny red dot as we now view the magnificent\ndowntown section of Gotham.\n\nCAMERA CONTINUES TO RISE, SHOOTING UP some eighty stories, then ninety,\nthen one hundred, finally revealing:\n\nWE DISSOLVE AS:\n\nThe dark, majestic figure of the Batman, standing on the top edge of\nthe tallest building in Gotham.  He looks down silently, cape billowing\nout behind him, a regal black prince surveying his steel and concrete\nrealm.\n\nNow swinging up and across from a nearby lower building:\n\nTHE IMPOSING, GRIM-FACED, COLORFUL FIGURE OF ROBIN!  Dressed in his\ngreen shirt, red vest, flowing yellow cape and black mask, he lands on\nthe roof noiselessly.\n\nBatman's eyes acknowledge his presence without turning.  Robin\nadvances, then stops silently, several paces behind.\n\nThe DYNAMIC DUO has been joined.  Both for now, and for the future\nadventures which await them in Gotham.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nTHE ENDEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/2873419", "artist_names":

She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But,\nyou can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.\nCLARENCE\nIn \"Jailhouse Rock\" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is\nrockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck\nabout anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and\nleaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big\nhe's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and\nhe's singing, \"Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care\". Now, they got\nhim dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this\nhorrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him\nwearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party,\nbig house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd\nwatch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm\nno fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most\nwomen. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too cause my\nlife depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.\n\nLucy takes a drag from her cigarette.\n\nLUCY\nI'd fuck Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nReally?\n\nLUCY\nWhen he was alive.

DINGY HOTEL ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nThe sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots\nand violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained\nblack.\n\nOn the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of\ncocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the\nsuitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. \"Bewitched\" is\nplaying.\n\nAt the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and\nFLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic\nbags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't\nknow it listen to him.\n\nDREXL\nNigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.\n\nFLOYD\nNaw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.\n\nDREXL\nThat's bullshit.\n\nBIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl\nand Floyd.

If I ever did eat some pussy \u221a I would never eat any pussy \u221a but,\nif I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be\nashamed as a motherfucker.\n\nBIG D\nShit!

Now what would you do.\n\nFLOYD\nI'd say fuck it!\n\nDrexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd\nsitting all alone.\n\nBig D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching \"Bewitched\".\n\nFLOYD\n(yelling after them)\nAin't no man have to eat pussy!\n\nBIG D\n(not even looking)\nTake that shit somewhere else.\n\nDRXL\n(marching back)\nYou tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?\n\nFLOYD\nIf it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.\n\nDREXL\nWith that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy,\nkiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger,\nyou'd aim to please.\n\nBIG D\n(glued on TV)\nI'm hip.\n\nDREXL\nIn fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D,\ntoss me that shotgun.\n\nWithout turning away from \"Bewitched\" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to\nDrexl.\n\nDREXL\n(to Floyd)\nAll right, check this out.\n(referring to shotgun)\nNow, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you.\n\nThen, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.\n\nBig D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.\n\nDrexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.\n\nThe blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.\n\nDrexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.\n\nBig D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops.\n\nDrexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves. As he gets to the front\ndoor he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out.\n\nEXT.

CLIFF'S MOVING CAR \u221a MORNING\n\nCLIFF WORLEY is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently\nto the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In\nbetween singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a\nsecurity guard uniform.\n\nEXT. TRAILER PARK \u221a MORNING\n\nCliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning. He pulls up to his trailer to see\nsomething that stops him short.\n\nCLIFF'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD\n\nClarence and a nice-looking YOUNG WOMAN are watching for him in front\nof his trailer.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a CLIFF\n\nUpon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down Cliff's cheek.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLIFF'S POV\n\nClarence and the Young Woman walk over to the car. Clarence sticks his face\nthrough the driver's side window.\n\nCLARENCE\nGood Morning, Daddy. Long time no see.\n\nINT. TRAILER HOME \u221a MORNING\n\nAll three enter the trailer home.\n\nCLIFF\nExcuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late. Sorry if\nI'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected\nto see this morning.\n\nClarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room.\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people. I'm dyin'\non thirst, you got anything to drink?\n\nHe moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator.\n\nCLIFF\nI think there's a Seven-Up in there.\n\nCLARENCE\n(rumaging around the fridge)\nAnything stronger?\n(pause)\nOh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?\n\nCLIFF\nI can, but I don't.\n\nCLARENCE\n(closing the fridge)\nThat's about all I ever eat.\n\nCliff looks at the Girl. She smiles sweetly at him.\n\nCLIFF\n(to Girl)\nI'm sorry... I'm his father.\n\nYOUNG GIRL\n(sticking her hand out)\nThat's OK, I'm his wife.\n(shaking his hand vigorously)\nAlabama Worley, pleased to meetcha.\n\nShe is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman. However, that's\nwhere the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere.\n\nClarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit\nmagnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama.\n\nCLARENCE\nOh yeah, we got married.\n(referring to the magnets)\nYou still have these.\n(to Alabama)\nThis isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one.\nI never shit it out, so I guess it's still there. Loverdoll, why don't you be a\nsport and go get us some beer. I want some beer.\n(to Cliff)\nDo you want some beer? Well, if you want some it's here.\n\nHe hands her some money and his car keys.\n\nCLARENCE\nGo to the liquor store \u221a\n(to Cliff)\nWhere is there a liquor store around here?\n\nCLIFF\nUh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nGet a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get\ncause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if\nnot, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look,\nsince you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a\nfoot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-\nDongs.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.\n(to Cliff)\nWhat do you think would taste good?\n\nCLIFF\nI'm really not very \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a\nwhile. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer,\ndefinitly, absolutely, without a doubt.\n(to Cliff)\nWhere's a good chicken place around here?\n\nCLIFF\nI really don't know.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou don't know the chicken places around where you live?\n(to Alabama)\nAsk the guy at the place where a chicken place is.\n\nHe gives her some more money.\n\nCLARENCE\nThis should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.\n\nALABAMA\nOkee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.\n\nShe opens the door and starts out. Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts.\n\nCLARENCE\nIsn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is\nshe a four alarm fire, or what?\n\nCLIFF\nShe seems very nice.\n\nCLARENCE\nDaddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only\nword for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in\nlove with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's\nwritten all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we\ngotta talk \u221a\n\nCLIFF\nClarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how\nmuch like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and\nthrough. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a\nsudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn\nbulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down.\nNow, when did you get married?\n\nCLARENCE\nDaddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.\n\nBLACK TITLE CARD: \"HOLLYWOOD\"\n\nINT.

I mean, that's me.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nStep inside.\n\nINT. CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE \u221a DAY\n\nShe sits behind a large desk. Her name-plate rests on the desktop. Several\nposters advertising \"The Return of T.J. Hooker\" hang on the wall.\n\nDick sits in a chair, holding his sheets in his hands.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nWell, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and\nMarty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for\nthe part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's\nhanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off.\n(she picks a up a copy of the script)\nWhenever you're ready.\n\nDICK\n(reading and miming driving)\nWhere'd you come from?\n\nRAVENCROFT\n(reading from the script lifelessly)\nI don't know. He just appeared as magic.\n\nDICK\n(reading from script)\nWell, don't just sit there, shoot him.\n\nShe puts her script down, and smiles at him.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nThat was very good.\n\nDICK\nThank you.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nIf we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?\n\nDICK\nSure.

You're a very fine actor.\n\nDick smiles.\n\nINT. TRAILER HOME \u221a DAY\n\nCliff's completely aghast. He just stares, unable to come to grips with what\nClarence has told him.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel\nfree.\n\nCLIFF\nYou're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes.\nMaking jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a\njoke about this \u221a\n(raising his voice)\n\u221a I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!\n\nCliff pauses and collects himself.\n\nCLIFF\nWhat do you want from me?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nCLIFF\nStop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in\nsome way. What do you need from me? You need money?\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you still have friends on the force?\n\nCLIFF\nYes, I still have friends on the force.\n\nCLARENCE\nCould you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit\nabout us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for\nsure what's goin' on.\n(pause)\nDaddy?\n\nCLIFF\nWhat makes you think I could do that?\n\nCLARENCE\nYou were a cop.\n\nCLIFF\nWhat makes you think I would do that?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm your son.\n\nCLIFF\nYou got it all worked out, don't you?\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to\nmake your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced\nyou, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a\nyear at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always \"OK\",\n\"No problem\", \"You're a busy guy, I understand\". The whole time you\nwere a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No!\nEverybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad\nparent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm\nbasically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask.\nAnd if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.\n\nAlabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag.\n\nALABAMA\nThe forager's back.\n\nCLARENCE\nThank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.\n\nALABAMA\nI didn't get any chicken.\n\nCLARENCE\nHow come?\n\nALABAMA\nIt's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.\n\nINT. TRAILER HOME \u221a BEDROOM \u221a DAY\n\nCliff's on the telephone in his bedroom, pacing as he talks. The living room od\nthe trailer can be seen from his doorway, where Clarence and Alabama are\nhorsing around. They giggle and cut up throughout the scene. As Cliff talks, all\nthe noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line. He's\ntalking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force.\n\nWe see both inside the conversation.\n\nCLIFF\nIt's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.\n\nWILSON\nWhat about him?\n\nCLIFF\nWell, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it\nmight be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible\nfor that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.\n\nWILSON\nAre you still working security for Foster & Langley?\n\nCLIFF\nYeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in\nfor the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while\nI have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?\n\nWILSON\nMcTeague.\n\nCLIFF\nI don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?\n\nWILSON\nI don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?\n\nCLIFF\nYou and Robin moved?\n\nWILSON\nShit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got\nmyself a new place \u221a mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the\nbed.

TRAILER HOME \u221a DAY\n\nClarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang. Alabama's amusing\nherself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background.\n\nCLIFF\nThey have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo tell. Why drug related?\n\nCLIFF\nApparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo shit?\n\nCLIFF\nYeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name\nmean anything to you?\n\nCLARENCE\nNope.\n\nCLIFF\nIf you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.\n\nCLARENCE\nWho is he?\n\nCLIFF\nGangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look,\nClarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did\nthe right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops\naren't looking for me?\n\nCLIFF\nNaw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou\nhad a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nClarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it.\n\nCLARENCE\nThanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.\n\nCLIFF\nI got some money I can give you \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nKeep it.\n\nCLIFF\nWell, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and\nAlabama.

Remeber, you got a wife to think about.\nQuit fuckin' around.\n(pause)\nI love you son.\n\nThey hug each other,\n\nClarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nThis is Dick's number in Hollywood. We don't know where we'll be, but\nyou can get a hold of me through him.\n\nClarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her.\n\nCLARENCE\nBama, we're outta here. Kiss Pops goodbye,\n\nAlabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff\nand gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's\nbubbling like a Fresca.\n\nALABAMA\nBye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.\n\nCLARENCE\n(mock anger)\nWhat kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?\n\nALABAMA\nOh, hush up.\n\nThe two get into the Mustang.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Cliff)\nWe'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood.\n\nClarence starts the engine. The convertible roof opens as they talk.\n\nCLIFF\nBama, you take care of that one for me. Keep him out of trouble.\n\nALABAMA\nDon't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin' this fella on a short leash.\n\nClarence, slowly, starts driving away.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Cliff)\nAs the sun sets slowly in the west we bid a fond farewell to all the friends\nwe've made... and, with a touch of melancholy, we look forward to the time\nwhen we will all be together again.\n\nClarence peels out, shooting a shower of gravel up in the air.\n\nAs the Mustang disappears Cliff runs his tongue over his lips.\n\nCLIFF\nThe-son-of-a-bitch was right... she does taste like a peach.\n\nINT. DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a DAY\n\nDick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor. Things are pretty neat\nand clean. A nice stereo unit sits on the shelf.

I'm Alabama Worley.\n\nDICK\nHello, Alabama.\n\nALABAMA\nI can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were\nhis best friend.

DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a DAY\n\nDick hears the click on the other end.\n\nDICK\nHello, hello, Clarence? Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama... hello?\n\nExtremely confused, Dick jangs up the phone.

TRAILER \u221a DAY\n\nA lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in\nfront of it in the shape of a planet.\n\nA big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly\nless kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a\nfast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.\n\nINT. TRAILER \u221a DAY\n\nHe steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to\nhis temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder.\n\nGUN CARRIER (DARIO)\nWelcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party.\n\nCliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men,\nstanding: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy),\nand TOOTH-PICK VIC (a fireplug pitbull type).\n\nSitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid\nmob leader Blue Lou Boyle.\n\nCliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario\nand Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(to Frankie)\nTell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what.\n\nIn Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits.\n\nCliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff.\nFrankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his\nhand, but he has yet to touch a drop.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nDo you know who I am, Mr. Worley?\n\nCLIFF\nI give up. Who are you?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell\nthe angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly\npersonified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is\nVincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man\nyour son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard\nof us before. Am I correct?\n\nCLIFF\nI've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question\nyou've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and,\nat the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.\n(taking out a pack of Chesterfields)\nWant a Chesterfield?\n\nCLIFF\nNo.\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(as he lights up)\nI have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful\nthis must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his\nbrought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road\nwith 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a\nchoice.\n\nCLIFF\nLook, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence \u221a\n\nBefore Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with\nhis fist.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSmarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got that\npain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It ain't any\nkind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's ever gonna\nget, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors.\nThey saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in\nfront of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your son?\n\nCliff's defeated.\n\nCLIFF\nI've seen him.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nNow I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance\nyou're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore\nyour boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't\njust mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity.\nWell, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do\nsome business, cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room\nblastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.\n\nCLIFF\nWhat are you talkin' about?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it\noutta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is,\nleft his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the\ncommode filled in all the blanks.\n\nCLIFF\nI don't believe you.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nThat's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that\nI believe you. Where did they go?\n\nCLIFF\nOn their honeymoon.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they\ngo?\n\nCLIFF\nThey didn't tell me.\n\nCoccotti looks at him.\n\nCLIFF\nNow, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years.\nYesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me\nhe needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could\nborrow five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a\ncheck. We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me\nGod. They never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never\nthought to ask.\n\nCoccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil,\nquick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then\nwhips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal\non the wound. Cliff screams.\n\nCoccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.\n\nTooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in\nthe car.\n\nVirgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm\nin agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my old\nman was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from\ngrowin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen\ndifferent things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has\nseventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen.\nAnd if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to\nhell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna\nshow me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know\nwhere they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away\nfrom.\n\nThe awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart.\nHe looks deep into Coccotti's eyes.\n\nCLIFF\nCould I have one of those Chesterfields now?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSure.\n\nCoccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.\n\nCLIFF\nGot a match?\n\nCliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.\n\nCLIFF\nOh, don't bother. I got one.\n(he lights the cigarette)\nSo you're a Sicilian, huh?\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(intensly)\nUh-huh.\n\nCLIFF\nYou know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find\nthat shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians\nwere spawned by niggers.\n\nAll the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic\nVic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what\nhe's hearing.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nCome again?\n\nCLIFF\nIt's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you\ndon't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago\nthe Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then,\nSicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But,\nonce the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did\nso much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for\never, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it\nabsolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later,\nSicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's\nwritten. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-\ngrandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a\nfact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?\n\nCoccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic,\ngrabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets\nthrough Cliff's head.\n\nHe pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his\nfeelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon,\nand turns to his men.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity\nin fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this\ncomedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me\nwhere that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this\nfucked-up family for good.\n\nTooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was\nall about.\n\nLenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer.\nWhen he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic\nbanana magnet that says: \"Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and\naddress)\".\n\nLENNY\nBoss, get ready to get happy.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"CLARENCE AND ALABAMA HIT L.A.\"\n\nINT. DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a MORNING\n\nDick's asleep in a recliner. He's wearing his clothes from the night before. His\nroom-mate FLOYD is lying on the sofa watching TV.\n\nThe sound of our hands knocking on his door wakes Dick up. He shakes the\nbats out of his belfry, opens the door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles\nstanding in his doorway.\n\nClarence and Alabama immediately start singing \"Hello My Baby\" like the frog\nin the old Chuck Jones cartoon.\n\nCLARENCE/ALABAMA\nHello my baby,\nHello my honey,\nHello my ragtime gal \u221a\n\nDICK\nHi guys.\n\nAlabama throws her arms around Dick, and gives him a quick kiss. After she\nbreaks, Clarence does the same. Clarence and Alabama walk right past Dick\nand into his apartment.\n\nCLARENCE\nWow. Neat place.\n\nINT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND \u221a DAY\n\nThe Pink's employees work like skilled Benihana chefs as they assemble the\nultimate masterpiece hot-dog.\n\nEXT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND \u221a PATIO \u221a DAY\n\nClarence, Alabama, and Dick are sitting at an outdoor table chowing down on\nchili dogs. Alabama is in the middle of a story.\n\nALABAMA\n... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid\nbefore, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished,\ncrowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and\nmy dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow\nzonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus\nappears, and the bus-driver says, \"Get her in here.\". He forgot all about his\nroute and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice\nguy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well,\nhis name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da\nbeen a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was\nfrom. And, so there you go.\n\nCLARENCE\nAnd here we are.\n\nDICK\nThat's a pretty amazing story.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?\n\nDICK\nJust like in Detroit, only skinnier.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou goin' out?\n\nDICK\nWell, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my\nacting class.\n\nCLARENCE\nGood for you.\n\nDICK\nWhat's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head\nbunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional\ninstability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a\nreally good reading for \"T.J. Hooker\" the other day.\n\nALABAMA\nYou're gonna be on \"T.J. Hooker\"?\n\nDICK\nKnock wood.\n\nHe knocks the table and then looks at it.\n\nDICK\n... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid you meet Captain Kirk?\n\nDICK\nYou don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.\n\nALABAMA\n(finishing her hot-dog)\nThat was so good I am gonna have another.\n\nDICK\nYou can't have just one.\n\nAlabama leaves to get another hot-dog. Clarence never takes his eyes off her.\n\nDICK\nHow much of that letter was on the up and up?\n\nCLARENCE\nEvery word of it.\n\nDick sees where Clarence's attention is.\n\nDICK\nYou're really in love, aren't you?\n\nCLARENCE\nFor the very first time in my life.\n(pause)\nDo you know what that's like?\n\nClarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer.\n\nDICK\n(regretfully)\nNo, I don't\n(he looks at Alabama)\nHow did you two meet?\n\nClarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his Hebrew cream soda.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you remember The Lyric?\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nSonny Chiba, as \"Streetfighter\" Terry Surki, drives into a group of guys, fists\nand feet flying and whips ass on the silver screen.\n\nClarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of him, nibbling on\npopcorn, eyes big as sourcers, and a big smile on his face.\n\nEXT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nA cab pulls up to the outside of The Lyric. The marquee carries the names of the\ntriple feature: \"The Streetfighter\", \"Return of the Streetfighter\" and \"Sister\nStreetfighter\". Alabama steps out of the taxi cab and walks up to the box office.\n\nA BOX OFFICE GIRL reading comic looks at her.\n\nALABAMA\nOne please.\n\nBOX OFFICE GIRL\nNinety-nine cents.\n\nALABAMA\nWhich one is on now?\n\nBOX OFFICE GIRL\n\"Return of the Streetfighter\". It's been on about forty-five minutes.\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a LOBBY \u221a NIGHT\n\nAlabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the concession stand. A\nYOUNG USHER takes care of her.\n\nALABAMA\nCan I have a medium popcorn? A super-large Mr. Pibb, and a box of\nGoobers.\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny Chiba taking on all-\ncomers.\n\nAlabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food. She makes a quick\nscan of the theater. Not many people are there. She makes a beeline for the\nfront whick happens to be Clarence's area of choice. She picks the row of seats\njust behind Clarence and starts asking her way down it.\n\nClarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone moving towards him. He\nturns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious.\n\nWhen Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine\nbottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn over Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nOh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm the clumsiest person in the world.\n\nCLARENCE\n(picking popcorn out of his hair)\nIt's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.\n\nALABAMA\n(picking popcorn out of his hair)\nWhat a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You\ncould have been a real dick.\n\nAlabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie.\n\nClarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't easy, and get back into\nthe movie.\n\nThey both watch the screen for a moment. Then, Alabama leans forward and\ntaps Clarence on the shoulder.\n\nALABAMA\nExcuse me... I hate to bother you again. Would you mind too terribly filling\nme in on what I missed?\n\nJumping on this opportunity.\n\nCLARENCE\nNot at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.\n\nALABAMA\nThe oriental.\n\nCLARENCE\nThe oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired\nto kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into\nthe police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while\nkeepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a\nnumber on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the\nwindow. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.\n\nALABAMA\nWant some Goobers?\n\nCLARENCE\nThanks a lot.\n\nALABAMA\nI thought Sonny was the good guy.\n\nCLARENCE\nHe ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be\nbullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.\n\nThey both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses.\n\nTIME CUT:\n\nOn the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies lie all around him.\nTHE END (in Japanese) flashes on the screen.\n\nThe theater light go up. Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence.\nThey're both applauding.\n\nALABAMA\nGreat movie. Action-packed!\n\nCLARENCE\nDoes Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?\n\nALABAMA\nSonny kicks ass.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the \"Streetfighter\". It\nwas the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the\nR.\n\nALABAMA\nIf that was the R, I'd love to see the X.\n\nCLARENCE\nMy name is Clarence, and what is yours?\n\nALABAMA\nAlabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs that your real name? Really?\n\nALABAMA\nThat's my real name, really. I got proof. See.\n\nShe shows Clarence her driver's license.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, cut my legs off and call me Shorty. That's a pretty original moniker\nthere, Alabama. Sounds like a Pam Grier movie.\n(announcer voice)\nShe's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She\ncarried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,\nand the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!\nPray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!\n\nEXT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence and Alabama are outside the theater. With the marquee lit up in the\nbackground they both perform unskilled martial arts moves. Clarence and\nAlabama break up laughing.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhere's your car? I'll walk you to it.\n\nALABAMA\nI took a cab.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou took a cab to see three kung fu movies?\n\nALABAMA\nSure. Why not?\n\nCLARENCE\nNothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat time is it?\n\nCLARENCE\n'Bout twelve.\n\nALABAMA\nI suppose you gotta get up early, huh?\n\nCLARENCE\nNo. Not particularly.\n(pause)\nHow come?\n\nALABAMA\nWell, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get\nsome pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after\nyou've seen a good movie?\n\nCLARENCE\nI love to get pie after a movie.\n\nALABAMA\nWould you like to get some pie?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'd love some pie.\n\nINT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's. It's about\n12:40 a.m. Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke.\nAlabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, enough about the King. How about you?\n\nALABAMA\nHow 'bout me what?\n\nCLARENCE\nTell me about yourself.\n\nALABAMA\nThere's nothing to tell.\n\nCLARENCE\nC'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?\n\nALABAMA\nWhat do you want to know?\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your\nfavorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you\nlike? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's\nthe story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?\nAnd, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?\n\nAlabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nAsk me them again. One by one.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat do you do?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't remember.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhere are you from.\n\nALABAMA\nMight be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's your favorite color?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's your favorite movie star?\n\nALABAMA\nBurt Reynolds.\n\nCLARENCE\nWould you like a bite of my pie?\n\nALABAMA\nYes, I would.\n\nClarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike it?\n\nALABAMA\nVery much. Now, where were we?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat kinda music do you like?\n\nALABAMA\nPhil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like \"He's a Rebel\".\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat are your turn-ons?\n\nALABAMA\nMickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like\nElvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.\n\nCLARENCE\nTurn-offs?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only\nthing that comes to mind are Persians.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you have a fella?\n\nShe looks at Clarence and smiles.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of\ntown alone?\n\nALABAMA\nApparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a\nform of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or\nwhere I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even\nknow my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a\nTallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they\ntold me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on\nme, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For\nsome reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told\nhim to stop and I got out.\n\nCLARENCE\nAnd in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?\n\nALABAMA\nBecause you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure\ncouldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.\n\nClarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until\nit makes that slurping sound. He puts it aside and stares into her soul.\n\nA smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.\n\nALABAMA\nAren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy?\n(eats her last piece of pie)\nWhere to next?\n\nINT. COMIC BOOK STORE \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's about 1:30 a.m. Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works. It's a\ncomic book store called Heroes For Sale. Alabama thinks this place is super-\ncool.\n\nALABAMA\nWow. What a swell place to work.\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books,\nplay music.\n\nALABAMA\nHow long have you worked here?\n\nCLARENCE\nAlmost four years.\n\nALABAMA\nThat's a long time.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what\nI'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most\nof the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.\n\nALABAMA\nDo you get paid a lot?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow\nsome money if you need it. Wanna see what \"Spiderman\" number one\nlooks like?\n\nALABAMA\nYou bet. How much is that worth?\n\nClarence gets a box off the shelf.\n\nCLARENCE\nFour hundred bucks.\n\nALABAMA\nI didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. \"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" Lunch\nboxes. \"Green Hornet\" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are\nmain business. There's a lot of collectors around here.\n\nShe holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat's that?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's a \"Rookies\" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls.\nThey're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors\nin \"The Black Hole\"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid\nplayin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.\n\nHe pulls a plastic-cased \"Spiderman\" comic form the box.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Spiderman\", number one. The one that started it all.\n\nClarence shows the comic book to Alabama.\n\nALABAMA\nGod, Spiderman looks different.\n\nCLARENCE\nHe was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr.\nGene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just\ndisguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold\non, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.\n\nHe pulls out another comic.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos\". One of the coolest series known\nto man. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about\nfour bucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap.\n(he opens one up)\nJust look at that artwork, will ya. Great stories. Great Characters. Look at\nthis one.\n\nWe see the \"Sgt. Fury\" panels.\n\nCLARENCE\nNick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on\na chain. OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on a\nship. He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain\nand the ring goes overboard too. So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it. Isn't\nthat cool?\n\nShe's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and meets her gaze.\n\nCLARENCE\nAlabama, I'd like you to have this.\n\nClarence hands her the \"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos\" comic book\nthat he loves so much.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis,\nanything you can imagine. The two walk through the door.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat a cool room!\n\nShe runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed.\n\nLater. Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album.\nClarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders.\n\nALABAMA\nOooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you\nthen?\n\nCLARENCE\nFive.\n\nShe turns the page.\n\nALABAMA\nOh, you look so cute as little Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nI finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.\n\nLATER \u221a LIVING ROOM\n\nClarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's\n\"Piece of My Heart\".\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know when you sat behind me?\n\nALABAMA\nAt the movies?\n\nCLARENCE\nUh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she\ndoesn't want me bothering her.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat would make you think that?\n\nCLARENCE\nI dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.\n\nALABAMA\nYou're not stupid. Just wrong.\n\nThey move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the\nsong.\n\nALABAMA\nI love Janis.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.\n\nALABAMA\nShe OD'd, didn't she?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too\nmuch. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what\nshe took.\n\nALABAMA\nYou mean she got a bad batch?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the\nhappiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't\ntrust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her\nto marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she\ncouldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money.\nSo, she said no. And the guy says, \"Look, I really love you, and I wanna\nprove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what\nhappens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it.\" So she did,\nand he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her\na secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.\n\nALABAMA\nSo he really loved her?\n\nCLARENCE\nUh-huh.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a DAY\n\nIt's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks\naround, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a\nrobe and investigates.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a LIVING ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair\ncrying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?\n\nALABAMA\nYou didn't do nothing.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid you hurt yourself?\n(he takes her foot)\nWhatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?\n\nALABAMA\nClarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the\ntheater. I was paid to be there.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls.\nMake sure they're not rippin' the place off.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.\n\nPause.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou're a whore?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.\n(pause)\nI don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that\ncomic book place.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Heroes For Sale\"?\n\nALABAMA\nYeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.\n\nCLARENCE\nWho?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into\nyou, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was\ngonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I\nwas leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich\nmillionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat dazzling imagination.\n\nALABAMA\nIt's over on the TV. All it says is: \"Dear Clarence.\" I couldn't write\nanymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to\never see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that\nmuch fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, \"Alabama, come clean, Let him\nknow what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to\nDrexl and fuck yourself.\"\n\nCLARENCE\nWho and what is a Drexl?\n\nALABAMA\nMy pimp.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou have a pimp?\n\nALABAMA\nUh-huh.\n\nCLARENCE\nA real live pimp?\n\nALABAMA\nUh-huh.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he black?\n\nALABAMA\nHe thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he nice?\n\nALABAMA\nWell, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty\ndecent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with\nArlene the other day.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat did he do to Arlene?\n\nALABAMA\nSlapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.\n\nCLARENCE\nThis motherfucker sounds charming!\n\nClarence is on his feet, furious.\n\nCLARENCE\nGoddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much\nlonger before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How\nthe fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first\nplace?\n\nALABAMA\nAt the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an\nagency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They\nhave a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-\ncollar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five\nhundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry\nbeepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in \"Dressed to Kill\". And when I was\nready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says\nhe makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's\ngonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or\nwind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the\nropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last\nnight. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it\nwas a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a\nsecond date.\n\nCLARENCE\nThank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again.\nBama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went\ntogether all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it,\nyou wanna marry me?\n\nALABAMA\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nWill you be my wife?\n\nWhen Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.\n\nALABAMA\nYes.\n\nCLARENCE\n(a little surprised)\nYou will?\n\nALABAMA\nYou better not be fucking teasing me.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou better not be fuckin' teasin' me.\n\nThey seal it with a kiss.\n\nLATER \u221a THAT NIGHT\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Alabama's wedding ring.\n\nThe newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching TV. The movie\nthey're watching is \"The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the\nFlying Guillotine\". Alabama watches the screen, but every so often she looks\ndown to admre the ring on her hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid ya ever see \"The Chinese Professionals\"?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't believe so.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the\nIncredible One-Armed Boxer.\n\nWe hear, off screen, the TV Announcer say:\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\n(off)\nWe'll return to Jimmy Wang Yu in... \"The Incredible One-Armed Boxer\nvs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine\", tonight's eight o'clock movie, after\nthese important messages...\n\nClarence looks at the TV. He feels the warmth of Alabama's hand holding his.\nWe see commercials playing.\n\nHe turns in her direction. She's absent-mindedly looking at her wedding ring.\n\nHe smiles and turns back to the TV.\n\nMore commercials.\n\nDolly close on Clarence's face\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nAlabama, right after he proposed.\n\nALABAMA\nYou better not be fucking teasing me.\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nIn a cute, all-night wedding chapel.

Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you\nseen your lovely wife today?\n\nCLARENCE\nOh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.\n\nALABAMA\nOf course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?\n\nMoving on top of her.\n\nCLARENCE\nNot for me.\n\nHe starts kissing her and moving her down on the seat. She resists.\n\nALABAMA\n(playfully)\nNo no no no no no no no no...\n\nCLARENCE\n(playfully)\nYes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nA big mean-looking BLACK MAN in pimp's clothes.\n\nPIMP\nBitch, you better git yo ass back on the street an' git me my money.\n\nPimp on street corner with his arm around Alabama, giving her a sales pitch to\na potential customer.\n\nPIMP\nI'm tellin' you, my man, this bitch is fine. This girl's a freak! You can fuck\n'er in the ass, fuck 'er in the mouth. Rough stuff, too. She's a freak for it.\nJus' try not to fuck 'er up for life.\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nPimp beating Alabama.\n\nPIMP\nYou holdin' out on me, girl? Bitch, you never learn!\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nAlabama passionately kissing the uninterested pimp.\n\nPIMP\nHang it up, momma. I got no time for this bullshit.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nTV showing kung fu film.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nClarence's face. There's definitely something different about his eyes.\n\nClarence springs off the couch and goes into his bedroom. Alabama's startled\nby his sudden movement.\n\nALABAMA\n(yelling after him)\nWhere you goin', honey?\n\nCLARENCE\n(off)\nI just gotta get somethin'.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BATHROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence splashes water on his face, trying to wash away the images that keep\npolluting his mind. Then, he hears a familiar voice.\n\nFAMILIAR VOICE\n(off)\nWell? Can you live with it?\n\nClarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to Elvis Presley. Clarence isn't surprised to see him.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nELVIS\nCan you live with it?\n\nCLARENCE\nLive with what?\n\nELVIS\nWith that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you?\nAnd gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah.\n\nELVIS\nYou wanna get unhaunted?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah.\n\nELVIS\nThen shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.\n\nCLARENCE\nI can't believe what you're tellin' me.\n\nELVIS\nI ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou'd really do that?\n\nELVIS\nHe don't got no right to live.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to\nkill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.\n\nELVIS\nI don't blame you.\n\nCLARENCE\nIf I thought I could get away with it \u221a\n\nELVIS\nKillin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya\nthink the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find\nwho done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole\nwide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught\nat the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.\n\nClarence looks at Elvis.\n\nELVIS\nClarence, I like ya. Always have, always will.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a A snub-nosed .38, which Clarence loads and sticks down his\nheavy athletic sock.\n\nINT. CALRENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a LIVING ROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence returns.\n\nCLARENCE\nSweetheart, write down your former address.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nWrite down Drexl's address.\n\nALABAMA\nWhy?\n\nCLARENCE\nSo I can go over there and pick up your things.\n\nALABAMA\n(really scared)\nNo, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.\n\nHe kneels down before her and holds her hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker.\nHe can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses\nabsolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it\nwould be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?\n\nALABAMA\nYou don't know him \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nYou don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I\nneed for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down\nthe address.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"CASS QUARTER, HEART OF DETROIT\"\n\nEXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREET \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his red Mustang. He's right smack\ndab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime. He checks the pulse on his\nneck; it's beating like a race horse. To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis\nPresley gyration.\n\nCLARENCE\n(in Elvis voice)\nYeah... Yeah...\n\nHe makes a beeline for the front door of a large, dark apartment building.\n\nINT. DARK BUILDING \u221a NIGHT\n\nHe's inside. His heart's really racing now. He has the TV guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand. He climbs a flight of stairs and makes his way down a dark hallway to apartment 22, the residence of Drexl Spivey. Clarence knock on the door.\n\nA YOUNG BLACK MAN, about twenty years old, answers the door. He has\nreally big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey.\n\nYOUNG BLACK MAN\nYou want somethin'?\n\nCLARENCE\nDrexl?\n\nYOUNG BLACK MAN\nNaw, man, I'm Marty. Watcha want?\n\nCLARENCE\nI gotta talk to Drexl.\n\nMARTY\nWell, what the fuck you wanna tell him?\n\nCLARENCE\nIt's about Alabama.\n\nA figure jumps in the doorway wearing a yellow Farah Fawcett T-shirt. It's our\nfriend, Drexl Spivey.\n\nDREXL\nWhere the fuck is that bitch?\n\nCLARENCE\nShe's with me.\n\nDREXL\nWho the fuck are you?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm her husband.\n\nDREXL\nWell. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.\n\nINT. DREXL'S LIVING ROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nDrexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation\nthey were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway. This is not the\nconfrontation Clarence expected. He trails in behind Drexl and Marty.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nWhat was I sayin'?\n\nMARTY\nRock whores.\n\nDREXL\nYou ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They\ngot that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you.\nThey give you hips, lips, and fingertips.\n\nDrexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nYou know what I'm talkin' about.\n\nDrexl gestures to one of the THREE STONED HOOKERS lounging about the\napartment.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nThese bitches over here ain't shit. You stomp them bitches to death to get\nthe kind of pussy I'm talkin' about.\n\nDrexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-\nout boxes of Chinese food. A black exploitation movie is playing on TV.\n\nDREXL\nLooky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with\nCherry Seven-Up.\n\nMARTY\nPussy love pink rocks.\n\nThis is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he\nexpected Drexl to be like. He positions himself in front of the food table,\ndemanding Drexl's attention.\n\nDREXL\n(eating with chopsticks, to Clarence)\nGrab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We\ngot everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo thanks.\n\nDREXL\nNo thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down\nhere? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to\nbe eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've\nalready given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly\nwhere your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some\ndinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to\nmyself, \"This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the\nworld. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad\nmotherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my\nChinese, watch my TV.\" See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV\nthere, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out,\nand you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I\nknow I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.\n\nClarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not eatin' cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' cause I'm not stayin'.\nI'm not lookin' at the movie cause I saw it seven years ago. It's \"The\nMack\" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by\nBobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama\nReleasing Company in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In\nthat envelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener\npastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter. I don't like to dicker.\nI never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's in that\nenvelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that much.\nNot one penny more, not one penny more.\n\nYou could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full\nalert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl.\nDrexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.\n\nDREXL\nIt's empty.\n\nClarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, \"That's right, asshole.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nDREXL\nOooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we\ngot here? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be?\nMr. Majestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't\ngot no hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand \u221a\n\nBefore Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at\nClarence, catching him of guard.\n\nMarty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting\nhim in a tight choke hold.\n\nClarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus.\nWe'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl\ntakes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.\n\nAll of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold\nrecords, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.\n\nMarty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.\n\nSince Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.\n\nClarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about\nit.\n\nDREXL\nYa wanna fuck with me?\n(hits Clarence)\nYa wanna fuck with me?\n(hits Clarence)\nI'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit!\n\nHe hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.\n\nClarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs\nhis nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and\nstarts twisting.\n\nMarty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip\naroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of\nhis head.\n\nDrexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's\nthumb.\n\nClarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and\nbusting his nose.\n\nMarty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets\nup on his knees.\n\nDrexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are\ngoing at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping\nthem coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other\nbecause of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.\n\nMarty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of\nLPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to\nhis feet.\n\nDrexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls.\n\nMarty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up\ninto a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.\n\nDrexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.\n\nMarty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nYou OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?\n\nMARTY\nNaw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.\n\nDrexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nYou see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk\nin my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin'\nsmack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be\ncrazy.\n(to Marty)\nI don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.\n(laughing)\nHe must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?\n\nMARTY\n(laughing)\nNaw, man, it ain't white boy day.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nShit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a\nnigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.\n\nCLARENCE\n(hurting)\nWannabee nigger...\n\nDREXl\nFuck you! My mother was Apache.\n\nDrexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up.\n\nDrexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket.\n\nClarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down.\n\nDrexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license.\n\nDREXL\nWell, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost\nlike a nigger name.\n(to Clarence)\nHey, dummy.\n\nHe puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up.\n\nDREXL\nBefore you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I\njust chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're\nsome macho motherfucker, I know who she's with. You. I know who you\nare, Clarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th street,\napartment 48. And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same\naddress. Marty, take the car and go get 'er. Bring her dumb ass back here.\n\nHe hands Marty the driver's license. Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nI'll keep lover boy here entertained.\n(to Clarence)\nYou know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her\nsuck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's\ndone it before. But I want you as a audience.\n(hollering to Marty)\nMarty, what the fuck are you doin'?\n\nMARTY\n(off)\nI'm tryin' to find my jacket.\n\nDREXL\nLook in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there\nlately.\n\nWhile Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock\nand pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's\nstanding over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger\nand blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.\n\nDrexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground.\n\nMARTY\n(off)\nWhat's happening?\n\nMarty steps into the room.\n\nClarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest.\n\nTwo of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming. The other\nHooker is curled up in the corner. She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to\nbe terrified.\n\nDrexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his\nballs and his dick.\n\nClarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker.\n\nCLARENCE\nGet a bag and put Alabama's thing in it!\n\nShe doesn't move.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou wanna get shot? I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it!\n\nThe Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the\nbed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence.\n\nClarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like\na pillbug.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand.\n\nClarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Drexl)\nOpen you eyes, laughing boy.\n\nHe doesn't. Clarence gives him a kick.\n\nCLARENCE\nOpen you eyes!\n\nHe does. It's now Drexl's POV from the floor.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?\n\nHe fires.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a The bullet comes out of the gun and heads right toward us. When\nit reaches us, the screen goes awash in red.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a NIGHT\n\nThe front swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama jumps off the couch and\nruns toward Clarence, before she reaches him he blurts out:\n\nCLARENCE\nI killed him.\n\nShe stops short.\n\nCLARENCE\nI've got some food in the car, I'll be right back.\n\nClarence leaves. Except for the TV playing, the room is quiet. Alabama sits on\nthe couch.\n\nClarence walks back into the room with a whole bounty of take-out food. He\nheaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down.\n\nCLARENCE\nHelp yourself. I got enough. I am fuckin' starvin'. I think I ordered one of\neverythin'.\n\nHe stops and looks at here.\n\nCLARENCE\nI am so hungry.\n\nHe starts eating french fries and hamburgers.\n\nALABAMA\n(in a daze)\nWas it him or you?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there\nI said to myself, \"If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it.\" I could.\nSo I did.\n\nALABAMA\nIs this a joke?\n\nCLARENCE\nNo joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious,\nI've never had a hamburger taste this good.\n\nAlabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignoring her.\n\nCLARENCE\nCome on, Bama, eat something. You'll feel better.\n\nShe continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her. Finally he spins on\nher, yelling:\n\nCLARENCE\nWhy are you crying? He's not worth one of your tears. Would you rather it\nhad been me? Do you love him?\n(no answer)\nDo you love him?\n(no answer)\nDo you love him?\n\nShe looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a word out.\n\nALABAMA\nI think what you did was...\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nALABAMA\nI think what you did...\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nALABAMA\n... was so romantic.\n\nClarence is completely taken back. They meet in a long, passionate lovers' kiss.\nTheir kiss breaks and slowly the world comes back to normal.\n\nCLARENCE\nI gotta get outta these clothes.\n\nHe picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in front of them.\n\nALABAMA\n(comically)\nClean clothes. There is a god,\n\nClarence flips open the suitcase. Alabama's and her husband's jaws drop.\n\nALABAMA\nClarence. Those aren't my clothes.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a DAY\n\nWe see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign. Pan to the parking lot where\nClarence's empty red Mustang is parked.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CALRENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Dick's jaw drops. His hand reaches out of shot.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a The reason for all the jaw dropping... the suitcase is full of\ncocaine!\n\nClarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine.\n\nAlabama's watching the cable TV.\n\nDICK\nHoly Mary, Mother of God.\n\nALABAMA\nThis is great, we got cable.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nBama, you got your blade?\n\nKeeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out from her purse a Swiss army knife\nwith a tiny dinosaur on it and tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the\ncorkscrew and opens the wine.\n\nHe pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a\nlittle one for himself. He hands it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks.\n\nDICK\nThis shit can't be real.\n\nCLARENCE\nIt'll get ya high.\n\nHe tosses the knife.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you want some wine, sweetheart?\n\nALABAMA\nNope. I'm not really a wine gal.\n\nUsing the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine. He jumps back.\n\nDICK\nIt's fuckin' real!\n(to Clarence)\nIt's fuckin' real!\n\nCLARENCE\nI certainly hope so.\n\nDICK\nYou've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!\n\nCLARENCE\nI know.\n\nDICK\nDo you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?\n\nCLARENCE\nTell me.\n\nDICK\nI don't know! A fuckin' lot!\n\nHe downs his wine. Clarence fills his glass.\n\nDICK\nThis is Drexl's coke?\n\nCLARENCE\nDrexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he\nwants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama\nare gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So,\nyou got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?\n\nDICK\nLook, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.\n\nDick gulps half of his wine. Clarence fills up.\n\nCLARENCE\nBut you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the\nset.\n\nDICK\nYeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know\nthose guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot\nto piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit\nat a time \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nNo way! The whole enchilada in one shot.\n\nDICK\nDo you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred\nthousand. How difficult can that be?\n\nDICK\nIt's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat\ncats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two\nhundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And,\nmore important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could\npossibly help you.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he big league?\n\nDICK\nHe's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very\npowerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could\nbe interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat'd'ya tell 'em?\n\nDICK\nHardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and\nwhat wasn't.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's this acting class guy's name?\n\nDICK\nElliot.\n\nCLARENCE\nElliot what?\n\nDICK\nElliot Blitzer.\n\nCLARENCE\nOK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the\ngetting to know you stuff.\n\nDICK\nWhere?\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nThe zoo.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Dick)\nThe zoo.\n(pause)\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nDICK\nWould you just shut up a minute and let me think?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's to think about?\n\nDICK\nShut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're\nmarried. You killed a guy.\n\nCLARENCE\nTwo guys.\n\nDICK\nTwo guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck,\nClarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean\nshit.\n\nCLARENCE\nDon't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a\nfuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he\ndeserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit\nbadge or somethin'.\n\nDick rests his head in his hands.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need\nyou to rise to the occasion. So, drink some more wine. Get used to the idea,\nand get your friend to the phone.\n\nEXT.

As they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal crackers and\nAlabama is blowing soap bubbles.\n\nELLIOT\nSo you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're\nunloading \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nWant an animal cracker?\n\nELLIOT\nYeah, OK.\n\nHe takes one.\n\nCLARENCE\nLeave the gorillas.\n\nELLIOT\n\u221a that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nUnloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.\n\nDICK\n(trying to chill him out)\nClarence...\n\nELLIOT\nWhere did you get it?\n\nCLARENCE\nI grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high\nenough so you can't see it from the street.\n\nELLIOT\n(forcing a laugh)\nHa ha ha. No really, where does it come from?\n\nCLARENCE\nCoco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind\nof a paste \u221a\n\nELLIOT\n(turning to Dick)\nLook, Dick, I don't \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\n(laughing)\nNo problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you\nbut you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're\ngood people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of\ngood faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.\n\nELLIOT\nWhat department?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat do you think, eightball?\n\nELLIOT\nThe police department?\n\nCLARENCE\nDuh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob\nquestions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the\nevidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with\na wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he\ncould trust.\n\nELLIOT\nHe trusts you?\n\nCLARENCE\nWe were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So,\nI'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get\nfucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you\ndidn't hear nothin'.\n\nELLIOT\nSure. I didn't hear anything.\n\nElliot is more than satisfied. Clarence makes a comical face at Dick when\nElliot's not looking. Dick is wearing I-don't-believe-this-guy expresion.\nAlabama is forever blowing bubbles.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO \u221a SNACK BAR \u221a DAY\n\nWe're in the snack bar area of the zoo.

He deals with a couple of guys,\nand he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're\ndependable. And, they're safe.\n\nCLARENCE\nRiddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what\nthe fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your\ntime than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's\ninterested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe\nfuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he\ncan play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's\nbest friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not\nputtin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money.

Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours\nfrom Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be\ntravelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they\nstayin' here?\n\nFLOYD\nNaw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're\nstayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.\n\nVIRGIL\nHow do you know?

LOS ANGELES ZOO \u221a PAYPHONE \u221a DAY\n\nClarence is still on the phone with Lee.\n\nCLARENCE\nLee, the reason I'm talkin' with you is I want to open \"Doctor Zhivago\" in\nL.A. And I want you to distribute it.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nStopped in the traffic on Sunset Boulevard.\n\nLEE\nI don't know, Clarence, \"Doctor Zhivago\" is a pretty big movie.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nThe biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a\nlot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a\nmovie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nHe's still on Sunset Boulevard, the traffic's moving better now.\n\nLEE\nI'm not sayin' I'm not interested. But being a distributer's not what I'm all\nabout. I'm a film producer, I'm on this world to make good movies.\nNothing more. Now, having my big toe dipped into the distribution end\nhelps me on many levels.\n\nTraffic breaks and Lee speeds along. The background whizzes past him.\n\nLEE\n(continuing)\nBut the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of\ndistributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna\naccomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nNow that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a\nrisk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks,\nthen go straight to cable. This is \"Doctor Zhivago\". This'll be packin' 'em\nin for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to\nwork with anybody's movie but mine.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nSpeeding down a benchside road.\n\nLEE\nWell, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to \"Doctor Zhivago\" are\nin arbitration?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nI wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a\ncourtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on\nthe cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're\nin bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have\nto come to terms with your Fear and Desire.\n\nPause. Clarence hands the phone to Elliot.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Elliot)\nHe wants to talk ya.\n\nELLIOT\n(into phone)\nMr. Donowitz?\n(pause)\nI told you, through Dick.\n(pause)\nHe's in my acting class.\n(pause)\nAbout a year.\n(pause)\nYeah, he's good.\n(pause)\nThey grew up together.\n(pause)\nSure thing.\n\nElliot hangs up the phone.\n\nELLIOT\nHe says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants\neverybody there.\n(pointing to Clarence)\nHe'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do\nbusiness. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a\nsample bag.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo problems on both counts.\n\nHe offers Elliot the animal crackers.\n\nCLARENCE\nHave a cookie.\n\nElliot takes one.\n\nELLIOT\nThanks.\n\nHe puts it in the mouth.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat wasn't a gorilla, was it?\n\nEXT. HOLIDAY INN \u221a DAY\n\nThe red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the hotel. Alabama\nhops out. Clarence stays in.\n\nALABAMA\nYou did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do\nmy part OK?\n\nCLARENCE\nBabalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.\n\nALABAMA\nI felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head.\nI'm gonna go grab dinner.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm\ngonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated\nmovies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nCLARENCE\nWe now return to \"Bullit\" already in progress.\n\nHe slams the Mustang in reverse and peels out of the hotel. Alabama walks her\nlittle walk from the parking lot to the pool area. Somebody whistles at her, she\nturns to them.\n\nALABAMA\nThank you.\n\nShe gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens the door.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CALRENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nShe steps in only to find Virgil sitting on a chair placed in front of the door with\na sawed-off shotgun aimed right at her.\n\nVIRGIL\n(calmly)\nStep inside and shut the door.\n\nShe doesn't move, she's frozen. Virgil leans forward.\n\nVIRGIL\n(calmly)\nLady. I'm gonna shoot you in the face.\n\nShe does exactly as he says. Virgil rises, still aiming the sawed-off.\n\nVIRGIL\nStep away from the door, move into the bathroom.\n\nShe does. He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then steps closer to her.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, Alabama, where's our coke, where's Clarence, and when's he coming\nback.\n\nALABAMA\nI think you got the wrong room, my name is Sadie. I don't have any Coke,\nbut there's a Pepsi machine downstairs. I don't know any Clarence, but\nmaybe my husband does. You might have heard of him, he play football. Al\nLylezado. He'll be home any minute, you can ask him.\n\nVirgil can't help but smile.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou're cute.\n\nVirgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which catches Alabama square\nin the face, lifting her off the ground and dropping her flat on her back.\n\nINT. MOVING RED MUSTANG \u221a DAY\n\nClarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat, singing to himself.\n\nCLARENCE\n(singing)\n\"Land of stardust, land of glamour,\nVistavision and Cinema,\nEverything about it is a must,\nTo get to Hollywood, or bust...\"\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's laying flat. She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste\nof the blood in her mouth wakes her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil\nstanding there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream. They open again\nto the same sight. She has never felt more helpless in her life.\n\nVIRGIL\nHurts, don't it? It better. Took me a long time to kick like that. I'm third-\ndegree blackbelt, you know? At home I got trophies. Tournaments I was in.\nKicked all kinds of ass. I got great technique. You ain't hurt that bad. Get\non your feet, Fruitloop.\n\nAlabama wobbily complies.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhere's our coke? Where's Clarence? And when he's comin' back?\n\nAlabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without a doubt she's going to\ndie, because this man is going to kill her.\n\nALABAMA\nGo take a flying fuck and a rolling donut.\n\nVirgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a sidekick straight to the stomach.\nThe air is sucked out of her lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours\ngasping for air that's just not there.\n\nVirgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one up with a Zippo lighter.\nHe takes a long, deep drag.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhatsamatta? Can't breathe? Get used to it.\n\nINT. HAMBURGER STAND \u221a DAY\n\nClarence walks through the door of some mom and pop fast-food restaurant.\n\nCLARENCE\nWoah! Smells like hamburgers in here! What's the biggest, fattest\nhamburger you guys got?\n\nThe IRANIAN GUY at the counter says:\n\nIRANIAN GUY\nThat would be Steve's double chili cheeseburger.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, I want two of them bad boys. Two large orders of chili fries. Two\nlarge Diet Cokes.\n(looking at a menu at the wall)\nAnd I'll tell you what, why don't you give me a combination burrito as well.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room. She braces herself\nagainst the wall. She is very punchy. Virgil steps in front of her.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you?\nDream on, cunt. You're nothin' but a fuckin' fool. And your pretty face is\ngonna turn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds. Now, where's my\nfuckin' coke?\n\nShe doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head. Her\nhead slams into the left side of the wall.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhere's Clarence?!\n\nNothing. He gives her another kick to the head, this time from the other side.\nHer legs start to give way. He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her\nlightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhen's Clarence getting back?\n\nShe can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages, and she gives him the\nmiddle finger. Virgil can't help but smile.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou gotta lot of heart, kid.\n\nHe gives her a spinning roadhouse kick to the head that sends her to the floor.\n\nINT. HAMBURGER STAND \u221a DAY\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Burgers sizzling on a griddle, Chili and cheese is put on them.\n\nClarence is waiting for his order. He notices a CUSTOMER reading a copy of\n\"Newsweek\" with Elvis on the cover.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's a great issue.\n\nThe Customer lowers his magazine a little bit.\n\nCUSTOMER\nYeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.\n\nCLARENCE\nHave you read the story on Elvis?\n\nCUSTOMER\nNo. Not yet.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I\nlook at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I\nended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever\nwrong.\n\nCUSTOMER\nThat good, huh?\n\nHe takes the magazine from the Customer's hands and starts flipping to the\nElvis article.\n\nCLARENCE\nIt tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the\nwhole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew\nup with him, the artists he inspired \u221a Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and\nthe fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the\ncreeps.\n\nCUSTOMER\nI can see what you mean.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every\nbranch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.\n\nClarence and the Customer laugh.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's pretty beat up. She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue. She's\ncrawling around on the floor. Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the\ncocaine. He's also carrying on a running commentary.\n\nVIRGIL\nNow the first guy you kill is always the hardest. I don't care if you're the\nBoston Strangler or Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas boy, Charles\nWhitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, I'll bet you\ngreen money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was the\nbitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to ho. Now, the\nsecond one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to ho.\nYou still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around. Then you\ncompletely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's gotten to the\npoint now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change.\n\nHe's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he flips the matress up off the\nbed, and the black suitcase is right there.\n\nAlabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying. Virgil flips open the\nblack case and almost goes snow blind.\n\nVIRGIL\nWell, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great.\nOne less thing I gotta worry about.\n\nVirgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse.\n\nShe pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up. Virgil turns toward her.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth \u221a\n\nAlabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands. Mr. Karate-\nman smiles.\n\nVIRGIL\nKid, you got a lotta heart.\n\nHe moves toward her.\n\nAlabama's hands are shaking.\n\nVIRGIL\nTell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a free swing. Now, I only\ndo that for people I like.\n\nHe moves close.\n\nAlabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open.\nButtons fly everywhere.\n\nVIRGIL\nGo ahead, girl, take a stab at it.\n(giggling)\nYou don't have anything to lose.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose.\nVirgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women\nthat comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many\nwomen all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt\nonly a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into \"I'll\ntake this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do\" seething hatred.\n\nLetting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then\ndrops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a VIRGIL'S FACE\n\nTalk about bloodcurling yells.\n\nVirgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running\ndown his face.\n\nWhile Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter\nthat Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster,\nso it doesn't kill him.\n\nVirgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.\n\nAlabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it\nand, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the\nnose, breaking it.\n\nHer eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to\nit, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back,\nsending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.\n\nVirgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama.\nAlabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but\nnot one of them has ever laughed before he did it.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhat's so fuckin' funny?!!\n\nALABAMA\n(laughing)\nYou look so ridiculous.\n\nShe laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off\nthe ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.\n\nVIRGIL\nLaugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you\nlaughing now?\n\nAlabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and\nsqueezes it out in her hand.\n\nVirgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.\n\nAlabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his\neyes.\n\nVIRGIL\nOh Jesus!\n\nShe grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.\n\nVIRGIL\nOh Mary, help me!\n\nThe battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's\nclutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a\nTasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming\ntoward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks\nher into the toilet.\n\nAhe recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the\ntoilet tank.\n\nVirgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama\nbrings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet\nlid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires\nanyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.\n\nThe toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground.\n\nAlabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net\nhairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his\ngun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame,\nwhich results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.\n\nHe fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending\nwater spraying.\n\nUpon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama\ndown, and runs out of the bathroom.\n\nVirgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off\nlaying on the ground. He crawls toward it.\n\nAlabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45\nautomatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room.\n\nHe reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.\n\nAlabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-\nrunning-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him.\n\nHe arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and\nsending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.\n\nAlabama snatches the shotgun.\n\nArched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.\n\nThe first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second\nhits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest.\n\nAlabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.\n\nEver since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been\nfunctioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of\nSaint Francis of Assisi.\n\nALABAMA\nLord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nand where there is sadness, joy.\nO Divine Master, grant that I may not\nso much seek to be consoled as to console;\nto be understood as to understand;\nto be loved as to love;\nfor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born\nto eternal life.\n\nClarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn,\nonly to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun.\n\nCLARENCE\nHoney?\n\nShe continues. He puts his gun away.\n\nCLARENCE\nSweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute,\n\nShe continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground. She\nlies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms.\n\nClarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his\nshoulder.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT.

NOWHERE\n\nClarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly to the camera. He's in a\nheadshot.\n\nCLARENCE\nI feel so horrible about what she went through. That fucker really beat the\nshit out of her. She never told him where I was. It's like I always felt that\nthe way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that\nmuch. I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was jokin'.\nBut, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured\nwith words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to \u221a\nthat's a test of oneself. That's a true romance. I swear to God, I'll cut off my\nhands and gouge out my eyes before I'll every let anything happen to that\nlady again.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS \u221a NIGHT\n\nA wonderful, gracefully flowing shot of the Hollywood Hills. Off in the distance\nwe hear the roar of a car engine.\n\nEXT.

MOVING PORSCHE \u221a NIGHT\n\nElliot Blitzer is the driver, standing on it. A blond, glitzy COKE WHORE is\nsitting next to him. They're having a ball. Then they're seeing a red and blue\nlight flashing in the rear-view window. It's the cops.\n\nELLIOT\nFuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined,\ndriving like this!\n(he pulls over)\nKandi, you gotta help me.\n\nKANDI\nWhat can I do?\n\nHe pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence gave him earlier.\n\nELLIOT\nYou gotta hold this for me.\n\nKANDI\nYou must be high. Uh-huh. No way.\n\nELLIOT\n(frantically)\nJust put it in your purse.\n\nKANDI\nI'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.\n\nELLIOT\nThey won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.\n\nKANDI\nNo way, Jose.\n\nELLIOT\nPlease, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.\n\nKANDI\nI'm not wearing a bra.\n\nELLIOT\n(pleading)\nPut it in your pants.\n\nKANDI\nNo.\n\nELLIOT\nYou're the one who wanted to drive fast.\n\nKANDI\nRead my lips.\n\nShe mouths the word \"no\".\n\nELLIOT\nAfter all I've done for you, you fuckin' whore!!\n\nShe goes to slap him, she hits the bag of cocaine instead. It rips open. Cocaine\ncompletely covers his blue suit. At that moment Elliot turns to face a flashing\nbeam. Tears fill his eyes.\n\nINT. POLICE STATION \u221a INTERROGATION ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nElliot is sitting in a chair at the table. Two young, good-looking, casually\ndressed, Starsky and Hutch-type POLICE DETECTIVES are questioning him.\nThey're known in the department as Nicholson and Dimes. The dark-haired one\nis Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky Dimes.\n\nNICHOLSON\nLook, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine \u221a\n\nDIMES\nNot a tiny little vial \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nBut a fuckin' baggie.\n\nDIMES\nNo don't sit here and feed us some shit.\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now\nwe gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time \u221a\n\nDIMES\nYou're no longer an extra \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nOr a bit player \u221a\n\nDIMES\nOr a supporting actor \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man\nshow nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience \u221a\n\nDIMES\nBut there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy\nwho gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll\nhave so much experience to draw on \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nAnd just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get\nmarried, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because\nyou'll know what it's like to be a woman.\n\nDIMES\n'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right\nanymore \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nThat is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.\n\nElliot starts crying.

Het in here!\n\nThe two casually dressed, sneaker-wearing cops rush in, both shouting at once.\n\nNICHOLSON\nKrinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin'\ninto somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him\nfrom the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form\nthe right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts cryin', and then it\nwas all over \u221a\n\nDIMES\nKrinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and\nif I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole\ndepartment. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta\ncome in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion \u221a\n\nKRINKLE\nBoth you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened,\nwhat's going on, and what are you talking about?\n\nDIMES\nOkee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for\nspeeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they\nbring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.\n\nNICHOLSON\nNicholson and I.\n\nDIMES\nNicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in\nDenmark, cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're\nsweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.\n\nNICHOLSON\nWhich wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.\n\nDIMES\nSo we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you\nain't gonna fuckin' believe it.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. RESTAURANT \u221a DAY\n\nDetroit. Very fancy restaurant. FOUR WISE-GUY HOODS, one older, the\nother three, youngsters, are seated at the table with Mr. Coccotti.\n\nCOCCOTTI\n\u221a And so, tomorrow morning comes, and no Virgil. I check with Nick\nCardella, who Virgil was supposed to leave my narcotics with, he never\nshows. Now, children, somebody is stickin' a red-hot poker up my asshole\nand what I don't know is whose hand's on the handle.\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #1 (FRANKIE)\nYou think Virgil started gettin' big ideas?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nIt's possible. Anybody can be carried away with delusions of grandeur. But\nafter that incident in Ann Arbor, I trust Virgil.\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #2 (DARIO)\nWhat happened?\n\nOLD WISE-GUY(LENNY)\nVirgil got picked up in a warehouse shakedown. He got five years, he\nserved three.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nAnybody who clams up and does hid time, I don't care how I feel about him\npersonally, he's OK.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nKRINKLE'S OFFICE\n\nNICHOLSON\nIt seems a cop from some department, we don't know where, stole a half a\nmillion dollars of coke from the property cage and he's been sittin' on it for\na year and a half. Now the cops got this weirdo \u221a\n\nDIMES\nSuspect's words \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nTo front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his\nboss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.\n\nDIMES\nHe produced \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\".\n\nKRINKLE\nThat Vietnam movie?\n\nNICHOLSON\nUh-huh.\n\nKRINKLE\nThat was a good fuckin' movie.\n\nDIMES\nSure was.\n\nKRINKLE\nDo you believe him?\n\nNICHOLSON\nI believe he believes him.\n\nDIMES\nHe's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny\ngranny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.\n\nNICHOLSON\nThis rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.\n\nKRINKLE\nHe'll wear a wire?\n\nDIMES\nWe talked him into it.\n\nKRINKLE\nDirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.\n\nNICHOLSON\nLook, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire\ndepartment, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the\ntwelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.\n\nDIMES\nCocaine. Dirty cops. Hollywood. This is Crocket and Tubbs all the way.\nAnd we found it, so we want the fuckin' collar.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nINT. RESTAURANT \u221a DAY\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #3 (MARVIN)\nMaybe Virgil dropped it off at Cardella's. Cardella turns Virgil's switch\noff, and Cardella decides to open up his own fruit stand.\n\nLENNY\nExcuse me, Mr. Coccotti.\n(to Marvin)\nDo you know Nick Cardella?\n\nMARVIN\nNo.\n\nLENNY\nThen where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?\n\nMARVIN\nI didn't mean \u221a\n\nLENNY\nShut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth\nbefore you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you\ncan throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nChildren, we're digressing. Another possibility is that rat-fuck whore and\nher wack-a-doo cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil. Knowing Virgil, I find\nthat hard to believe. But they sent Drexl to hell, and Drexl was no faggot.\nSo you see, children, I got a lot of questions and no answers. Find out who\nthis wing-and-a-prayer artist is and take him off at the neck.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"THE BIG DAY\"\n\nEXT. IMPERIAL HIGHWAY \u221a SUNRISE\n\nClarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just off of Imperial Highway.\nAs luck would have it, somebody has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of\nthe road.

Where should we fly off\nto, my little turtledove?\n\nALABAMA\nCancoon.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhy Cancoon?\n\nALABAMA\nIt's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. \"Clarence and Alabama Go\nto Cancoon\". Don't 'cha think?\n\nCLARENCE\nBut in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nCLARENCE\nDon't you worry 'bout anything. It's all gonna work out for us. We deserve\nit.\n\nINT.

Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us, and he's not a cop,\nhe's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high. And I'm just the man\nwho can get him there. So what say we throw caution to the wind and let\nthe chips fall where they may.\n\nClarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the hotel. Dick and\nAlabama exchange looks and follow.\n\nINT.

I can feel it. If\nanything out of the ordinary goes down, believe this, you're gonna be the\nfirst one shot. Trust me, I am AIDS, you fuck with me, you die.

Alabama and Dick can't believe what\nhe's gonna do.\n\nElliot, tears running down, starts talking for the benefit of the people at the\nother end of the wire. He sounds like a little boy.\n\nELLIOT\nI don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. I wish somebody would just come\nand get me cause I don't like this.

He'll be out in a quick.\n\nThey all move into the room, it is very luxurious.\n\nANOTHER INCREDIBLY MUSCULAR GUY, Boris, is sitting on the sofa, he\ntoo has an Uzi. Monty begins patting everybody down.\n\nMONTY\nSorry, nothin personal.\n\nHe starts to search Clarence. Clarence back away.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo need to search me, daredevil. All you'll find is a .38 calibre.\n\nBoris gets up from the couch.\n\nBORIS\nWhat compelled you to bring that along?\n\nCLARENCE\nThe same thing that compelled you, Beastmaster, to bring rapid-fire\nweaponry to a business meeting.\n\nBORIS\nI'll take that.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou'll have to.\n\nThe toilet flushes in the bathroom. The door swings open and Lee Donowitz\nemerges.\n\nLEE\nThey're here. Who's who?\n\nELLIOT\nLee, this is my friend Dick, and these are his friends, Clarence and\nAlabama.\n\nBORIS\n(pointing at Clarence)\nThis guy's packin'.\n\nLEE\nReally?\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these \"Soldier of\nFortune\" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident\nthat you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll\nput the gun on the table.\n\nLEE\nI don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you\nbe nice and get coffee for everybody.\n\nThey all sit around a fancy glass table except for Boris, who's getting the coffee,\nand Monty, who's standing behind Lee's chair.\n\nCLARENCE\nOh, Mr. Donowitz \u221a\n\nLEE\nLee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.\n\nCLARENCE\nOK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\" is one\nof my favorite movies. After \"Apocalypse Now\" I think it's the best\nVietnam movie ever.\n\nLEE\nThank you very much, Clarence.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. \"Sophie's\nChoice\", \"Ordinary People\", \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", \"Gandhi\". All that\nstuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.\n\nLEE\nI hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are\nunwatchable movies from unreadable books.\n\nBoris starts placing clear-glass coffee cups in front of everybody and fills\neverybody's cup from a fancy coffee pot that he handles like an expert.\n\nLEE\nClarence, there might be somebody somewhere that agrees with you more\nthan I do, but I wouldn't count on it.\n\nClarence is on a roll and he knows it.\n\nCLARENCE\nThey ain't plays, they ain't books, they certainly ain't movies, they're films.\nAnd do you know what films are? They're for people who don't like\nmovies. \"Mad Max\", that's a movie. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\",\nthat's a movie. \"Rio Bravo\", that's a movie. \"Rumble Fish\", that's a\nfuckin' movie. And, \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\", that's a movie. It was\nthe first movie with balls to win a lot of Oscars since the \"The Deer\nHunter\".\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThey're all listening to this.\n\nDIMES\nWhat's this guy doin'? Makin' a drug deal or gettin' a job on the \"New\nYorker\"?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nCLARENCE\nMy uncle Roger and uncle Cliff, both of which were in Nam, saw \"Coming\nHome in a Body Bag\" and thought it was the most accurate Vietnam film\nthey'd ever seen.\n\nLEE\nYou know, Clarence, when a veteran of that bullshit wars says that, it\nmakes the whole project worthwhile. Clarence, my friend, and I call you\nmy friend because we have similar interests, let's take a look at what you\nhave for me.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNICHOLSON\nThank God.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nClarence puts the suitcase on the table.\n\nCLARENCE\nLee, when you see this you're gonna shit.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLOBBY\n\nThe four Wise-guys are at the desk.\n\nLENNY\n(quietly to the others)\nWhat was the Jew-boy's name?\n\nMARVIN\nDonowitz, he said.\n\nFRONT-DESK GUY\nHow can I help you, Gentlemen?\n\nLENNY\nYeah, we're from Warner Bros. What room is Mr. Donowitz in?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nLee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it.\n\nCLARENCE\nNow, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot\nmore.\n\nLEE\nDon't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.\n\nCLARENCE\nMe too, Boris.\n\nBoris fills both of their cups. They both, calm as a lake, take cream and sugar.\nAll eyes are on them. Lee uses light cream and sugar, he begins stirring this\ncup. Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar.\n\nLEE\n(stirring loudly)\nYou like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.\n\nBoth are cool as cucumbers.\n\nLEE\nI have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage, this is quality. Can Boris\nmake anybody a sandwich? I got all kinds of sandwich shit from Canters in\nthere.\n\nALABAMA\nNo thank you.\n\nDICK\nNo. But thanks.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that\nmade me a little sick.\n\nLEE\nWhere'd you go?\n\nCLARENCE\nA Norms in Van Nuys.\n\nLEE\nBastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.\n\nLee continues looking at the merchandise.\n\nAlabama writes something in her napkin with a pencil. She slides the napkin\nover to Clarence. It says: \"You're so cool\" with a tiny heart drawn on the\nbottom of it. Clarence takes the pencil and draws an arrow through the heart.\nShe takes the napkin and puts it in her pocket.\n\nLee looks up.\n\nLEE\nOK, Clarence, the merchandise is perfect. But, whenever I'm offered a deal\nthat's too good to be true, it's because it's a lie. Convince me you're on the\nlevel.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNICHOLSON\nIf he don't bite, we ain't got shit except posession.\n\nDIMES\nConvince him.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, Lee, it's like this. You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because I\ndon't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with\nprofessionals. I'm not a professional. I'm a rank amateur. I could take that,\nand I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and make a\nhelluva lot more money. But, in order to do that, I'd have to become a drug\ndealer. Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting busted all\nof the time. Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta me, and\nyou're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking movie-maker. I like\nyou, and I'm still scared. I'm a punk kid who picked up a rock in the street,\nonly to find out it's the Hope Diamond. It's worth a million dollars, but I\ncan't get the million dollars for it. But, you can. So, I'll sell it to you for a\ncouple a hundred thousand. You go to make a million. It's all found money\nto me anyway. Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred\nthousand is the world.\n\nLEE\nElliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.\n(to Elliot)\nThanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on\nyou. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.\n(to Lee)\nHe's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.\n\nLEE\nWhy does he trust you?\n\nCLARENCE\nWe grew up together.\n\nLEE\nIf you don't know shit, ehy does he think you can sell it?\n\nCLARENCE\nI bullshitted him.\n\nLee starts laughing.\n\nLEE\nThat's wild. This fucking guy's a madman. I love it. Monty, go in the other\nroom and get the money.\n\nClarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNicholson and Dimes exchange looks.\n\nDIMES & NICHOLSON\nBingo!\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nThe four Wise-guys are coming up.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nLEE\n(pointing to Alabama)\nWhat's your part in this?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm his wife.\n\nLEE\n(referring to Dick)\nHow 'bout you?\n\nDICK\nI know Elliot.\n\nLEE\nAnd Elliot knows me. Tell me, Clarence, what department does you friend\nwork in?\n\nDick and Alabama panic.\n\nCLARENCE\n(without missing a beat)\nCarson County Sheriffs.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThe internal affairs officers high five.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nMonty brings in a briefcase of money and puts it down on the table.\n\nLEE\nWanna count your money?\n\nCLARENCE\nActually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThey all stand.\n\nDIMES\nOK, boys. Let's go get 'em.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a LEE'S HOTEL ROOM \u221a BATHROOM \u221a\nDAY\n\nClarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door. As soon as it's shut he\nstarts doing the twist. He can't believe he's pulled it off. He goes to the toilet\nand starts taking a piss. He turns and sees Elvis sitting on the sink.\n\nELVIS\nClarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.\n\nCLARENCE\nI was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.\n\nELVIS\nAll anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.\n\nCLARENCE\nCan you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.\n\nELVIS\nOh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: \"I'll take that gun\", \"You'll\nhave to\".\n\nCLARENCE\nThat was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came\nfrom. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought,\nthat's a cool line, I gotta remember that.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nEverything's just as it was.\n\nSudenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives break into the room with\nguns drawn.\n\nDIMES & NICHOLSON\nPolice! Freeze, you're all under arrest!\n\nEverybody at the table stands up. Boris and Monty stand ready with the Uzis.\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou two! Put the guns on the floor and back away.\n\nMONTY\nFuck you! All you pigs put your guns on the floor and back away.\n\nLEE\nMonty, what are you talking about? So what they say.\n\nDIMES\nThis is your last warning! Drop those fuckin' guns!\n\nBORIS\nThis is your last warning! We could kill all six of ya and ya fuckin' know it!\nNow get on the floor!\n\nDICK\nWhat the fuck am I doing here?\n\nLEE\nBoris! Everybody's gonna get killed! They're cops!\n\nMONTY\nSo they're cops. Who gives a shit?\n\nBORIS\nLee, something I never told you about me. I don't like cops.\n\nDIMES\nOK, let's everybody calm down and get nice. Nobody has to die. We don't\nwant it, and you don't want it.\n\nLEE\nWe don't want it.\n\nThe four Wise-guys burst through the door, shotguns drawn, except for Frankie,\nwho has two .45 automatics, one in each hand.\n\nHalf of the cops spin around.\n\nWURLITZER\nFreeze!\n\nLENNY\nWho are you guys?\n\nWURLITZER\nPolice.\n\nDARIO\n(to Lenny)\nDo we get any extra if we have to kill cops?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nBATHROOM\n\nClarence and Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nHow do you think I'm doin' with Lee?\n\nELVIS\nAre you kiddin'? He loves you.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?\n\nELVIS\nYou're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as\nkissin' his ass.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\".\n\nELVIS\nThat's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and\nhe can see that.\n\nElvis fixes Clarence's collar.\n\nELVIS\nI like ya, Clarence. Always have.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nThis is a Mexican stand-off if there ever was one. Gangsters on one end with\nshotguns. Bodyguards with machine guns on the other. And cops with handguns\nin the middle.\n\nDick's ready to pass out.\n\nAlabama's so scared she pees on herself.\n\nFor Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life, and he's just about had it.\n\nELLIOT\nOfficer Dimes? Officer Dimes.\n\nDimes looks at Elliot.\n\nELLIOT\nThis has nothing to do with me anymore. Can I just leave and you guys just\nsettle it by yourselves?\n\nDIMES\nElliot, shut the fuck up and stay put!\n\nLEE\n(to Elliot)\nHow did you know his name? How the fuck did he know your name? Why,\nyou fuckin' little piece of shit!\n\nELLIOT\nLee, understand, I didn't want to \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nShut the fuck up!\n\nLEE\nWell, I hope you're not planning on acting any time in the next twenty\nyears cause your career is over as of now! You might as weel burn you\nSAG card! To think I treated you as a son! And you stabbed me in the\nheart!\n\nLee can't control his anger any more. He grabs the coffee pot off the table and\nflings hot coffee into Elliot's face. Elliot screams and falls to his knees,\n\nInstinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice.\n\nAlabama screams.\n\nBoris lets loose with his Uzi, pinting Nicholson red with bullets.\n\nDIMES\n(screaming)\nCody!!!\n\nNicholson flies backwards.\n\nMarvin fires his shotgun, hits Nicholson in the back, Nicholson's body jerks\nback and forth then on the floor.\n\nClarence opens the bathroom door.\n\nDimes hits the ground firing.\n\nA shot catches Clarence in the forehead.\n\nAlabama screams.\n\nDario fires his sawed-off. It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the\nbathroom sink, smashing the mirror.\n\nIt might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either\nhits the ground or runs for cover.\n\nDimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground.\n\nBoris dives into the kitchen area.\n\nMonty tips the table over.\n\nMarvin dives behind the sofa.\n\nDario runs out of the door and down the hall.\n\nWith bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything. Two IA\nOfficers are shot right away.\n\nFrankie takes an Uzi hit. He goes down firing both automatics.\n\nElliot gets it from both sides.\n\nAlabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the\nbathroom.\n\nClarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching. He moves and falls off.\n\nAlabama continues crawling.\n\nMarvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires. The shotgun blast\nhits the glass table and Monty. Monty stands up screaming.\n\nThe Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty.\n\nAs Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over\nthe apartment.\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a DAY\n\nCop cars start arriving in twos in front of the hotel.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nGUNFIGHT\n\nAlabama crawling.\n\nThe suitcase full of cocaine is by Dick. Dick grabs it and tosses it in the air.\nMarvin comes from behind the sofa and fires. The suitcase is hit in mid-air.\nWhite powder goes everywhere. The room is enveloped in cocaine.\n\nDick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door.\n\nAn IA Officer goes after him.\n\nLenny makes a break for it.\n\nWurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin.\n\nAlabama reaches the bathroom and finds Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nSweety?\n\nClarence's face is awash with blood.\n\nCLARENCE\nI... I can't see you... I've got blood in my eyes...\n\nHe dies.\n\nAlabama tries to give him outh-to-mouth resuscitation.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a HALLWAY \u221a DAY\n\nDario runs down the hall, right into a cluster of uniformed police.\n\nHe fires his shotgun, hitting two, just before the others chop him to ribbons.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a ANOTHER HALLWAY\n\nThe hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast. Dick comes\naround the corner, running as if on fire. Then we see the IA Officer turn the\nsame corner.\n\nIA OFFICER\n(aiming gun)\nFreeze!\n\nDick does.\n\nDICK\nI'm unarmed!\n\nIA OFFICER\nPut your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch!\n\nHe does. Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the IA Officer,\nsending him to the wall.\n\nDICK\nOh shit.\n\nHe starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the\ncorner and runs down the hall.\n\nDick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box.\n\nLenny catches up. Dick raises his hands. Lenny aimes his sawed-off.\n\nDICK\nLook, I don't know who you are, but whatever it was that I did to you, I'm\nsorry.\n\nTwo elevator doors on either side of them open.\n\nLenny looks at Dick. He drops his aim and says:\n\nLENNY\nLotsa luck.\n\nLenny dives into one elevator car. Dick jumps into the other, just as the doors\nclose.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nHOTEL ROOM\n\nThe Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each\nother down.\n\nWurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned\ndown in the kitchen.\n\nIn the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get\nhis heart started. It's not working. She slaps him hard in the face a couple of\ntimes.\n\nALABAMA\nWake up, goddamn it!\n\nDimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the\ngrip of a dead Wise-guy.\n\nBoris peeks around the wall to fire.\n\nDimes lets loose with a blast. A scream is heard.\n\nBORIS\n(off)\nI'm shot! Stop!\n\nDIMES\nThrow out your gun, asshole!\n\nThe Uzi's tossed out.\n\nDimes goes to where Wurlitzer is.\n\nDIMES\n(to Marvin)\nOK, black jacket! It's two against one now! Toss the gun and lie face down\non the floor or die like all you friends.\n\nThe shotgun's tossed out from behind the sofa.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a ELEVATOR \u221a DAY\n\nDick's sitting on the ground, he can't believe any of this. The doors open on the\nfourth floor. He runs out into the hallway.\n\nHALLWAY\n\nHe starts trying the room doors for an open one.\n\nDICK\nOh, God, if you just get me outta this I swear to God I'll never fuck up\nagain. Please, just let me get to \"T.J. Hooker\" on Monday.\n\nSTEWARDESS'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nDick steps in. THREE GORGEOUS GIRLS are doing a killer aerobics workout\nto a video on TV. The music is so loud they're so into their exercises, they don't\nhear Dick tiptoe behind them and crawl underneath the bed.\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nBoris has caught a lot of buckshots, but he'll live. He's lying on the kitchen\nfloor. Dimes stands over him. He has the sawed-off in his hand.\n\nDIMES\nDon't even give me an excuse, motherfucker.\n\nDimes pats him down for other weapons, there are none.\n\nWurlitzer puts the cuffs on Marvin and sits him down on the couch.\n\nDimes looks in the bathroom and sees the dead Clarence with Alabama crying\nover him.\n\nDimes walks over to Wurlitzer.\n\nDIMES\nEverything's under control here.\n\nWURLITZER\nSorry about Nicholson.\n\nDIMES\nMe too.\n\nWURLITZER\nI'm gonna go see what's goin' on outside.\n\nDIMES\nYou do that.\n\nWurlitzer exits. Dimes grabs the phone.\n\nLOBBY\n\nShotgun in hand, Lenny moves hurriedly down the lobby.\n\nA COP yells out.\n\nCOP\nYou! Stop!\n\nLenny brings up his sawed-off and lets him have it. OTHER COPS rush\nforward. Lenny grabs a woman standing by.\n\nLENNY\nGet back or I'll blow this bitch's brains to kingdom come!\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nDimes on the phone talking with the department. Boris is still moving on the\nfloor. Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back.\nAlabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket. She\nreaches in and pulls out his .38. She wipes her eyes. She holds the gun in her\nhand and remembers Clarence saying:\n\nCLARENCE\n(off)\nShe's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She\ncarried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,\nand the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!\nPray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!\n\nAlabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand.\n\nMarvin turns his head toward her. She shoots him twice.\n\nDimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun. She\nfires. He's hit in the head and flung to the floor.\n\nShe sees Boris on the kitchen floor.\n\nALABAMA\nBye-bye, Boris. Good luck.\n\nBORIS\nYou too, cutie.\n\nShe starts to leave and then spots the briefcase full of money. She takes it and\nwalks out the door.\n\nHALLWAY\n\nThe elevator opens and Wurlitzer steps out.\n\nAlabama comes around the corner.\n\nWURLITZER\nHey, you!\n\nAlabama shoots him three times in the belly. She steps into the elevator, the\ndoors close.\n\nLOBBY\n\nAlabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out. In the background, COPS\nare all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage.\n\nLENNY\nI wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready to\ntake me to Kilimanjaro and... and a million bucks!\n(pause)\nSmall bills!\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a PARKING LOT \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama puts the briefcase in the trunk. She gets into the Mustang and drives\naway.\n\nINT. MUSTANG \u221a MOVING \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's driving fast down the freeway. The DJ on the radio is trying to be\nfunny. She's muttering to herself.\n\nALABAMA\nI could have walked away. I told you that. I told you I could have walked\naway. This is not my fault. I did not do this. You did this one hundred\npercent to yourself. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling bad. I\nshould laugh cause you don't deserve any better. I could get another guy\nlike that. I'm hot lookin'. What are you? Dead! Dumb jerk. Asshole. You're\na asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole. You wanted it all, didn't ya?\nDidn't ya? Well watcha got now? You ain't got the money. You ain't got\nme. You ain't even got your body anymore. You got nothin'. Nada. Zip.\nGoose egg. Nil. Donut.\n\nThe song \"Little Arrows\" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio. Alabama breaks\ndown and starts crying. She pulls the car over to the side. The song continues.\nShe wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket. She tosses it on\nthe dashboard. She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth.\n\nShe pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view\nmirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens\non the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads\nit: \"You're so cool\".\n\nShe tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase. She\nlooks around for, and finally finds, the \"Sgt. Fury\" comic book Clarence bought\nher.\n\nAnd with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away\nfrom the Mustang forever.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nTHE END2Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

eyes\nBut for now, cry softly lonely one\nCry softly lonely one\nYour heartaches have just begun\nAnd though they linger on\nCarry on, be strong\n\nYou're baby's gone, left you alone\nBut I'll stand by you\nOn the long nights through\nYou can cry, cry to me girl\nC'mon and cry, cry to me girl\n\nFrom this moment on\nDon't cry all alone\nYou can run to me, come to me\nYou can cry to me\nTonight

all\nI don't feel bad at all\n[Chorus 1]\nPictures of Lily made my life so wonderful\nPictures of Lily helped me sleep at night\nPictures of Lily solved my childhood problems\nPictures of Lily helped

with Lily\nI asked my dad where Lily I could find\nHe said, \"Son, now don't be silly\nShe's been dead since 1929\"\nOh, how I cried that night\nIf only I'd been born in Lily's time\nIt would have been alright\n\n[Chorus 2]\nPictures of Lily made my life so wonderful\nPictures of Lily helped me sleep at night\nFor me and Lily are together in my dreams\nAnd I ask you, \"Hey mister, have you ever

"Head I.C.E. vs. Chilla Jones (Title Match) Lyrics[Round 1: Chilla Jones]\nSo water damage to your passport\nSo your canoe tipped over while you was paddlin'?\nOr you was in upstate New York gettin' some white water raftin' in?\nWell let's factor in the facts\nThere was a flood in your basement and it was too late for you to get a fuckin' replacement\nYou waited 24 hours to come up with a statement\nInstead we comin' to London with no justification\nOver a year for a title match, fans becomin' impatient, demandin' money back\nKing Fly refundin' the payments\nAnd this your champ?\nThis who you got to take what it succeed?\nCouldn't even protect the face on his passport and y'all let him be the face of the league\nBut I'm glad you made it my G\nYou got the photo on your passport booked right?\nOkay cool, cause after duckin' me at Decade\n{puts on a sweatshirt with a picture of Head ICE's passport on it}\n\nThis is probably exactly what it looks like\n\n[Head ICE]\nDon't choke\n\n[Chilla Jones]\nWhat's crackin' ICE?\nStab him twice, I hope Heaven can help ya\nHe'll find a blade in ICE temple like the Legend Of Zelda\nI'm above the law of ICE, like a lemon and seltzer\nMask up, flame burnin', why mess with a welder\nI felt the disrespect\nWhy you told Lux, \"They like me.\"\nSoundin' a little high brow, so I posted on IG\nKinda had the people's champ raisin' eyebrows\nLike, \"If ya \"Sma-\" y'all know the rest, yeah they like me\nBut they also played a big part in yo' success\nTHEY know I can finish a scheme cause they stop and listen\nAnd with that shit you kick, shit I throw my pad in the crowd, arms in a cross position\nI know you feelin' like your back's against the ropes\nBut by the time this 'rupt (disrupt) and hit him\nI'ma make it clear with the pen (pin), that I got a leg up with the competition\nNot to mention, you be actin' like I just be entertainin' whites\nNo offense but nobody think that shit you sayin' tight, my pen don't got no limitation\nSo to get the chain tonight, I'm eliminatin' ICE for more than immigration rights\nBut you live a gangsta's life\nY'all think his BS clever?\nHe told Bigg K, \"Gun pokin' out the shirt like a nipple on a T-Rex sweater\"\nOh that's that gangsta shit\nI ain't even playin' around witchu\nYou told Real Deal, \"I got shells the size of cow nipples\"\nThen you told Rone he had \"cow titties\"\nBut I'm 'posed to think this bully tough?\nHe got me standin' here feelin' like I need to zip my hoodie up\nCow titties my nigga?\nI can't believe the shit he utter (udder)\nSo for that, man I should take ya shorty and titty fuck her\nDark liquor got me feelin' like Papoose, I'm a Remy lover\nSemi tucker, screamin' \"Fuck the Wolves\" I'm Jimmy Butler\nI'm plenty gutter\nExit the whip or you'll be layin' in the projects\nGet out that car mello (Carmelo) Anthony, I ain't playin' wit' them Rockets\nI cock it, aim it and pop it\nStart snipin' the lead wit' a bullet right in the head, goin' right in the head\nYou was writin' ahead\nKingpen, I write on ya head\nWhat you writin' ahead?\nCrazy, I ain't right in the head\nBut you gon' try to take my life 'til I'm dead\nHow so? Tell him try it\nLike I've been on diet, the Cal's (cows) low\nYou'll be paralyzed tryin' to battle like \"Carry me out bro\"\nThey bringin' Head back and forth to the ring like Al Snow\nNow you know, bar for bar you can't hang wit' me\nThinkin' ICE sick'll (icicle) get him broken off for tryin' to hang wit' me\nIt's all the same shit you just talk and get hype G's\nBut tonight, try to be versatile with what you write, please\nMaybe punch a lil' bit, tie in some nice schemes\nOr rebuttal, that would be cold\nBut I don't think ICE free's (freeze)\nSee how well thought out that was?\nThat's why I'm a better artist than you\nCause I'm direct, keep takin' shots 'til my target is full\nThat fitted is fire, and them J's nice\nLooks like you tryin' to market a Bull\nThe problem witchu bein' the champ ICE is you ain't marketable\nThe muhfuckin' Kingpen\nStop givin' him props, all hail, ICE fallin' to the Kingpen Of The Dot\nAnd new!\nYou might also like[Round 1: Head ICE]\nThey said Drake was supposed to be in the buildin', I wasn't surprised\nCause I'm his favorite in battle rap\nThen I thought about it\nOh he out here to get 21 Savage back\nICE!\nYou say shit like, \"If he don't write back. He can't get his rights back\nThe way he left, I should've known he wasn't comin' right back\nBut I kept it civil, cause in war, after that hit, the strike is right back\nThat's dead center, but the injury was to his right back.\"\nAnd y'all like that?\nThat's why this the right match\nCause that punch was not for yo' eye\nIt's so you don't be surprised at the pressure that ICE pack\nYou stole my mojo and ran wit' it\nNow you under constructions like a planned business\nStephan Curry in the pole I ain't Under Armor\nAnd it'll push your tee (Pusha T) like a Drake diss if you come perform it nigga\nFor my Blood I'll Wack 100 and keep the Acura runnin'\nFor the chips and rings if that ain't the goal then (Golden) I'ma State who gon' be the last king comin'\nCause I'm draftin' somethin'\nYou ain't gon' know who from his sand dropped unless you use our (hour) glasses for it\nWho ya protection? Smack and them?\nNWX and Rain?\nI knew them niggas when they was young bucks\nTryin' to run behind Lux and them\nA bunch of soft niggas frontin' for a bunch of soft niggas, that's why I don't fuck wit' them\nYou niggas get nervous when we around\nCall people who tuck burners when we around\nOnly for your shooters to come shake my hand\nAnd be like, \"ICE. Just give us the word and we'll burn these niggas down.\"\nCause killers respect killers\nAnd your scheme don't work here, take that scheme elsewhere\nOr get dragged with a Canadian flag to a slab to get supreme healthcare\nYou tried to use the Wu against me, that's a good prop, Joe\nBut without the wire the Method is to kill those that try to go against me\nAll my [?], see now I shall lend (Shaolin) the Golden Arms after removin' prints (Prince)\nMy killer army (Killarmy) do exist\nBoard meetings, no croc or dial (crocodile) and their gators like a Lacrosse t-shirt\nI'm truly offended\nKnowin' when I keep it too frank to lend, let's keep it a Benji\nYou don't keep it a hundred\nYou 10% of the cut after 10% of the cut, no breakdown\nSo I don't respect the shakedown unless Red Cafe and them comin'\nI'm the young OG besides Fab' in the Maybach\nI give credit where credit is due\nBut if your credit is due, I want nothin' but cash on the payback\nI give a fuck if you pay loans on your vehicle after I tell my girl, \"Loan me your vehicle.\"\nBullets flyin', towards Jones\nThe crime scene was so intense and loud\nYour child tried to call police on a toy phone\nBut it was Pearl Harbor\nAntonio Tarver, after those bombs landin' I Roy Jones\nJunior keep your shoes tied\nI won't get odd if you get even if you choose sides\nI just find a space to eat him soon as the space between us like a moon pie\nYou had the nerve to speak on my ability\nLike you royaled up\nAnd you a fake diamond, Lil' Jon oil cup\nEven ya bitch feel she too shiny for yo' ass so all you butt\nDon't bring this pussy near me\nDoin' battles in local community centers lookin' shook and scary\nAin't no justification if this hooker dare me\nAnd I'm even takin' a pimp's cut over this vagina like the pussy hairy\nPussy hear me?\nYeah, try and 'ply, and I'ma show you what the mask for (Mass 4) after the Iron shot\nThey gon' say, \"ICE hit him wit' a big 40 too (42); Ronnie Lott\"\nCause he was fakin' a facade with no burners on him\nThis nigga's 6'9\", tryin' to put a 30 on a Chief then run to police and tell who he sent to do the murders for him\nRat! Rat!\n6'9\" was supposed to get outta jail when he was 69\nBut niggas ate wit' this pussy, cause he was suckin' dick to be down, that's what I hate about 69s\nBut he gon' get shot six or nine times with the six shooter\nThe .9, he gon' be six feet, his suit gin' be a nine piece, design\nYou think you suited for them?\nWell your tailor port the cheap bottom\nIf I swing on you more than once the feet follow\nYou see Math and Hollow beefin' over two\nBut for six ounces I'll press you like a knock out punch from elite boxers, nigga\nYou throwin' jokes, Chappelle skits\nI'm so deep in the smoke I'm tryin' to put .380 bullets in the .9, hopin' the shells fit\nRan outta .9 shells shootin' at another crack pusher\nFor tryin' to put my name in bottles to promote his cook up\nBut meet the kingpin (Kingpen) with no drugs charges\nWho still got a Mexican watchin' over his sales like he drug smugglin'\nDon't bring ya bitch around me\nI'ma big dick nigga, I'ma want to see if she can test the water\nAnd if she go off energy, then it's fuck yo' Infinity, just after I test love (Tesla) offered\nMan ICE and Chill a (Chilla) cold combo\nSo the (soda) pop from the freezer ain't a frozen bottle\nYou get instant cook\nYou'll have a gas livin' without a mention in our history books\nSlow ya roll or get jack\nWe even removin' the car tire\nWe won't spare you either when a pair of Eagles rippin' into ya flesh over those bars for forgettin' the barb wire, nigga\nThis maximum pressure\nPen I tenture read (penitentiary) and discuss the murder behind glass to those who support the act like Bruce Willis\nDie Hard why would you try God?\nEven Nems tried to come to the stage deep like his pride was G\nBut saw the Mark in me wasn't nobody he could test like Saigon\nI got a lotta cars I wanna get but I ain't goin' the Craig's way\nStand under the 50\nIt ain't Eminem and Curtis in the same frame\nThe stick still holdin' a nigga down with one foot in the game like a peg leg nigga\nOh I'm bound to get it\nI have my wolves searchin' the ground even if it sound suspicious\nSo off of air they'll affect shins (affection) even if you ain't down to kick it nigga\nA nigga died over some twerk (Twork) it wasn't a Jersey murder\nForensics said all the bullets added up to a Karl Anthony Towns\nBut the shootin' was done by a Chauncey Billups jersey number\nThey-they-they ain't get that\n[Chilla Jones]\nThat was hard\n\n[Head ICE]\nI don't like keepin' a secret with those I don't keep it at peace with\nSo if the deuce in the air, you already got dragged\nAnd ain't nobody watchin' out for a race after the tires are screechin'\nSo what's up youngin'? You ain't old enough\nThat chip on ya shoulder ain't grow enough\nBy the time you fit the shoes, that riot gear gon' be old as fuck\nSo you out here givin' 'em light chills but in ICE grill you ain't cold enough, nigga\nICE!\n\n[Round 2: Chilla Jones]\nSo this ya London debut?\nDon't make the same mistakes they do\nWhoever told you to mention Big Ben and Princess Diana played you\nBut since it's ya first time in the UK I'ma save you\nGet on my Big L and break down some London slang too\nExample: they put tobacco in they blunts and they call it a \"spliff\"\nA cookie's a \"biscuit\", French fries are \"chips\"\nSee they call a train a \"tube\", an elevator's a \"lift\"\nAnd if you joke or disrespect then you \"takin' a piss\"\nA house is a \"flat\" a store is a \"shop\"\nPeep the lyrics, get it clear\nSee what we call liquor they call \"spirits\"\nI just had to let you know from the jump, right out the gate\nShout out to Big L, for this big L you about to take\nWho can stop ICE?\nHe stops lives in front of stop lights\nStop ICE\nCause you tried to battle Shotgun Suge and it got blocked twice\nNot ICE!\nMr. I Control Everything\nArsonal offered you Suge, you said, \"I don't know if they'll let me king.\"\nNot ICE!\nMr. I Control Everything and rap raw\nClaimin' Smack don't like you and URL got you blackballed\nIt's wack, see y'all don't even believe he can die in seconds\nBut he Will, all by himself, cause I Am Legend\nBut I'm 'posed to be the Wolf gang puck\nGettin' slapped around if I ever slide in ICE direction\nNotice I said Wolfgang Puck, cause I got the skill it (skillet) take to cook\nY'all see me and Iron Chef'fin' out\nY'all was expectin' Pass, Deal, maybe Ward to put him right in his place\nFor those who say I lost my last fight, maybe that's why they put ICE in my face\nSpeakin' of losin' fights, what happened after them three rounds for Swave?\nYou dissed QB and them CT niggas came around your way\nYou got damn near slumped, they jumped you for like an hour straight\nThen they put extra bodies on ICE, that was the power play\nShouts to Drake, cause he was out like a light uh\nLike a light uh\nLike a light (uh)\nSlept through the night\nBut when he woke up on the block man the knots was all over\nHeadshot so many fades, he reminded me of a barber shop poster\nOh you mad?\nNot ICE?\nMr. I Control Everything, the thug hero\nWho can't handle his emotions\nYeah I know who ya bug weirdo\nSee he just gotta hit his heart like Cupid with love's arrow\nI'm just showin' y'all I control ICE I'm Sub-Zero\nMK, MK\nSay goodnight Wolf I'm winnin' live on cam' ain't no tellin' how this might look\nFuck a right hook, I run up on you wit' a tre squeezin'\nThen BAOW, head in the clouds like he daydreamin'\nStay schemin', hand me the crown\nThis cat runnin' wit' wolves, this car'll (Karl) drive through Anthony Towns\nCause now he started drama\nI'm not a boxer I brought a Llama\nYou wanna go around, when here come a round, just call it karma\nI bring every target trauma\nGrip and squirt, rip his shirt\nEliminating half ICE tee (ice tea) like Arnold Palmer\nBut I'm calmer than most, not as friendly as I let on fam'\nThis battle, not the one that I would bet on fam'\nICE is the hostage, I wouldn't want to be Head on cam'\nIsis, the hostage, wouldn't want to behead on cam'\nMan, I'm the best at this\nWho the \"F\" is this tryin' to compete wit' me? The Exorcist\nWhat I possess will make Head do a 360\nBut let me flip that, get back\nI snuck a black pistol in, the gat whistlin', with the Mag I'm magnificent\nCatch him comin' outta his spot, the blast hittin' him\nBAOW! I'm puttin' HEAD through the door I'm Jack Nicholson\nIs y'all listenin'?\nI'm blackin' out tryin' to show him to the light\nHe was jonesin' for a fight, now Jones in for the fight\nThey say, \"Jones in for a fight\"\nAnd this is your Premier battle? You should've pulled a Cojay\nYou was better no-showin' on the mic (Mike)\nIt's alright...cause I'm nice\nStop givin' him props\nAll hail, ICE fallin' to the Kingpen Of The Dot\nAnd new!\n\n[Round 2: Head ICE]\nSee that's how I know you're not thuggin' black\nTry to bring up some street shit and you don't really want none of that\nThat'll get every blood cell in your mug a cap\nYou came to bring T pain (T-Pain)?\nWell there was D for your L Shawty on the low (Lo), let's get it snappin'\nYou came to bring Toronto pain?\nWell they was down for your loss shorty on the low, let's get it snappin'\nCause you actin'\nAnd killers ain't for the rose unless gettin' napkins\nWhat's happenin'?\nFirst it's like, \"ICE can't make a classic.\"\nThey sponged everything when he was bubbly\nNow they tryin' to keep him underwater wit' Patrick\nThey why they gave Hollow Dizaster or Iron to Magic\nAnd try to blind me wit' a Big T\nBut I was tall enough to see that he only agreed cause his Summer wasn't Madness\n\n{Chokes}\n\nRone said ICE you cold but the top is colder\nWhen you put on that chain you realize it ain't no snakes in the lane, but just a lane used for lots of vultures\nAnd I thought the bird was pickin' at me\nCause all I saw was my shot from bein' trigger happy\nBut now I see what lies beneath\nSo if you create a Harriet Tubman scheme I could prolly tell you the rest of the way to go exactly\nFor example; I got trust issues\nSo you gotta make your wife suck my dick before I fuck witchu\nWe can run the train after\nThat's the scheme\nFuck you thought? I was on board to railroad my people? I'm the king, nigga\nI don't think I got enough pistols\nI thought you was gunnin' to be the man on URL but they let Roc(k) launch and only the subs miss you\nBullets ain't got no name\nBut Jerome niece got a shooter\n25 years after they the gun that match the slugs in her? Ain't that right?\nCause guess who got shot in the dome piece?\nJerome's niece on her way from Jones Beach\nSo stick to ya character part\nIf you draw that's amateur art\nThis .40 got 750 cocktail ingredients\nA shot'll spill more liquid than you thought, nigga\nNow look me in eyes and tell me you actually schemed on something\nHit the beam on somethin'\nScarred the op', then sent him back to warn the team you comin'\nNever!\nI was in Boston and watched your demeanor\nI figured Chilla had the hoes in the spot I could stretch him\n'Til some real niggas walked up and this turned into a hostages rescue\nI'm lookin' at Chilla, he lookin' at the nigga who girl's he wit'\nThen looked at me and I'm like, \"If you gotta scheme to get outta this situation right now. I'm all the way in.\"\nLong story short, they could've made a web series\nCause Boston baked beans, so frankly he ain't ready for this hot water cause he buns\nSo by the time he catch up (ketchup) to this real live street shit\nThere'll be lead in him\nBAOW! You hang with danger, but ain't prepared for danger\nHow ironic, cause I'm a livin' prophet and ya lime, light like gin and tonic\nThat type of doc will get you and your dawg (Dogg) Pound for sellin' Chronic\nAfter Math (aftermath), shit got Shady for Slim\nI backed out the .40 Loc\nUnder 50, under was 50 and took 80%\nYou young bucks wildin'\nI had my hand over eyes before one 1000\nOr red light, green light\nNo snow on the ground but when I sled my mask was ski tight\nSo if a Proving Ground or top tier nigga ask you \"What ICE 'bout 'bout?\" Just say \"Master P type\"\nI'm in this for life\nWe past the three strikes\nPlus move off principle, you outta class, you gotta ask to speak twice, nigga\nI need more than love\nThe fiends I serve need more than drugs\nThat's dope, but throughout the dust, my .9 had to serve more than one\nI knocked ya bitch down in room 5\nRoom 5 Ars'\nAnd she told me he brought a band to hit her; Maroon 5\nTwo piece will only make ya manager be able to manage his raccoon eyes\nYou sincere and too kind\nEven in jail I was gettin' my bread off of bottles out the water; moonshine\nBut now I'm fuckin' ya aunt\nI gotta pump it louder, hood chick\nYa grandma owe me $350\nBut this ass whoopin' you takin' tonight is priceless\nSo I'ma look at that as some bullshit\nAnd you don't want no smoke cause you cause you Black & Mild\nThat's why ya aunt gon' keep gettin' this wood tip\nYou can't get to a cannon (Kannon) unless Ms. Gracie book 'em for a rap battle\nWith a face like that you can't even grill fight\nYo Chilla, you look so soft, you make a nigga wanna beat you up even more in a real fight\nLook at him\nYeah, so next time y'all talk on the phone\nTell Surf I ain't puttin' not Titles on my Gun cause my hammers ain't stayin' good\nAnd that freestyle wit' me, him and Lux\nI almost got my gun dirty protectin' him and he can put that on his neighborhood\nI'll put you under my wing then give you instructions\nThen tell my wolf, \"Take the picture and add the caption 'You can't touch him. He's one of ours.'\"\nSo if you [?] son is ours\nOr play under a rock with your name and birthday on it and I send you flowers\nI'll point a rifle at your family tree, I want answers now\nOr they gon' trap the dirt on this corn feel (cornfield) when this banana clip knock the apples down\nMug shots, line ups, wanted posters\nCounty time turn to state bids\nHelp me dodge that Fed case, now that warrants over\nSo know my mind is thinkin' of a chillin' getaway when I leave your corpse on the corner colder, nigga\nThey said, \"Chilla gon' escape the paws.\"\nI'm lookin' like, \"I'm just trainin' my dogs.\"\nThe way Chubbs got\nAnd still KOTD reppin' like the IG page that Dub's got\nYes, some of this battle rap money sponsor local neighborhood drug spots\nBut Chilla? Can't out bar me unless he club hop\nThe .9 clip shaped like Slinky\nAnother Twinkie in the glove box\nAin't no power when he right, he lacy\nThis counter punch is way the millions and the judge watch\nAye look, I gave the last Jones the Hawk but I miss my dawg (dog) like X and Kato\nI flip big H twice, every three days but for this bird you bought me to sell out?\nI'ma need an extra day tho'\nRound two and I already showed you niggas how to treat Chilla like a prostitute\nAnd not give him his bag until he finish shakin' his leg like Zab after that jab from Kostya Tsyzu\nThat's why ya bitch won't neglect me\nCause I got her pumps like my bitch first Giuseppe\nWe ain't cool, you a Rubix Cube\nThat color on that block you choose can't connect me\nBut even if you turned sour\nGun powder\nPaow, the shell will knock a turd out him\nGang affiliation jail like, \"We never heard about him.\"\nSo his pride died when that flag tried to dry up the blood that earned around him\nICE!\n\n[Round 3: Chilla Jones]\nY'all remember a few minutes ago he was just chokin'?\nAnd I told y'all to encourage him?\nMy only motive was helpin' to rap\nIt's ironic, his whole round was 'bout how I'm not in the street shit\nBut all it took was a hand gesture and I tell 'em how to clap\nAye the best Chilla we ever seen? Tough call\nEvery battle I raised the bar like a bench presser\nThe best Head we ever seen? Tough call\nTeanna Trump, Gianna Michel, Karrine Steffans\nYou suck ICE, my whole class could school you\nYou ain't invincible but fuck that\nSee I ain't call Head \"master\" (headmaster) off principle\nWe witnessed you, do nothin' wit' the chain\nWhat has ICE accomplished, if there was anything, we'd be growin' like hydroponics\nBut let's be honest\nI mean, we knew Rone was headed straight to BarStool\nPlus they wanted an urban face as the champ, that played a part too\nSo yeah you the King Of The Dot but you really think they impartial?\nThey just really wanted a black on the throne like Meghan Markle\nDon't be startled\nCause you lost a lot of battles, even the Los shit\nNems made it debatable, Bigg K smoked shit\nAnd T ate yo' NY bars, that was the closest\nA.N.T.H.O.N.Y. bars! Boy I'm the coldest\nHow I'm spellin' out ya government name and you ain't notice?\nBoy I'm focused\nWhen I'm gone I'll be missed in this profession\nI got the imprint of a legend, we leave a difference and impression\nBut you remind 'em of they grandfather ICE\nThat's not an age joke, just listen to the reference\nIt's cause we only see you twice a year and all they get from you is presents (presence)\nBut the lesson in these rounds, you can't call me \"wack\" boy I'm the Kingpen\nIt's time to show you why they call me that\nRemember Lux lost the rematch to Mook? He was defeated and hopeless\nThen my Daylyt battle dropped and in every tweet they would quote it\nThe War Report, they did a poll, thousands of people had voted\nGuess who ranked the top pen? Me, all I did was find a scheme to promote it\nSo I screamed it in Prep's face, it hit the screen and exploded\nCreated a brand, sold merchandise, it was genius and golden\nSee you think every pen nigga wanna be Lux and that's why I'm unbelievably focused\nCause if you train to kill with one shot, then why the fuck would you need to be Loaded\nAnd you can quote it\nI'm the best pen ever\nAnd I can say more but I'm just explainin' how I got my title before I take yours\nAnd I'ma make sure, when it's all said and done I'm your favorite writer\nIf con (Kon) Artists look at me Crooked, I play conniver (Kuniva)\nLeft the Westside Gunn-er with five .9's (5'9\"), gave 'em fire\nIt's Bizarre, but I'll make you a yeller Wolf (Yelawolf)\nYa life will end with an M-16 (Em' 16) like a Shady cipher\nY'all say he nicer?\nYou should've put your check on ICE\nCause I'ma take the chain to make it reign 'til they check gone ICE\nFrench toast, but I'ma use somethin' Czeck on ICE\nThrow the stick across his chest, put a check on ICE\nStomp him out with a pair of Nikes, put a check on ICE\nThe .40 on chill so you don't gonna check on ICE\nBut while y'all check on ICE, aye Pass, quit with the act soldier\nSaid you killed me? Okay that's cool, well now I'm back colder\nBut I get it, in case I win you wanna bring that rematch closer\nThought you was gon' eat, well if 'Ganik say the word then Pass over (Passover)\nListen God, tell that Christian squad this is our lane\nYeah they reppin' IV, but this shit in our veins\nI keep a stick for the beef, let that shish kabob bang\nWard gon' be a headless Horseman like Ichabod Crane\nIt's my chain, yeah I guess I'm a batch lighter\nThe gat fire, extended clip, got a three minute round, it's on a SMACK timer\nErrr, off the back tires, hangin' out the Pathfinder\nThe ratchet makin' Head look bad, I call it \"Blac Chyna\"\nThe raps flier\nEvery punch is nuts; low blow\nI'm at the gun store; dolo\nCoppin' metal; Robo\nOohh, you a foe foe\nCool, I got a fo' fo' with somethin' scary at the end of this clip nigga; Momo\nI know you wishin' this was promo, but you can dead that\nThere's a new champ in town and ICE gon' have to respect that\nIf not, it's gon' be a fair exchange when that TEC clap\nCause I'm sendin' ICE to the sky and makin' God send his cadet back\nSo step back\nIt's a wrap, stop givin' him props\nAll hail, ICE fallin' to the Kingpen Of The Dot\nAnd new!\n\n[Round 3: Head ICE]\nHe said when his TEC clap\nI'm not here to drag your name through the mug young buck\nYa glamour is perfect\nBut if you up here talkin' all this gangsta shit on how ya hammer is workin'\nDon't be mad at me for not believin' you\nCause you the one that got they head blown when you saw that man in person\nYeah, I was in DC Fly, tokin'\nBut a lot of clips on me, stylin' out\nGot a phone call, the next day I'm in Austin\nWith a Cannon bein' a Hitman, who Wild N Out?\nYo Ars', I saw Chilla on the corner schemin' and made a move around\nBaow, shot once, I don't know if I hit or missed him, but I lose a round\nThen I chased him, in the buildin' he usually around\nIt's still blood on the carpet in the apartment that his baby mother cousin usin' now\nAll I had to do was follow the drip, then his noggin' got hit\n'Til his top tear (tier) 'til he was Proving Ground, nigga\nYou a mistake, you should've never got a date to make it out the hospital\nIf I was yo' father I'd have nutted in yo' mother face\nCause I know she can't stand the taste of seein' you grow to be a prostitute\nWhat? You feelin' froggy then leap\nShow the anger from it\nBut don't be surprised, when after that action\nYou wake up in the arm of Danja mother\nRest in peace to that lady, you know\nYou'll never make the cut that's why I'm addressin' you to lose this fake ass thug appearance\nCause every hustler wanna be ghost 'til them pigeons turn into a dove and you really gotta hug a spirit\nI never heard your name mentioned in a war story, not even a little fight\nSo us keepin' it civil, cause I'm the only one who could assure Glory nigga\nEvery nigga in my circle the plug, we be in outlets like extension cords\nDifferent stores\nPick it all, some even pimpin' whores\nBut I ain't no Trick, Daddy, 'I'm A Thug'\nSo if yo' bitch go M.I.A., by the time she go back to New York to take her shit, I'll be here to get my drugs\nYou the complexion that Charlemagne gon' end up lookin' like\nIf I tick it (ticket) gon' book ya flight\nCause a combination gon' knock today's lesson out his head like playin' hookey twice\nYou Arnold, I'm the Tookie type\nYa mission is to kill me, but I wrote the kids the book of life\nSo what you see is Blue, but these gon' get Mo' Better than Denzel and Spike\nThere's levels to this, but some admire the Ground is Proving\nIn his mind, he just jumped to top tier\n'Til gravity pulled him back down\nYou stupid nigga\nThis useless, he wastin' our time\nMe passin' Jones the torch, will only to find ancient shit in the mine (mind)\nYa ink ain't for this design\nThat link could be your demise\nCause if I'm forced to grab the nose, it's gon' be uglier than a safety test for DUI\nSave the jokes for April 1st, cause fuck is you smilin' about?\nI'll put another smile in ya mouth\nYou'll get murdered by the youngin' in the backseat\nCause we know you a track meet if I'm standin' outside of yo' house\nI'm that grimy\nStolen cars for the hit, no rats find me\nThe AK, gave him 47 holes out that MAC 90\nChilla better chill or be froze forever\nOr his lost pose gonna be holdin' his holes together\nLet's take it there, gun butt, breathe with blood in ya nasal hairs\nNow you got less energy\nAnd that thin ass sky blue vest tickle me\nCause you gon' get a headshot like the best Kennedy\nOr get tied then die in a chair like the death penalty, nigga\nIt's in my genes, you know the deal\nYou get bodied, and God a witness to Biggie playin'\nThen the Feds will realize it's a bigger unit behind this murder than Lenny Grant\nYou got app reminders\nAin't no juice in ya girl box unless she got apple cider\nA wolf asks for steak meals, you brought me snakes and appetizers\nSo I ain't payin' for this bill unless the collector got battle raps behind it\nRound three, and I already showed y'all how to treat Chilla like a prostitute\nCause ya flow borin', ya whole performance trash to me\nMy time kids get the punch the prom is over\nCause ya scheme is too dragged out like Cassidy\nSo eat a dick nigga you don't pop\nYou ain't never gon' be the king of King Of The Dot\nBAOW\nICE niggaEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/6747599", "artist_names": "\u200b\u200b\u200bvintagewashingmachine", "full_title": "\u200bvwm's

him, they'll never cheer him\nDon't even know his name\nBut I don't care he's playing for me, and he'll play my favorite melody\nHe's the melancholy music man, but he don't mind\nJust take you time, keep on playing\nAnd back to the way\nJust for me, (just for me) won't you please (won't you please)\nWon't you please (won't you please) play for me (play for me)\nMelancholy music man\nMelancholy

Lyrics(Clarke/Hicks/Nash)\nWill you try to justify the meaning, of the note you sent this evening, to my door your not deceiving me\nI'd of thought that you'd have known me better, sending round an unsigned letter, facing you would be much better now\nIs it just that you can't face the future with me, can't you tell me to my face\nYou just took the cowards way to say good-bye, how would you feel

frozen over I though i was clever\n\n[Verse 1]\nI would avoid all the drama\nSo there'd be nothing bad to tell your mama\nJust that when I sleep I don't wear pajamas\nAnd that I want to take you to the fucking Bahamas's\nJust can't keep hanging on\nWe used to be banging til dawn\nShe looks like she was drawn\nMost think she's from Iran\nEric Hammer the don\nArtistic phenomenon\nI would keep an Eye on\nMe you can rely on\nGirl my bed you can lie on\nJust don't spy on\nMe she said right on\nMagic carpet we fly on\nWant a girl from Taiwan\nThat doesn't need a\nShoulder to cry on\nAnd fucks with the light on\nEvery day's the right day to die on\nThis is a track you can vibe on\n[Verse 2]\nWhat's the best way\nTo change a life today\nAfter you finish\nThey shouldn't know what to say\nShe

here to answer your prayin\nSo just quit playin\nMy heart you're sprainin\nDon't you dare think that I'm surprised\nThat I'm the number one person you despise\nBut there's one thing I need you to realize\nI removed your disguise\n\n[Verse 3]\nSave me from myself\nThis problem won't fix itself\nOnly time will tell\nThat you felt what I felt\nWe would never yell\nBut I guess I wasn't good enough\nOh well\nI make impressions you remember\nI'll be stacking by December\nDunking on every defender\nExposing every pretender\nTo my friends I'm a lender\nTo you I'm a spender\nAt the end of the show I smash a fender\nMy bro said your hoes here I said send her\nInside\nRide or die\nLook me in my eyes\nAnd tell me why\nI'm your guy\nAnd why you're mine\nSun don't shine\nWhen you lie\nI gave you all of me\nI wonder why personally\nBecause we weren't meant to be\nI wish I could make you see\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nThat we were the best\nMontague to your capulet\nThe best is yet\nTo

"artist": "Martin Luther King Jr.", "lyrics": "The Birth of a New Nation LyricsI want to preach this morning from the subject: \"The Birth of a New Nation.\" And I would like to use as a basis for our thinking together a story that has long since been stenciled on the mental sheets of succeeding generations. It is the story of the Exodus, the story of the flight of the Hebrew people from the bondage of Egypt, through the wilderness, and finally to the Promised Land. It\u2019s a beautiful story. I had the privilege the other night of seeing the story in movie terms in New York City, entitled \"The Ten Commandments,\" and I came to see it in all of its beauty\u2014the struggle of Moses, the struggle of his devoted followers as they sought to get out of Egypt. And they finally moved on to the wilderness and toward the Promised Land. This is something of the story of every people struggling for freedom. It is the first story of man\u2019s explicit quest for freedom. And it demonstrates the stages that seem to inevitably follow the quest for freedom\n\nPrior to March the sixth, 1957, there existed a country known as the Gold Coast. This country was a colony of the British Empire. This country was situated in that vast continent known as Africa. I\u2019m sure you know a great deal about Africa, that continent with some two hundred million people and it extends and covers a great deal of territory. There are many familiar names associated with Africa that you would probably remember, and there are some countries in Africa that many people never realize. For instance, Egypt is in Africa. And there is that vast area of North Africa with Egypt and Ethiopia, with Tunisia and Algeria and Morocco and Libya. Then you might move to South Africa and you think of that extensive territory known as the Union of South Africa. There is that capital city Johannesburg that you read so much about these days. Then there is central Africa with places like Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo. And then there is East Africa with places like Kenya and Tanganyika, and places like Uganda and other very powerful countries right there. And then you move over to West Africa, where you find the French West Africa and Nigeria, and Liberia and Sierra Leone and places like that. And it is in this spot, in this section of Africa, that we find the Gold Coast, there in West Africa\n\nYou also know that for years and for centuries, Africa has been one of the most exploited continents in the history of the world. It\u2019s been the \"Dark Continent.\" It\u2019s been the continent that has suffered all of the pain and the affliction that could be mustered up by other nations. And it is that continent which has experienced slavery, which has experienced all of the lowest standards that we can think about, and its been brought into being by the exploitation inflicted upon it by other nations\n\nAnd this country, the Gold Coast, was a part of this extensive continent known as Africa. It\u2019s a little country there in West Africa about ninety-one thousand miles in area, with a population of about five million people, a little more than four and a half million. And it stands there with its capital city, Accra. For years the Gold Coast was exploited and dominated and trampled over. The first European settlers came in there about 1444, the Portuguese, and they started legitimate trade with the people in the Gold Coast. They started dealing with them with their gold, and in turn they gave them guns and ammunition and gunpowder and that type of thing. Well, pretty soon America was discovered a few years later in the fourteen hundreds, and then the British West Indies. And all of these growing discoveries brought about the slave trade. You remember it started in America in 1619\n\nAnd there was a big scramble for power in Africa. With the growth of the slave trade, there came into Africa, into the Gold Coast in particular, not only the Portuguese but also the Swedes and the Danes and the Dutch and the British. And all of these nations competed with each other to win the power of the Gold Coast so that they could exploit these people for commercial reasons and sell them into slavery\n\nFinally, in 1850, Britain won out, and she gained possession of the total territorial expansion of the Gold Coast. From 1850 to 1957, March sixth, the Gold Coast was a colony of the British Empire. And as a colony she suffered all of the injustices, all of the exploitation, all of the humiliation that comes as a result of colonialism. But like all slavery, like all domination, like all exploitation, it came to the point that the people got tired of it\nAnd that seems to be the long story of history. There seems to be a throbbing desire, there seems to be an internal desire for freedom within the soul of every man. And it\u2019s there\u2014it might not break forth in the beginning, but eventually it breaks out Men realize that freedom is something basic, and to rob a man of his freedom is to take from him the essential basis of his manhood. To take from him his freedom is to rob him of something of God\u2019s image. To paraphrase the words of Shakespeare\u2019s Othello: Who steals my purse steals trash; \u2018tis something, nothing; twas mine, \u2018tis his, has been the slave of thousands; but he who filches from me my freedom robs me of that which not enriches him, but makes me poor indeed\n\nThere is something in the soul that cries out for freedom. There is something deep down within the very soul of man that reaches out for Canaan. Men cannot be satisfied with Egypt. They tried to adjust to it for awhile. Many men have vested interests in Egypt, and they are slow to leave. Egypt makes it profitable to them; some people profit by Egypt. The vast majority, the masses of people never profit by Egypt, and they are never content with it. And eventually they rise up and begin to cry out for Canaan\u2019s land\n\nAnd so these people got tired. It had a long history. As far back as 1844, the chiefs themselves of the Gold Coast rose up and came together and revolted against the British Empire and the other powers that were in existence at that time dominating the Gold Coast. They revolted, saying that they wanted to govern themselves. But these powers clamped down on them, and the British said that we will not let you go\n\nAbout 1909, a young man was born on the twelfth of September. History didn\u2019t know at that time what that young man had in his mind. His mother and father, illiterate, not a part of the powerful tribal life of Africa, not chiefs at all, but humble people. And that boy grew up. He went to school at Achimota for a while in Africa, and then he finished there with honors and decided to work his way to America. And he landed to America one day with about fifty dollars in his pocket in terms of pounds, getting ready to get an education. And he went down to Pennsylvania, to Lincoln University. He started studying there, and he started reading the great insights of the philosophers, he started reading the great insights of the ages. And he finished there and took his theological degree there and preached awhile around Philadelphia and other areas as he was in the country. And went over to the University of Pennsylvania and took up a masters there in philosophy and sociology. All the years that he stood in America, he was poor, he had to work hard. He says in his autobiography how he worked as a bellhop in hotels, as a dishwasher, and during the summer how he worked as a waiter trying to struggle through school\n\n\"I want to go back home. I want to go back to West Africa, the land of my people, my native land There is some work to be done there.\" He got a ship and went to London and stopped for a while by London School of Economy and picked up another degree there. Then while in London, he started thinking about Pan-Africanism and the problem of how to free his people from colonialism. For as he said, he always realized that colonialism was made for domination and for exploitation. It was made to keep a certain group down and exploit that group economically for the advantage of another. He studied and thought about all of this, and one day he decided to go back to Africa\n\nHe got to Africa and he was immediately elected the executive secretary of the United Party of the Gold Coast. And he worked hard, and he started getting a following. And the people in this party, the old, the people who had had their hands on the plow for a long time, thought he was pushing a little too fast, and they got a little jealous of his influence. and so finally he had to break from the United Party of the Gold Coast, and in 1949 he organized the Convention People\u2019s Party. It was this party that started out working for the independence of the Gold Coast. He started out in a humble way, urging his people to unite for freedom and urging the officials of the British Empire to give them freedom. They were slow to respond, but the masses of people were with him, and they had united to become the most powerful and influential party that had ever been organized in that section of Africa\n\nHe started writing. And his companions with him, and many of them started writing so much that the officials got afraid, and they put them in jail. And Nkrumah himself was finally placed in jail for several years because he was a seditious man, he was an agitator. He was imprisoned on the basis of sedition, and he was placed there to stay in prison for many years. But he had inspired some people outside of prison. They got together just a few months after he\u2019d been in prison and elected him the prime minister while he was in prison. For awhile the British officials tried to keep him there, and Gbedemah says\u2014one of his close associates, the Minister of Finance, Mr. Gbedemah\u2014 said that that night the people were getting ready to go down to the jail and get him out. But Gbedemah said, \"This isn\u2019t the way; we can\u2019t do it like this. Violence will break out and we will defeat our purpose.\" But the British Empire saw that they had better let him out. And in a few hours Kwame Nkrumah was out of jail, the prime minister of the Gold Coast. He was placed there for fifteen years but he only served eight or nine months, and now he comes out the Prime Minister of the Gold Coast\n\nAnd this was the struggling that had been going on for years. It was now coming to the point that this little nation was moving toward its independence. Then came the continual agitation, the continual resistance, so that the British Empire saw that it could no longer rule the Gold Coast. And they agreed that on the sixth of March, 1957, they would release this nation. This nation would no longer be a colony of the British Empire, that this nation would be a sovereign nation within the British Commonwealth. All of this was because of the persistent protest, the continual agitation on the part of Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah and the other leaders who worked along with him and the masses of people who were willing to follow\n\nSo that day finally came. It was a great day. The week ahead was a great week. They had been preparing for this day for many years, and now it was here. People coming in from all over the world. They had started getting in by the second of March. Seventy nations represented to come to say to this new nation: \"We greet you, and we give you our moral support. We hope for you God\u2019s guidance as you move now into the realm of independence.\" From America itself more than a hundred persons: the press, the diplomatic guests, and the prime minister\u2019s guests. And oh, it was a beautiful experience to see some of the leading persons on the scene of civil rights in America on hand to say, \"Greetings to you,\" as this new nation was born. Look over, to my right is Adam Powell, to my left is Charles Diggs, to my right again is Ralph Bunche. To the other side is Her Majesty\u2019s First Minister of Jamaica, Manning, Ambassador Jones of Liberia. All of these people from America, Mordecai Johnson, Horace Mann Bond, all of these people just going over to say, \"We want to greet you and we want you to know that you have our moral support as you grow.\" Then you look out and see the vice-president of the United States, you see A. Philip Randolph, you see all of the people who have stood in the forefront of the struggle for civil rights over the years, coming over to Africa to say, \"We bid you Godspeed.\" This was a great day not only for Nkrumah, but for the whole of the Gold Coast\n\nThen came Tuesday, [March] the fifth, many events leading up to it. That night we walked into the closing of Parliament\u2014the closing of the old Parliament, the old Parliament, which was presided over by the British Empire. The old Parliament which designated colonialism and imperialism. Now that Parliament is closing. That was a great sight and a great picture and a great scene. We sat there that night, just about five hundred able to get in there. People, thousands and thousands of people waiting outside, just about five hundred in there, and we were fortunate enough to be sitting there at that moment as guests of the prime minister. At that hour we noticed Prime Minister Nkrumah walking in with all of his ministers, with his justices of the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast, and with all of the people of the Convention People\u2019s Party, the leaders of that party. Nkrumah came up to make his closing speech to the old Gold Coast. There was something old now passing away\n\nThe thing that impressed me more than anything else that night was the fact that when Nkrumah walked in, and his other ministers who had been in prison with him, they didn\u2019t come in with the crowns and all of the garments of kings, but they walked in with prison caps and the coats that they had lived with for all of the months that they had been in prison. Nkrumah stood up and made his closing speech to Parliament with the little cap that he wore in prison for several months and the coat that he wore in prison for several months, and all of his ministers round about him. That was a great hour. An old Parliament passing away\n\nAnd then at twelve o\u2019clock that night we walked out. As we walked out we noticed all over the polo grounds almost a half-a-million people. They had waited for this hour and this moment for years. As we walked out of the door and looked at that beautiful building, we looked up to the top of it and there was a little flag that had been flowing around the sky for many years. It was the Union Jack flag of the Gold Coast, the British flag, you see. But at twelve o\u2019clock that night we saw a little flag coming down, and another flag went up. The old Union Jack flag came down, and the new flag of Ghana went up. This was a new nation now, a new nation being born\n\nAnd when Prime Minister Nkrumah stood up before his people out in the polo ground and said, \"We are no longer a British colony. We are a free, sovereign people,\" all over that vast throng of people we could see tears. And I stood there thinking about so many things. Before I knew it, I started weeping. I was crying for joy. And I knew about all of the struggles, and all of the pain, and all of the agony that these people had gone through for this moment\nAfter Nkrumah had made that final speech, it was about twelve-thirty now. And we walked away. And we could hear little children six years old and old people eighty and ninety years old walking the streets of Accra crying, \"Freedom! Freedom!\" They couldn\u2019t say it in the sense that we\u2019d say it\u2014many of them don\u2019t speak English too well\u2014but they had their accents and it could ring out, \"Free-doom!\" They were crying it in a sense that they had never heard it before, and I could hear that old Negro spiritual once more crying out:\n\nFree at last! Free at last!\n\nGreat God Almighty, I\u2019m free at last!\n\nThey were experiencing that in their very souls. And everywhere we turned, we could hear it ringing out from the housetops. We could hear it from every corner, every nook and crook of the community: \"Freedom! Freedom!\" This was the birth of a new nation. This was the breaking aloose from Egypt\n\nWednesday morning the official opening of Parliament was held. There again we were able to get on the inside. There Nkrumah made his new speech. And now the prime minister of the Gold Coast with no superior, with all of the power that MacMillan of England has, with all of the power that Nehru of India has\u2014now a free nation, now the prime minister of a sovereign nation. The Duchess of Kent walked in, the Duchess of Kent, who represented the Queen of England, no longer had authority now. She was just a passing visitor now. The night before, she was the official leader and spokesman for the Queen, thereby the power behind the throne of the Gold Coast. But now it\u2019s Ghana. It\u2019s a new nation now, and she\u2019s just an official visitor like M. L. King and Ralph Bunche and Coretta King and everybody else, because this is a new nation. A new Ghana has come into being\n\nAnd now Nkrumah stands the leader of that great nation. And when he drives out, the people standing around the streets of the city after Parliament is open, cry out: \"All hail, Nkrumah!\" The name of Nkrumah crowning around the whole city, everybody crying this name, because they knew he had suffered for them, he had sacrificed for them, he\u2019d gone to jail for them. This was the birth of a new nation. This nation was now out of Egypt and had crossed the Red Sea\n\nNow it will confront its wilderness. Like any breaking aloose from Egypt, there is a wilderness ahead. There is a problem of adjustment. Nkrumah realizes that. There is always this wilderness standing before him. For instance, it\u2019s a one-crop country, cocoa mainly. Sixty percent of the cocoa of the world comes from the Gold Coast, or from Ghana. And, in order to make the economic system more stable, it will be necessary to industrialize. Cocoa is too fluctuating to base a whole economy on that, so there is the necessity of industrializing. Nkrumah said to me that one of the first things that he will do is to work toward industrialization. And also he plans to work toward the whole problem of increasing the cultural standards of the community. Still ninety percent of the people are illiterate, and it is necessary to lift the whole cultural standard of the community in order to make it possible to stand up in the free world\n\nYes, there is a wilderness ahead, though it is my hope that even people from America will go to Africa as immigrants, right there to the Gold Coast, and lend their technical assistance, for there is great need and there are rich opportunities there. Right now is the time that American Negroes can lend their technical assistance to a growing new nation. I was very happy to see already people who have moved in and making good. The son of the late president of Bennett College, Dr. Jones, is there, who started an insurance company and making good, going to the top. A doctor from Brooklyn, New York, had just come in that week and his wife is also a dentist, and they are living there now, going in there and working, and the people love them. There will be hundreds and thousands of people, I\u2019m sure, going over to make for the growth of this new nation. And Nkrumah made it very clear to me that he would welcome any persons coming there as immigrants and to live there. Now don\u2019t think that because they have five million people the nation can\u2019t grow, that that\u2019s a small nation to be overlooked. Never forget the fact that when America was born in 1776, when it received its independence from the British Empire, there were fewer, less than four million people in America, and today it\u2019s more than a hundred and sixty million. So never underestimate a people because it\u2019s small now. America was smaller than Ghana when it was born\n\nThere is a great day ahead. The future is on its side. It\u2019s going now through the wilderness, but the Promised Land is ahead\n\nAnd I want to take just a few more minutes as I close to say three or four things that this reminds us of and things that it says to us\u2014things that we must never forget as we ourselves find ourselves breaking aloose from an evil Egypt, trying to move through the wilderness toward the promised land of cultural integration. Ghana has something to say to us. It says to us first that the oppressor never voluntarily gives freedom to the oppressed. You have to work for it. And if Nkrumah and the people of the Gold Coast had not stood up persistently, revolting against the system, it would still be a colony of the British Empire. Freedom is never given to anybody, for the oppressor has you in domination because he plans to keep you there, and he never voluntarily gives it up. And that is where the strong resistance comes. Privileged classes never give up their privileges without strong resistance\n\nSo don\u2019t go out this morning with any illusions. Don\u2019t go back into your homes and around Montgomery thinking that the Montgomery City Commission and that all of the forces in the leadership of the South will eventually work out this thing for Negroes, it\u2019s going to work out; it\u2019s going to roll in on the wheels of inevitability. If we wait for it to work itself out, it will never be worked out. Freedom only comes through persistent revolt, through persistent agitation, through persistently rising up against the system of evil. The bus protest is just the beginning. Buses are integrated in Montgomery, but that is just the beginning. And don\u2019t sit down and do nothing now because the buses are integrated, because, if you stop now, we will be in the dungeons of segregation and discrimination for another hundred years, and our children and our children\u2019s children will suffer all of the bondage that we have lived under for years. It never comes voluntarily. We\u2019ve got to keep on keeping on in order to gain freedom. It never comes like that. It would be fortunate if the people in power had sense enough to go on and give up, but they don\u2019t do it like that. It is not done voluntarily, but it is done through the pressure that comes about from people who are oppressed\n\nIf there had not been a Gandhi in India with all of his noble followers, India would have never been free. If there had not been an Nkrumah and his followers in Ghana, Ghana would still be a British colony. If there had not been abolitionists in America, both Negro and white, we might still stand today in the dungeons of slavery. And then because there have been, in every period, there are always those people in every period of human history who don\u2019t mind getting their necks cut off, who don\u2019t mind being persecuted and discriminated and kicked about, because they know that freedom is never given out, but it comes through the persistent and the continual agitation and revolt on the part of those who are caught in the system. Ghana teaches us that\n\nIt says to us another thing. It reminds us of the fact that a nation or a people can break aloose from oppression without violence. Nkrumah says in the first two pages of his autobiography, which was published on the sixth of March\u2014a great book which you ought to read\u2014he said that he had studied the social systems of social philosophers and he started studying the life of Gandhi and his techniques. And he said that in the beginning he could not see how they could ever get aloose from colonialism without armed revolt, without armies and ammunition, rising up. Then he says after he continued to study Gandhi and continued to study this technique, he came to see that the only way was through nonviolent positive action. And he called his program \"positive action.\" And it\u2019s a beautiful thing, isn\u2019t it? That here is a nation that is now free, and it is free without rising up with arms and with ammunition. It is free through nonviolent means. Because of that the British Empire will not have the bitterness for Ghana that she has for China, so to speak. Because of that, when the British Empire leaves Ghana, she leaves with a different attitude than she would have left with if she had been driven out by armies. We\u2019ve got to revolt in such a way that after revolt is over we can live with people as their brothers and their sisters. Our aim must never be to defeat them or humiliate them\nOn the night of the State Ball, standing up talking with some people, Mordecai Johnson called my attention to the fact that Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah was there dancing with the Duchess of Kent. And I said, \"Isn\u2019t this something? Here is the once-serf, the once-slave, now dancing with the lord on an equal plane.\" And that is done because there is no bitterness. These two nations will be able to live together and work together because the breaking aloose was through nonviolence and not through violence\n\nThe aftermath of nonviolence is the creation of the beloved community. The aftermath of nonviolence is redemption. The aftermath of nonviolence is reconciliation. The aftermath of violence however, are emptiness and bitterness. This is the thing I\u2019m concerned about. Let us fight passionately and unrelentingly for the goals of justice and peace, but let\u2019s be sure that our hands are clean in this struggle. Let us never fight with falsehood and violence and hate and malice, but always fight with love, so that, when the day comes that the walls of segregation have completely crumbled in Montgomery. that we will be able to live with people as their brothers and sisters\n\nOh, my friends, our aim must be not to defeat Mr. Engelhardt, not to defeat Mr. Sellers and Mr. Gayle and Mr. Parks. Our aim must be to defeat the evil that\u2019s in them. But our aim must be to win the friendship of Mr. Gayle and Mr. Sellers and Mr. Engelhardt. We must come to the point of seeing that our ultimate aim is to live with all men as brothers and sisters under God and not be their enemies or anything that goes with that type of relationship. And this is one thing that Ghana teaches us: that you can break aloose from evil through nonviolence, through a lack of bitterness. Nkrumah says in his book: \"When I came out of prison, I was not bitter toward Britain. I came out merely with the determination to free my people from the colonialism and imperialism that had been inflicted upon them by the British. But I came out with no bitterness.\" And, because of that, this world will be a better place in which to live\n\nThere\u2019s another thing that Ghana reminds us. I\u2019m coming to the conclusion now. Ghana reminds us that freedom never comes on a silver platter. It\u2019s never easy. Ghana reminds us that whenever you break out of Egypt, you better get ready for stiff backs. You better get ready for some homes to be bombed. You better get ready for some churches to be bombed. You better get ready for a lot of nasty things to be said about you, because you're getting out of Egypt, and, whenever you break aloose from Egypt, the initial response of the Egyptian is bitterness. It never comes with ease. It comes only through the hardness and persistence of life. Ghana reminds us of that. You better get ready to go to prison. When I looked out and saw the prime minister there with his prison cap on that night, that reminded me of that fact, that freedom never comes easy. It comes through hard labor and it comes through toil. It comes through hours of despair and disappointment\n\nThat\u2019s the way it goes. There is no crown without a cross. I wish we could get to Easter without going to Good Friday, but history tells us that we got to go by Good Friday before we can get to Easter. That\u2019s the long story of freedom, isn\u2019t it? Before you get to Canaan, you\u2019ve got a Red Sea to confront. You have a hardened heart of a pharaoh to confront. You have the prodigious hilltops of evil in the wilderness to confront. And,even when you get up to the Promised Land, you have giants in the land. The beautiful thing about it is that there are a few people who\u2019ve been over in the land. They have spied enough to say, \"Even though the giants are there we can possess the land, because we got the internal fiber to stand up amid anything that we have to face.\"\n\nThe road to freedom is a difficult, hard road. It always makes for temporary setbacks. And those people who tell you today that there is more tension in Montgomery than there has ever been are telling you right. Whenever you get out of Egypt, you always confront a little tension, you always confront a little temporary setback. If you didn\u2019t confront that you\u2019d never get out. You must remember that the tensionless period that we like to think of was the period when the Negro was complacently adjusted to segregation, discrimination, insult, and exploitation. And the period of tension is the period when the Negro has decided to rise up and break aloose from that. And this is the peace that we are seeking: not an old negative obnoxious peace which is merely the absence of tension, but a positive, lasting peace, which is the presence of brotherhood and justice. And it is never brought about without this temporary period of tension. The road to freedom is difficult\n\nBut finally Ghana tells us that the forces of the universe are on the side of justice. That\u2019s what it tells us, now. You can interpret Ghana any kind of way you want to, but Ghana tells me that the forces of the universe are on the side of justice. That night when I saw that old flag coming down and the new flag coming up, I saw something else. That wasn\u2019t just an Ephemeral, evanescent event appearing on the stage of history, but it was an event with eternal meaning, for it symbolizes something. That thing symbolized to me that an old order is passing away and a new order is coming into being. An old order of colonialism, of segregation, of discrimination is passing away now, and a new order of justice and freedom and goodwill is being born. That\u2019s what it said: that somehow the forces of justice stand on the side of the universe, and that you can\u2019t ultimately trample over God\u2019s children and profit by it\n\nI want to come back to Montgomery now, but I must stop by London for a moment, for London reminds me of something. I never will forget the day we went into London. The next day we started moving around this great city, the only city in the world that is almost as large as New York City. Over eight million people in London, about eight million, three hundred thousand; New York about eight million, five hundred thousand. London larger in area than New York, though. Standing in London is an amazing picture. And I never will forget the experience I had, the thoughts that came to my mind. We went to Buckingham Palace, and I looked there at all of Britain, at all of the pomp and circumstance of royalty. And I thought about all of the queens and kings that had passed through here. Look at the beauty of the changing of the guards and all of the guards with their beautiful horses. It\u2019s a beautiful sight. Move on from there and go over to Parliament. Move into the House of Lords and the House of Commons. There with all of its beauty standing up before the world is one of the most beautiful sights in the world\n\nThen I remember, we went on over to Westminster Abbey. And I thought about several things when we went in this great church, this great cathedral, the center of the Church of England. We walked around and went to the tombs of the kings and queens buried there. Most of the kings and queens of England are buried right there in the Westminster Abbey. And I walked around. On the one hand I enjoyed and appreciated the great gothic architecture of that massive cathedral. I stood there in awe thinking about the greatness of God and man\u2019s feeble attempt to reach up for God. And I thought something else\u2014I thought about the Church of England\n\nMy mind went back to Buckingham Palace, and I said that this is the symbol of a dying system. There was a day that the queens and kings of England could boast that the sun never sets on the British Empire, a day when she occupied the greater portion of Australia, the greater portion of Canada. There was a day when she ruled most of China, most of Africa, and all of India. I started thinking about this empire. I started thinking about the fact that she ruled over India one day. Mahatma Gandhi stood there at every hand, trying to get the freedom of his people, and they never bowed to it. They never, they decided that they were going to stand up and hold India in humiliation and in colonialism many, many years. I remember we passed by Ten Downing Street. That\u2019s the place where the prime minister of England lives. And I remember that a few years ago a man lived there by the name of Winston Churchill. One day he stood up before the world and said, \"I did not become his Majesty\u2019s First Minister to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire.\"\n\nAnd I thought about the fact that a few weeks ago a man by the name of Anthony Eden lived there. And out of all of his knowledge of the Middle East, he decided to rise up and march his armies with the forces of Israel and France into Egypt, and there they confronted their doom, because they were revolting against world opinion. Egypt, a little country; Egypt, a country with no military power. They could have easily defeated Egypt, but they did not realize that they were fighting more than Egypt. They were attacking world opinion; they were fighting the whole Asian-African bloc, which is the bloc that now thinks and moves and determines the course of the history of the world\n\nI thought of many things. I thought of the fact that the British Empire exploited India. Think about it! A nation with four hundred million people and the British exploited them so much that out of a population of four hundred million, three hundred and fifty million made an annual income of less than fifty dollars a year. Twenty-five of that had to be used for taxes and the other things of life. I thought about dark Africa, and how the people there, if they can make a hundred dollars a year they are living very well, they think. Two shillings a day\u2014one shilling is fourteen cents, two shillings, twenty-eight cents\u2014that\u2019s a good wage. That\u2019s because of the domination of the British Empire\n\nAll of these things came to my mind, and when I stood there in Westminster Abbey with all of its beauty, and I thought about all of the beautiful hymns and anthems that the people would go in there to sing. And yet the Church of England never took a stand against this system.The Church of England sanctioned it The Church of England gave it moral stature. All of the exploitation perpetuated by the British Empire was sanctioned by the Church of England\n\nBut something else came to my mind: God comes in the picture even when the Church won\u2019t take a stand. God has injected a principle in this universe. God has said that all men must respect the dignity and worth of all human personality, \"And if you don\u2019t do that, I will take charge.\" It seems this morning that I can hear God speaking. I can hear him speaking throughout the universe, saying, \"Be still and know that I am God. And if you don\u2019t stop, if you don\u2019t straighten up, if you don\u2019t stop exploiting people, I\u2019m going to rise up and break the backbone of your power. And your power will be no more!\"\n\nAnd the power of Great Britain is no more. I looked at France. I looked at Britain. And I thought about the Britain that could boast, \"The sun never sets on our great Empire.\" And I said now she had gone to the level that the sun hardly rises on the British Empire\u2014because it was based on exploitation, because the God of the universe eventually takes a stand\n\nAnd I say to you this morning, my friends, rise up and know that, as you struggle for justice, you do not struggle alone, but God struggles with you. And He is working every day. Somehow I can look out, I can look out across the seas and across the universe, and cry out, \"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\" Then I think about it, because His truth is marching on, and I can sing another chorus: \"Hallelujah, glory hallelujah! His truth is marching on.\"\n\nThen I can hear Isaiah again, because it has profound meaning to me, that somehow, \"Every valley shall be exalted, and every hill shall be made low; the crooked places shall be made straight, and the rough places plain; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\"\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this thing: all flesh shall see it together. Not some from the heights of Park Street and others from the dungeons of slum areas. Not some from the pinnacles of the British Empire and some from the dark deserts of Africa. Not some from inordinate, superfluous wealth and others from abject, deadening poverty. Not some white and not some black, not some yellow and not some brown, but all flesh shall see it together. They shall see it from Montgomery. They shall see it from New York. They shall see it from Ghana. They shall see it from China\n\nFor I can look out and see a great number, as John saw, marching into the great eternity, because God is working in this world, and at this hour, and at this moment. And God grants that we will get on board and start marching with God, because we got orders now to break down the bondage and the walls of colonialism, exploitation, and imperialism, to break them down to the point that no man will trample over another man, but that all men will respect the dignity and worth of all human personality. And then we will be in Canaan\u2019s freedom land\n\nMoses might not get to see Canaan, but his children will see it. He even got to the mountaintop enough to see it and that assured him that it was coming. But the beauty of the thing is that there\u2019s always a Joshua to take up his work and take the children on in. And it\u2019s there waiting with its milk and honey, and with all of the bountiful beauty that God has in store for His children. Oh, what exceedingly marvelous things God has in store for us. Grant that we will follow Him enough to gain them. [recording interrupted]\n\nO God, our gracious Heavenly Father, help us to see the insights that come from this new nation. Help us to follow Thee and all of Thy creative works in this world, and that somehow we will discover that we are made to live together as brothers And that it will come in this generation: the day when all men will recognize the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.

Morales LyricsJustice Stevens announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and V, and an opinion with respect to Parts III, IV, and VI, in which Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join.\n\nIn 1992, the Chicago City Council enacted the Gang Congregation Ordinance, which prohibits \"criminal street gang members\" from \"loitering\" with one another or with other persons in any public place. The question presented is whether the Supreme Court of Illinois correctly held that the ordinance violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.IBefore the ordinance was adopted, the city council's Committee on Police and Fire conducted hearings to explore the problems created by the city's street gangs, and more particularly, the consequences of public loitering by gang members. Witnesses included residents of the neighborhoods where gang members are most active, as well as some of the aldermen who represent those areas. Based on that evidence, the council made a series of findings that are included in the text of the ordinance and explain the reasons for its enactment.[1]\n\nThe council found that a continuing increase in criminal street gang activity was largely responsible for the city's rising murder rate, as well as an escalation of violent and drug related crimes. It noted that in many neighborhoods throughout the city, \"`the burgeoning presence of street gang members in public places has intimidated many law abiding citizens.' \" 177 Ill. 2d 440, 445, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 58 (1997). Furthermore, the council stated that gang members \"`establish control over identifiable areas . . . by loitering in those areas and intimidating others from entering those areas; and . . . [m]embers of criminal street gangs avoid arrest by committing no offense punishable under existing laws when they know the police are present . . . .' \" Ibid. It further found that \"`loitering in public places by criminal street gang members creates a justifiable fear for the safety of persons and property in the area' \" and that \"`[a]ggressive action is necessary to preserve the city's streets and other public places so that the public may use such places without fear.' \" Moreover, the council concluded that the city \"`has an interest in discouraging all persons from loitering in public places with criminal gang members.' \" Ibid.\n\nThe ordinance creates a criminal offense punishable by a fine of up to $500, imprisonment for not more than six months, and a requirement to perform up to 120 hours of community service. Commission of the offense involves four predicates. First, the police officer must reasonably believe that at least one of the two or more persons present in a \"`public place' \" is a \"`criminal street gang membe[r].' \" Second, the persons must be \"`loitering,' \" which the ordinance defines as \"`remain[ing] in any one place with no apparent purpose.' \" Third, the officer must then order \"`all' \" of the persons to disperse and remove themselves \"`from the area.' \" Fourth, a person must disobey the officer's order. If any person, whether a gang member or not, disobeys the officer's order, that person is guilty of violating the ordinance. Ibid.[2]\n\nTwo months after the ordinance was adopted, the Chicago Police Department promulgated General Order 92-4 to provide guidelines to govern its enforcement.[3] That order purported to establish limitations on the enforcement discretion of police officers \"to ensure that the anti-gang loitering ordinance is not enforced in an arbitrary or discriminatory way.\" Chicago Police Department, General Order 92-4, reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. The limitations confine the authority to arrest gang members who violate the ordinance to sworn \"members of the Gang Crime Section\" and certain other designated officers,[4] and establish detailed criteria for defining street gangs and membership in such gangs. Id., at 66a\u201467a. In addition, the order directs district commanders to \"designate areas in which the presence of gang members has a demonstrable effect on the activities of law abiding persons in the surrounding community,\" and provides that the ordinance \"will be enforced only within the designated areas.\" Id., at 68a\u201469a. The city, however, does not release the locations of these \"designated areas\" to the public.[5]IIDuring the three years of its enforcement,[6] the police issued over 89,000 dispersal orders and arrested over 42,000 people for violating the ordinance.[7] In the ensuing enforcement proceedings, 2 trial judges upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance, but 11 others ruled that it was invalid.[8] In respondent Youkhana's case, the trial judge held that the \"ordinance fails to notify individuals what conduct is prohibited, and it encourages arbitrary and capricious enforcement by police.\"[9]\n\nThe Illinois Appellate Court affirmed the trial court's ruling in the Youkhana case,[10] consolidated and affirmed other pending appeals in accordance with Youkhana,[11] and reversed the convictions of respondents Gutierrez, Morales, and others.[12] The Appellate Court was persuaded that the ordinance impaired the freedom of assembly of nongang members in violation of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution and Article I of the Illinois Constitution, that it was unconstitutionally vague, that it improperly criminalized status rather than conduct, and that it jeopardized rights guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment.[13]\nThe Illinois Supreme Court affirmed. It held \"that the gang loitering ordinance violates due process of law in that it is impermissibly vague on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties.\" 177 Ill. 2d, at 447, 687 N. E. 2d, at 59. The court did not reach the contentions that the ordinance \"creates a status offense, permits arrests without probable cause or is overbroad.\" Ibid.\n\nIn support of its vagueness holding, the court pointed out that the definition of \"loitering\" in the ordinance drew no distinction between innocent conduct and conduct calculated to cause harm.[14] \"Moreover, the definition of `loiter' provided by the ordinance does not assist in clearly articulating the proscriptions of the ordinance.\" Id., at 451-452, 687 N. E. 2d, at 60-61. Furthermore, it concluded that the ordinance was \"not reasonably susceptible to a limiting construction which would affirm its validity.\"[15]\n\nWe granted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1071 (1998), and now affirm. Like the Illinois Supreme Court, we conclude that the ordinance enacted by the city of Chicago is unconstitutionally vague.IIIThe basic factual predicate for the city's ordinance is not in dispute. As the city argues in its brief, \"the very presence of a large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-on on the public ways intimidates residents, who become afraid even to leave their homes and go about their business. That, in turn, imperils community residents' sense of safety and security, detracts from property values, and can ultimately destabilize entire neighborhoods.\"[16] The findings in the ordinance explain that it was motivated by these concerns. We have no doubt that a law that directly prohibited such intimidating conduct would be constitutional,[17] but this ordinance broadly covers a significant amount of additional activity. Uncertainty about the scope of that additional coverage provides the basis for respondents' claim that the ordinance is too vague.\n\nWe are confronted at the outset with the city's claim that it was improper for the state courts to conclude that the ordinance is invalid on its face. The city correctly points out that imprecise laws can be attacked on their face under two different doctrines.[18] First, the overbreadth doctrine permits the facial invalidation of laws that inhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights if the impermissible applications of the law are substantial when \"judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.\" Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612-615 (1973). Second, even if an enactment does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, it may be impermissibly vague because it fails to establish standards for the police and public that are sufficient to guard against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty interests. Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 358 (1983).\n\nWhile we, like the Illinois courts, conclude that the ordinance is invalid on its face, we do not rely on the overbreadth doctrine. We agree with the city's submission that the law does not have a sufficiently substantial impact on conduct protected by the First Amendment to render it unconstitutional. The ordinance does not prohibit speech. Because the term \"loiter\" is defined as remaining in one place \"with no apparent purpose,\" it is also clear that it does not prohibit any form of conduct that is apparently intended to convey a message. By its terms, the ordinance is inapplicable to assemblies that are designed to demonstrate a group's support of, or opposition to, a particular point of view. Cf. Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288 (1984); Gregory v. Chicago, 394 U. S. 111 (1969). Its impact on the social contact between gang members and others does not impair the First Amendment \"right of association\" that our cases have recognized. See Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U. S. 19, 23-25 (1989).\n\nOn the other hand, as the United States recognizes, the freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the \"liberty\" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[19] We have expressly identified this \"right to remove from one place to another according to inclination\" as \"an attribute of personal liberty\" protected by the Constitution. Williams v. Fears, 179 U. S. 270, 274 (1900); see also Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 164 (1972).[20] Indeed, it is apparent that an individual's decision to remain in a public place of his choice is as much a part of his liberty as the freedom of movement inside frontiers that is \"a part of our heritage\" Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S. 116, 126 (1958), or the right to move \"to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct\" identified in Blackstone's Commentaries. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 130 (1765).[21]\n\nThere is no need, however, to decide whether the impact of the Chicago ordinance on constitutionally protected liberty alone would suffice to support a facial challenge under the overbreadth doctrine. Cf. Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500, 515-517 (1964) (right to travel); Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 82-83 (1976) (abortion); Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 355, n. 3, 358-360, and n. 9. For it is clear that the vagueness of this enactment makes a facial challenge appropriate. This is not an ordinance that \"simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement.\" See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 499 (1982). It is a criminal law that contains no mens rea requirement, see Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 395 (1979), and infringes on constitutionally protected rights, see id., at 391. When vagueness permeates the text of such a law, it is subject to facial attack.[22]\n\nVagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of two independent reasons. First, it may fail to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits; second, it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 357. Accordingly, we first consider whether the ordinance provides fair notice to the citizen and then discuss its potential for arbitrary enforcement.IV\"It is established that a law fails to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause if it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits . . . .\" Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U. S. 399, 402-403 (1966). The Illinois Supreme Court recognized that the term \"loiter\" may have a common and accepted meaning, 177 Ill. 2d, at 451, 687 N. E. 2d, at 61, but the definition of that term in this ordinance\u2014\"to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose\"\u2014does not. It is difficult to imagine how any citizen of the city of Chicago standing in a public place with a group of people would know if he or she had an \"apparent purpose.\" If she were talking to another person, would she have an apparent purpose? If she were frequently checking her watch and looking expectantly down the street, would she have an apparent purpose?[23]\n\nSince the city cannot conceivably have meant to criminalize each instance a citizen stands in public with a gang member, the vagueness that dooms this ordinance is not the product of uncertainty about the normal meaning of \"loitering,\" but rather about what loitering is covered by the ordinance and what is not. The Illinois Supreme Court emphasized the law's failure to distinguish between innocent conduct and conduct threatening harm.[24] Its decision followed the precedent set by a number of state courts that have upheld ordinances that criminalize loitering combined with some other overt act or evidence of criminal intent.[25] However, state courts have uniformly invalidated laws that do not join the term \"loitering\" with a second specific element of the crime.[26]\n\nThe city's principal response to this concern about adequate notice is that loiterers are not subject to sanction until after they have failed to comply with an officer's order to disperse. \"[W]hatever problem is created by a law that criminalizes conduct people normally believe to be innocent is solved when persons receive actual notice from a police order of what they are expected to do.\"[27] We find this response unpersuasive for at least two reasons.\n\nFirst, the purpose of the fair notice requirement is to enable the ordinary citizen to conform his or her conduct to the law. \"No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.\" Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939). Although it is true that a loiterer is not subject to criminal sanctions unless he or she disobeys a dispersal order, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit.[28] If the loitering is in fact harmless and innocent, the dispersal order itself is an unjustified impairment of liberty. If the police are able to decide arbitrarily which members of the public they will order to disperse, then the Chicago ordinance becomes indistinguishable from the law we held invalid in Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U. S. 87, 90 (1965).[29] Because an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, it cannot provide the kind of advance notice that will protect the putative loiterer from being ordered to disperse. Such an order cannot retroactively give adequate warning of the boundary between the permissible and the impermissible applications of the law.[30]\n\nSecond, the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice afforded by the ordinance. It provides that the officer \"shall order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. This vague phrasing raises a host of questions. After such an order issues, how long must the loiterers remain apart? How far must they move? If each loiterer walks around the block and they meet again at the same location, are they subject to arrest or merely to being ordered to disperse again? As we do here, we have found vagueness in a criminal statute exacerbated by the use of the standards of \"neighborhood\" and \"locality.\" Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385 (1926). We remarked in Connally that \"[b]oth terms are elastic and, dependent upon circumstances, may be equally satisfied by areas measured by rods or by miles.\" Id., at 395.\n\nLack of clarity in the description of the loiterer's duty to obey a dispersal order might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear, but it does buttress our conclusion that the entire ordinance fails to give the ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden and what is permitted. The Constitution does not permit a legislature to \"set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large.\" United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 221 (1876). This ordinance is therefore vague \"not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all.\" Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 614 (1971).VThe broad sweep of the ordinance also violates \"`the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.' \" Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 358. There are no such guidelines in the ordinance. In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent. The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes. It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she may\u2014 indeed, she \"shall\"\u2014order them to disperse.\nRecognizing that the ordinance does reach a substantial amount of innocent conduct, we turn, then, to its language to determine if it \"necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the moment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat.\" Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 360 (internal quotation marks omitted). As we discussed in the context of fair notice, see supra, at 56-60, the principal source of the vast discretion conferred on the police in this case is the definition of loitering as \"to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose.\"\n\nAs the Illinois Supreme Court interprets that definition, it \"provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering.\" 177 Ill. 2d, at 457, 687 N. E. 2d, at 63. We have no authority to construe the language of a state statute more narrowly than the construction given by that State's highest court.[31] \"The power to determine the meaning of a statute carries with it the power to prescribe its extent and limitations as well as the method by which they shall be determined.\" Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U. S. 447, 455 (1905).\n\nNevertheless, the city disputes the Illinois Supreme Court's interpretation, arguing that the text of the ordinance limits the officer's discretion in three ways. First, it does not permit the officer to issue a dispersal order to anyone who is moving along or who has an apparent purpose. Second, it does not permit an arrest if individuals obey a dispersal order. Third, no order can issue unless the officer reasonably believes that one of the loiterers is a member of a criminal street gang.\n\nEven putting to one side our duty to defer to a state court's construction of the scope of a local enactment, we find each of these limitations insufficient. That the ordinance does not apply to people who are moving\u2014that is, to activity that would not constitute loitering under any possible definition of the term\u2014does not even address the question of how much discretion the police enjoy in deciding which stationary persons to disperse under the ordinance.[32] Similarly, that the ordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal order has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance to the officer deciding whether such an order should issue. The \"no apparent purpose\" standard for making that decision is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is \"apparent\" to the officer on the scene.\n\nPresumably an officer would have discretion to treat some purposes\u2014perhaps a purpose to engage in idle conversation or simply to enjoy a cool breeze on a warm evening\u2014as too frivolous to be apparent if he suspected a different ulterior motive. Moreover, an officer conscious of the city council's reasons for enacting the ordinance might well ignore its text and issue a dispersal order, even though an illicit purpose is actually apparent.\n\nIt is true, as the city argues, that the requirement that the officer reasonably believe that a group of loiterers contains a gang member does place a limit on the authority to order dispersal. That limitation would no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect,[33] or possibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gang members. But this ordinance, for reasons that are not explained in the findings of the city council, requires no harmful purpose and applies to nongang members as well as suspected gang members.[34] It applies to everyone in the city who may remain in one place with one suspected gang member as long as their purpose is not apparent to an officer observing them. Friends, relatives, teachers, counselors, or even total strangers might unwittingly engage in forbidden loitering if they happen to engage in idle conversation with a gang member.\n\nIronically, the definition of loitering in the Chicago ordinance not only extends its scope to encompass harmless conduct, but also has the perverse consequence of excluding from its coverage much of the intimidating conduct that motivated its enactment. As the city council's findings demonstrate, the most harmful gang loitering is motivated either by an apparent purpose to publicize the gang's dominance of certain territory, thereby intimidating nonmembers, or by an equally apparent purpose to conceal ongoing commerce in illegal drugs. As the Illinois Supreme Court has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says and that it has no application to loiterers whose purpose is apparent. The relative importance of its application to harmless loitering is magnified by its inapplicability to loitering that has an obviously threatening or illicit purpose.\n\nFinally, in its opinion striking down the ordinance, the Illinois Supreme Court refused to accept the general order issued by the police department as a sufficient limitation on the \"vast amount of discretion\" granted to the police in its enforcement. We agree. See Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 575 (1974). That the police have adopted internal rules limiting their enforcement to certain designated areas in the city would not provide a defense to a loiterer who might be arrested elsewhere. Nor could a person who knowingly loitered with a well-known gang member anywhere in the city safely assume that they would not be ordered to disperse no matter how innocent and harmless their loitering might be.VIIn our judgment, the Illinois Supreme Court correctly concluded that the ordinance does not provide sufficiently specific limits on the enforcement discretion of the police \"to meet constitutional standards for definiteness and clarity.\"[35] 177 Ill. 2d, at 459, 687 N. E. 2d, at 64. We recognize the serious and difficult problems testified to by the citizens of Chicago that led to the enactment of this ordinance. \"We are mindful that the preservation of liberty depends in part on the maintenance of social order.\" Houston v. Hill, 482 U. S. 451, 471-472 (1987). However, in this instance the city has enacted an ordinance that affords too much discretion to the police and too little notice to citizens who wish to use the public streets.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is\n\nAffirmed.\n\nJustice O'Connor, with whom Justice Breyer joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n\nI agree with the Court that Chicago's Gang Congregation Ordinance, Chicago Municipal Code \u00a7 8-4\u2014015 (1992) (gang loitering ordinance or ordinance) is unconstitutionally vague. A penal law is void for vagueness if it fails to \"define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited\" or fails to establish guidelines to prevent \"arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement\" of the law. Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357 (1983). Of these, \"the more important aspect of the vagueness doctrine `is . . . the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.' \" Id., at 358 (quoting Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 574-575 (1974)). I share Justice Thomas' concern about the consequences of gang violence, and I agree that some degree of police discretion is necessary to allow the police \"to perform their peace keeping responsibilities satisfactorily.\" Post, at 109 (dissenting opinion). A criminal law, however, must not permit policemen, prosecutors, and juries to conduct \"`a standardless sweep . . . to pursue their personal predilections.' \" Kolender v. Lawson, supra, at 358 (quoting Smith v. Goguen, supra, at 575).\n\nThe ordinance at issue provides:Whenever a police officer observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public place with one or more other persons, he shall order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area. Any person who does not promptly obey such an order is in violation of this section.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.To \"[l]oiter,\" in turn, is defined in the ordinance as \"to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose.\" Ibid. The Illinois Supreme Court declined to adopt a limiting construction of the ordinance and concluded that the ordinance vested \"absolute discretion to police officers.\" 177 Ill. 2d 440, 457, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997) (emphasis added). This Court is bound by the Illinois Supreme Court's construction of the ordinance. See Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4 (1949).\nAs it has been construed by the Illinois court, Chicago's gang loitering ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers. In particular, it fails to provide police with any standard by which they can judge whether an individual has an \"apparent purpose.\" Indeed, because any person standing on the street has a general \"purpose\"\u2014even if it is simply to stand\u2014the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are permissible. Under this construction the police do not have to decide that an individual is \"threaten[ing] the public peace\" to issue a dispersal order. See post, at 107 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Any police officer in Chicago is free, under the Illinois Supreme Court's construction of the ordinance, to order at his whim any person standing in a public place with a suspected gang member to disperse. Further, as construed by the Illinois court, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are not gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or \"other location open to the public, whether publicly or privately owned.\" Chicago Municipal Code \u00a7 8-4\u2014015(c)(5) (1992).\n\nTo be sure, there is no violation of the ordinance unless a person fails to obey promptly the order to disperse. But, a police officer cannot issue a dispersal order until he decides that a person is remaining in one place \"with no apparent purpose,\" and the ordinance provides no guidance to the officer on how to make this antecedent decision. Moreover, the requirement that police issue dispersal orders only when they \"reasonably believ[e]\" that a group of loiterers includes a gang member fails to cure the ordinance's vague aspects. If the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably believed to be gang members, this requirement might have cured the ordinance's vagueness because it would have directed the manner in which the order was issued by specifying to whom the order could be issued. Cf. ante, at 62. But, the Illinois Supreme Court did not construe the ordinance to be so limited. See 177 Ill. 2d, at 453-454, 687 N. E. 2d, at 62.\n\nThis vagueness consideration alone provides a sufficient ground for affirming the Illinois court's decision, and I agree with Part V of the Court's opinion, which discusses this consideration. See ante, at 62 (\"[T]hat the ordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal order has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance to the officer deciding whether such an order should issue\"); ibid. (\"It is true .. . that the requirement that the officer reasonably believe that a group of loiterers contains a gang member does place a limit on the authority to order dispersal. That limitation would no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect, or possibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gang members\"). Accordingly, there is no need to consider the other issues briefed by the parties and addressed by the plurality. I express no opinion about them.\n\nIt is important to courts and legislatures alike that we characterize more clearly the narrow scope of today's holding. As the ordinance comes to this Court, it is unconstitutionally vague. Nevertheless, there remain open to Chicago reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed by gang intimidation and violence. For example, the Court properly and expressly distinguishes the ordinance from laws that require loiterers to have a \"harmful purpose,\" see ibid., from laws that target only gang members, see ibid., and from laws that incorporate limits on the area and manner in which the laws may be enforced, see ante, at 62-63. In addition, the ordinance here is unlike a law that \"directly prohibit[s]\" the \"`presence of a large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-on on the public ways,' \" that \"`intimidates residents.' \" Ante, at 51, 52 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 14). Indeed, as the plurality notes, the city of Chicago has several laws that do exactly this. See ante, at 52, n. 17. Chicago has even enacted a provision that \"enables police officers to fulfill . . . their traditional functions,\" including \"preserving the public peace.\" See post, at 106 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Specifically, Chicago's general disorderly conduct provision allows the police to arrest those who knowingly \"provoke, make or aid in making a breach of peace.\" See Chicago Municipal Code \u00a7 8-4\u2014010 (1992).\n\nIn my view, the gang loitering ordinance could have been construed more narrowly. The term \"loiter\" might possibly be construed in a more limited fashion to mean \"to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities.\" Such a definition would be consistent with the Chicago City Council's findings and would avoid the vagueness problems of the ordinance as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a\u201461a. As noted above, so would limitations that restricted the ordinance's criminal penalties to gang members or that more carefully delineated the circumstances in which those penalties would apply to nongang members.\n\nThe Illinois Supreme Court did not choose to give a limiting construction to Chicago's ordinance. To the extent it relied on our precedents, particularly Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156 (1972), as requiring it to hold the ordinance vague in all of its applications because it was intentionally drafted in a vague manner, the Illinois court misapplied our precedents. See 177 Ill. 2d, at 458-459, 687 N. E. 2d, at 64. This Court has never held that the intent of the drafters determines whether a law is vague. Nevertheless, we cannot impose a limiting construction that a state supreme court has declined to adopt. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 355-356, n. 4 (noting that the Court has held that \"`[f]or the purpose of determining whether a state statute is too vague and indefinite to constitute valid legislation we must take the statute as though it read precisely as the highest court of the State has interpreted it' \" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 769, n. 24 (1982) (noting that where the Court is \"dealing with a state statute on direct review of a state-court decision that has construed the statute[,] [s]uch a construction is binding on us\"). Accordingly, I join Parts I, II, and V of the Court's opinion and concur in the judgment.Justice Kennedy, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.I join Parts I, II, and V of the Court's opinion and concur in the judgment.\n\nI also share many of the concerns Justice Stevens expresses in Part IV with respect to the sufficiency of notice under the ordinance. As interpreted by the Illinois Supreme Court, the Chicago ordinance would reach a broad range of innocent conduct. For this reason it is not necessarily saved by the requirement that the citizen must disobey a police order to disperse before there is a violation.\n\nWe have not often examined these types of orders. Cf. Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U. S. 87 (1965). It can be assumed, however, that some police commands will subject a citizen to prosecution for disobeying whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given. Illustrative examples include when the police tell a pedestrian not to enter a building and the reason is to avoid impeding a rescue team, or to protect a crime scene, or to secure an area for the protection of a public official. It does not follow, however, that any unexplained police order must be obeyed without notice of the lawfulness of the order. The predicate of an order to disperse is not, in my view, sufficient to eliminate doubts regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance. A citizen, while engaging in a wide array of innocent conduct, is not likely to know when he may be subject to a dispersal order based on the officer's own knowledge of the identity or affiliations of other persons with whom the citizen is congregating; nor may the citizen be able to assess what an officer might conceive to be the citizen's lack of an apparent purpose.Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.The ordinance before us creates more than a \"minor limitation upon the free state of nature.\" Post, at 74 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). The law authorizes a police officer to order any person to remove himself from any \"location open to the public, whether publicly or privately owned,\" Chicago Municipal Code \u00a7 8-4\u2014015(c)(5) (1992), i. e., any sidewalk, front stoop, public park, public square, lakeside promenade, hotel, restaurant, bowling alley, bar, barbershop, sports arena, shopping mall, etc., but with two, and only two, limitations: First, that person must be accompanied by (or must himself be) someone police reasonably believe is a gang member. Second, that person must have remained in that public place \"with no apparent purpose.\" \u00a7 8-4\u2014015(c)(1).\n\nThe first limitation cannot save the ordinance. Though it limits the number of persons subject to the law, it leaves many individuals, gang members and nongang members alike, subject to its strictures. Nor does it limit in any way the range of conduct that police may prohibit. The second limitation is, as the Court, ante, at 62, and Justice O'Connor, ante, at 65-66 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), point out, not a limitation at all. Since one always has some apparent purpose, the so-called limitation invites, in fact requires, the policeman to interpret the words \"no apparent purpose\" as meaning \"no apparent purpose except for . . . .\" And it is in the ordinance's delegation to the policeman of open-ended discretion to fill in that blank that the problem lies. To grant to a policeman virtually standardless discretion to close off major portions of the city to an innocent person is, in my view, to create a major, not a \"minor,\" \"limitation upon the free state of nature.\"\n\nNor does it violate \"our rules governing facial challenges,\" post, at 74 (Scalia, J., dissenting), to forbid the city to apply the unconstitutional ordinance in this case. The reason why the ordinance is invalid explains how that is so. As I have said, I believe the ordinance violates the Constitution because it delegates too much discretion to a police officer to decide whom to order to move on, and in what circumstances. And I see no way to distinguish in the ordinance's terms between one application of that discretion and another. The ordinance is unconstitutional, not because a policeman applied this discretion wisely or poorly in a particular case, but rather because the policeman enjoys too much discretion in every case. And if every application of the ordinance represents an exercise of unlimited discretion, then the ordinance is invalid in all its applications. The city of Chicago may be able validly to apply some other law to the defendants in light of their conduct. But the city of Chicago may no more apply this law to the defendants, no matter how they behaved, than it could apply an (imaginary) statute that said, \"It is a crime to do wrong,\" even to the worst of murderers. See Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939) (\"If on its face the challenged provision is repugnant to the due process clause, specification of details of the offense intended to be charged would not serve to validate it\").\n\nJustice Scalia's examples, post, at 81-83, reach a different conclusion because they assume a different basis for the law's constitutional invalidity. A statute, for example, might not provide fair warning to many, but an individual defendant might still have been aware that it prohibited the conduct in which he engaged. Cf., e. g., Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 756 (1974) (\"[O]ne who has received fair warning of the criminality of his own conduct from the statute in question is [not] entitled to attack it because the language would not give similar fair warning with respect to other conduct which might be within its broad and literal ambit.\n\nOne to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness\"). But I believe this ordinance is unconstitutional, not because it provides insufficient notice, but because it does not provide \"sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers.\" See ante, at 65-66 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n\nI concede that this case is unlike those First Amendment \"overbreadth\" cases in which this Court has permitted a facial challenge. In an overbreadth case, a defendant whose conduct clearly falls within the law and may be constitutionally prohibited can nonetheless have the law declared facially invalid to protect the rights of others (whose protected speech might otherwise be chilled). In the present case, the right that the defendants assert, the right to be free from the officer's exercise of unchecked discretion, is more clearly their own.\n\nThis case resembles Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611 (1971), where this Court declared facially unconstitutional on, among other grounds, the due process standard of vagueness an ordinance that prohibited persons assembled on a sidewalk from \"conduct[ing] themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by.\" The Court explained:It is said that the ordinance is broad enough to encompass many types of conduct clearly within the city's constitutional power to prohibit. And so, indeed, it is. The city is free to prevent people from blocking sidewalks, obstructing traffic, littering streets, committing assaults, or engaging in countless other forms of antisocial conduct. It can do so through the enactment and enforcement of ordinances directed with reasonable specificity toward the conduct to be prohibited. . . . It cannot constitutionally do so through the enactment and enforcement of an ordinance whose violation may entirely depend upon whether or not a policeman is annoyed.\" Id., at 614 (citation omitted). The ordinance in Coates could not constitutionally be applied whether or not the conduct of the particular defendants was indisputably \"annoying\" or of a sort that a different, more specific ordinance could constitutionally prohibit. Similarly, here the city might have enacted a different ordinance, or the Illinois Supreme Court might have interpreted this ordinance differently. And the Constitution might well have permitted the city to apply that different ordinance (or this ordinance as interpreted differently) to circumstances like those present here. See ante, at 67-68 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But this ordinance, as I have said, cannot be constitutionally applied to anyone.Justice Scalia, dissenting.The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished. At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle. This infringed upon the \"freedom\" of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.\n\nSimilarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident. At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents. They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order. Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the \"freedom\" of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.\n\nUntil the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purpose\u2014to engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering. In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs. As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their \"turf.\" Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes. Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed. The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful. See Chicago Municipal Code \u00a7 8-4\u2014015 (1992). The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.\n\nThe majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.IRespondents' consolidated appeal presents a facial challenge to the Chicago ordinance on vagueness grounds. When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question is declared to be unenforceable in all its applications, and not just in its particular application to the party in suit. To tell the truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courts have any business making such a declaration. The rationale for our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), was that we had to do so in order to decide the case before us. But that rationale only extends so far as to require us to determine that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to this party, in the circumstances of this case.\n\nThat limitation was fully grasped by Tocqueville, in his famous chapter on the power of the judiciary in American society:The second characteristic of judicial power is, that it pronounces on special cases, and not upon general principles. If a judge, in deciding a particular point, destroys a general principle by passing a judgment which tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his functions. But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.\n. . . . .\n\n\"Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is invoked in a tribunal of the United States, he may refuse to admit it as a rule . . . . But as soon as a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case, that law immediately loses a portion of its moral force. Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. . . . The political power which the Americans have intrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. . . . [W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only incidentally. Moreover, although it is censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but its authority is not taken away; and its final destruction can be accomplished only by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries.\" Democracy in America 73, 75-76 (R. Heffner ed. 1956).As Justice Sutherland described our system in his opinion for a unanimous Court in Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923):We have no power per se to review and annul acts of Congress on the ground that they are unconstitutional. That question may be considered only when the justification for some direct injury suffered or threatened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such an act. Then the power exercised is that of ascertaining and declaring the law applicable to the controversy. It amounts to little more than the negative power to disregard an unconstitutional enactment, which otherwise would stand in the way of the enforcement of a legal right. . . . If a case for preventive relief be presented the court enjoins, in effect, not the execution of the statute, but the acts of the official, the statute notwithstanding.\"And as Justice Brennan described our system in his opinion for a unanimous Court in United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 20-22 (1960):The very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies before them. . . . This Court, as is the case with all federal courts, `has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies. In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.' . . .Kindred to these rules is the rule that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional. . . . The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.\"It seems to me fundamentally incompatible with this system for the Court not to be content to find that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to the person before it, but to go further and pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in all applications. Its reasoning may well suggest as much, but to pronounce a holding on that point seems to me no more than an advisory opinion\u2014which a federal court should never issue at all, see Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), and especially should not issue with regard to a constitutional question, as to which we seek to avoid even non advisory opinions, see, e. g., Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). I think it quite improper, in short, to ask the constitutional claimant before us: Do you just want us to say that this statute cannot constitutionally be applied to you in this case, or do you want to go for broke and try to get the statute pronounced void in all its applications?\n\nI must acknowledge, however, that for some of the present century we have done just this. But until recently, at least, we have\u2014except in free-speech cases subject to the doctrine of overbreadth, see, e. g., New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 769-773 (1982)\u2014required the facial challenge to be a go-forbroke proposition. That is to say, before declaring a statute to be void in all its applications (something we should not be doing in the first place), we have at least imposed upon the litigant the eminently reasonable requirement that he establish that the statute was unconstitutional in all its applications. (I say that is an eminently reasonable requirement, not only because we should not be holding a statute void in all its applications unless it is unconstitutional in all its applications, but also because unless it is unconstitutional in all its applications we do not even know, without conducting an as-applied analysis, whether it is void with regard to the very litigant before us\u2014whose case, after all, was the occasion for undertaking this inquiry in the first place.[1])\n\nAs we said in United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987):A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid. The fact that [a legislative Act] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid, since we have not recognized an `overbreadth' doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment.\" (Emphasis added.)[2]This proposition did not originate with Salerno, but had been expressed in a line of prior opinions. See, e. g., Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 796 (1984) (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.) (statute not implicating First Amendment rights is invalid on its face if \"it is unconstitutional in every conceivable application\"); Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 269, n. 18 (1984); Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 494-495, 497 (1982); United States v. National Dairy Products Corp., 372 U. S. 29, 31-32 (1963); Raines, 362 U. S., at 21. And the proposition has been reaffirmed in many cases and opinions since. See, e. g., Anderson v. Edwards, 514 U. S. 143, 155-156, n. 6 (1995) (unanimous Court); Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 699 (1995) (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.) (facial challenge asserts that a challenged statute or regulation is invalid \"in every circumstance\"); Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 301 (1993); Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 183 (1991); Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 514 (1990) (opinion of Kennedy, J.); Webster v. Reproductive Health Servs., 492 U. S. 490, 523-524 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1988).[3] Unsurprisingly, given the clarity of our general jurisprudence on this point, the Federal Courts of Appeals all apply the Salerno standard in adjudicating facial challenges.[4]\n\nI am aware, of course, that in some recent facial-challenge cases the Court has, without any attempt at explanation, created entirely irrational exceptions to the \"unconstitutional in every conceivable application\" rule, when the statutes at issue concerned hot-button social issues on which \"informed opinion\" was zealously united. See Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 643 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (homosexual rights); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 895 (1992) (abortion rights). But the present case does not even lend itself to such a \"political correctness\" exception\u2014which, though illogical, is at least predictable. It is not \u00e0 la mode to favor gang members and associated loiterers over the beleaguered law-abiding residents of the inner city.\n\nWhen our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof. Instead of requiring respondents, who are challenging the ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications. Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the law's application would (in their view) be ambiguous. But that creative role has been usurped from petitioner, who can defeat respondents' facial challenge by conjuring up a single valid application of the law. My contribution would go something like this:[5] Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby. Officer Krupke, applying the ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse. After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statement\u2014not entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rude\u2014\"Gee, Officer Krupke, krup you.\" A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order. Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it,I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming. That should settle the matter of respondents' facial challenge to the ordinance's vagueness.\n\nOf course respondents would still be able to claim that the ordinance was vague as applied to them. But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Court's holding of facial invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an as-applied challenge on the basis of the majority's own criteria. For instance, respondent Jose Renteria\u2014who admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gang\u2014was observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members. The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested. In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several others\u2014who admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gang\u2014were observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks. The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued another dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later. Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrez\u2014who had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gang\u2014was observed loitering with two other men. The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return. See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 11. Even on the majority's assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order ex ante that his conduct is covered by the ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained. Much less is it possible to say that the ordinance is invalid in all its applications.IIThe plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: \"[This] is a criminal law that contains no mens rea requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights . . . . When vagueness permeates the text of such a law, it is subject to facial attack.\" Ante, at 55 (emphasis added). The proposition is set forth with such assurance that one might suppose that it repeats some well-accepted formula in our jurisprudence: (Criminal law without mens rea requirement) [H11501] (infringement of constitutionally protected right) [H11501] (vagueness) [H11505] (entitlement to facial invalidation). There is no such formula; the plurality has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citation demonstrates.\n\nBut no matter. None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway. I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiter\u2014or, as the plurality more favorably describes 84*84 it, for a person to \"remain in a public place of his choice.\" Ante, at 54. The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally un protected, activities as doing (ugh!) business: \"This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no mens rea requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights.\" Ante, at 55 (internal quotation marks omitted). (Poor Alexander Hamilton, who has seen his \"commercial republic\" devolve, in the eyes of the plurality, at least, into an \"indolent republic,\" see The Federalist No. 6, p. 56; No. 11, pp. 84-91 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).)\n\nOf course every activity, even scratching one's head, can be called a \"constitutional right\" if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without \"rational basis.\" See FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313 (1993). But using the term in that sense utterly impoverishes our constitutional discourse. We would then need a new term for those activities\u2014such as political speech or religious worship\u2014that cannot be forbidden even with rational basis.\n\nThe plurality tosses around the term \"constitutional right\" in this renegade sense, because there is not the slightest evidence for the existence of a genuine constitutional right to loiter. Justice Thomas recounts the vast historical tradition of criminalizing the activity. Post, at 102-106 (dissenting opinion). It is simply not maintainable that the right to loiter would have been regarded as an essential attribute of liberty at the time of the framing or at the time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. For the plurality, however, the historical practices of our people are nothing more than a speed bump on the road to the \"right\" result. Its opinion blithely proclaims: \"Neither this history nor the scholarly 85*85 compendia in Justice Thomas' dissent, [ibid.,] persuades us that the right to engage in loitering that is entirely harmless in both purpose and effect is not a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.\" Ante, at 54, n. 20. The entire practice of using the Due Process Clause to add judicially favored rights to the limitations upon democracy set forth in the Bill of Rights (usually under the rubric of socalled \"substantive due process\") is in my view judicial usurpation. But we have, recently at least, sought to limit the damage by tethering the courts' \"right-making\" power to an objective criterion. In Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720-721 (1997), we explained our \"established method\" of substantive due process analysis: carefully and narrowly describing the asserted right, and then examining whether that right is manifested in \"[o]ur Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices.\" See also Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125-126 (1992); Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 122-123 (1989); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 502-503 (1977). The plurality opinion not only ignores this necessary limitation, but it leaps far beyond any substantive-due-process atrocity we have ever committed, by actually placing the burden of proof upon the defendant to establish that loitering is not a \"fundamental liberty.\" It never does marshal any support for the proposition that loitering is a constitutional right, contenting itself with a (transparently inadequate) explanation of why the historical record of laws banning loitering does not positively contradict that proposition,[6] and the (transparently erroneous) assertion that the city of Chicago appears to have conceded the 86*86 point.[7] It is enough for the Members of the plurality that \"history . . . [fails to] persuad[e] us that the right to engage in loitering that is entirely harmless in both purpose and effect is not a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause,\" ante, at 54, n. 20 (emphasis added); they apparently think it quite unnecessary for anything to persuade them that it is.[8]\n\nIt would be unfair, however, to criticize the plurality's failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences. The plurality at least makes an attempt. The concurrences, on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad \"vagueness invalidates\" rule to a liberty interest. As far as appears from Justice O'Connor's and Justice Breyer's opinions, no police officer may issue any order, affecting any insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of \"gang members\") unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise. No modern urban society\u2014and probably none since London got big enough to have sewers\u2014could function under such a rule. There are innumerable reasons why it may be important for a constable to tell a pedestrian to \"move on\"\u2014and even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable. Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the city of New York which reads: \"No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated verbally, by gesture or otherwise.\" 56 RCNY \u00a7 1-03(c)(1) (1996). It is one thing to uphold an \"as-applied\" challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonable\u2014or even when a pedestrian asserting some true \"liberty\" interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable but unexplained. But to say that such a general ordinance permitting \"lawful orders\" is void in all its applications demands more than a safe and orderly society can reasonably deliver.\n\nJustice Kennedy apparently recognizes this, since he acknowledges that \"some police commands will subject a citizen to prosecution for disobeying whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given,\" including, for example, an order \"tell[ing] a pedestrian not to enter a building\" when the reason is \"to avoid impeding a rescue team.\" Ante, at 69 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But his only explanation of why the present interference with the \"right to loiter\" does not fall within that permitted scope of action is as follows: \"The predicate of an order to disperse is not, in my view, sufficient to eliminate doubts regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance.\" Ibid. I have not the slightest idea what this means. But I do understand that the follow-up explanatory sentence, showing how this principle invalidates the present ordinance, applies equally to the rescue-team example that Justice Kennedy thinks is constitutional\u2014as is demonstrated by substituting for references to the facts of the present case (shown in italics) references to his rescue-team hypothetical (shown in brackets): \"A citizen, while engaging in a wide array of innocent conduct, is not likely to know when he may be subject to a dispersal order [order not to enter a building] based on the officer's own knowledge of the identity or affiliations of other persons with whom the citizen is congregating [what is going on in the building]; nor may the citizen be able to assess what an officer might conceive to be the citizen's lack of an apparent purpose [the impeding of a rescue team].\" Ante, at 69-70.IIII turn next to that element of the plurality's facialchallenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no mens rea requirement. The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the actus reus, to which that mens rea is supposed to be attached, consists of. The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained. See ante, at 47, 50-51, 53-55, 57-59, 60-61, 62-63 (plurality and majority opinions); ante, at 65, 66, 68 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); ante, at 69-70 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); ante, at 72-73 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). That is not what the ordinance provides. The only part of the ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant appears to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is actually doing. The ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (i. e., have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any apparent purpose. Someone who in fact has a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) can be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no apparent purpose. It is likely, to be sure, that the ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are actually loitering (those who really have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.\n\nThe only act of a defendant that is made punishable by the ordinance\u2014or, indeed, that is even mentioned by the ordinance\u2014is his failure to \"promptly obey\" an order to disperse. The question, then, is whether that actus reus must be accompanied by any wrongful intent\u2014and of course it must. As the Court itself describes the requirement, \"a person must disobey the officer's order.\" Ante, at 47 (emphasis added). No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible. The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.\n\nIV\n\nFinally, I address the last of the three factors in the plurality's facial-challenge formula: the proposition that the ordinance is vague. It is not. Even under the ersatz overbreadth standard applied in Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 358, n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a law reaches \"a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,\" respondents' claim fails because the ordinance would not be vague in most or even a substantial number of applications. A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. See, e. g., Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108 (1972).\n\nThe plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects. Since, it reasons, \"the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit,\" and \"an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred,\" ante, at 58, 59, the order to disperse cannot itself serve \"to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.\" What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the ordinance is \"designed to prohibit,\" but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty. As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct. The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order itself is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify how far to disperse(!), see ante, at 59, scarcely requires a response.[9] If it were true, it would render unconstitutional for vagueness many of the Presidential proclamations issued under that provision of the United States Code which requires the President, 91*91 before using the militia or the Armed Forces for law enforcement, to issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse. See 10 U. S. C. \u00a7 334. President Eisenhower's proclamation relating to the obstruction of court-ordered enrollment of black students in public schools at Little Rock, Arkansas, read as follows: \"I . . .command all persons engaged in such obstruction of justice to cease and desist therefrom, and to disperse forthwith.\" Presidential Proclamation No. 3204, 3 CFR 132 (1954-1958 Comp.). See also Presidential Proclamation No. 3645, 3 CFR 103 (1964-1965 Comp.) (ordering those obstructing the civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, to \"disperse . . . forthwith\"). See also Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 331 (1988) (rejecting overbreadth/vagueness challenge to a law allowing police officers to order congregations near foreign embassies to disperse); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 536, 551 (1965) (rejecting vagueness challenge to the dispersal-order prong of a breach-of-the-peace statute and describing that prong as \"narrow and specific\").\n\nFor its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the Court relies secondarily\u2014and Justice O'Connor's and Justice Breyer's concurrences exclusively\u2014upon the second aspect of that doctrine, which requires sufficient specificity to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement. See ante, at 60 (majority opinion); ante, at 65-66 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); ante, at 72 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In discussing whether Chicago's ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint. They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois' statement that the \"apparent purpose\" standard \"provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering,\" 177 Ill. 2d 440, 457, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the ordinance more narrowly than did the State's highest court. Ante, at 61, 63 (majority opinion); ante, at 68 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The \"absolute discretion\" statement, however, is nothing more than the Illinois Supreme Court's characterization of what the language achieved\u2014after that court refused (as I do) to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain. It is not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).\n\nThe criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago ordinance could hardly be clearer. First, the law requires police officers to \"reasonably believ[e]\" that one of the group to which the order is issued is a \"criminal street gang member.\" This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Department's General Order 92-4 (1992)\u2014promulgated to govern enforcement of the ordinance\u2014makes the probable-cause requirement explicit.[10] Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officer's \"experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders\" and by \"specific, documented and reliable information\" such as reliable witness testimony or an individual's admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs. App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a\u201469a, 71a\u201472a.\n\nSecond, the ordinance requires that the group be \"remain[ing] in any one place with no apparent purpose.\" Justice O'Connor's assertion that this applies to \"any person standing in a public place,\" ante, at 66, is a distortion. The ordinance does not apply to \"standing,\" but to \"remain[ing]\"\u2014 a term which in this context obviously means \"[to] endure or persist,\" see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992). There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but \"remain[ing] in one place\" requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding respondents' arrests described supra, at 82-83.\n\nAs for the phrase \"with no apparent purpose\": Justice O'Connor again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies. \"[A]ny person standing on the street,\" her concurrence says, \"has a general `purpose'\u2014even if it is simply to stand,\" and thus \"the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are permissible. \" Ante, at 66. But Chicago police officers enforcing the ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who \"remain in any one place with no apparent purpose\"\u2014that is, who remain there without any apparent reason for remaining there. That is not difficult to perceive.[11]\n\nThe Court's attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: \"The `no apparent purpose' standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is `apparent' to the officer on the scene.\" Ante, at 62. In the Court's view, a person's lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an objective factor, and what the ordinance requires as a condition of an order to disperse\u2014 the absence of any apparent purpose\u2014is a subjective factor. This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.\n\nElsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent. The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes. It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she may\u2014indeed, she `shall'\u2014order them to disperse.\" Ante, at 60.Quite so. And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers \"reach[es] a substantial amount of innocent conduct,\" ibid., would be invalidating if that conduct were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion. Remaining in one place is not so protected, and so (as already discussed) it is up to the citizens of Chicago\u2014not us\u2014to decide whether the trade-off is worth it.[12]\n\nJustice Breyer's concurrence tries to perform the impossible feat of affirming our unquestioned rule that a criminal statute that is so vague as to give constitutionally inadequate notice to some violators may nonetheless be enforced against those whose conduct is clearly covered, see ante, at 71-72, citing Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733 (1974), while at the same time asserting that a statute which \"delegates too much discretion to a police officer\" is invalid in all its applications, even where the officer uses his discretion \"wisely,\" ante, at 71. But the vagueness that causes notice to be inadequate is the very same vagueness that causes \"too much discretion\" to be lodged in the enforcing officer. Put another way: A law that gives the policeman clear guidance in all cases gives the public clear guidance in all cases as well. Thus, what Justice Breyer gives with one hand, he takes away with the other. In his view, vague statutes that nonetheless give adequate notice to some violators are not unenforceable against those violators because of inadequate notice, but are unenforceable against them \"because the policeman enjoys too much discretion in every case,\" ibid. This is simply contrary to our case law, including Parker v. Levy, supra.[13]VThe plurality points out that Chicago already has several laws that reach the intimidating and unlawful gang-related conduct the ordinance was directed at. See ante, at 52, n. 17. The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicago's city council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away. The only solution, the council concluded, was to clear the streets of congregations of gangs, their drug customers, and their associates.\n\nJustice O'Connor's concurrence proffers the same empty solace of existing laws useless for the purpose at hand, see ante, at 67, 67-68, but seeks to be helpful by suggesting some measures similar to this ordinance that would be constitutional. It says that Chicago could, for example, enact a law that \"directly prohibit[s] the presence of a large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-on on the public ways, that intimidates residents.\" Ante, at 67 (internal quotation marks omitted). (If the majority considers the present ordinance too vague, it would be fun to see what it makes of \"a large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members.\") This prescription of the concurrence is largely a quotation from the plurality\u2014which itself answers the concurrence's suggestion that such a law would be helpful by pointing out that the city already \"has several laws that serve this purpose.\" Ante, at 52, n. 17 (plurality opinion) (citing extant laws against \"intimidation,\" \"street gang criminal drug conspiracy,\" and \"mob action\"). The problem, again, is that the intimidation and lawlessness do not occur when the police are in sight.\n\nJustice O'Connor's concurrence also proffers another cure: \"If the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably believed to be gang members, this requirement might have cured the ordinance's vagueness because it would have directed the manner in which the order was issued by specifying to whom the order could be issued.\" Ante, at 66 (the Court agrees that this might be a cure, see ante, at 62). But the ordinance already specifies to whom the order can be issued: persons remaining in one place with no apparent purpose in the company of a gang member. And if \"remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose\" is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of nongang members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members alone. Surely gang members cannot be decreed to be outlaws, subject to the merest whim of the police as the rest of us are not.\n\n* * *\n\nThe fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety. As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majority's real quarrel with the Chicago ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed. As Justice O'Connor's concurrence says with disapprobation, \"the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are not gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public.\" Ante, at 66 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nBut in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts. So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, all sorts of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbidden\u2014riding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the risk of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged. The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to \"hang out\" with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidation\u2014and that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other. This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.\n\nI dissent from the judgment of the Court.Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia join, dissenting.The duly elected members of the Chicago City Council enacted the ordinance at issue as part of a larger effort to prevent gangs from establishing dominion over the public streets. By invalidating Chicago's ordinance, I fear that the Court has unnecessarily sentenced law-abiding citizens to lives of terror and misery. The ordinance is not vague. \"[A]ny fool would know that a particular category of conduct would be within [its] reach.\" Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 370 (1983) (White, J.,dissenting). Nor does it violate the Due Process Clause. The asserted \"freedom to loiter for innocent purposes,\" ante, at 53 (plurality opinion), is in no way \"`deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,' \" Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (citation omitted). I dissent.IThe human costs exacted by criminal street gangs are inestimable. In many of our Nation's cities, gangs have \"[v]irtually overtak[en] certain neighborhoods, contributing to the economic and social decline of these areas and causing fear and lifestyle changes among law-abiding residents.\" U. S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance, Monograph: Urban Street Gang Enforcement 3 (1997). Gangs fill the daily lives of many of our poorest and most vulnerable citizens with a terror that the Court does not give sufficient consideration, often relegating them to the status of prisoners in their own homes. See U. S. Dept. of Justice, Attorney General's Report to the President, Coordinated Approach to the Challenge of Gang Violence: A Progress Report 1 (Apr. 1996) (\"From the small business owner who is literally crippled because he refuses to pay `protection' money to the neighborhood gang, to the families who are hostages within their homes, living in neighborhoods ruled by predatory drug trafficking gangs, the harmful impact of gang violence . . . is both physically and psychologically debilitating\").\n\nThe city of Chicago has suffered the devastation wrought by this national tragedy. Last year, in an effort to curb plummeting attendance, the Chicago Public Schools hired dozens of adults to escort children to school. The youngsters had become too terrified of gang violence to leave their homes alone. Martinez, Parents Paid to Walk Line Between Gangs and School, Chicago Tribune, Jan. 21, 1998, p. 1. The children's fears were not unfounded. In 1996, the Chicago Police Department estimated that there were 132 criminal street gangs in the city. Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, Research Bulletin: Street Gangs and Crime 4 (Sept. 1996). Between 1987 and 1994, these gangs were involved in 63,141 criminal incidents, including 21,689 nonlethal violent crimes and 894 homicides. Id., at 4-5.[1] Many of these criminal incidents and homicides result from gang \"turf battles,\" which take place on the public streets and place innocent residents in grave danger. See U. S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice, Research in brief, C. Block & R. Block, Street Gang Crime in Chicago 1 (Dec. 1993); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Juvenile Justice Journal, J. Howell, Youth Gang Drug Trafficking and Homicide: Policy and Program Implications (Dec. 1997); see also Testimony of Steven R. Wiley, Chief, Violent Crimes and Major Offenders Section, FBI, Hearing on S. 54 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1997) (\"While street gangs may specialize in entrepreneurial activities like drug-dealing, their gang-related lethal violence is more likely to grow out of turf conflicts\").\n\nBefore enacting its ordinance, the Chicago City Council held extensive hearings on the problems of gang loitering. Concerned citizens appeared to testify poignantly as to how gangs disrupt their daily lives. Ordinary citizens like Ms. D'Ivory Gordon explained that she struggled just to walk to work:When I walk out my door, these guys are out there . . . .\n\n. . . . .\n\n\"They watch you. . . . They know where you live. They know what time you leave, what time you come home. I am afraid of them. I have even come to the point now that I carry a meat cleaver to work with me . . . .\n\". . . I don't want to hurt anyone, and I don't want to be hurt. We need to clean these corners up. Clean these communities up and take it back from them.\" Transcript of Proceedings before the City Council of Chicago, Committee on Police and Fire 66-67 (May 15, 1992) (hereinafter Transcript).Eighty-eight-year-old Susan Mary Jackson echoed her sentiments, testifying: \"We used to have a nice neighborhood. We don't have it anymore . . . . I am scared to go out in the daytime. . . . [Y]ou can't pass because they are standing. I am afraid to go to the store. I don't go to the store because I am afraid. At my age if they look at me real hard, I be ready to holler.\" Id., at 93-95. Another long-time resident testified:I have never had the terror that I feel everyday when I walk down the streets of Chicago. . . .\n. . . . .\n\n\"I have had my windows broken out. I have had guns pulled on me. I have been threatened. I get intimidated on a daily basis, and it's come to the point where I say, well, do I go out today. Do I put my ax in my briefcase. Do I walk around dressed like a bum so I am not looking rich or got any money or anything like that.\" Id., at 124-125.Following these hearings, the council found that \"criminal street gangs establish control over identifiable areas . . . by loitering in those areas and intimidating others from entering those areas.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a. It further found that the mere presence of gang members \"intimidate[s] many law abiding citizens\" and \"creates a justifiable fear for the safety of persons and property in the area.\" Ibid. It is the product of this democratic process\u2014the council's attempt to address these social ills\u2014that we are asked to pass judgment upon today.IIAs part of its ongoing effort to curb the deleterious effects of criminal street gangs, the citizens of Chicago sensibly decided to return to basics. The ordinance does nothing more than confirm the well-established principle that the police have the duty and the power to maintain the public peace, and, when necessary, to disperse groups of individuals who threaten it. The plurality, however, concludes that the city's commonsense effort to combat gang loitering fails constitutional scrutiny for two separate reasons\u2014because it infringes upon gang members' constitutional right to \"loiter for innocent purposes,\" ante, at 53, and because it is vague on its face, ante, at 55. A majority of the Court endorses the latter conclusion. I respectfully disagree.AWe recently reconfirmed that \"[o]ur Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices . . . provide the crucial `guide posts for responsible decision-making' . . . that direct and restrain our exposition of the Due Process Clause.\" Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721 (quoting Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion)). Only laws that infringe \"those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, `deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' \" offend the Due Process Clause. Glucksberg, supra, at 720-721.\n\nThe plurality asserts that \"the freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the `liberty' protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Ante, at 53. Yet it acknowledges\u2014as it must\u2014that \"antiloitering ordinances have long existed in this country.\" Ante, at 53, n. 20; see also 177 Ill. 2d 440, 450, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 60 (1997) (case below) (\"Loitering and vagrancy statutes have been utilized throughout American history in an attempt to prevent crime by removing `undesirable persons' from public before they have the opportunity to engage in criminal activity\"). In derogation of the framework we articulated only two Terms ago in Glucksberg, the plurality asserts that this history fails to \"persuad[e] us that the right to engage in loitering that is entirely harmless . . . is not a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.\" Ante, at 54, n. 20. Apparently, the plurality believes it sufficient to rest on the proposition that antiloitering laws represent an anachronistic throwback to an earlier, less sophisticated, era. For example, it expresses concern that some antivagrancy laws carried the penalty of slavery. Ibid. But this fact is irrelevant to our analysis of whether there is a constitutional right to loiter for innocent purposes. This case does not involve an antiloitering law carrying the penalty of slavery. The law at issue in this case criminalizes the failure to obey a police officer's order to disperse and imposes modest penalties, such as a fine of up to $500 and a prison sentence of up to six months.\n\nThe plurality's sweeping conclusion that this ordinance infringes upon a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause withers when exposed to the relevant history: Laws prohibiting loitering and vagrancy have been a fixture of Anglo-American law at least since the time of the Norman Conquest. See generally C. Ribton-Turner, A History of Vagrants and Vagrancy and Beggars and Begging (reprint 1972) (discussing history of English vagrancy laws); see also Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 161-162 (1972) (recounting history of vagrancy laws). The American colonists enacted laws modeled upon the English vagrancy laws, and at the time of the founding, state and local governments customarily criminalized loitering and other forms of vagrancy.[2] Vagrancy laws were common in the decades preceding the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment,[3] and remained on the books long after.[4]\n\nTellingly, the plurality cites only three cases in support of the asserted right to \"loiter for innocent purposes.\" See ante, at 53-54. Of those, only one\u2014decided more than 100 years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014 actually addressed the validity of a vagrancy ordinance. That case, Papachristou, supra, contains some dicta that can be read to support the fundamental right that the plurality asserts.[5] However, the Court in Papachristou did not undertake the now-accepted analysis applied in substantive due process cases\u2014it did not look to tradition to define the rights protected by the Due Process Clause. In any event, a careful reading of the opinion reveals that the Court never said anything about a constitutional right. The Court's holding was that the antiquarian language employed in the vagrancy ordinance at issue was unconstitutionally vague. See id., at 162-163. Even assuming, then, that Papachristou was correctly decided as an original matter\u2014a doubtful proposition\u2014it does not compel the conclusion that the Constitution protects the right to loiter for innocent purposes. The plurality's contrary assertion calls to mind the warning that \"[t]he Judiciary, including this Court, is the most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or even the design of the Constitution. . . . [We] should be extremely reluctant to breathe still further substantive content into the Due Process Clause so as to strike down legislation adopted by a State or city to promote its welfare.\" Moore, 431 U. S., at 544 (White, J., dissenting). When \"the Judiciary does so, it unavoidably pre-empts for itself another part of the governance of the country without express constitutional authority.\" Ibid.B<!--?h3-->\n\nThe Court concludes that the ordinance is also unconstitutionally vague because it fails to provide adequate standards to guide police discretion and because, in the plurality's view, it does not give residents adequate notice of how to conform their conduct to the confines of the law. I disagree on both counts.1<!--?h4-->\n\nAt the outset, it is important to note that the ordinance does not criminalize loitering per se. Rather, it penalizes loiterers' failure to obey a police officer's order to move along. A majority of the Court believes that this scheme vests too much discretion in police officers. Nothing could be further from the truth. Far from according officers too much discretion, the ordinance merely enables police officers to fulfill one of their traditional functions. Police officers are not, and have never been, simply enforcers of the criminal law. They wear other hats\u2014importantly, they have long been vested with the responsibility for preserving the public peace. See, e. g., O. Allen, Duties and Liabilities of Sheriffs 59 (1845) (\"As the principal conservator of the peace in his county, and as the calm but irresistible minister of the law, the duty of the Sheriff is no less important than his authority is great\"); E. Freund, Police Power \u00a7 86, p. 87 (1904) (\"The criminal law deals with offenses after they have been committed, the police power aims to prevent them. The activity of the police for the prevention of crime is partly such as needs no special legal authority\"). Nor is the idea that the police are also peace officers simply a quaint anachronism. In most American jurisdictions, police officers continue to be obligated, by law, to maintain the public peace.[6]\n\nIn their role as peace officers, the police long have had the authority and the duty to order groups of individuals who threaten the public peace to disperse. For example, the 1887 police manual for the city of New York provided:It is hereby made the duty of the Police Force at all times of day and night, and the members of such Force are hereby there unto empowered, to especially preserve the public peace, prevent crime, detect and arrest offenders, suppress riots, mobs and insurrections, disperse unlawful or dangerous assemblages, and assemblages which obstruct the free passage of public streets, side- walks, parks and places. \" Manual Containing the Rules and Regulations of the Police Department of the City of New York, Rule 414 (emphasis added).\n\nSee also J. Crocker, Duties of Sheriffs, Coroners and Constables \u00a7 48, p. 33 (2d ed. rev. 1871) (\"Sheriffs are, ex officio, conservators of the peace within their respective counties, and it is their duty, as well as that of all constables, coroners, marshals and other peace officers, to prevent every breach of the peace, and to suppress every unlawful assembly, affray or riot which may happen in their presence\" (emphasis added)). The authority to issue dispersal orders continues to play a commonplace and crucial role in police operations, particularly in urban areas.[7] Even the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice recognize that \"[i]n day-to-day police experience there are innumerable situations in which police are called upon to order people not to block the sidewalk, not to congregate in a given place, and not to `loiter' . . . . The police may suspect the loiterer of considering engaging in some form of undesirable conduct that can be at least temporarily frustrated by ordering him or her to `move on.' \" Standard 1-3.4(d), p. 1.88, and comments (2d ed. 1980, Supp. 1986).[8]\n\nIn order to perform their peacekeeping responsibilities satisfactorily, the police inevitably must exercise discretion. Indeed, by empowering them to act as peace officers, the law assumes that the police will exercise that discretion responsibly and with sound judgment. That is not to say that the law should not provide objective guidelines for the police, but simply that it cannot rigidly constrain their every action. By directing a police officer not to issue a dispersal order unless he \"observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public place,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a, Chicago's ordinance strikes an appropriate balance between those two extremes. Just as we trust officers to rely on their experience and expertise in order to make spur-of-the-moment determinations about amorphous legal standards such as \"probable cause\" and \"reasonable suspicion,\" so we must trust them to determine whether a group of loiterers contains individuals (in this case members of criminal street gangs) whom the city has determined threaten the public peace. See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 695, 700 (1996) (\"Articulating precisely what `reasonable suspicion' and `probable cause' mean is not possible. They are commonsense, nontechnical conceptions that deal with the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act. . . . [O]ur cases have recognized that a police officer may draw inferences based on his own experience in deciding whether probable cause exists\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). In sum, the Court's conclusion that the ordinance is impermissibly vague because it \"`necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the momentto-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat,' \" ante, at 60, cannot be reconciled with common sense, longstanding police practice, or this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.\n\nThe illogic of the Court's position becomes apparent when it opines that the ordinance's dispersal provision \"would no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect, or possibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gang members.\" Ante, at 62 (footnote omitted). See also ante, at 67 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (endorsing Court's proposal). With respect, if the Court believes that the ordinance is vague as written, this suggestion would not cure the vagueness problem. First, although the Court has suggested that a scienter requirement may mitigate a vagueness problem \"with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed,\" Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 499 (1982) (footnote omitted), the alternative proposal does not incorporate a scienter requirement. If the ordinance's prohibition were limited to loitering with \"an apparently harmful purpose,\" the criminality of the conduct would continue to depend on its external appearance, rather than the loiterer's state of mind. See Black's Law Dictionary 1345 (6th ed. 1990) (scienter \"is frequently used to signify the defendant's guilty knowledge\"). For this reason, the proposed alternative would neither satisfy the standard suggested in Hoffman Estates nor serve to channel police discretion. Indeed, an ordinance that required officers to ascertain whether a group of loiterers have \"an apparently harmful purpose\" would require them to exercise more discretion, not less. Furthermore, the ordinance in its current form\u2014requiring the dispersal of groups that contain at least one gang member\u2014actually vests less discretion in the police than would a law requiring that the police disperse groups that contain only gang members. Currently, an officer must reasonably suspect that one individual is a member of a gang. Under the plurality's proposed law, an officer would be required to make such a determination multiple times.\n\nIn concluding that the ordinance adequately channels police discretion, I do not suggest that a police officer enforcing the Gang Congregation Ordinance will never make a mistake. Nor do I overlook the possibility that a police officer, acting in bad faith, might enforce the ordinance in an arbitrary or discriminatory way. But our decisions should not turn on the proposition that such an event will be anything but rare. Instances of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement of the ordinance, like any other law, are best addressed when (and if) they arise, rather than prophylactically through the disfavored mechanism of a facial challenge on vagueness grounds. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987) (\"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid\").2The plurality's conclusion that the ordinance \"fails to give the ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden and what is permitted,\" ante, at 60, is similarly untenable. There is nothing \"vague\" about an order to disperse.[9] While \"we can never expect mathematical certainty from our language,\" Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 110 (1972), itis safe to assume that the vast majority of people who are ordered by the police to \"disperse and remove themselves from the area\" will have little difficulty understanding how to comply. App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.\n\nAssuming that we are also obligated to consider whether the ordinance places individuals on notice of what conduct might subject them to such an order, respondents in this facial challenge bear the weighty burden of establishing that the statute is vague in all its applications, \"in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all.\" Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 614 (1971). I subscribe to the view of retired Justice White\u2014\"If any fool would know that a particular category of conduct would be within the reach of the statute, if there is an unmistakable core that a reasonable person would know is forbidden by the law, the enactment is not unconstitutional on its face.\" Kolender, 461 U. S., at 370-371 (dissenting opinion). This is certainly such a case. As the Illinois Supreme Court recognized, \"persons of ordinary intelligence may maintain a common and accepted meaning of the word `loiter.' \" 177 Ill. 2d, at 451, 687 N. E. 2d, at 61.\n\nJustice Stevens' contrary conclusion is predicated primarily on the erroneous assumption that the ordinance proscribes large amounts of constitutionally protected and/or innocent conduct. See ante, at 55, 56-57, 60. As already explained, supra, at 102-106, the ordinance does not proscribe constitutionally protected conduct\u2014there is no fundamental right to loiter. It is also anomalous to characterize loitering as \"innocent\" conduct when it has been disfavored throughout American history. When a category of conduct has been consistently criminalized, it can hardly be considered \"innocent.\" Similarly, when a term has long been used to describe criminal conduct, the need to subject it to the \"more stringent vagueness test\" suggested in Hoffman Estates, 455 U. S., at 499, dissipates, for there is no risk of a trap for the unwary. The term \"loiter\" is no different from terms such as \"fraud,\" \"bribery,\" and \"perjury.\" We expect people of ordinary intelligence to grasp the meaning of such legal terms despite the fact that they are arguably imprecise.[10]\n\nThe plurality also concludes that the definition of the term loiter\u2014\"to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose,\" see 177 Ill.2d, at 445, 687 N. E. 2d, at 58\u2014fails to provide adequate notice.[11] \"It is difficult to imagine,\" the plurality posits, \"how any citizen of the city of Chicago standing in a public place . . .would know if he or she had an `apparent purpose.' \" Ante, at 56-57. The plurality underestimates the intellectual capacity of the citizens of Chicago. Persons of ordinary intelligence are perfectly capable of evaluating how outsiders perceive their conduct, and here \"[i]t is self-evident that there is a whole range of conduct that anyone with at least a semblance of common sense would know is [loitering] and that would be covered by the statute.\" See Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 584 (1974) (White, J., concurring in judgment). Members of a group standing on the corner staring blankly into space, for example, are likely well aware that passersby would conclude that they have \"no apparent purpose.\" In any event, because this is a facial challenge, the plurality's ability to hypothesize that some individuals, in some circumstances, may be unable to ascertain how their actions appear to outsiders is irrelevant to our analysis. Here, we are asked to determine whether the ordinance is \"vague in all of its applications.\" Hoffman Estates, supra, at 497. The answer is unquestionably no.\n\n* * *\n\nToday, the Court focuses extensively on the \"rights\" of gang members and their companions. It can safely do so\u2014 the people who will have to live with the consequences of today's opinion do not live in our neighborhoods. Rather, the people who will suffer from our lofty pronouncements are people like Ms. Susan Mary Jackson; people who have seen their neighborhoods literally destroyed by gangs and violence and drugs. They are good, decent people who must struggle to overcome their desperate situation, against all odds, in order to raise their families, earn a living, and remain good citizens. As one resident described: \"There is only about maybe one or two percent of the people in the city causing these problems maybe, but it's keeping 98 percent of us in our houses and off the streets and afraid to shop.\" Transcript 126. By focusing exclusively on the imagined \"rights\" of the two percent, the Court today has denied our most vulnerable citizens the very thing that Justice Stevens, ante, at 54, elevates above all else\u2014the \"`freedom of movement.' \" And that is a shame.

Any person who does not promptly obey such an order is in violation of this section.\n\n\"(b) It shall be an affirmative defense to an alleged violation of this section that no person who was observed loitering was in fact a member of a criminal street gang.\n\n\"(c) As used in this Section:\n\n\"(1) `Loiter' means to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose.\n\n\"(2) `Criminal street gang' means any ongoing organization, association in fact or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, having as one of its substantial activities the commission of one or more of the criminal acts enumerated in paragraph (3), and whose members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.\n\n. . . . .\n\n\"(5) `Public place' means the public way and any other location open to the public, whether publicly or privately owned.\n\n\"(e) Any person who violates this Section is subject to a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $500 for each offense, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.\n\n\"In addition to or instead of the above penalties, any person who violates this section may be required to perform up to 120 hours of community service pursuant to section 1-4\u2014120 of this Code.\" Chicago Municipal Code \u00a7 8-4\u2014015 (added June 17, 1992), reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a\u201463a.\n\n[3] As the Illinois Supreme Court noted, during the hearings preceding the adoption of the ordinance, \"representatives of the Chicago law and police departments informed the city counsel that any limitations on the discretion police have in enforcing the ordinance would be best developed through police policy, rather than placing such limitations into the ordinance itself.\" 177 Ill. 2d, at 446, 687 N. E. 2d, at 58-59.\n\n[4] Presumably, these officers would also be able to arrest all nongang members who violate the ordinance.\n\n[5] Tr. of Oral Arg. 22-23.\n\n[6] The city began enforcing the ordinance on the effective date of the general order in August 1992 and stopped enforcing it in December 1995, when it was held invalid in Chicago v. Youkhana, 277 Ill. App. 3d 101, 660 N. E. 2d 34 (1995). Tr. of Oral Arg. 43.\n\n[7] Brief for Petitioner 16. There were 5,251 arrests under the ordinance in 1993, 15,660 in 1994, and 22,056 in 1995. City of Chicago, R. Daley & T. Hillard, Gang and Narcotic Related Violent Crime: 1993-1997, p. 7 (June 1998).\n\nThe city believes that the ordinance resulted in a significant decline in gang-related homicides. It notes that in 1995, the last year the ordinance was enforced, the gang-related homicide rate fell by 26%. In 1996, after the ordinance had been held invalid, the gang-related homicide rate rose 11%. Pet. for Cert. 9, n. 5. However, gang-related homicides fell by 19% in 1997, over a year after the suspension of the ordinance. Daley & Hillard, at 5. Given the myriad factors that influence levels of violence, it is difficult to evaluate the probative value of this statistical evidence, or to reach any firm conclusion about the ordinance's efficacy.

People with entirely legitimate and lawful purposes will not always be able to make their purposes apparent to an observing police officer. For example, a person waiting to hail a taxi, resting on a corner during a jog, or stepping into a doorway to evade a rain shower has a perfectly legitimate purpose in all these scenarios; however, that purpose will rarely be apparent to an observer.\" 177 Ill. 2d, at 451\u2014 452, 687 N. E. 2d, at 60-61.\n\n[15] It stated: \"Although the proscriptions of the ordinance are vague, the city council's intent in its enactment is clear and unambiguous. The city has declared gang members a public menace and determined that gang members are too adept at avoiding arrest for all the other crimes they commit. Accordingly, the city council crafted an exceptionally broad ordinance which could be used to sweep these intolerable and objectionable gang members from the city streets.\" Id., at 458, 687 N. E. 2d, at 64.\n\n[16] Brief for Petitioner 14.\n\n[17] In fact the city already has several laws that serve this purpose. See, e. g., Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720 \u00a7\u00a7 5/12-6 (1998) (intimidation); 570/405.2 (streetgang criminal drug conspiracy); 147/1 et seq. (Illinois Streetgang Terrorism Omnibus Prevention Act); 5/25-1 (mob action). Deputy Superintendent Cooper, the only representative of the police department at the Committee on Police and Fire hearing on the ordinance, testified that, of the kinds of behavior people had discussed at the hearing, \"90 percent of those instances are actually criminal offenses where people, in fact, can be arrested.\" Record, Appendix II to plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 182 (Tr. of Proceedings, Chicago City Council Committee on Police and Fire, May 18, 1992).\n\n[18] Brief for Petitioner 17.\n\n[19] See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23: \"We do not doubt that, under the Due Process Clause, individuals in this country have significant liberty interests in standing on sidewalks and in other public places, and in traveling, moving, and associating with others.\" The city appears to agree, at least to the extent that such activities include \"social gatherings.\" Brief for Petitioner 21, n. 13. Both Justice Scalia, post, at 83-86 (dissenting opinion), and Justice Thomas, post, at 102-106 (dissenting opinion), not only disagree with this proposition, but also incorrectly assume (as the city does not, see Brief for Petitioner 44) that identification of an obvious liberty interest that is impacted by a statute is equivalent to finding a violation of substantive due process. See n. 35, infra.\n\n[20] Petitioner cites historical precedent against recognizing what it describes as the \"fundamental right to loiter.\" Brief for Petitioner 12. While antiloitering ordinances have long existed in this country, their pedigree does not ensure their constitutionality. In 16th-century England, for example, the \"`Slavery acts' \" provided for a 2-year enslavement period for anyone who \"`liveth idly and loiteringly, by the space of three days.' \" Note, Homelessness in a Modern Urban Setting, 10 Ford. Urb. L. J. 749, 754, n. 17 (1982). In Papachristou we noted that many American vagrancy laws were patterned on these \"Elizabethan poor laws.\" 405 U. S., at 161-162. These laws went virtually unchallenged in this country until attorneys became widely available to the indigent following our decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). See Recent Developments, Constitutional Attacks on Vagrancy Laws, 20 Stan. L. Rev. 782, 783 (1968). In addition, vagrancy laws were used after the Civil War to keep former slaves in a state of quasi slavery. In 1865, for example, Alabama broadened its vagrancy statute to include \"`any runaway, stubborn servant or child' \" and \"`a laborer or servant who loiters away his time, or refuses to comply with any contract for a term of service without just cause.' \" T. Wilson, Black Codes of the South 76 (1965). The Reconstruction-era vagrancy laws had especially harsh consequences on African-American women and children. L. Kerber, No Constitutional Right to be Ladies: Women and the Obligations of Citizenship 50-69 (1998). Neither this history nor the scholarly compendia in Justice Thomas' dissent, post, at 102-106, persuades us that the right to engage in loitering that is entirely harmless in both purpose and effect is not a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.\n\n[21] The freewheeling and hypothetical character of Justice Scalia's discussion of liberty is epitomized by his assumption that citizens of Chicago, who were once \"free to drive about the city\" at whatever speed they wished, were the ones who decided to limit that freedom by adopting a speed limit. Post, at 73. History tells quite a different story.\n\nIn 1903, the Illinois Legislature passed \"An Act to regulate the speed of automobiles and other horseless conveyances upon the public streets, roads, and highways of the state of Illinois.\" That statute, with some exceptions, set a speed limit of 15 miles per hour. See Christy v. Elliott, 216 Ill. 31, 74 N. E. 1035 (1905). In 1900, there were 1,698,575 citizens of Chicago, 1 Twelfth Census of the United States 430 (1900) (Table 6), but only 8,000 cars (both private and commercial) registered in the entire United States. See Ward's Automotive Yearbook 230 (1990). Even though the number of cars in the country had increased to 77,400 by 1905, ibid., it seems quite clear that it was pedestrians, rather than drivers, who were primarily responsible for Illinois' decision to impose a speed limit.\n\n[22] The burden of the first portion of Justice Scalia's dissent is virtually a facial challenge to the facial challenge doctrine. See post, at 74-83. He first lauds the \"clarity of our general jurisprudence\" in the method for assessing facial challenges and then states that the clear import of our cases is that, in order to mount a successful facial challenge, a plaintiff must \"establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\" See post, at 78-79 (emphasis deleted); United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). To the extent we have consistently articulated a clear standard for facial challenges, it is not the Salerno formulation, which has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court, including Salerno itself (even though the defendants in that case did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them, see id., at 745, n. 3, the Court nevertheless entertained their facial challenge). Since we, like the Illinois Supreme Court, conclude that vagueness permeates the ordinance, a facial challenge is appropriate.\n\nWe need not, however, resolve the viability of Salerno `s dictum, because this case comes to us from a state\u2014not a federal\u2014court. When asserting a facial challenge, a party seeks to vindicate not only his own rights, but those of others who may also be adversely impacted by the statute in question. In this sense, the threshold for facial challenges is a species of third party (jus tertii) standing, which we have recognized as a prudential doctrine and not one mandated by Article III of the Constitution. See Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 955 (1984). When a state court has reached the merits of a constitutional claim, \"invoking prudential limitations on [the respondent's] assertion of jus tertii would serve no functional purpose.\" City of Revere v. Massachusetts Gen. Hospital, 463 U. S. 239, 243 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWhether or not it would be appropriate for federal courts to apply the Salerno standard in some cases\u2014a proposition which is doubtful\u2014state courts need not apply prudential notions of standing created by this Court. See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 618 (1989). Justice Scalia's assumption that state courts must apply the restrictive Salerno test is incorrect as a matter of law; moreover it contradicts \"essential principles of federalism.\" See Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and Federal Statutes, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 235, 284 (1994).\n\n[23] The Solicitor General, while supporting the city's argument that the ordinance is constitutional, appears to recognize that the ordinance cannot be read literally without invoking intractable vagueness concerns. \"[T]he purpose simply to stand on a corner cannot be an `apparent purpose' under the ordinance; if it were, the ordinance would prohibit nothing at all.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12-13.\n\n[24] 177 Ill. 2d, at 452, 687 N. E. 2d, at 61. One of the trial courts that invalidated the ordinance gave the following illustration: \"Suppose a group of gang members were playing basketball in the park, while waiting for a drug delivery. Their apparent purpose is that they are in the park to play ball. The actual purpose is that they are waiting for drugs. Under this definition of loitering, a group of people innocently sitting in a park discussing their futures would be arrested, while the `basketball players' awaiting a drug delivery would be left alone.\" Chicago v. Youkhana, Nos. 93 MCI 293363 et al. (Ill. Cir. Ct., Cook Cty., Sept. 29, 1993), App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a\u201449a.\n\n[25] See, e. g., Tacoma v. Luvene, 118 Wash. 2d 826, 827 P. 2d 1374 (1992) (upholding ordinance criminalizing loitering with purpose to engage in drug-related activities); People v. Superior Court, 46 Cal. 3d 381, 394-395, 758 P. 2d 1046, 1052 (1988) (upholding ordinance criminalizing loitering for the purpose of engaging in or soliciting lewd act).\n\n[26] See, e. g., State v. Richard, 108 Nev. 626, 627, n. 2, 836 P. 2d 622, 623, n. 2 (1992) (striking down statute that made it unlawful \"for any person to loiter or prowl upon the property of another without lawful business with the owner or occupant thereof\").\n\n[27] Brief for Petitioner 31.\n\n[28] In this way, the ordinance differs from the statute upheld in Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104, 110 (1972). There, we found that the illegality of the underlying conduct was clear. \"Any person who stands in a group of persons along a highway where the police are investigating a traffic violation and seeks to engage the attention of an officer issuing a summons should understand that he could be convicted under . . . Kentucky's statute if he fails to obey an order to move on.\" Ibid.\n\n[29] \"Literally read . . . this ordinance says that a person may stand on a public sidewalk in Birmingham only at the whim of any police officer of that city. The constitutional vice of so broad a provision needs no demonstration.\" 382 U. S.,at 90.\n\n[30] As we have noted in a similar context: \"If petitioners were held guilty of violating the Georgia statute because they disobeyed the officers, this case falls within the rule that a generally worded statute which is construed to punish conduct which cannot constitutionally be punished is unconstitutionally vague to the extent that it fails to give adequate warning of the boundary between the constitutionally permissible and constitutionally impermissible applications of the statute.\" Wright v. Georgia, 373 U. S. 284, 292 (1963).\n\n[31] This critical fact distinguishes this case from Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 329-330 (1988). There, we noted that the text of the relevant statute, read literally,may have been void for vagueness both on notice and on discretionary enforcement grounds. We then found, however, that the Court of Appeals had \"provided a narrowing construction that alleviates both of these difficulties.\" Ibid.\n\n[32] It is possible to read the mandatory language of the ordinance and conclude that it affords the police no discretion, since it speaks with the mandatory \"shall.\" However, not even the city makes this argument, which flies in the face of common sense that all police officers must use some discretion in deciding when and where to enforce city ordinances.\n\n[33] Justice Thomas' dissent overlooks the important distinction between this ordinance and those that authorize the police \"to order groups of individuals who threaten the public peace to disperse.\" See post, at 107.\n\n[34] Not all of the respondents in this case, for example, are gang members. The city admits that it was unable to prove that Morales is a gang member but justifies his arrest and conviction by the fact that Morales admitted \"that he knew he was with criminal street gang members.\" Reply Brief for Petitioner 23, n. 14. In fact, 34 of the 66 respondents in this case were charged in a document that only accused them of being in the presence of a gang member. Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, 58.\n\n[35] This conclusion makes it unnecessary to reach the question whether the Illinois Supreme Court correctly decided that the ordinance is invalid as a deprivation of substantive due process. For this reason, Justice Thomas, see post, at 102-106, and Justice Scalia, see post, at 85-86, are mistaken when they assert that our decision must be analyzed under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702 (1997).\n\n[1] In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge. See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495 (1982) (\"A plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others. A court should therefore examine the complainant's conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law\"); Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 756 (1974) (\"One to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness\").\n\nThe plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court \"entertained\" a facial challenge even though \"the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.\" Ante, at 55, n. 22. That is not so. The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that \"no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid,\" 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added). The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (\"Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case,\" id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challenge\u2014i. e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.\n\n[2] Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Court's statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 359, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed \"even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.\" Kolender seems to have confused the standard for First Amendment overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds. See ibid. (citing the Court's articulation of the standard for First Amendment overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494). As Salerno noted, supra, at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression. See, e. g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612 (1973).\n\n[3] The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge \"has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.\" Ante, at 55, n. 22. It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several. But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated. It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single application\u2014and hard to resist mentioning more than one.\n\nThe plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Court's opinion did here. Ante, at 55-56, n. 22. This is quite wrong. Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the \"standing\" question whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can. The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says \"all\" (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says \"many.\" That is not a question of standing but of substantive law. The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.\n\n[4] See, e. g., Abdullah v. Commissioner of Ins. of Commonwealth of Mass., 84 F. 3d 18, 20 (CA1 1996); Deshawn E. v. Safir, 156 F. 3d 340, 347 (CA2 1998); Artway v. Attorney Gen. of State of N. J., 81 F. 3d 1235, 1252, n. 13 (CA3 1996); Manning v. Hunt, 119 F. 3d 254, 268-269 (CA4 1997); Causeway Medical Suite v. Ieyoub, 109 F. 3d 1096, 1104 (CA5), cert. denied, 522 U.

Westark Community College, 160 F. 3d 435, 438-439 (CA8 1998); Roulette v.Seattle, 97 F. 3d 300, 306 (CA9 1996); Public Lands Council v. Babbitt, 167 F. 3d 1287, 1293 (CA10 1999); Dimmitt v.

FCC, 93 F. 3d 957, 972 (CADC 1996).\n\n[5] With apologies for taking creative license with the work of Messrs. Bernstein, Sondheim, and Laurents. West Side Story, copyright 1959.\n\n[6] The plurality's explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them carried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had \"harsh consequences on African-American women and children.\" Ante, at 54, n. 20. Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are certainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness of penalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering was never regarded as a fundamental liberty.\n\n[7] Ante, at 53, n. 19. The plurality bases its assertion of apparent concession upon a footnote in Part I of petitioner's brief which reads: \"Of course, laws regulating social gatherings affect a liberty interest, and thus are subject to review under the rubric of substantive due process . . . . We address that doctrine in Part II below.\" Brief for Petitioner 21-22, n. 13. If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term \"social gatherings\" in this passage with \"loitering,\" his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: \"[A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the court's novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.\" Id., at 39.\n\n[8] The plurality says, ante, at 64, n. 35, that since it decides the case on the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process, I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion \"under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg. \" Ibid. But I am not analyzing it under that framework. I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that \"the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause\" it does not believe that the same word (\"liberty\") means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process. There is no authority for that startling proposition. See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 572-575 (1972) (rejecting procedural-due-process claim for lack of \"liberty\" interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).\n\nThe plurality's opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the Fourteenth Amendment's august protection of \"liberty\" in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case law defining \"liberty,\" and substituting, instead, all \"harmless and innocent\" conduct, ante, at 58.\n\n[9] I call it a \"suggestion\" because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order \"compound the inadequacy of the notice,\" and acknowledges that they \"might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear.\" Ante, at 59, 59-60. This notion that a prescription (\"Disperse!\") which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mystery\u2014suspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet) .\n\n[10] \"Administrative interpretation and implementation of a regulation are . .. highly relevant to our [vagueness] analysis, for `[i]n evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must . . . consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.' \" Ward v.Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S.781, 795-796 (1989) (emphasis added) (quoting Hoffman Estates, 455 U. S., at 494, n. 5). See also id., at 504 (administrative regulations \"will often suffice to clarify a standard with an otherwise uncertain scope\").\n\n[11] Justice Breyer asserts that \"one always has some apparent purpose,\" so that the policeman must \"interpret the words `no apparent purpose' as meaning `no apparent purpose except for . . . .' \" Ante, at 70. It is simply not true that \"one always has some apparent purpose\"\u2014and especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest. Remaining at rest will be a person's normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move. That is why one frequently reads of a person's \"wandering aimlessly\" (which is worthy of note) but not of a person's \"sitting aimlessly\" (which is not remarkable at all). And that is why a synonym for \"purpose\" is \"motive\": that which causes one to move.\n\n[12] The Court speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Court's view) the ordinance is inapplicable\u2014viz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one. See ante, at 62. No one in his right mind would read the phrase \"without any apparent purpose\" to mean anything other than \"without any apparent lawful purpose.\" The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are \"lawful\" acts is routine. The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it \"has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .\" Ante, at 63. But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the ordinance a \"limiting\" interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.\n\n[13] The opinion that Justice Breyer relies on, Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611 (1971), discussed ante, at 72-73, did not say that the ordinance there at issue gave adequate notice but did not provide adequate standards for the police. It invalidated that ordinance on both inadequatenotice and inadequate-enforcement-standard grounds, because First Amendment rights were implicated. It is common ground, however, that the present case does not implicate the First Amendment, see ante, at 52-53 (plurality opinion); ante, at 72 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n\n[1] In 1996 alone, gangs were involved in 225 homicides, which was 28 percent of the total homicides committed in the city. Chicago Police Department, Gang and Narcotic Related Violent Crime, City of Chicago: 1993-1997 (June 1998). Nationwide, law enforcement officials estimate that as many as 31,000 street gangs, with 846,000 members, exist. U. S.

Tiedeman, Limitations of Police Power in the United States 116-117 (1886) (\"The vagrant has been very appropriately described as the chrysalis of every species of criminal. A wanderer through the land, without home ties, idle, and without apparent means of support, what but criminality is to be expected from such a person? If vagrancy could be successfully combated . . . the infractions of the law would be reduced to a surprisingly small number; and it is not to be wondered at that an effort is so generally made to suppress vagrancy\").

S. 270, 274-275 (1900); Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S. 116 (1958). The plurality claims that dicta in those cases articulating a right of free movement, see Williams, supra, at 274; Kent, supra, at 125, also supports an individual's right to \"remain in a public place of his choice.\" Ironically, Williams rejected the argument that a tax on persons engaged in the business of importing out-of-state labor impeded the freedom of transit, so the precise holding in that case does not support, but undermines, the plurality's view. Similarly, the precise holding in Kent did not bear on a constitutional right to travel; instead, the Court held only that Congress had not authorized the Secretary of State to deny certain passports. Furthermore, the plurality's approach distorts the principle articulated in those cases, stretching it to a level of generality that permits the Court to disregard the relevant historical evidence that should guide the analysis. Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 127, n. 6 (1989) (plurality opinion).\n\n[6] See, e. g., Ark.

The plurality purports to distinguish its sweeping condemnation of dispersal orders from Colten v.Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104 (1972), but I see no principled ground for doing so. The logical implication of the plurality's assertion is that the police can never issue dispersal orders. For example, in the plurality's view, itis apparently unconstitutional for a police officer to ask a group of gawkers to move along in order to secure a crime scene.\n\n[10] For example, a 1764 Georgia law declared that \"all able bodied persons . . . who shall be found loitering . . . , all other idle vagrants, or disorderly persons wandering abroad without betaking themselves to some lawful employment or honest labor, shall be deemed and adjudged vagabonds,\" and required the apprehension of \"any such vagabond . . . found within any county in this State, wandering, strolling, loitering about\" (reprinted in First Laws of the State of Georgia, Part 1, 376-377 (J. Cushing comp. 1981)). See also, e. g., Digest of Laws of Pennsylvania 829 (F. Brightly 8th ed. 1853) (\"The following described persons shall be liable to the penalties imposed by law upon vagrants . . . . All persons who shall . . . be found loitering\"); Ky. Rev. Stat., ch. CIV, \u00a7 1, p. 69 (1852) (\"If any able bodied person be found loitering or rambling about, . . . he shall be taken and adjudged to be a vagrant, and guilty of a high misdemeanor\").\n\n[11] The Court asserts that we cannot second-guess the Illinois Supreme Court's conclusion that the definition \"`provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering,' \"ante, at 61 (quoting 177 Ill.2d, at 457, 687 N. E. 2d, at 63). While we are bound by a state court's construction of a statute, the Illinois court \"did not, strictly speaking, construe the [ordinance] in the sense of defining the meaning of a particular statutory word or phase. Rather, it merely characterized [its] `practical effect' . . . .This assessment does not bind us.\" Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476, 484 (1993).Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1571957", "artist_names": "Eddie Floyd", "full_title": "Raise Your Hand by\u00a0Eddie\u00a0Floyd",

and my love makes me proud\nI need him, if he doesn't come back\nI know I'll surely die\n\nFind me a cloud that never brings you rain\nAnd I'll show you a man who never, ever brings you pain\nFind me a bird and if you can prove\nThat bird you've found has no wings but still can fly\nI'll show you a man who'll\nNever, never, ever, ever leave you high and dry\n\nAnother night when I'm all alone\nAnother night without him\nAnother night when I stay at home\nI worry so about him\n\nOh, I love him\nAnd my love makes me proud\nI need him, if he doesn't come back\nI'll die\n\nAnd he'll

sun\nNow the days are lonely\nThe song of love is still\nThey say that I'll forget you\nBut I say I never will\n\nAnd it hurts with such a pain\nTo be alone and lonely in the rain\nAnd it hurts with\nSuch a pain to be\nAlone and lonely in the rain\n\nChove chuva\nConstant is the rain\nChove chove chove chuva\nEndless is the painYou might also likeEmbed"}]
