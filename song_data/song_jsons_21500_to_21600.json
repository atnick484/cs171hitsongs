I brush my teeth and comb my hair\nThere's a big black cadillac parked on the street over there\n\nWell it's the finest lookin' car, that ever rolled of the line\nAny other car would just be wasting your time\nOoh one fine day I'm gonna make a cadillac mine\n\nI gotta get a cadillac\nLook at that cadillac, look at that\nLook at that cadillac, look at that\nRolling down the avenue, I'm gonna get me a cadillac too\nIf it's the last thing I do\nWell I got a job, down at the liquor store\nWell I got me a job down at the liquor store\nOooh I ain't lazy but I don't wanna work no more\n\nWhen I get my paycheck I put it right in the bank\nI'm putting all my money straight right in the bank\nWell I'm halfway to get my big black cadillac tank\n\nI gotta get a cadillac\nLook at that cadillac, look at that\nLook at that cadillac, look at that\nRolling down the avenue, I'm gonna get me a cadillac too\nIf it's the last thing I do\n\nSittin' in a bar knockin' 'm back\nUp pulls a big black cadillac\nOut steps a kitten, stand back cats\nAway I go in that cadillac\n\nLook at that cadillac, look at that\nLook at that cadillac, look at that\nRolling down the avenue, I'm gonna get me a cadillac too\nIf it's the last thing I do\n\nI gotta get a cadillac\nLook at that cadillac, look at that\nLook at that cadillac, look at that\nRock and rolling down the avenue, I'm gonna get me a

Sound of Goodbye LyricsWe kissed goodnight\nAnd we turn out the light\nAnd we lay side by side in the dark\nAnd we're waiting for sleep or a spark\n\nBut the night's on the run\nAnd the spark does not come\nAnd we quietly worry and wonder\nAnd the silence is louder than thunder\nAnd it rings with the sound of goodbye\nIt rings with the sound of goodbye\nI can't even tell you just why\nIt may be the truth or it may be a lie\nBut it sounds like the sound of goodbye\n\nWe can talk of the weather\nWe can talk of the news\nWe can talk of the talk of the town\nThere's another true love going down\n\nWe can talk about promises, talk about lies\nBut there's no use pointing our fingers\nAnd the sound of 'I love you' still lingers\nBut it rings with the sound of goodbye\n\nIt rings with the sound of goodbye\nI can't even tell you just why\nIt may be the truth or it may be a lie\nBut it sounds like the sound of goodbye\n\nTime is forever\nBut love is a fire\nAnd one day is one degree colder\nAnd the clock's tickin' over your shoulder\nAnd it ticks and it ticks, and it ticks and it ticks...\nYou might also likeAnd it ticks with the sound of goodbye\nI can't even tell you just

Kyjuan]\nI really hate to see her leave but I love to see her walk off\nImagine what her *oooo* looks like with her clothes off\nI'm rolling with the top off, see tops come off\nWhen the streetlights go off I heard shots go off\nI'm a humble show-off I'll be beating when I roll off\nPumping Jill Scott number seven in front of the seven-eleven\nGrab some magnum protection gonna be some sexin'\nWrap some hemp and L's its gonna be a session\nShe stressing the fact that we gotta stay at the best western\nI ain't cheap and that's on everything\nPut her pants to her knees don't take off everything\nI pay for her chains staying near her cain's\nSipping on her cane I'm forgetting everything\nMy name Kyjuan, yeah Kyjuan left none\nBoy she wouldn't have been with me if you wouldn't have left her\nI left her sexed her stressed her and left her\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]\nMy sex steno cus I'm taxing it I smack it a little\nStir it up like mother fuckin coffee then back to the middle\nLift over some pounds some way my hitters nod away\nYou damn near caught a Charlie-horse to make your dick stay in the hole\nOh we fuckin now pumping like all my pow\nAss up face down I'm going to town\nRound and round here I go pumping for nothing\nCus she wiggle and wiggle and wiggle just know when I'm coming\nI'm like *Ohhhh* I can't take it no more\nMove it one more time and watch my knees buckle\nShe tip drip type quit to get her dirty, hype, and aroused\nAlways see her nipples through her blouse *Owwww*\nWatch it wiggle just like the Harlem dance\nLook at all that ass in those *itty-bitty* pants\nDamn, hey Ms. Parker I make that ass come on down like Bob Barker\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\nBaby girl shake it like a paraplegic please believe it (Wooo)\nKnees bent, and back arched just how I need it\nCall her \"Billie Jean,\" I like the \"Thriller\" before I \"Beat It\"\nConceded when she shake it but I like it like that\nThrow it at me even harder just to see me react\nSee if it's wack, in fact see what Nelly about\nI thought that ass was a fluke until I went to her house\nYou see mama got ass too, her sister Keesha and Sue\nHer cousins, aunts and nieces start walking in by two\nLike who's trying to keep they composure now\nI'm feeling it can't nobody hold me down\nNobody told me how crazy groupies and coochies can get\nIn the back side under the stage trying to hit\nAnd I'm like \"Baby girl I ain't that kind of guy\"\nLet me at least let me go get a condom I ain't trying to die\nI might be high but I'm not that damn high!\nYou might also

smoking, passing the smirks\nPopping bottle after bottle I'm like \"Here we go again\"\nPosting it up in the club thinking \"Is he got a win\"\nMy chrome shoes went from Barry to Larry Hughes\nEmmitt's 22's now its Jordan's I cruise\nBut anyway Fo Sho I'm from the show me let me show you\nTo drunk and out of town trying to kiss you like I know you\nIn the middle of the dance floor caught the man's attention\nWiggle Wiggle do your thug's hydraulic suspension\nDid I mention long Ohhh, \"What the fuck is going on?\"\nYour body banging ma' I got to take you home\nCool lets break,

Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.\n\nMICHAEL: Really?\n\nJIM: Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?\n\nCut to Jim, talking to the camera\n\nJIM: Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.\n\nCut to the office\n\nDWIGHT: Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.\n\nCut back to Jim\nJIM: Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.\nCut back to Michael's office\n\nDWIGHT: OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?\n\nMICHAEL: Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.\n\nDWIGHT: OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.\n\nMICHAEL: You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.\n\nDWIGHT: [to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.\n\nMICHAEL: Nope, you cannot use it.\n\nDWIGHT: OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.\n\nMICHAEL: Temporary workspace. You can use it.\n\nDWIGHT: Thank you.\n\nMichael to the camera\n\nMICHAEL: If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.\n\nCut to Dwight handing out forms\n\nDWIGHT: What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.\n\nCut to Dwight in the conference room\n\nDWIGHT: In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, \"Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.\" Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.\n\nCut to the office\n\nSTANLEY: There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.\n\nPAM: (on the phone) Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.\n\nMICHAEL: [on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?\n\nPAM: Where are you?\n\nMICHAEL: Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. (playing with a model-truck) I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?\n\nPAM: Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...\n\nMICHAEL: Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.\n\nPAM: No you're not.\n\nMICHAEL: I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?\n\nPAM: OK.\n\nMICHAEL: Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.\n\nPAM: Still no one calling.\n\nPam and Jim enter the conference room\n\nPAM: Dwight, what...\n\nDWIGHT: Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.\n\nJIM: It says \"workspace\".\n\nDWIGHT: Same thing.\n\nJIM: If it's the same thing, then why did you write \"workspace\"?\n\nDWIGHT: Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.\n\nJIM: You are not my superior.\n\nDWIGHT: Oh gee, then why do I have an office?\n\nJIM: I thought it was a workspace?\n\nPAM: OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?\n\nDWIGHT: Yes. And my decision in final.\n\nPAM: This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.\n\nDWIGHT: Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.\n\nJIM: You cut more than you had to, didn't you?\n\nDWIGHT: Sure.\n\nJIM: Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?\n\nDWIGHT: Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.\n\nJIM: OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.\n\nDWIGHT: I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.\n\nPAM: Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?\n\nDWIGHT: So I can lower it.\n\nCut to the office\n\nOSCAR: He literally won't come out of his office.\n\nKEVIN: He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom. (laughs)\n\nANGELA: Kevin! That's inappropriate.\n\nCut to the bathroom, Oscar and Meredith are waiting outside\n\nOSCAR: Michael, can I talk to you?\n\nMICHAEL: Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?\n\nMEREDITH: Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?\n\nMICHAEL: Ah, what? Which memo?\n\nPAM: Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.\n\nMICHAEL: Is it a good plan?\n\nDWIGHT: It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.\n\nOSCAR: It's like a pay decrease.\n\nPAM: Michael, he made huge cuts.\n\nMICHAEL: Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?\n\nDWIGHT: Yeah, you said...\n\nMICHAEL: No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?\n\nDWIGHT: I can handle that.\n\nMICHAEL: OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?\n\nMichael walks into his office, Dwight walks into his \"workspace\"\n\nOSCAR: This is not good.\n\nANGELA: It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?\n\nOSCAR: What was that?\n\nANGELA: You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.\n\nKEVIN: What are you guys talking about?\n\nANGELA: Nothing, Kevin.\n\nMichael talks to the camera\n\nMICHAEL: Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, \"Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him.\n\nCut to the office, Dwight comes out of his office\n\nDWIGHT: OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.\n\nJIM: OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.\n\nDWIGHT: OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.\n\nJIM: Workspace.\n\nMichael talks to the camera\n\nMICHAEL: You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.\n\nWalks out of his office\n\nPAM: Where are you going?\n\nMICHAEL: Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob.\n\nCut to a traveling agency\n\nMICHAEL: So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.\n\nTRAVEL AGENT: I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?\n\nMICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...\n\nCut to the office, everyone is filling out forms\n\nJIM: Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.\n\nPAM: I'm inventing new diseases.\n\nJIM: Oh, great.\n\nPAM: So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?\n\nJIM: I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.\n\nPAM: Nice.\n\nJIM: Thank you.\n\nCut to Michael in his car\n\nMICHAEL: [on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.\n\nMan on Phone: You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.\n\nMICHAEL: It says here that it's a 300ft drop.\n\nMAN ON PHONE: It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.\n\nMICHAEL: So it's not a free fall?\n\nMAN ON PHONE: It's an industrial coal elevator.\n\nMICHAEL: Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?\n\nCut to Michael, talking to the camera\n\nMICHAEL: OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?\n\nCut to Dwight in his office\n\nDWIGHT: Damnit! Damnit Jim!\n\nStorms out\n\nDWIGHT: All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.\n\nJIM: What are you talking about?\n\nDWIGHT: Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.\n\nJIM: OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?\n\nDWIGHT: Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers.(Kevin laughs) Government-created killer nanorobot infection. (Stanley laughs)\n\nDWIGHT: You did this, didn't you?\n\nJIM: Absolutely not.\n\nDWIGHT: Yes you did.\n\nJIM: No I didn't.\n\nDWIGHT: I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!\n\nJIM: Killer nanorobots?\n\nPAM: It's an epidemic.\n\nCut to Dwight's office/workspace\n\nDWIGHT: The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] \"Count Choculitis\"\n\nJIM: Sounds tough.\n\nDWIGHT: Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?\n\nJIM: Do you?\n\nDWIGHT: I think you need to confess...\n\nJIM: Mmm hmm.\n\nDWIGHT: ...the fact...\n\nJIM: Yep.\n\nDWIGHT: What are you doing? Those are my keys.\n\nJIM: Good luck. [closes door and locks it]\n\nDWIGHT: Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]\n\nSTANLEY: [looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...\n\nJIM: [answering phone] Jim Halpert.\n\nDWIGHT: Let me out.\n\nJIM: Who is this?\n\nDWIGHT: Let me out or you're fired.\n\nJIM: No, you can't fire me.\n\nDWIGHT: Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.\n\nJIM: OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.\n\nPAM: [on phone] Hey, Jim. It's Pam.\n\nJIM: Hey Pam! How are you?\n\nDWIGHT: Jim! Open the door!\n\nPAM: Good, how are you? Busy?\n\nJIM: I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?\n\nDWIGHT: Jim!\n\nPAM: Um, I'm not bothering you, am I?\n\nJIM: No, not at all.\n\nPAM: You don't have anything you're doing?\n\nJIM: I have nothing to do.\n\nDWIGHT: Jim!\n\nPAM: Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.\n\nDWIGHT: Jim!\n\nJIM: Oh yeah?\n\nPAM: I might go to the mall.\n\nJIM: The mall?\n\nDWIGHT: Jim!\n\nPAM: I need new shoes.\n\nJIM: Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?\n\nCut to Dwight, who calls Jan\n\nJAN: Hello?\n\nDWIGHT: Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.\n\nJAN: This is Jan.\n\nDWIGHT: Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.\n\nJAN: Who is this?\n\nDWIGHT: Dwight Schrute.\n\nJAN: From sales?\n\nDWIGHT: Well...\n\nJAN: Where's Michael Scott?\n\nDWIGHT: He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.\n\nJAN: Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?\n\nDWIGHT: That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.\n\nJAN: Really?\n\nDWIGHT: Yeah.\n\nJAN: OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.\n\nDWIGHT: Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?\n\nJAN: No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.\n\nDWIGHT: Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]\n\nCut to Michael, entering the office\n\nMICHAEL: Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! (Phyllis almost catches it) Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? (Throws horrible) Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.\n\nRYAN: Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...\n\nMICHAEL: Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.\n\nSTANLEY: Oh, thanks.\n\nMICHAEL: There you go.\n\nSTANLEY: This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.\n\nMICHAEL: Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.\n\nDWIGHT: Michael. Michael?\n\nMICHAEL: [under his breath] Oh, Christ.\n\nMichael enters his office, Jim throws his ice cookie to Dwight's window\n\nCut to Dwight, talking to the camera\n\nDWIGHT: I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.\n\nCut to the conference room\n\nDWIGHT: I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.\n\nSTANLEY: What about confidentiality?\n\nDWIGHT: You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.\n\nMEREDITH: Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.\n\nDWIGHT: I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?\n\nMEREDITH: A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.\n\nCut to Michael, looking desperate while eating tons of ice cookies\n\nCut back\n\nDWIGHT: OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?\n\nKEVIN: That's a real thing.\n\nDWIGHT: Yeah, but no one here has it.\n\nKEVIN: Someone has it.\n\nSilence\n\nCut to the end of the day, everybody is waiting for Michael\n\nKEVIN: Do you think we should go ?\n\nOSCAR: I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.\n\nKEVIN: What is he doing?\n\nOSCAR: I don't know.\n\nMichael comes out\n\nOSCAR: Well?\n\nMICHAEL: Well, what? You could be referring to anything.\n\nOSCAR: OK, the health care plan.\n\nPAM: Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.\n\nMICHAEL: Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?\n\nDWIGHT: I most certainly did not.\n\nMICHAEL: Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.\n\nANGELA: What about the surprise?\n\nMICHAEL: Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?\n\nSTANLEY: We all think you don't have a surprise.\n\nMICHAEL: All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!\n\nSilence\n\nCut to Michael, talking to the camera\n\nMICHAEL: When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.\n\nCut back\n\nMICHAEL: [clapping hands] God, yeah... Ah! This...\n\nEveryone leaves,\n\nCut to Michael, talking to the camera\n\nMICHAEL: Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] \"Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.\" Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.\n\nCut back\n\nDWIGHT: Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.\n\nEND OF EPISODE2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1141067", "artist_names": "Hughes/Thrall", "full_title": "Beg, Borrow Or Steal

Tony. On behalf of myself and the coachline I'd like to thank you for choosing to drive with us today. I'm a local, I hope I can impart some local knowledge. If you've got any questions don't hesitate, just sing out. For those who are interested, there's the Old Bridge, swaying away. Replaced by the New Bridge in 1972. Funny thing, the Old Bridge used to be called the New Bridge. Yeah, bit of a funny thing. Up ahead there's the bronze of Bluey, a local sheepdog, who became a member of Regional Council. It was a bloody great day for dogs, not just here, but everywhere in the North Island. There's the town's oldest street. That's the Museum of Meat. There's the town's largest industry, that's the sock factory, hence the giant sock.\"\n\n*Sings* The town hall\nNote the mosaic wall\nWell, there are 5,600 tiles on that wall\nI know, I counted them all\nThe local school, the local swimming pool\nWhich was opened by the Governor General\nBack in 1952\nWhere I was caught with a friend aged 11, sniffing tractor fuel\nWe thought we were pretty cool, breaking them changing shed rules\nBut do you see up there?\nThe banner hanging in the air?\nThe Presbyterian Fair\nWell, I never go, there's too many Presbyterians there\nBut if you're interested, the fair's in the third weekend of August every year\nBut don't bother entering the raffle\nIt's always won by some kid of the Mayor\n\nDo you hear that sound?\nThe town clock, heard from anywhere in town\nUntil 1960, it was a little place in Norway\nWe bought it for a hundred pounds\nRumor has it they sold it cheap because the chimes were too loud\nBut every time I hear that sound it makes me so proud\n\nLook to your left, what a beautiful sight\nIt's Paula, Paula Thompson, nee Paula Wright\nLook at her hair, it's still gorgeous, even now\nFlowing like the Womahonga River\nWhich incidently, is to your right\nAnd it's the largest, in the area\nIn terms of volume\nEverybody, look at Paula, look at Paula Thompson\nI always thought I'd marry Paula\nBut some things just don't work out that way\nWell, that's the most important thing you'll learn on the tour today\nThat, and the fact there'll be a toilet break\nAt the information center near the manmade lake\nYou might also like*Speaking* \"Yeah, I'll just ask you one favor, if you do see Paula in town later on that you don't mention the details of the tour. I'd appreciate that. Same goes for my wife, Gloria. You'll recognize her, she looks a hell of a lot like Paula, actually. She often gets mistaken for Paula, but, um, well, she's not Paula, that's for sure, no.\"\n\n*Singing*\nPaula Thompson, born in '54\nTo a family of four\nTo the family next door\nTake me back next door\nPaula Thompson, nee Paula Wright\nThat's her old house, number 39\nNumber 41 was mine\nIf this old coach could go back in time\nI'd drive to 1979\nTake me back...\nTake me back, take me back\n(Take, take, take, take me back)\nTake me back, take me back\n(Take, take, take, take me back)\nTake me back, take me back, take me back, take me back, take me back, take me back...\n\n*Speaking* \"Yeah, sorry about that. I always get a little bit emotional on the corner of Rutherford and Brown Streets. But, um, that is truly the end of the tour, so mind your step, yeah, good on you.\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4635737", "artist_names": "Spys (Band)",

And then when I\u2019m up against people that I really admire, as I have been on this show, you know, sometimes it gets away from me. Just warning you in case things get really rubbish.\n\nEd: OK. Alright, OK.\nAdam: But before we go any further, can I fire off our quick-fire questions to you that I\u2019ve been asking all my guests the last few weeks. Answer any way you wish to these. Who are you?\n\nEd: Uh\u2026Edward O\u2019brien.\n\nAdam: What do you do?\n\nEd: I play guitar and I\u2019m a dad.\n\nAdam: Who do you do?\n\nEd: Who do you do? How do you do? [chuckles]\n\nAdam: Faves?\n\nEd: Faces? Uhh\u2026football? [chuckles]\n\nAdam: Worsties?\n\nEd: Worsties? Smelly cabs.\n\nAdam: Jedward?\n\nEd: X-factor?\n\nAdam: Thank you very much, Ed. That\u2019s all there is to it, there\u2019s no right or wrong way to respond to those questions.\nEd: Yeah, OK.\n\nAdam: Uhm how you doing anyway, how\u2019s the band?\n\nEd: Really good, we are in the studio at the moment. Well, not right this moment. We are in the heart of the record\n\nAdam: Yeah\n\nEd: And uhm, it\u2019s great, it feels, I\u2019m really excited, I feel like this is the best record [chuckles] I sound like one of those blokes, \u201cI think this is the best record we\u2019ve ever made\u201d but it really, it\u2019s genuinely exciting. It\u2019s very different from what we did last time. And uhm, yeah, it\u2019s just really nice to be doing this, it\u2019s so good to be making music with the band you feel is still as good as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nAdam: Yeah especially after the last record, \u201cIn Rainbows\u201d, you seemed to kind of completely reinvent yourselves and actually you seemed to turn a corner and start having a lot more fun as well. That\u2019s what it looked like from the outside looking in. Is that fair?\n\nEd: [chuckles] It wasn\u2019t fun making the record but what we decided was \u2013 making record\u2019s been hard, it\u2019s always been a slog. Traditionally, Radiohead in the studio has been kind of \u201cDon your tin helmet, get in there and just see it out\u201d, like a war of attrition.\n\nAdam: Yeah\n\nEd: And basically at the end of \u201cIn Rainbows\u201d it had taken 3 years to sort of come together. When we initially started off on our own and pulled in someone else and you know and after a year we worked with Nigel again.\n\nAdam: Nigel Godrich?\n\nEd: Nigel Godrich, yeah. And it was such a hard, it was such a slog, we know we had these songs, we really believed in these songs, so we had to do it right and it just took a long time. We basically then and there with the end of that record that we were never going to do it this way. That was kind of like the end of Radiohead mk 2 and we decided the only way that\u2019d work for us to carry on is to actually do it in a different spirit, you know, enjoy it.\n\nAdam: This is after \u201cHail to the Thief\u201d?\n\nEd: No, this is after \u201cIn Rainbows\u201d. Cause that was such a hard record to make.\nAdam: Cause it sounds so carefree\u2026\n\nEd: That\u2019s what everyone says, \u201cYou guys sound like you had great time in the studio!\u201d. Oh man\u2026\n\nAdam: It sounds like a summer\u2019s day.\n\nEd: That was a slog. I mean it was a really long process and by the end, for a instance, a song like, I don\u2019t know, \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d had been recorded 6 times,\n\nAdam: OK\n\nEd: Plus the fact we had a genius idea in 2006 to go out and tour. We did that 15-odd shows and the idea was we play these songs and then get back in the studio and record them. That\u2019s when we went back with Nigel and recorded them, having played them 15 times. We kind of got the arrangements sorted and we were like \u201cWe gotta get these down, we\u2019ve played them enough\u201d. And we got them down and they were, most of them were rubbish.\n\nAdam: Yeah.\n\nEd: You know, you just have to keep going.\n\nAdam: It\u2019s just so hard for a fan of a band to think about what it would be like for those songs to be rubbish. I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to hear a rubbish Radiohead song. Especially if I know those songs, I already like them, I know they\u2019re good songs, right? So I can\u2019t imagine what a rubbish version of them would be like. Why were they rubbish?\n\nEd: Uh, have you ever seen that Stones\u2019 documentary. Uhm, is it the Jean-Luc Godard one, Sympathy for the Devil?\n\nAdam: Oh yeah.\n\nEd: So they\u2019ve spent three days recording. It\u2019s brilliant seeing that as a person from a band. Day 1 and day 2, it\u2019s rubbish!\n\nAdam: Yeah.\n\nEd: You know, it\u2019s not until they get the conga player in, Keith\u2019s on bass. And then it gets, you know, 3 days later. I think that\u2019s the truth, I think you\u2019ll probably find that for lots of bands. I know I\u2019ve heard demos of bands. For instance, ages ago, when U2 did \u201cAchtung baby\u201d, there\u2019s a whole leaked tape of them basically just jamming and most of it\u2019s rubbish. And it\u2019s true, most of what you end up doing in the creative process is rubbish.\n\nAdam: Yeah.\n\nEd: And the art is to not give in, carry on and persevere.\n\nAdam: And to be hard on yourselves. Ed: Yeah! The great thing about Nigel is that he raises the bar.\n\nAdam: A hard man. I mean, I\u2019ve been on the wrong end of Nigel\u2019s taskmaster skills once or twice as well, that\u2019s quite scary.\n\nEd: He drives you hard and you think you\u2019ve done your take, you think you\u2019ve done your overdub, you think it\u2019s in there, but [he says] \u201cMaybe one more?\u201d\n\n[both laugh]\n\nAdam: He\u2019s the guy that told Macca off for not being good enough.\n\nEd: [laughs] But that\u2019s why he\u2019s so good! You know, he gets the best performances out of you, he\u2019s amazing. He also drives himself really hard, as well. The quality of the stuff he does is really high. So it\u2019s good, it\u2019s actually, to be driven hard.\n\nAdam: So have you any idea when this album might see the light of day? The current one?\n\nEd: No, but ideally, it would be great if it came out some time this year, it\u2019s got to, I mean, I hope so.\n\nAdam: And do you think you\u2019re weeks away or months away from completion? I mean, you can\u2019t say, I guess.\n\nEd: I can\u2019t really say. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s like that when you make anything, a film or whatever, write a book: for ages and ages it seems like the finishing line is miles away. And now it feels it\u2019s in touching distance. But, of course, it being a creative process, this last bit, it\u2019s like a burst of energy, you know, you achieve a lot in small period of time. And then sometimes things slow down and you are nearly there, you are nearly there. You know, you get the point. Yeah, hopefully, it\u2019s gonna be a matter of weeks.\n\nAdam: Excellent. Let\u2019s listen to some of the music you\u2019ve brought in right now. And this is a track from Deodato. I don\u2019t know anything about this band, all I know about them is that they provided the opening titles for \u201cBeing there\u201d, the Peter Sellers movie.\n\nEd: Yeah, that\u2019s where I first heard this track. \u201cBeing There\u201d is one of my all-time favourite films.\n\nAdam: It\u2019s an amazing film.\n\nEd: Isn\u2019t it? And when he leaves the house into the big wide world and he is walking down Washington DC, lost, and this music comes on. I didn\u2019t know anything about him, Deodato was Brazilian, I think, and in the band he had, like, a young funky guitarists who\u2019s a bit of a prodigy and they had Stanley Clarke, the ubermeister, the funkmeister, on bass.\n\nAdam: Well, we can hear it bubbling away underneath us. We won\u2019t play the whole thing cause it\u2019s a bit of an epic, but here\u2019s a nice\u2026\n\n[music]\n\nAdam: Deodato there with \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d by Richard Strauss. How you doing, ladies and gentlemen? Welcome, we are flailing in space. This is Adam Buxton here, this is my big mixtape \u201c2010: a tape odyssey\u201d and my guest is Ed O\u2019Brien from Radiohead. Ed: Hello. Again.\n\nAdam: He\u2019s the tall, handsome one, plays the guitar and he has many pedals on stage. Is that fair?\n\nEd: Lots of pedals.\n\nAdam: You love your pedals\n\nEd: I love pedals, man.\n\nAdam: Absolutely love them.\n\nEd: I\u2019ve got more as well.\n\nAdam: Listen, before we get into that, on the \u201c2001\u201d tip there, as we were \u2013 have you ever heard The Portsmouth Sinfonia\u2019s version of that track?\n\nEd: [chortle] No.\n\nAdam: Do you know about The Portsmouth Sinfonia?\n\nEd: Nothing.\n\nAdam: Well this is something Brian Eno was involved with, one of the many wonderful perverse art projects that he\u2019s undertaken in his life. And this is around 1970 in the Portsmouth\u2019s school of art. And the idea was that it was an orchestra comprised of non-musicians. And if they were musicians, then you had to play an instrument that was entirely new to you, OK? So it was a completely na\u00efve orchestra, if you will. You can imagine the noise they created was quite bizarre. And the project was, they had to play as well as they possibly could, they couldn\u2019t do, like, jokey playing. In fact, Brian Eno said that at one point they had one guy that came in and he thought it was a big joke and he was sort of making funny honking noises and they had to boot him out cause he wasn\u2019t taking it seriously. But this is what they sounded like doing \u201c2001\u201d there, the \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d\n\n[music starts playing]\n\nEd: [laughs]\n\n[music continues]\n\nAdam: The tympani\u2018s good.\n\nEd: [chuckling] The sound of the bagpipes [imitates a bagpipe]. Wait.\n\nAdam: Here it comes.\n\n[music reaches climax, Ed and Adam laugh]\n\nAdam: There was no way they were ever going to get that one.\n\nEd: [laughs] No.\n\nAdam: This is the thing, the thing is, it\u2019s particularly effective with brass instruments cause they are so hard to play.\n\nEd: So hard. I played the trumpet for four years.\n\nAdam: Did you?\n\nEd: Yeah and I was rubbish at it after 4 years, it\u2019s really hard.\n\nAdam: Wow.\n\nEd: It\u2019s not like picking up a guitar where you can strum a chord.\n\nAdam: You can make yourself sound decent in a day\n\n[music continues in the background, Adam and Ed laugh]\n\nAdam: Ah man, you gotta love Brian Eno.\n\nEd: Brilliant, good man.\n\nAdam: You, of course, worked with Eno. You spent a day in the studio, did he not sort of oversee the creation of either \u201cLucky\u201d or \u201cThe Tourist\u201d? Or the War Child album?\n\nEd: Ah, no. He wasn\u2019t. We have never worked with him.\n\nAdam: Have you not? Or what was the deal with the War Child album? Was that something he kind of wrote you into?\n\nEd: Yeah. Isn\u2019t he the patron of War Child?\n\nAdam: Oh yeah.\n\nEd: And he started it up and it was actually a brilliant idea. One of those great moments, when you look back on it, that whole thing of everybody doing a track a day and it was really exciting. Brian Eno, actually, when we were making \u201cOK Computer\u201d \u2013 here\u2019s a bit of trivia \u2013 there\u2019s a track on the album called \u201cLet Down\u201d and we finished it quite early on and we sent it off for him to mix it.\n\nAdam: And what did he come back with? He sort of tried out? You were sort of thinking \u201cLet\u2019s see what Brian Eno comes up with.\u201d?\n\nEd: Well, I think the thing was, it was Nigel\u2019s first big, first album and I think he was kinda quite up for someone else to\u2026 Maybe it was the fashion in those days\u2026sometimes you get someone in to mix it. You know, The Bends and Pablo Honey. \u201cThe Bends\u201d had been recorded and produced by John Leckie, mixed by Slade and Kolderie. So there was a trend for people to mix stuff. And I remember thinking we thought the track was appropriate for maybe kind of Eno\u2019s, it was a big sort of, big beautiful kind of stellar track, that it might suit him. And, you know, it\u2019s very difficult to mix something you have no idea of what the band wants.\n\nAdam: Cause the final mix on the album is not his.\n\nEd: No, Nigel mixed the whole lot and, you know, Nigel\u2019s the ubermixer, he\u2019s amazing.\n\nAdam: He\u2019s a massive doo-wop, Eno, isn\u2019t it?\n\nEd: He is, he\u2019s a big doo-wop fan.\n\nAdam: So, did he try any of his doo-wop backing vocals on there?\n\nEd: [laughs] No, no he hasn\u2019t. But there are apparently many stories of Brian Eno doing sessions and sort of coming in and adding some doo-wop vocals to some fairly unlikely tunes.\n\nAdam: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah man, I\u2019ve always liked a bit of Eno\u2019s doo-wop. He\u2019s a big fan of backing vocals, obviously. He believes strongly that a great song always has a sort of harmony backing vocal that you can sing along with. And that\u2019s the enjoyable thing for the listener, I find that all the time that I like to the high harmony parts in the car.\n\nEd: Yeah, you are like my mum.\n\nAdam: Right. And that\u2019s your job in Radiohead when you are playing live, of course, is to do those high harmonies. And so when you are in the car do you find yourself carrying on, you know, when you are not at work?\n\nEd: Yeah, you know, I think the backing vocals thing is great. To me, if I\u2019m honest, up until recently, I\u2019ve found them pretty tricky because Thom had usually sung them in the studio so he\u2019s got a much higher range than I have and he\u2019s got a much better voice than I have. I remember in the OK Computer-era sort of going on stage and doing backing vocals and [imitates absent-minded harmonising]. You know, not really going for it cause I was self-conscious I wasn\u2019t actually doing the job properly.\n\nAdam: Cause the first time I saw you play I was really struck by how similar your voices sounded and, I guess, \u201cNo Surprises\u201d is the one where it\u2019s a very, very distinctive harmony that comes in at the end there. And I was knocked out, I was like \u201cWow, he can really sing!\u201d.\n\nEd: Oh, really?\n\nAdam: And it sounded, I\u2019ve always assumed that it was Thom doing the vocal parts on the album.\n\nEd: Yeah, he does. I mean, I\u2019ve done very little vocal parts on recording cause it\u2019s, I guess it\u2019s a confidence thing. I mean, Thom\u2019s got such an amazing voice, I mean he can go and [snaps fingers] he just gets those backing vocals out and you might be an hour later with me.\n\nAdam: But live it sounds just amazing.\n\nEd: Well, I love it. I really love singing, basically, I really love singing. Once you get the confidence and love something, then it becomes easy, you relax, you get the notes, you know.\n\nAdam: Man, I wanna talk to you about the whole business of playing live and touring in just a second, but let\u2019s have some more music now. This is another track that you\u2019ve brought in with you, Ed, tell us about this one.\n\nEd: This track is \u201cInto the Sun\u201d by Diplo and Martina Topley-Bird and, in fact, the first time I ever heard this one was on the tour bus about three years ago, Thom played this track.\n\nAdam: I know Martina Topley-Bird, I don\u2019t know Diplo.\n\nEd: You know that track \u201cPon de Floor\u201d?\n\nAdam: Oh, sure, Major Lazer.\n\nEd: Yeah, he\u2019s one half of Major Lazer. He\u2019s very talented, used to go out with M.I.A. He basically programmed, he did a lot of music on Paper Planes. And he\u2019s a wiz, he\u2019s brilliant and Martina Topley-Bird is obviously brilliant, she sang on Maxinquaye\n\nAdam: She was Tricky\u2019s muse, for a while, wasn\u2019t she?\n\nEd: Ahh, she\u2019s amazing. And her voice is just, you know\u2026\n\n[music]\n\nAdam: That was \u201cInto the Sun\u201d by Diplo featuring Martina Topley-Bird. Hey, how you doing, this is Adam Buxton here, thanks for listening to my big mixtape this afternoon, my guest is Ed O\u2019Brien from Radiohead. How you doing , Ed?\n\nEd: I\u2019m good, man.\n\nAdam: Very nice to see you. We were talking before about the whole business of playing and singing live and stuff like that. I mean, how long have you been at it now?\n\nEd: Well, we\u2019ve been a band since, uh, 1985.\n\nAdam: 1985? That was a long time ago.\n\nEd: That was a long time ago. The summer of Live Aid.\n\nAdam: Good one.\n\nEd: Yes.\n\nAdam: And when you formed then you were called\u2026?\n\nEd: On a Friday.\n\nAdam: On a Friday. And at some point you were called something like Worley Gig or something?\n\nEd: [chuckles] You want a full run-down?\n\nAdam: Yeah, come on.\n\nEd: OK. Try not to laugh too hard. Then we became Dearest.\n\nAdam: Dearest? Who\u2019s idea was that?\n\nEd: I dunno, I shouldn\u2019t attribute the blame, I think that was Thom\u2019s\u2026and then there was [laughing] Shindig.\n\nAdam: [laughing] Shinding?! What the hell was that? Were you going through like a Poe\u2019s phase or something?\n\nEd: I think one of the things was, we were sort of\u2026there was a bit of an Irish phase going on [laughing hard]. Phil had an Irish girlfriend at the time.\n\nAdam: That\u2019s a laugh, isn\u2019t it?\n\nEd: Yeah, and we were\u2026the worst song was, there was a song called \u201cWise Up\u201d.\n\nAdam: \u201cWise Up\u201d? I\u2019ve never heard of \u201cWise Up\u201d.\n\nEd: \u201cWise Up\u201d was like a Northern-Irish kind of phrase, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wise up?\u201d, but of course it was at the same time as Happy Mondays so it was bit flowered up, so it was kind of quite clever, really.\n\nAdam: It\u2019s more like some kind of Janet Street-Porter youth show, \u201cCome on, wise up!\u201d, a little bit of rapping in the middle.\n\nEd: Yeah, exactly.\n\nAdam: Shinding is my favourite.\n\nEd: Shinding, terrible.\n\nAdam: [in a mock announcer-voice] Ladies and gentlemen: Shindig! [mimics jolly trumpets]\n\nEd: The thing is, stylistically, at that time, we were all over the shop , you know. I mean, we were literally playing the music that we loved and we loved everything so there was a track that sounded like Elvis Costello, there\u2019d be the track that was an homage to the Smiths, there was a\u2026Do you remember Steve Earle\u2019s Copperhead Road?\n\nAdam: U-huh, sure.\n\nEd: One summer, Phil went to Northern Ireland to, you know, to be with his girlfriend so we got another friend in to play. And Nigel\u2019s a bit more of a rock drummer, you know, more kind of four-on-the-floors and stick-twiddling kind of thing and suddenly we were, like, country rock. So it was kind of, you know, you kind of have to go down all those different avenues or country lanes in our case.\n\nAdam: Absolutely. I mean, one of the impressive and heartening things about Radiohead is that, apparently by sheer dint of hard work and tenacity and perspicaciousness, whatever the right word is, you have turned yourselves into a good band from fairly inauspicious beginnings if you don\u2019t mind me saying so. Do you think that\u2019s fair?\n\nEd: Yeah, you know, I mean. OK, so when we first started I thought we were the best band in the world. I remember there was this feeling of, you know, 1985, probably about 3rd rehearsal, I remember thinking \u201cGod, this is amazing!\u201d. Then, of course, 6 years later, you get your record deal, you get signed and you make a record and you still think you are really good. And then you make a record and it\u2019s not great. And we hadn\u2019t got our chops together. For instance, when were signed, it was the Nirvana, you know, post-Stone Roses. People were saying, you know, one record company said: \u201cSo, uh, what\u2019s your agenda? What\u2019s your manifesto?\u201d. And were like: \u201cUhh, music?\u201d. So we sort of stumbled, you know. Image-wise we looked terrible, you know, we didn\u2019t think these things were important and I guess that\u2019s fairly na\u00efve and of course they\u2019re important, you know, how you look and how you present yourself. We were fairly shambolic in the early days and I think the whole experience of \u201cPablo Honey\u201d and then \u201cCreep\u201d getting really big in America, you know, finding ourselves in the public eye, looking shambolic. We knew we had to get our stuff together. And, so, who do we look towards? The coolest band at the time \u2013 and they\u2019re still very cool \u2013 were Massive Attack, as far as we were concerned. \u201cOK, we need to reappraise things\u201d, it wasn\u2019t a very conscious thing, we knew we had to do it differently, so it was kind of like, the big thing, I think, was doing the videos. It was, for \u201cThe Bends\u201d, getting Jake Scott to do \u201cFake Plastic Trees\u201d and \u201cStreet Spirit\u201d. At that time, the video could really define you as well, so that really helped.\n\nAdam: I remember being sort of aware of Radiohead and aware of Pablo Honey. I remember sort of seeing those posters with the baby, thinking \u201cWhat the hell is that\u2026\u201d. And I remember then a friend of mine, Louis Theroux in fact, who was a guest on this show, sort of said, \u201cYou into Radiohead?\u201d. And I went, \u201cNot really\u2026\u201d. And he said: \u201cOh, you should check out this album \u201cThe Bends\u201d that\u2019s come out, it\u2019s good\u201d. And I said: \u201cReally? Is it?\u201d. And he gave me a tape and I didn\u2019t listen to it for ages. Then I was on a holiday in France, it was kind of a grim holiday, just me and my dad, wandering around, wondering what we were doing. And on one long drive, I thought: \u201cHang on, let\u2019s listen to this thing Louis\u2019 given me. And, instantly, \u201cPlanet Telex\u201d comes on and you think \u201cOh, OK, this is quite different and this is good, this is what they call \u201cwidescreen music\u201d on press releases. Track after track you think \u201cHey, this is, uh, I don\u2019t know which part of me it\u2019s speaking to, but it\u2019s speaking very loudly to it.\u201d\n\nEd: Well, we knew, after Pablo Honey, I remember my dad, who\u2019s a always a great arbiter, he said: \u201cOne good song on \u201cPablo Honey\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cCreep\u201d, rest of it\u2019s\u2026you know\u2026\u201d. And, you know, that\u2019s maybe a little harsh, but basically when we did \u201cThe Bends\u201d we knew that the idea was that 12 songs, every song had to be kind of a single. It had to be. Cause we were losing momentum and we were losing momentum fast. \u201cCreep\u201d held us in there, but, you know, for bands, when you\u2019re young, it\u2019s inertia and momentum. If you are losing it, if you are going down, everyone can sniff it, anyone can. And they want it. They wanted to see us fail, you know, we were five minor-public school boys from Oxfordshire. We weren\u2019t liked by the Melody Maker, NME and the reviews were terrible and they were probably justified, but they did not really like anything about us. Except, you know, people liked \u201cCreep\u201d and that kept us in there. So we kinda got one chance and that was our chance, the record. \u201cLucky\u201d was brilliant and that was when we met Nigel cause he was the engineer on that session.\n\nAdam: So it all started coming together?\n\nEd: Yeah.\n\nAdam: And was that a fun time? Was that a hopefully time or were you all just dragged down by, did you just think: \u201cListen, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be doing this?\u201d?\n\nEd: Not really, it wasn\u2019t fun. I mean, the thing that was always there was when we were touring \u201cPablo Honey\u201d with these songs that Thom had written, we knew that they were very special , you know, cause we were playing a lot of them live. We must\u2019ve been mid-20s so you know you want to things in a certain way, you know you want to, but you don\u2019t have the confidence to see it through. So, for instance, when we first went to the studio [for \u201cThe Bends\u201d], it was the last time the record company really told us what to do, at EMI. They said: \u201cWe want you to record these five songs upfront, we think they might be potential singles.\u201d. So there was \u201cJust\u201d and there was \u201cSulk\u201d and it was disastrous, cause it put all this pressure on us to get it right. You don\u2019t enter a recording session like that, you enter it like, you just do it, you know, it pans out, it evolves naturally. But we weren\u2019t in the position to say \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to do that\u201d, so it was a bit fraught. What happened was that we had about 6-7 weeks in the studio in London and, we didn\u2019t abort the sessions, but we thought \u201cRight, what we need to do is get out on the road\u201d and we went out on the road and basically played all these songs live, came back in and did them live, most of them live, in about three weeks at The Manor, a studio outside Oxford. And I guess it was just very, very lucky. We kept on doing, we kept on going and that was the key.\n\nAdam: Yeah, keep your head down. We\u2019re gonna skip ahead, musically, to \u201cOK Computer\u201d , one of the b-sides that came out for, I think, \u201cKarma Police\u201d. That was an album that, obviously, meant a lot to a huge amount of people, continues to mean a lot to an awful lot of people, that\u2019s when I met my wife, that year, 1997. It was so intense, there was so much good music around and when that album came out and every one of those tracks spoke to me. And then there was this instrumental on the \u201cKarma Police\u201d single and I thought \u201cWow, this is the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever heard!\u201d. I\u2019ve found out since that you\u2019re responsible for it, it was \u201cMeeting in the Aisle\u201d. Am I right in saying that that\u2019s the only instrumental Radiohead have ever done?\n\nEd: Yeah, I think it\u2019s the only instrumental. I mean, I\u2019m only responsible for coming up with the original riff, the music, but I wasn\u2019t responsible for the production of the track. Nigel and, you know, we all worked on that. I think that came out of St Catherine\u2019s Court, Jane Seymour. Late at night, you know, fooling around with my pedals as usual and then up with this riff and sampled it. Sam and Henry, who are basically Zero 7, they did the drum programming on that. I like this track cause it conveys that feeling of what it was like around that time, there\u2019s a whole element of, you are almost in like a trance just doing this stuff, you are going through this bubble. \u201cOK Computer\u201d was amazing, but it was sort of the same, the eye of the storm was getting bigger and bigger and bigger. It was a magic time, don\u2019t get me wrong. For me, this always sums up this \u2013 what\u2019s the word? \u2013 progression, movement and being quite spaced out. Naturally.\n\nAdam: This is \u201cMeeting in the Aisle\u201d.\n\n[music]\n\nAdam: That\u2019s \u201cMeeting People [sic] in the Aisle\u201d from Radiohead, there. My guest is Ed O\u2019Brien from the band. Let me take you back to the time, if you don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m thinking of the documentary \u201cMeeting People is Easy\u201d, directed by Grant Gee. That is basically painting a picture of band around the \u201cOK Computer\u201d touring time. And you look as if you are under a lot of pressure. Both sort of external pressure from critics and things, becoming successful, and also sort of internal pressure about how to actually deal with that. Do you think, when you see that film \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen it since \u2013 do you think it was sort of exaggerated, the feeling of claustrophobia and imminent implosion or was that a fairly accurate portrait?\n\nEd: It was very accurate when Grant was out there with us. And he happened to \u2013I mean, I don\u2019t know what it was \u2013 but he happened to be around the moments when it all got a little hairy. I mean, there were lighter moments, you know. The Japanese stuff was followed by a glorious tour of Australia. But it was just one of those things, it was growing pains. I think we wanted to be in that situation, but we weren\u2019t very good at handling it. We were basically collectively quite shy, individually we were quite shy. We weren\u2019t very well prepared for it. But it was all good.\n\nAdam: Cause I remember thinking, like, \u201cOh no, this band is not gonna last, they\u2019re just gonna fold. This lead singer, he\u2019s writing these songs from his heart, suddenly he\u2019s got all these fans who feel like he\u2019s communicating directly with them, there\u2019s all that unbelievable pressure from a group of unusually emotional and intelligent fans, I would characterise Radiohead fans as being \u2013myself included, of course. But that must continue to be a huge pressure for all the members of the band. Or is it not?\n\nEd: Not really, I mean it was pressure on Thom around that time. Hence you see the shift to \u201cKid A\u201d.\n\nAdam: Withdrawing a little?\n\nEd: Withdrawing, that\u2019s right. And I think, what\u2019s interesting about \u201cIn Rainbows\u201d, I remember at the time and I think it was brought on by Thom doing \u201cThe Eraser\u201d. When Thom did \u201cThe Eraser\u201d the vocals were, for the first time in a long time, for the first time since \u201cOK Computer\u201d, they were upfront. And that was a big thing on \u201cIn Rainbows\u201d. Suddenly, there was something very tangible to hold on to. It was a, you know, a security thing, to remain intact, he withdrew. \u201cKid A\u201d is what it is, cause it was a reaction for what went on before. And I think, precisely as you said, it doesn\u2019t sit comfortably; suddenly people are latching to every single word you\u2019re writing and taking them to heart and personalizing them. That\u2019s a strong load to bear.\n\nAdam: That\u2019s a lot of responsibility. And the flipside of that, of course, is that when you\u2019re so visible and successful you get a lot of people saying \u201cCome on, they\u2019re not THAT good!\u201d and \u201cWhy won\u2019t they stop whining?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s so wrong with being successful? If you don\u2019t like it, stop doing it.\u201d Were there bits of criticism that remain with you to this day? Things that either fans or critics said about the band that you thought \u201cUhh, that hurts\u2026\u201d?\n\nEd: [chortle] Not really. The only thing [laughing], the only thing that comes into my mind is how a really good friend of mine said \u201cListen, mate, you gotta check out this website.\u201d And, I mean, I never, I never ever, I don\u2019t read our reviews, I stopped reading them around the time of \u201cKid A\u201d, I don\u2019t see us, I don\u2019t listen to us, you know, because it makes you too self-conscious. And he directed me, the only bit of criticism, he directed me to this website. And it was about how I was the worst-dressed member of Radiohead [laughing]. And I looked at it and said \u201cYeah, they\u2019re right, aren\u2019t they? They\u2019re really right!\u201d.\n\nAdam: Around about when was this?\n\nEd: Oh this was about 2003. I mean it\u2019s very superficial. I know you say people say we whine. I mean, life isn\u2019t necessarily a bed of roses wherever you are. And I think that in those days we were struggling with a lot of things, we were struggling with ourselves. So it\u2019s, you know, fine.\n\nAdam: Struggling with universal things. People latch on to the music and that\u2019s why it means so much to them.\n\nEd: Exactly. Totally. I mean, we\u2019ve always been honest. Nigel said to us in the early days: \u201cGod, you guys are like method actors.\u201d We\u2019d have to get in to the right collective mind space and it would come out. But it wasn\u2019t a conscious thing, it wasn\u2019t putting it on as it was. I think we were sort of very lucky. I think it\u2019s still true to that, the only way you can make music is to be honest. The only way music is good is if it honestly reflects where you are as an individual and as a collective and that\u2019s always been the case and it has to carry on being the case. Otherwise you get into dreadful kind of scenarios where you are kind of second-guessing what people want and you shouldn\u2019t be like this.\n\nAdam: Absolutely. Just before we play some more music, you mentioning being called \u201cbadly dressed\u201d, there, by someone. I mean, that\u2019s harsh, I think of you as being very sartorially correct on stage these days.\n\nEd: Well, I\u2019ve made an effort over the last 4 years [laughing]. And they were right, all these pictures, with captions like \u201cWhat are those trousers?!\u201d, \u201cWhat the hell was going on?\u201d.\n\nAdam: What were you wearing, like salmon-pink cords or something?\n\nEd: No, they were like, they were quite ill-fitting, cause I\u2019m quite tall so I would get things that didn\u2019t quite fit so maybe they were a little bit short, you know.\n\n[both laughing]\n\nAdam: Mr Bean!\n\nEd: Yes, exactly!\n\nAdam: And are there times when you are all in your dressing rooms or whatever before a gig and then everyone convenes for whatever the Radiohead version of the band hug is, before you go on stage and look at what someone else is wearing and you think [imitates a sad trumpet]. \u201cDo we mention it or\u2026?\u201d\n\n[both laugh]\n\nEd: In the early days, certainly. I mean, we don\u2019t have individual dressing rooms, we still have ours. Now it\u2019s kind of funny, the more time you hang out with people the more you sort of morph into looking the same, we\u2019ve been saying that recently. Certainly in the early days, there was a waistcoat that Colin used to wear \u2013 he\u2019ll kill me for mentioning it. And everyone would look at me constantly and I knew there would be raised eyebrows like \u201cThose trousers and two inches too short but we\u2019re not gonna tell him!\u201d [laughing]\n\n[music]\n\nAdam: That was called \u201cHawaii in 10 seconds\u201d, before that you heard Plone.\n\n[music]\n\nAdam: Scott Walker, there. I think we\u2019ve played almost every track from Scott on \u201cThe Big Mixtape\u201d. That\u2019s what you\u2019re listening to, incidentally. Hey, I\u2019m Adam Buxton, thank you so much for tuning in, listeners. This week, our fictional compilation is space-themed tape, it\u2019s called \u201c2010: A Tape Odyssey\u201d and my guest, who chose that last track, incidentally, is Ed O\u2019Brien from Radiohead. How you doing, Ed?\n\nEd: Very well, thank you.\n\nAdam: I\u2019ve got some questions from some of the people who\u2019ve been blogging and logging into the blog, doing some bloglogs. We were over-whelmed with questions, let me say, when people found out that you were going to be on the show so apologies to anyone out there who doesn\u2019t have their question read out. Here\u2019s one from James, he says, \u201cEd, after saying many of your concerts, I noticed that unlike Jonny, Thom or Colin, you seem to use a wide range of guitars. I see Strats, Tellies, Gibsons and the Plank flying on and off stage. Which one\u2019s your favourite or do you not get attached to guitars in that way?\u201d What\u2019s the Plank?\n\nEd: The Plank was built by Peter Plank, our chief back-line. Plank\u2019s been with us forever, since \u00b493, he looks after\u2026he\u2019s in the studio with us, looks after all our gear. He built be a guitar in \u00b493 and then we had all our gear nicked in \u00b495 when we were on tour in America and he built another one. It\u2019s a very beautiful kind of a Rickenbacker-Gibson hybrid that he built and, yeah, it\u2019s lovely.\n\nAdam: And do you have favourites?\n\nEd: Yeah. He\u2019s right, I play way too many guitars on stage and I\u2019m stripping it down, next time we go out: two guitars, Gibson 335 and a Fender Telly, that\u2019s all I\u2019ll use.\n\nAdam: And a lot of pedals.\n\nEd: Lots of pedals\u2026No! I\u2019m stripping down, yeah man. I\u2019ve got it down, really, I\u2019ve been working on it. Adam: Which one would you keep? Which one is the ultimate pedal?\n\nEd: The ultimate pedal? Well, I\u2019ve just got this one called the Klon Centaur.\n\nAdam: Ohhhh\u2026\n\nEd: [chuckles] Yeah, you know it\u2019s good.\n\nAdam: [in a mock, high-pitched, demanding voice] I am the Klon Centaur, what is your bidding?\n\nEd: It\u2019s brilliant cause it\u2019s like, it\u2019s a boutique pedal, you know.\n\nAdam: [same comic voice] Step on my face, I will change the sound!\n\nEd: [laughing] But it\u2019s got like a centaur on the pedal.\n\nAdam: Has it? And little horns coming out?\n\nEd: Yeah, totally, man. It\u2019s disconcerting looking down there.\n\nAdam: What about the Kaoss pad?\n\nEd: The Kaoss pad is, Jonny uses the Kaoss pad, that\u2019s still around, that\u2019s still there, that\u2019s still rocking our world.\n\nAdam: Excellent, thank you very much for your question, James. Let\u2019s play another track right now that you\u2019ve brought in for our space tape, Ed, what have you got for us?\n\nEd: Well, I\u2019ve got \u201cRunaways\u201d by the XTC which might seem a little tenuous, the link, but I thought we\u2019d be running away into space. And XTC are a band\u2026I mean, that\u2019s the first track from \u201cEnglish Settlement\u201d, great album. Probably \u201cBlack Sea\u201d is my favourite album by XTC. But they were a Swindon band as well, I mean, I lived half-way between Oxford and Swindon. There\u2019s this bizarre rivalry between Oxford and Swindon that used to exist. It used to manifest itself in the football games mainly. I was sort of on the cusp of it and you\u2019d hear, on the one hand there\u2019d be the Oxford song about Swindon, dunno if you\u2019ve ever heard it, it was like \u201cWe hate Swindon and we hate Swindon, we hate Swindon and we hate Swindon, we hate Swindon and we hate Swindon, we are the Swindon-haters\u201d. [both laugh]. So there was that coming from the east side of Oxfordshire, on the other side it was more \u201cWe love Swindon and we love Swindon, we are the Swindon-lovers\u201d. I digressed, of course, but XTC are an amazing band and I love this tune. I think this is from when they sort of discovered the 12-string.\n\nAdam: Fantastic, this is XTC with \u201cRunaways\u201d. >[music]\n\nAdam: XTC with \u201cRunaways\u201d there, that was the choice of my guest this week , Ed O\u2019Brien. Hey, this is Adam Buxton here and you are listening to my \u201cBig Mixtape\u201d on 6 Music, thank you so much for doing so. Andy Partridge, of course, is someone whose live commitments as a band had been cartelled by his stage fright a lot of the time. I dunno if that\u2019s something he\u2019s got over completely or not really. He\u2019s still in a studio band because of that, I guess. And that\u2019s a shame for any musician because presumably, playing live is more than half of the deal a lot of the time, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t that the fun part?\n\nEd: Well, I guess it is frustrating, but I guess it\u2019s horses for courses, you know. I mean, it must be a nightmare for you, if you, you know, you have to go out and play live and you\u2019ve got such fear for it. I mean, whatever he needs to do to make music is the thing. I mean, for us, it\u2019s the big part of what we do, so, yeah.\n\nAdam: Is it something you look forward to or is it something you feel frightened of?\n\nEd: Um, a little bit apprehensive at the start of the tour, in terms of are we gonna play well, and then when you are doing it, it\u2019s brilliant.\n\nAdam: Looking up at the stage and seeing you guys play, doing an amazing job, it\u2019s so exciting. And there are moments, when, for example when you play \u201cThere There\u201d in particularly, it\u2019s the most exciting thing I\u2019ve ever seen and you can tell the rest of the crowd feel the same way. It just lives up to all your fantasies about what it would be like to see this amazing band. Is it like that on the stage, though? Do you ever get that feeling of \u201cI\u2019m in an amazing band!\u201d?\n\nEd: Do you ever get that feeling of \u201cThis is an amazing night\u201d? And the amazing night is that it\u2019s not about us, it\u2019s about everybody, it\u2019s about the audience, that\u2019s an amazing thing about music and that\u2019s what I love about life. I mean, when you come to one of our shows, then you\u2019re participating as much as we are. If you wanna get it down to physics, then it\u2019s an exchange of energy, there\u2019s energies going on there. So what happens is that, on a great night, what we do, individually and collectively, and what the people in the audience do, it becomes greater than the sum of its parts. And, literally, there\u2019s nights when you think the roof\u2019s gonna come off and we\u2019re all gonna be sucked up into space. It feels amazing. I think you\u2019re tapping into these very primal things, you know, rhythm, tribal, meditative, hypnotic, melodic. That\u2019s why we love music, because it taps into something with all of us, it resonates very, very deeply. It\u2019s amazing, I mean, when you are in the middle of it, you\u2019re kind of lost in it, it\u2019s just amazing.\n\nAdam: And I mentioned \u201cThere There\u201d, but are there tracks that you particularly enjoy playing and you think \u201cAh, can\u2019t wait to play one\u2026\u201d?\n\nEd: \u201cArpeggi\u201d, on the last tour, was like, that was a real moment. Cause it was one of those tracks that was always greeted, Phil started up the drums and it was always greeted with this \u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d, you could feel it, and then it just builds and builds and builds and builds and then it cuts down and there\u2019s this moment of delicate beauty where we are all garnered and then it suddenly goes into the big, you know\u2026 When I love music it\u2019s really, really\u2026there\u2019s a \u2026.I can see it, I can feel it, you know, it\u2019s like a film. It takes you places, it\u2019s very vivid. So, yeah, \u201cArpeggi\u201d\u2019s a good one for that.\n\nAdam: And, conversely, is there a track that you think \u201cOh, not this one\u2026\u201d? Either because it\u2019s technically challenging or cause you\u2019re sick of it.\n\nEd: [laughing] Yeah, there must be and I\u2019m trying to wrap my brain around it. There used to be, I mean, the technically challenging ones are good. I mean, we are very lucky cause we\u2019ve got a big body of songs so the songs we play we\u2019re never sick of. Certainly in the early days, there was a b-side that was on the \u201cMy Iron Lung\u201d EP that was called \u201cPunchdrunk Lovesong [pause] \u201dLove\u201d [pause, Ed can\u2019t remember the title] Punchdrunk Lovesong\u201d [pause] \u201cPunchdrunk Lovesick Singalong\u201d. And it had so many chord changes and we always used to joke that Colin used to fluff it [imitates bending a note on bass], bass is very unforgiving. At least on the guitar you can sort of move it or bend the note, but on the bass, if you don\u2019t get the right note, it\u2019s \u201cAhhh!\u201d. But, we all used to make mistakes, in the early days, when you had a limited number of songs and you played the same songs. And I\u2019ve mentioned Colin, Colin is the best bass player in the world. So I feel like I\u2019m just kind of like\u2026we\u2019re all making mistakes. But he\u2019ll know, if he\u2019s listening, he\u2019ll know exactly what I mean, we used to laugh.\n\nAdam: Yeah, yeah, yeah. What about when you finish a tour, you come off the tour after all that adrenaline has been spent or at least when it\u2019s still coursing through your veins and exiting your body, that must be quite a period of adjustment when you come back home and you have to deal with everyday life, the nappies and washing up.\n\nEd: Tricky, yeah. [laughing]\n\nAdam: Have you got better at making that adjustment now?\n\nEd: I think you should ask my wife that, probably not. I think, next time, [I should] stay away from home for about a week and just decompress and maybe go to the woods. Cause it\u2019s like Pavlov\u2019s dogs, 9 o\u2019clock in the evening you are awake and you are kind of like \u201cAhh!\u201d and your body clock\u2019s going. The worst thing that happens is that, when, for instance, you finish the tour in America on the west coast so you\u2019re going on stage at 9 o\u2019clock in America, that\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock in the morning in the UK. So you fly back to 2 days later and every morning for the next week, I\u2019m \u2013bang! \u2013 5 o\u2019clock in the morning I\u2019m ready, \u201cWhere\u2019s the gig, man?\u201d. It\u2019s really, really hard and of course, on tour, it\u2019s quite a selfish existence cause everything\u2019s geared to you doing the best performance on that day. So you have people who help, you have lovely food cooked for you, you don\u2019t have to clean an arse, you don\u2019t have to do anything. It\u2019s done for you, you know, you don\u2019t have to do the nappies, anything. So when you get back, it\u2019s a bit of a \u2026\n\nAdam: Shock?\n\nEd: Yeah, and you walk back in expecting to be like the returning hero, but it\u2019s just like \u201cLife\u2019s continued\u201d. And you\u2019re like \u201cBut we were up to 20 000 people last night!\u201d.\n\nAdam: \u201cBrad Pitt was at the gig for Christ\u2019s sake! Gimme some respect! You make your own tea!\n\nEd: [laughing hard, wheezing] Exactly, that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like. I can be a total arse when I get off tour; you\u2019ve got to recognize that as well.\n\nAdam: Let\u2019s hear another track that you\u2019ve brought in for our space-mix. Now, this is Mary Wells, how is this space-related?\n\nEd: Well, the thing is, I was thinking about this, like, you\u2019re in space\u2026have you ever seen the documentary \u201cIn the shadow of the Moon\u201d?\n\nAdam: Ah, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nEd: It\u2019s an amazing documentary; it\u2019s basically interviews with all of the Apollo crews.\n\nAdam: There\u2019s a similar one that\u2019s called \u201cFor all Mankind\u201d that has Eno\u2019s music.\n\nEd: That\u2019s very good as well. And what\u2019s interesting is that when all astronauts get into space there\u2019s this almost universal kind of experience that they have, and it\u2019s a very spiritual one. They always look back on the Earth and they see this beautiful, blue planet, you know, the one James Lovelock called Gaia or whatever, and it\u2019s the most beautiful thing and they are aware of, for the first time, how precious and beautiful it is. And I thought, you know, given that, what would be the bit of music? If I was given a film, what would I do? And I would have Mary Wells\u2019 \u201cMy Guy\u201d, cause there\u2019s something in that song, of true beauty, it\u2019s very human, as well. It\u2019s full of love and it\u2019s a joyful song. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily want Richard Strauss to accompany me at that moment, I want something to warm my heart, and that song does that, it\u2019s amazing.\n\n[music]\n\nAdam: Mary Wells with \u201cMy Guy\u201d, that was the final selection of my guest this week, Ed O\u2019Brien from Radiohead.

I have no fears of being forced in my own despite to play, as we say, the devil's attorney. I have no infirmity of faith; no belief that it is of much importance what I or any man may say: I am sure that a certain truth will be said through me, though I should be dumb, or though I should try to say the reverse. Nor do I fear skepticism for any good soul. A just thinker will allow full swing to his skepticism. I dip my pen in the blackest ink, because I am not afraid of falling into my inkpot. I have no sympathy with a poor man I knew, who, when suicides abounded, told me he dared not look at his razor. We are of different opinions at different hours, but we always may be said to be at heart on the side of truth.\n\nI see not why we should give ourselves such sanctified airs. If the Divine Providence has hid from men neither disease, nor deformity, nor corrupt society, but has stated itself out in passions, in war, in trade, in the love of power and pleasure, in hunger and need, in tyrannies, literatures, and arts,\u2014let us not be so nice that we cannot write these facts down coarsely as they stand, or doubt but there is a counter-statement as ponderous, which we can arrive at, and which, being put, will make all square. The solar system has no anxiety about its reputation, and the credit of truth and honesty is as safe; nor have I any fear that a skeptical bias can be given by leaning hard on the sides of fate, of practical power, or of trade, which the doctrine of Faith cannot down-weigh. The strength of that principle is not measured in ounces and pounds: it tyrannizes at the centre of Nature. We may well give skepticism as much line as we can. The spirit will return, and fill us. It drives the drivers. It counterbalances any accumulations of power.\n\n\"Heaven kindly gave our blood a moral flow.\"\n\nWe are born loyal. The whole creation is made of hooks and eyes, of bitumen, of sticking-plaster, and whether your community is made in Jerusalem or in California, of saints or of wreckers, it coheres in a perfect ball. Men as naturally make a state, or a church, as caterpillars a web. If they were more refined, it would be less formal, it would be nervous, like that of the Shakers, who, from long habit of thinking and feeling together, it is said, are affected in the same way, at the same time, to work and to play, and as they go with perfect sympathy to their tasks in the field or shop, so are they inclined for a ride or a journey at the same instant, and the horses come up with the family carriage unbespoken to the door.\n\nWe are born believing. A man bears beliefs, as a tree bears apples. A self-poise belongs to every particle; and a rectitude to every mind, and is the Nemesis and protector of every society. I and my neighbors have been bred in the notion, that, unless we came soon to some good church,\u2014Calvinism, or Behmenism, or Romanism, or Mormonism,\u2014there would be a universal thaw and dissolution. No Isaiah or Jeremy has arrived. Nothing can exceed the anarchy that has followed in our skies. The stern old faiths have all pulverized. 'Tis a whole population of gentlemen and ladies out in search of religions. 'Tis as flat anarchy in our ecclesiastic realms, as that which existed in Massachusetts, in the Revolution, or which prevails now on the slope of the Rocky Mountains or Pike's Peak. Yet we make shift to live. Men are loyal. Nature has self-poise in all her works; certain proportions in which oxygen and azote combine, and, not less a harmony in faculties, a fitness in the spring and the regulator.\n\nThe decline of the influence of Calvin, or Fenelon, or Wesley, or Channing, need give us no uneasiness. The builder of heaven has not so ill constructed his creature as that the religion, that is, the public nature, should fall out: the public and the private element, like north and south, like inside and outside, like centrifugal and centripetal, adhere to every soul, and cannot be subdued, except the soul is dissipated. God builds his temple in the heart on the ruins of churches and religions.\n\nIn the last chapters, we treated some particulars of the question of culture. But the whole state of man is a state of culture; and its flowering and completion may be described as Religion, or Worship. There is always some religion, some hope and fear extended into the invisible,\u2014from the blind boding which nails a horseshoe to the mast or the threshold, up to the song of the Elders in the Apocalypse. But the religion cannot rise above the state of the votary. Heaven always bears some proportion to earth. The god of the cannibals will be a cannibal, of the crusaders a crusader, and of the merchants a merchant. In all ages, souls out of time, extraordinary, prophetic, are born, who are rather related to the system of the world, than to their particular age and locality. These announce absolute truths, which, with whatever reverence received, are speedily dragged down into a savage interpretation. The interior tribes of our Indians, and some of the Pacific islanders, flog their gods, when things take an unfavorable turn. The Greek poets did not hesitate to let loose their petulant wit on their deities also. Laomedon, in his anger at Neptune and Apollo, who had built Troy for him, and demanded their price, does not hesitate to menace them that he will cut their ears off.5 Among our Norse forefathers, King Olaf's mode of converting Eyvind to Christianity was to put a pan of glowing coals on his belly, which burst asunder. \"Wilt thou now, Eyvind, believe in Christ?\" asks Olaf, in excellent faith. Another argument was an adder put into the mouth of the reluctant disciple Rand, who refused to believe.\n\n\nIliad, Book xxi. 1. 455.\nChristianity, in the romantic ages, signified European culture,\u2014the grafted or meliorated tree in a crab forest. And to marry a pagan wife or husband, was to marry Beast, and voluntarily to take a step backwards towards the baboon.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hengist had verament\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A daughter both fair and gent,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she was heathen Sarazine,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Vortigern for love fine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her took to fere and to wife,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And was cursed in all his life;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For he let Christian wed heathen,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And mixed our blood as flesh and mathen.\"\nMoths or worms\n\nWhat Gothic mixtures the Christian creed drew from the pagan sources, Richard of Devizes's chronicle of Richard I.'s crusade, in the twelfth century, may show. King Richard taunts God with forsaking him: \"O fie! O how unwilling should I be to forsake thee, in so forlorn and dreadful a position, were I thy lord and advocate, as thou art mine. In sooth, my standards will in future be despised, not through my fault, but through thine: in sooth, not through any cowardice of my warfare, art thou thyself, my king and my God conquered, this day, and not Richard thy vassal.\" The religion of the early English poets is anomalous, so devout and so blasphemous, in the same breath. Such is Chaucer's extraordinary confusion of heaven and earth in the picture of Dido.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She was so fair,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So young, so lusty, with her eyen glad,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That if that God that heaven and earthe made\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Would have a love for beauty and goodness,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And womanhede, truth, and seemliness,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whom should he loven but this lady sweet?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There n' is no woman to him half so meet.\"\n\nWith these grossnesses, we complacently compare our own taste and decorum. We think and speak with more temperance and gradation,\u2014but is not indifferentism as bad as superstition?\n\nWe live in a transition period, when the old faiths which comforted nations, and not only so, but made nations, seem to have spent their force. I do not find the religions of men at this moment very creditable to them, but either childish and insignificant, or unmanly and effeminating. The fatal trait is the divorce between religion and morality. Here are know-nothing religions, or churches that proscribe intellect; scortatory religions; slave-holding and slave-trading religions; and, even in the decent populations, idolatries wherein the whiteness of the ritual covers scarlet indulgence. The lover of the old religion complains that our contemporaries, scholars as well as merchants, succumb to a great despair,\u2014have corrupted into a timorous conservatism, and believe in nothing. In our large cities, the population is godless, materialized,\u2014no bond, no fellow-feeling, no enthusiasm. These are not men, but hungers, thirsts, fevers, and appetites walking. How is it people manage to live on,\u2014so aimless as they are? After their peppercorn aims are gained, it seems as if the lime in their bones alone held them together, and not any worthy purpose. There is no faith in the intellectual, none in the moral universe. There is faith in chemistry, in meat, and wine, in wealth, in machinery, in the steam-engine, galvanic battery, turbine-wheels, sewing machines, and in public opinion, but not in divine causes. A silent revolution has loosed the tension of the old religious sects, and, in place of the gravity and permanence of those societies of opinion, they run into freak and extravagance. In creeds never was such levity; witness the heathenisms in Christianity, the periodic \"revivals,\" the Millennium mathematics, the peacock ritualism, the retrogression to Popery, the maundering of Mormons, the squalor of Mesmerism, the deliration of rappings, the rat and mouse revelation, thumps in table-drawers, and black art. The architecture, the music, the prayer, partake of the madness: the arts sink into shift and make-believe. Not knowing what to do, we ape our ancestors; the churches stagger backward to the mummeries of the dark ages. By the irresistible maturing of the general mind, the Christian traditions have lost their hold. The dogma of the mystic offices of Christ being dropped, and he standing on his genius as a moral teacher, 'tis impossible to maintain the old emphasis of his personality; and it recedes, as all persons must, before the sublimity of the moral laws. From this change, and in the momentary absence of any religious genius that could offset the immense material activity, there is a feeling that religion is gone. When Paul Leroux offered his article \"Dieu\" to the conductor of a leading French journal, he replied, \"La question de Dieu manque d'actualit\u00e9.\" In Italy, Mr. Gladstone said of the late King of Naples, \"it has been a proverb, that he has erected the negation of God into a system of government.\" In this country, the like stupefaction was in the air, and the phrase \"higher law\" became a political jibe. What proof of infidelity, like the toleration and propagandism of slavery? What, like the direction of education? What, like the facility of conversion? What, like the externality of churches that once sucked the roots of right and wrong, and now have perished away till they are a speck of whitewash on the wall? What proof of skepticism like the base rate at which the highest mental and moral gifts are held? Let a man attain the highest and broadest culture that any American has possessed, then let him die by sea-storm, railroad collision, or other accident, and all America will acquiesce that the best thing has happened to him; that, after the education has gone far, such is the expensiveness of America, that the best use to put a fine person to, is, to drown him to save his board.\n\nAnother scar of this skepticism is the distrust in human virtue. It is believed by well-dressed proprietors that there is no more virtue than they possess; that the solid portion of society exist for the arts of comfort: that life is an affair to put somewhat between the upper and lower mandibles. How prompt the suggestion of a low motive! Certain patriots in England devoted themselves for years to creating a public opinion that should break down the corn-laws and establish free trade. 'Well,' says the man in the street, 'Cobden got a stipend out of it.' Kossuth fled hither across the ocean to try if he could rouse the New World to a sympathy with European liberty. 'Aye,' says New York, 'he made a handsome thing of it, enough to make him comfortable for life.'\n\nSee what allowance vice finds in the respectable and well-conditioned class. If a pickpocket intrude into the society of gentlemen, they exert what moral force they have, and he finds himself uncomfortable, and glad to get away. But if an adventurer go through all the forms, procure himself to be elected to a post of trust, as of senator, or president,\u2014though by the same arts as we detest in the house-thief,\u2014the same gentlemen who agree to discountenance the private rogue, will be forward to show civilities and marks of respect to the public one: and no amount of evidence of his crimes will prevent them giving him ovations, complimentary dinners, opening their own houses to him, and priding themselves on his acquaintance. We were not deceived by the professions of the private adventurer,\u2014the louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our spoons; but we appeal to the sanctified preamble of the messages and proclamations of the public sinner, as the proof of sincerity. It must be that they who pay this homage have said to themselves, On the whole, we don't know about this that you call honesty; a bird in the hand is better.\n\nEven well-disposed, good sort of people are touched with the same infidelity, and for brave, straightforward action, use half-measures and compromises. Forgetful that a little measure is a great error, forgetful that a wise mechanic uses a sharp tool, they go on choosing the dead men of routine. But the official men can in nowise help you in any question of to-day, they deriving entirely from the old dead things. Only those can help in counsel or conduct who did not make a party pledge to defend this or that, but who were appointed by God Almighty, before they came into the world, to stand for this which they uphold.\n\nIt has been charged that a want of sincerity in the leading men is a vice general throughout American society. But the multitude of the sick shall not make us deny the existence of health. In spite of our imbecility and terrors, and \"universal decay of religion,\" &c. &c., the moral sense reappears to-day with the same morning newness that has been from of old the fountain of beauty and strength. You say, there is no religion now. 'Tis like saying in rainy weather, there is no sun, when at that moment we are witnessing one of his superlative effects. The religion of the cultivated class now, to be sure, consists in an avoidance of acts and engagements which it was once their religion to assume. But this avoidance will yield spontaneous forms in their due hour. There is a principle which is the basis of things, which all speech aims to say, and all action to evolve, a simple, quiet, undescribed, undescribable presence, dwelling very peacefully in us, our rightful lord: we are not to do, but to let do; not to work, but to be worked upon; and to this homage there is a consent of all thoughtful and just men in all ages and conditions. To this sentiment belong vast and sudden enlargements of power. 'Tis remarkable that our faith in ecstasy consists with total inexperience of it. It is the order of the world to educate with accuracy the senses and the understanding; and the enginery at work to draw out these powers in priority, no doubt, has its office. But we are never without a hint that these powers are mediate and servile, and that we are one day to deal with real being,\u2014essences with essences. Even the fury of material activity has some results friendly to moral health. The energetic action of the times develops individualism, and the religious appear isolated. I esteem this a step in the right direction. Heaven deals with us on no representative system. Souls are not saved in bundles. The Spirit saith to the man, 'How is it with thee? thee personally? is it well? is it ill?' For a great nature, it is a happiness to escape a religious training,\u2014religion of character is so apt to be invaded. Religion must always be a crab fruit: it cannot be grafted and keep its wild beauty. \"I have seen,\" said a traveller who had known the extremes of society, \"I have seen human nature in all its forms, it is everywhere the same, but the wilder it is, the more virtuous.\"\n\nWe say, the old forms of religion decay, and that a skepticism devastates the community. I do not think it can be cured or stayed by any modification of theologic creeds, much less by theologic discipline. The cure for false theology is motherwit. Forget your books and traditions, and obey your moral perceptions at this hour. That which is signified by the words \"moral\" and \"spiritual,\" is a lasting essence, and, with whatever illusions we have loaded them, will certainly bring back the words, age after age, to their ancient meaning. I know no words that mean so much. In our definitions, we grope after the spiritual by describing it as invisible. The true meaning of spiritual is real; that law which executes itself, which works without means, and which cannot be conceived as not existing. Men talk of \"mere morality,\"\u2014which is much as if one should say, 'poor God, with nobody to help him.' I find the omnipresence and the almightiness in the reaction of every atom in Nature. I can best indicate by examples those reactions by which every part of Nature replies to the purpose of the actor,\u2014beneficently to the good, penally to the bad. Let us replace sentimentalism by realism, and dare to uncover those simple and terrible laws which, be they seen or unseen, pervade and govern.\nEvery man takes care that his neighbor shall not cheat him. But a day comes when he begins to care that he do not cheat his neighbor. Then all goes well. He has changed his market-cart into a chariot of the sun. What a day dawns, when we have taken to heart the doctrine of faith! to prefer, as a better investment, being to doing; being to seeming; logic to rhythm and to display; the year to the day; the life to the year; character to performance;\u2014and have come to know, that justice will be done us; and, if our genius is slow, the term will be long.\n\n'Tis certain that worship stands in some commanding relation to the health of man, and to his highest powers, so as to be, in some manner, the source of intellect. All the great ages have been ages of belief. I mean, when there was any extraordinary power of performance, when great national movements began, when arts appeared, when heroes existed, when poems were made, the human soul was in earnest, and had fixed its thoughts on spiritual verities, with as strict a grasp as that of the hands on the sword, or the pencil, or the trowel. It is true that genius takes its rise out of the mountains of rectitude; that all beauty and power which men covet, are somehow born out of that Alpine district; that any extraordinary degree of beauty in man or woman involves a moral charm. Thus, I think, we very slowly admit in another man a higher degree of moral sentiment than our own,\u2014a finer conscience, more impressionable, or, which marks minuter degrees; an ear to hear acuter notes of right and wrong, than we can. I think we listen suspiciously and very slowly to any evidence to that point. But, once satisfied of such superiority, we set no limit to our expectation of his genius. For such persons are nearer to the secret of God than others; are bathed by sweeter waters; they hear notices, they see visions, where others are vacant. We believe that holiness confers a certain insight, because not by our private, but by our public force, can we share and know the nature of things.\n\nThere is an intimate interdependence of intellect and morals. Given the equality of two intellects,\u2014which will form the most reliable judgments, the good, or the bad hearted? \"The heart has its arguments, with which the understanding is not acquainted.\" For the heart is at once aware of the state of health or disease, which is the controlling state, that is, of sanity or of insanity, prior, of course, to all question of the ingenuity of arguments, the amount of facts, or the elegance of rhetoric. So intimate is this alliance of mind and heart, that talent uniformly sinks with character. The bias of errors of principle carries away men into perilous courses, as soon as their will does not control their passion or talent. Hence the extraordinary blunders, and final wrong head, into which men spoiled by ambition usually fall. Hence the remedy for all blunders, the cure of blindness, the cure of crime, is love. \"As much love, so much mind,\" said the Latin proverb. The superiority that has no superior; the redeemer and instructor of souls, as it is their primal essence, is love.\n\nThe moral must be the measure of health. If your eye is on the eternal, your intellect will grow, and your opinions and actions will have a beauty which no learning or combined advantages of other men can rival. The moment of your loss of faith, and acceptance of the lucrative standard, will be marked in the pause, or solstice of genius, the sequent retrogression, and the inevitable loss of attraction to other minds. The vulgar are sensible of the change in you, and of your descent, though they clap you on the back, and congratulate you on your increased common sense.\n\nOur recent culture has been in natural science. We have learned the manners of the sun and of the moon, of the rivers and the rains, of the mineral and elemental kingdoms, of plants and animals. Man has learned to weigh the sun, and its weight neither loses nor gains. The path of a star, the moment of an eclipse, can be determined to the fraction of a second. Well, to him the book of History, the book of love, the lures of passion, and the commandments of duty are opened: and the next lesson taught, is, the continuation of the inflexible law of matter into the subtile kingdom of will, and of thought; that, if, in sidereal ages, gravity and projection keep their craft, and the ball never loses its way in its wild path through space,\u2014a secreter gravitation, a secreter projection, rule not less tyrannically in human history, and keep the balance of power from age to age unbroken. For, though the new element of freedom and an individual has been admitted, yet the primordial atoms are prefigured and predetermined to moral issues, are in search of justice, and ultimate right is done. Religion or worship is the attitude of those who see this unity, intimacy, and sincerity; who see that, against all appearances, the nature of things works for truth and right forever.\n\n'Tis a short sight to limit our faith in laws to those of gravity, of chemistry, of botany, and so forth. Those laws do not stop where our eyes lose them, but push the same geometry and chemistry up into the invisible plane of social and rational life, so that, look where we will, in a boy's game, or in the strifes of races, a perfect reaction, a perpetual judgment keeps watch and ward. And this appears in a class of facts which concerns all men, within and above their creeds.\n\nShallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances: It was somebody's name, or he happened to be there at the time, or, it was so then, and another day it would have been otherwise. Strong men believe in cause and effect. The man was born to do it, and his father was born to be the father of him and of this deed, and, by looking narrowly, you shall see there was no luck in the matter, but it was all a problem in arithmetic, or an experiment in chemistry. The curve of the flight of the moth is preordained, and all things go by number, rule, and weight.\nSkepticism is unbelief in cause and effect. A man does not see, that, as he eats, so he thinks: as he deals, so he is, and so he appears; he does not see, that his son is the son of his thoughts and of his actions; that fortunes are not exceptions but fruits; that relation and connection are not somewhere and sometimes, but everywhere and always; no miscellany, no exemption, no anomaly,\u2014but method, and an even web; and what comes out, that was put in. As we are, so we do; and as we do, so is it done to us; we are the builders of our fortunes; cant and lying and the attempt to secure a good which does not belong to us, are, once for all, balked and vain. But, in the human mind, this tie of fate is made alive. The law is the basis of the human mind. In us, it is inspiration; out there in Nature, we see its fatal strength. We call it the moral sentiment.\n\nWe owe to the Hindoo Scriptures a definition of Law, which compares well with any in our Western books. \"Law it is, which is without name, or color, or hands, or feet; which is smallest of the least, and largest of the large; all, and knowing all things; which hears without ears, sees without eyes, moves without feet, and seizes without hands.\"\n\nIf any reader tax me with using vague and traditional phrases, let me suggest to him, by a few examples, what kind of a trust this is, and how real. Let me show him that the dice are loaded; that the colors are fast, because they are the native colors of the fleece; that the globe is a battery, because every atom is a magnet; and that the police and sincerity of the Universe are secured by God's delegating his divinity to every particle; that there is no room for hypocrisy, no margin for choice.\n\nThe countryman leaving his native village, for the first time, and going abroad, finds all his habits broken up. In a new nation and language, his sect, as Quaker, or Lutheran, is lost. What! it is not then necessary to the order and existence of society? He misses this, and the commanding eye of his neighborhood, which held him to decorum. This is the peril of New York, of New Orleans, of London, of Paris, to young men. But after a little experience, he makes the discovery that there are no large cities,\u2014none large enough to hide in; that the censors of action are as numerous and as near in Paris, as in Littleton or Portland; that the gossip is as prompt and vengeful. There is no concealment, and, for each offence, a several vengeance; that, reaction, or nothing for nothing, or, things are as broad as they are long, is not a rule for Littleton or Portland, but for the Universe.\n\nWe cannot spare the coarsest muniment of virtue. We are disgusted by gossip; yet it is of importance to keep the angels in their proprieties. The smallest fly will draw blood, and gossip is a weapon impossible to exclude from the privatest, highest, selectest. Nature created a police of many ranks. God has delegated himself to a million deputies. From these low external penalties, the scale ascends. Next come the resentments, the fears, which injustice calls out; then, the false relations in which the offender is put to other men; and the reaction of his fault on himself, in the solitude and devastation of his mind.\n\nYou cannot hide any secret. If the artist succor his flagging spirits by opium or wine, his work will characterize itself as the effect of opium or wine. If you make a picture or a statue, it sets the beholder in that state of mind you had, when you made it. If you spend for show, on building, or gardening, or on pictures, or on equipages, it will so appear. We are all physiognomists and penetrators of character, and things themselves are detective. If you follow the suburban fashion in building a sumptuous-looking house for a little money, it will appear to all eyes as a cheap dear house. There is no privacy that cannot be penetrated. No secret can be kept in the civilized world. Society is a masked ball, where every one hides his real character, and reveals it by hiding. If a man wish to conceal anything he carries, those whom he meets know that he conceals somewhat, and usually know what he conceals. Is it otherwise if there be some belief or some purpose he would bury in his breast? 'Tis as hard to hide as fire. He is a strong man who can hold down his opinion. A man cannot utter two or three sentences, without disclosing to intelligent ears precisely where he stands in life and thought, namely, whether in the kingdom of the senses and the understanding, or, in that of ideas and imagination, in the realm of intuitions and duty. People seem not to see that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character. We can only see what we are, and if we misbehave we suspect others. The fame of Shakspeare or of Voltaire, of Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, or of Bonaparte, characterizes those who give it. As gas-light is found to be the best nocturnal police, so the universe protects itself by pitiless publicity.\n\nEach must be armed\u2014not necessarily with musket and pike. Happy, if, seeing these, he can feel that he has better muskets and pikes in his energy and constancy. To every creature is his own weapon, however skilfully concealed from himself, a good while. His work is sword and shield. Let him accuse none, let him injure none. The way to mend the bad world, is to create the right world. Here is a low political economy plotting to cut the throat of foreign competition, and establish our own;\u2014excluding others by force, or making war on them; or, by cunning tariffs, giving preference to worse wares of ours. But the real and lasting victories are those of peace, and not of war. The way to conquer the foreign artisan, is, not to kill him, but to beat his work. And the Crystal Palaces and World Fairs, with their committees and prizes on all kinds of industry, are the result of this feeling. The American workman who strikes ten blows with his hammer, whilst the foreign workman only strikes one, is as really vanquishing that foreigner, as if the blows were aimed at and told on his person. I look on that man as happy, who, when there is question of success, looks into his work for a reply, not into the market, not into opinion, not into patronage. In every variety of human employment, in the mechanical and in the fine arts, in navigation, in farming, in legislating, there are among the numbers who do their task perfunctorily, as we say, or just to pass, and as badly as they dare,\u2014there are the working-men, on whom the burden of the business falls,\u2014those who love work, and love to see it rightly done, who finish their task for its own sake; and the state and the world is happy, that has the most of such finishers. The world will always do justice at last to such finishers: it cannot otherwise. He who has acquired the ability, may wait securely the occasion of making it felt and appreciated, and know that it will not loiter. Men talk as if victory were something fortunate. Work is victory. Wherever work is done, victory is obtained. There is no chance, and no blanks. You want but one verdict: if you have your own, you are secure of the rest. And yet, if witnesses are wanted, witnesses are near. There was never a man born so wise or good, but one or more companions came into the world with him, who delight in his faculty, and report it. I cannot see without awe, that no man thinks alone, and no man acts alone, but the divine assessors who came up with him into life,\u2014now under one disguise, now under another,\u2014like a police in citizens' clothes, walk with him, step for step, through all the kingdom of time.\n\nThis reaction, this sincerity is the property of all things. To make our word or act sublime, we must make it real. It is our system that counts, not the single word or unsupported action. Use what language you will, you can never say anything but what you are. What I am, and what I think, is conveyed to you, in spite of my efforts to hold it back. What I am has been secretly conveyed from me to another, whilst I was vainly making up my mind to tell him it. He has heard from me what I never spoke.\n\nAs men get on in life, they acquire a love for sincerity, and somewhat less solicitude to be lulled or amused. In the progress of the character, there is an increasing faith in the moral sentiment, and a decreasing faith in propositions. Young people admire talents, and particular excellences. As we grow older, we value total powers and effects, as the spirit, or quality of the man. We have another sight, and a new standard; an insight which disregards what is done for the eye, and pierces to the doer; an ear which hears not what men say, but hears what they do not say.\n\nThere was a wise, devout man who is called, in the Catholic Church, St. Philip Neri, of whom many anecdotes touching his discernment and benevolence are told at Naples and Rome. Among the nuns in a convent not far from Rome, one had appeared, who laid claim to certain rare gifts of inspiration and prophecy, and the abbess advised the Holy Father, at Rome, of the wonderful powers shown by her novice. The Pope did not well know what to make of these new claims, and Philip coming in from a journey, one day, he consulted him. Philip undertook to visit the nun, and ascertain her character. He threw himself on his mule, all travel-soiled as he was, and hastened through the mud and mire to the distant convent. He told the abbess the wishes of his Holiness, and begged her to summon the nun without delay. The nun was sent for, and, as soon as she came into the apartment, Philip stretched out his leg all bespattered with mud, and desired her to draw off his boots. The young nun, who had become the object of much attention and respect, drew back with anger, and refused the office: Philip ran out of doors, mounted his mule, and returned instantly to the Pope; \"Give yourself no uneasiness, Holy Father, any longer: here is no miracle, for here is no humility.\"\n\nWe need not much mind what people please to say, but what they must say; what their natures say, though their busy, artful, Yankee understandings try to hold back, and choke that word, and to articulate something different. If we will sit quietly,\u2014what they ought to say is said, with their will, or against their will. We do not care for you, let us pretend what we will:\u2014we are always looking through you to the dim dictator behind you. Whilst your habit or whim chatters, we civilly and impatiently wait until that wise superior shall speak again. Even children are not deceived by the false reasons which their parents give in answer to their questions, whether touching natural facts, or religion, or persons. When the parent, instead of thinking how it really is, puts them off with a traditional or a hypocritical answer, the children perceive that it is traditional or hypocritical. To a sound constitution the defect of another is at once manifest: and the marks of it are only concealed from us by our own dislocation. An anatomical observer remarks, that the sympathies of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, tell at last on the face, and on all its features. Not only does our beauty waste, but it leaves word how it went to waste. Physiognomy and phrenology are not new sciences, but declarations of the soul that it is aware of certain new sources of information. And now sciences of broader scope are starting up behind these. And so for ourselves, it is really of little importance what blunders in statement we make, so only we make no wilful departures from the truth. How a man's truth comes to mind, long after we have forgotten all his words! How it comes to us in silent hours, that truth is our only armor in all passages of life and death! Wit is cheap, and anger is cheap; but if you cannot argue or explain yourself to the other party, cleave to the truth against me, against thee, and you gain a station from which you cannot be dislodged. The other party will forget the words that you spoke, but the part you took continues to plead for you.\n\nWhy should I hasten to solve every riddle which life offers me? I am well assured that the Questioner, who brings me so many problems, will bring the answers also in due time. Very rich, very potent, very cheerful Giver that he is, he shall have it all his own way, for me. Why should I give up my thought, because I cannot answer an objection to it? Consider only, whether it remains in my life the same it was. That only which we have within, can we see without. If we meet no gods, it is because we harbor none. If there is grandeur in you, you will find grandeur in porters and sweeps. He only is rightly immortal, to whom all things are immortal. I have read somewhere, that none is accomplished, so long as any are incomplete; that the happiness of one cannot consist with the misery of any other.\n\nThe Buddhists say, \"No seed will die:\" every seed will grow. Where is the service which can escape its remuneration? What is vulgar, and the essence of all vulgarity, but the avarice of reward? 'Tis the difference of artisan and artist, of talent and genius, of sinner and saint. The man whose eyes are nailed not on the nature of his act, but on the wages, whether it be money, or office, or fame,\u2014is almost equally low. He is great, whose eyes are opened to see that the reward of actions cannot be escaped, because he is transformed into his action, and taketh its nature, which bears its own fruit, like every other tree. A great man cannot be hindered of the effect of his act, because it is immediate. The genius of life is friendly to the noble, and in the dark brings them friends from far. Fear God, and where you go, men shall think they walk in hallowed cathedrals.\n\nAnd so I look on those sentiments which make the glory of the human being, love, humility, faith, as being also the intimacy of Divinity in the atoms; and, that, as soon as the man is right, assurances and previsions emanate from the interior of his body and his mind; as, when flowers reach their ripeness, incense exhales from them, and, as a beautiful atmosphere is generated from the planet by the averaged emanations from all its rocks and soils.\n\nThus man is made equal to every event. He can face danger for the right. A poor, tender, painful body, he can run into flame or bullets or pestilence, with duty for his guide. He feels the insurance of a just employment. I am not afraid of accident, as long as I am in my place. It is strange that superior persons should not feel that they have some better resistance against cholera, than avoiding green peas and salads. Life is hardly respectable,\u2014is it? if it has no generous, guaranteeing task, no duties or affections, that constitute a necessity of existing. Every man's task is his life-preserver. The conviction that his work is dear to God and cannot be spared, defends him. The lightning-rod that disarms the cloud of its threat is his body in its duty. A high aim reacts on the means, on the days, on the organs of the body. A high aim is curative, as well as arnica. \"Napoleon,\" says Goethe, \"visited those sick of the plague, in order to prove that the man who could vanquish fear, could vanquish the plague also; and he was right. 'Tis incredible what force the will has in such cases: it penetrates the body, and puts it in a state of activity, which repels all hurtful influences; whilst fear invites them.\"\n\nIt is related of William of Orange, that, whilst he was besieging a town on the continent, a gentleman sent to him on public business came to his camp, and, learning that the King was before the walls, he ventured to go where he was. He found him directing the operation of his gunners, and, having explained his errand, and received his answer, the King said, \"Do you not know, sir, that every moment you spend here is at the risk of your life?\" \"I run no more risk,\" replied the gentleman, \"than your Majesty.\" \"Yes,\" said the King, \"but my duty brings me here, and yours does not.\" In a few minutes, a cannon-ball fell on the spot, and the gentleman was killed.\n\nThus can the faithful student reverse all the warnings of his early instinct, under the guidance of a deeper instinct. He learns to welcome misfortune, learns that adversity is the prosperity of the great. He learns the greatness of humility. He shall work in the dark, work against failure, pain, and ill-will. If he is insulted, he can be insulted; all his affair is not to insult. Hafiz writes,\n\nAt the last day, men shall wear\nOn their heads the dust,\nAs ensign and as ornament\nOf their lowly trust.\n\nThe moral equalizes all; enriches, empowers all. It is the coin which buys all, and which all find in their pocket. Under the whip of the driver, the slave shall feel his equality with saints and heroes. In the greatest destitution and calamity, it surprises man with a feeling of elasticity which makes nothing of loss.\n\nI recall some traits of a remarkable person whose life and discourse betrayed many inspirations of this sentiment. Benedict was always great in the present time. He had hoarded nothing from the past, neither in his cabinets, neither in his memory. He had no designs on the future, neither for what he should do to men, nor for what men should do for him. He said, 'I am never beaten until I know that I am beaten. I meet powerful brutal people to whom I have no skill to reply. They think they have defeated me. It is so published in society, in the journals; I am defeated in this fashion, in all men's sight, perhaps on a dozen different lines. My ledger may show that I am in debt, cannot yet make my ends meet, and vanquish the enemy so. My race may not be prospering: we are sick, ugly, obscure, unpopular. My children may be worsted. I seem to fail in my friends and clients, too. That is to say, in all the encounters that have yet chanced, I have not been weaponed for that particular occasion, and have been historically beaten; and yet, I know, all the time, that I have never been beaten; have never yet fought, shall certainly fight, when my hour comes, and shall beat.' \"A man,\" says the Vishnu Sarma, \"who having well compared his own strength or weakness with that of others, after all doth not know the difference, is easily overcome by his enemies.\"\n\n'I spent,' he said, 'ten months in the country. Thick-starred Orion was my only companion. Wherever a squirrel or a bee can go with security, I can go. I ate whatever was set before me; I touched ivy and dogwood. When I went abroad, I kept company with every man on the road, for I knew that my evil and my good did not come from these, but from the Spirit, whose servant I was. For I could not stoop to be a circumstance, as they did, who put their life into their fortune and their company. I would not degrade myself by casting about in my memory for a thought, nor by waiting for one. If the thought come, I would give it entertainment. It should, as it ought, go into my hands and feet; but if it come not spontaneously, it comes not rightly at all. If it can spare me, I am sure I can spare it. It shall be the same with my friends. I will never woo the loveliest. I will not ask any friendship or favor. When I come to my own, we shall both know it. Nothing will be to be asked or to be granted.' Benedict went out to seek his friend, and met him on the way; but he expressed no surprise at any coincidences. On the other hand, if he called at the door of his friend, and he was not at home, he did not go again; concluding that he had misinterpreted the intimations.\n\nHe had the whim not to make an apology to the same individual whom he had wronged. For this, he said, was a piece of personal vanity; but he would correct his conduct in that respect in which he had faulted, to the next person he should meet. Thus, he said, universal justice was satisfied.\n\nMira came to ask what she should do with the poor Genesee woman who had hired herself to work for her, at a shilling a day, and, now sickening, was like to be bedridden on her hands. Should she keep her, or should she dismiss her? But Benedict said, 'Why ask? One thing will clear itself as the thing to be done, and not another, when the hour comes. Is it a question, whether to put her into the street? Just as much whether to thrust the little Jenny on your arm into the street. The milk and meal you give the beggar, will fatten Jenny. Thrust the woman out, and you thrust your babe out of doors, whether it so seem to you or not.'\n\nIn the Shakers, so called, I find one piece of belief, in the doctrine which they faithfully hold, that encourages them to open their doors to every wayfaring man who proposes to come among them; for, they say, the Spirit will presently manifest to the man himself, and to the society, what manner of person he is, and whether he belongs among them. They do not receive him, they do not reject him. And not in vain have they worn their clay coat, and drudged in their fields, and shuffled in their Bruin dance, from year to year, if they have truly learned thus much wisdom.\n\nHonor him whose life is perpetual victory; him, who, by sympathy with the invisible and real, finds support in labor, instead of praise; who does not shine, and would rather not. With eyes open, he makes the choice of virtue, which outrages the virtuous; of religion, which churches stop their discords to burn and exterminate; for the highest virtue is always against the law.\n\nMiracle comes to the miraculous, not to the arithmetician. Talent and success interest me but moderately. The great class, they who affect our imagination, the men who could not make their hands meet around their objects, the rapt, the lost, the fools of ideas,\u2014they suggest what they cannot execute. They speak to the ages, and are heard from afar. The Spirit does not love cripples and malformations. If there ever was a good man, be certain, there was another, and will be more.\n\nAnd so in relation to that future hour, that spectre clothed with beauty at our curtain by night, at our table by day,\u2014the apprehension, the assurance of a coming change. The race of mankind have always offered at least this implied thanks for the gift of existence,\u2014namely, the terror of its being taken away; the insatiable curiosity and appetite for its continuation. The whole revelation that is vouchsafed us, is, the gentle trust, which, in our experience we find, will cover also with flowers the slopes of this chasm.\n\nOf immortality, the soul, when well employed, is incurious. It is so well, that it is sure it will be well. It asks no questions of the Supreme Power. The son of Antiochus asked his father, when he would join battle? \"Dost thou fear,\" replied the King, \"that thou only in all the army wilt not hear the trumpet?\" 'Tis a higher thing to confide, that, if it is best we should live, we shall live,\u2014'tis higher to have this conviction, than to have the lease of indefinite centuries and millenniums and \u00e6ons. Higher than the question of our duration is the question of our deserving. Immortality will come to such as are fit for it, and he who would be a great soul in future, must be a great soul now. It is a doctrine too great to rest on any legend, that is, on any man's experience but our own. It must be proved, if at all, from our own activity and designs, which imply an interminable future for their play.\n\nWhat is called religion effeminates and demoralizes. Such as you are, the gods themselves could not help you. Men are too often unfit to live, from their obvious inequality to their own necessities, or, they suffer from politics, or bad neighbors, or from sickness, and they would gladly know that they were to be dismissed from the duties of life. But the wise instinct asks, 'How will death help them?' These are not dismissed when they die. You shall not wish for death out of pusillanimity. The weight of the Universe is pressed down on the shoulders of each moral agent to hold him to his task. The only path of escape known in all the worlds of God is performance. You must do your work, before you shall be released. And as far as it is a question of fact respecting the government of the Universe, Marcus Antoninus summed the whole in a word, \"It is pleasant to die, if there be gods; and sad to live, if there be none.\"\n\nAnd so I think that the last lesson of life, the choral song which rises from all elements and all angels, is, a voluntary obedience, a necessitated freedom. Man is made of the same atoms as the world is, he shares the same impressions, predispositions, and destiny. When his mind is illuminated, when his heart is kind, he throws himself joyfully into the sublime order, and does, with knowledge, what the stones do by structure.\n\nThe religion which is to guide and fulfil the present and coming ages, whatever else it be, must be intellectual. The scientific mind must have a faith which is science. \"There are two things,\" said Mahomet, \"which I abhor, the learned in his infidelities, and the fool in his devotions.\" Our times are impatient of both, and specially of the last. Let us have nothing now which is not its own evidence. There is surely enough for the heart and imagination in the religion itself. Let us not be pestered with assertions and half-truths, with emotions and snuffle.\n\nThere will be a new church founded on moral science, at first cold and naked, a babe in a manger again, the algebra and mathematics of ethical law, the church of men to come, without shawms, or psaltery, or sackbut; but it will have heaven and earth for its beams and rafters; science for symbol and illustration; it will fast enough gather beauty, music, picture, poetry. Was never stoicism so stern and exigent as this shall be. It shall send man home to his central solitude, shame these social, supplicating manners, and make him know that much of the time he must have himself to his friend. He shall expect no co\u00f6peration, he shall walk with no companion. The nameless Thought, the nameless Power, the superpersonal Heart,\u2014he shall repose alone on that. He needs only his own verdict. No good fame can help, no bad fame can hurt him. The Laws are his consolers, the good Laws themselves are alive, they know if he have kept them, they animate him with the leading of great duty, and an endless horizon. Honor and fortune exist to him who always recognizes the neighborhood of the great, always feels himself in the presence of high causes.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

see this delicious creature who had fallen on his knees before the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning\u2013or rather the ex-Director, for the poor man had resigned immediately afterwards and never set foot inside the Center again\u2013had flopped down and called him (the joke was almost too good to be true!) \"my father.\" Linda, on the contrary, cut no ice; nobody had the smallest desire to see Linda. To say one was a mother that was past a joke: it was an obscenity. Moreover, she wasn't a real savage, had been hatched out of a bottle and conditioned like any one else, so couldn't have really quaint ideas. Finally and this was by far the strongest reason for people's not wanting to see poor Linda\u2013there was her appearance. Fat; having lost her youth; with bad teeth, and a blotched complexion, and that figure (Ford!)\u2013you simply couldn't look at her without feeling sick, yes, positively sick. So the best people were quite determined not to see Linda. And Linda, for her part, had no desire to see them. The return to civilization was for her the return to soma, was the possibility of lying in bed and taking holiday after holiday, without ever having to come back to a headache or a fit of vomiting, without ever being made to feel as you always felt after peyotl, as though you'd done something so shamefully anti-social that you could never hold up your head again. Soma played none of these unpleasant tricks. The holiday it gave was perfect and, if the morning after was disagreeable, it was so, not intrinsically, but only by comparison with the joys of the holiday. The remedy was to make the holiday continuous. Greedily she clamoured for ever larger, ever more frequent doses. Dr. Shaw at first demurred; then let her have what she wanted. She took as much as twenty grammes a day. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\"Which will finish her off in a month or two,\" the doctor confided to Bernard. \"One day the respiratory centre will be paralyzed. No more breathing. Finished. And a good thing too. If we could rejuvenate, of course it would be different. But we can't.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nSurprisingly, as every one thought (for on soma-holiday Linda was most conveniently out of the way), John raised objections. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"But aren't you shortening her life by giving her so much?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"In one sense, yes,\" Dr. Shaw admitted. \"But in another we're actually lengthening it.\" The young man stared, uncomprehending. \"Soma may make you lose a few years in time,\" the doctor went on. \"But think of the enormous, immeasurable durations it can give you out of time. Every soma-holiday is a bit of what our ancestors used to call eternity.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nJohn began to understand. \"Eternity was in our lips and eyes,\" he murmured. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\"Eh?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\"Nothing.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Of course,\" Dr. Shaw went on, \"you can't allow people to go popping off into eternity if they've got any serious work to do. But as she hasn't got any serious work \u2026\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"All the same,\" John persisted, \"I don't believe it's right.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, of course, if you prefer to have her screaming mad all the time \u2026\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIn the end John was forced to give in. Linda got her soma. Thenceforward she remained in her little room on the thirty-seventh floor of Bernard's apartment house, in bed, with the radio and television always on, and the patchouli tap just dripping, and the soma tablets within reach of her hand\u2013there she remained; and yet wasn't there at all, was all the time away, infinitely far away, on holiday; on holiday in some other world, where the music of the radio was a labyrinth of sonorous colours, a sliding, palpitating labyrinth, that led (by what beautifully inevitable windings) to a bright centre of absolute conviction; where the dancing images of the television box were the performers in some indescribably delicious all-singing feely; where the dripping patchouli was more than scent\u2013was the sun, was a million saxophones, was Pop\u00e9 making love, only much more so, incomparably more, and without end. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\"No, we can't rejuvenate. But I'm very glad,\" Dr. Shaw had concluded, \"to have had this opportunity to see an example of senility in a human being. Thank you so much for calling me in.\" He shook Bernard warmly by the hand. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nIt was John, then, they were all after. And as it was only through Bernard, his accredited guardian, that John could be seen, Bernard now found himself, for the first time in his life, treated not merely normally, but as a person of outstanding importance. There was no more talk of the alcohol in his blood-surrogate, no gibes at his personal appearance. Henry Foster went out of his way to be friendly; Benito Hoover made him a present of six packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum; the Assistant Predestinator came out and cadged almost abjectly for an invitation to one of Bernard's evening parties. As for the women, Bernard had only to hint at the possibility of an invitation, and he could have whichever of them he liked. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Bernard's asked me to meet the Savage next Wednesday,\" Fanny announced triumphantly. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"I'm so glad,\" said Lenina. \"And now you must admit that you were wrong about Bernard. Don't you think he's really rather sweet?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nFanny nodded. \"And I must say,\" she said, \"I was quite agreeably surprised.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe Chief Bottler, the Director of Predestination, three Deputy Assistant Fertilizer-Generals, the Professor of Feelies in the College of Emotional Engineering, the Dean of the Westminster Community Singery, the Supervisor of Bokanovskification\u2013the list of Bernard's notabilities was interminable. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\"And I had six girls last week,\" he confided to Helmholtz Watson. \"One on Monday, two on Tuesday, two more on Friday, and one on Saturday. And if I'd had the time or the inclination, there were at least a dozen more who were only too anxious \u2026\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHelmholtz listened to his boastings in a silence so gloomily disapproving that Bernard was offended. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"You're envious,\" he said. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHelmholtz shook his head. \"I'm rather sad, that's all,\" he answered. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBernard went off in a huff. Never, he told himself, never would he speak to Helmholtz again. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe days passed. Success went fizzily to Bernard's head, and in the process completely reconciled him (as any good intoxicant should do) to a world which, up till then, he had found very unsatisfactory. In so far as it recognized him as important, the order of things was good. But, reconciled by his success, he yet refused to forego the privilege of criticizing this order. For the act of criticizing heightened his sense of importance, made him feel larger. Moreover, he did genuinely believe that there were things to criticize. (At the same time, he genuinely liked being a success and having all the girls he wanted.) Before those who now, for the sake of the Savage, paid their court to him, Bernard would parade a carping unorthodoxy. He was politely listened to. But behind his back people shook their heads. \"That young man will come to a bad end,\" they said, prophesying the more confidently in that they themselves would in due course personally see to it that the end was bad. \"He won't find another Savage to help him out a second time,\" they said. Meanwhile, however, there was the first Savage; they were polite. And because they were polite, Bernard felt positively gigantic\u2013gigantic and at the same time light with elation, lighter than air. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Lighter than air,\" said Bernard, pointing upwards. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLike a pearl in the sky, high, high above them, the Weather Department's captive balloon shone rosily in the sunshine. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"\u2026 the said Savage,\" so ran Bernard's instructions, \"to be shown civilized life in all its aspects. \u2026\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nHe was being shown a bird's-eye view of it at present, a bird's-eye view from the platform of the Charing-T Tower. The Station Master and the Resident Meteorologist were acting as guides. But it was Bernard who did most of the talking. Intoxicated, he was behaving as though, at the very least, he were a visiting World Controller. Lighter than air. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nThe Bombay Green Rocket dropped out of the sky. The passengers alighted. Eight identical Dravidian twins in khaki looked out of the eight portholes of the cabin\u2013the stewards. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Twelve hundred and fifty kilometres an hour,\" said the Station Master impressively. \"What do you think of that, Mr. Savage?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nJohn thought it very nice. \"Still,\" he said, \"Ariel could put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"The Savage,\" wrote Bernard in his report to Mustapha Mond, \"shows surprisingly little astonishment at, or awe of, civilized inventions. This is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that he has heard them talked about by the woman Linda, his m\u2013\u2013\u2013.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n(Mustapha Mond frowned. \"Does the fool think I'm too squeamish to see the word written out at full length?\") \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Partly on his interest being focussed on what he calls 'the soul,' which he persists in regarding as an entity independent of the physical environment, whereas, as I tried to point out to him \u2026\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe Controller skipped the next sentences and was just about to turn the page in search of something more interestingly concrete, when his eye was caught by a series of quite extraordinary phrases. \" \u2026 though I must admit,\" he read, \"that I agree with the Savage in finding civilized infantility too easy or, as he puts it, not expensive enough; and I would like to take this opportunity of drawing your fordship's attention to \u2026\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nMustapha Mond's anger gave place almost at once to mirth. The idea of this creature solemnly lecturing him\u2013him-about the social order was really too grotesque. The man must have gone mad. \"I ought to give him a lesson,\" he said to himself; then threw back his head and laughed aloud. For the moment, at any rate, the lesson would not be given. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt was a small factory of lighting-sets for helicopters, a branch of the Electrical Equipment Corporation. They were met on the roof itself (for that circular letter of recommendation from the Controller was magical in its effects) by the Chief Technician and the Human Element Manager. They walked downstairs into the factory. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Each process,\" explained the Human Element Manager, \"is carried out, so far as possible, by a single Bokanovsky Group.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAnd, in effect, eighty-three almost noseless black brachycephalic Deltas were cold-pressing. The fifty-six four-spindle chucking and turning machines were being manipulated by fifty-six aquiline and ginger Gammas. One hundred and seven heat-conditioned Epsilon Senegalese were working in the foundry. Thirty-three Delta females, long-headed, sandy, with narrow pelvises, and all within 20 millimetres of 1 metre 69 centimetres tall, were cutting screws. In the assembling room, the dynamos were being put together by two sets of Gamma-Plus dwarfs. The two low work-tables faced one another; between them crawled the conveyor with its load of separate parts; forty-seven blonde heads were confronted by forty-seven brown ones. Forty-seven snubs by forty-seven hooks; forty-seven receding by forty-seven prognathous chins. The completed mechanisms were inspected by eighteen identical curly auburn girls in Gamma green, packed in crates by thirty-four short-legged, left-handed male Delta-Minuses, and loaded into the waiting trucks and lorries by sixty-three blue-eyed, flaxen and freckled Epsilon Semi-Morons. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"O brave new world \u2026\" By some malice of his memory the Savage found himself repeating Miranda's words. \"O brave new world that has such people in it.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"And I assure you,\" the Human Element Manager concluded, as they left the factory, \"we hardly ever have any trouble with our workers. We always find \u2026\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut the Savage had suddenly broken away from his companions and was violently retching, behind a clump of laurels, as though the solid earth had been a helicopter in an air pocket. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"The Savage,\" wrote Bernard, \"refuses to take soma, and seems much distressed because of the woman Linda, his m\u2013\u2013\u2013, remains permanently on holiday. It is worthy of note that, in spite of his m\u2013\u2013\u2013's senility and the extreme repulsiveness of her appearance, the Savage frequently goes to see her and appears to be much attached to her\u2013an interesting example of the way in which early conditioning can be made to modify and even run counter to natural impulses (in this case, the impulse to recoil from an unpleasant object).\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAt Eton they alighted on the roof of Upper School. On the opposite side of School Yard, the fifty-two stories of Lupton's Tower gleamed white in the sunshine. College on their left and, on their right, the School Community Singery reared their venerable piles of ferro-concrete and vita-glass. In the centre of the quadrangle stood the quaint old chrome-steel statue of Our Ford. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nDr. Gaffney, the Provost, and Miss Keate, the Head Mistress, received them as they stepped out of the plane. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Do you have many twins here?\" the Savage asked rather apprehensively, as they set out on their tour of inspection. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Oh, no,\" the Provost answered. \"Eton is reserved exclusively for upper-caste boys and girls. One egg, one adult. It makes education more difficult of course. But as they'll be called upon to take responsibilities and deal with unexpected emergencies, it can't be helped.\" He sighed. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBernard, meanwhile, had taken a strong fancy to Miss Keate. \"If you're free any Monday, Wednesday, or Friday evening,\" he was saying. Jerking his thumb towards the Savage, \"He's curious, you know,\" Bernard added. \"Quaint.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nMiss Keate smiled (and her smile was really charming, he thought); said Thank you; would be delighted to come to one of his parties. The Provost opened a door. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nFive minutes in that Alpha Double Plus classroom left John a trifle bewildered. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"What is elementary relativity?\" he whispered to Bernard. Bernard tried to explain, then thought better of it and suggested that they should go to some other classroom. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nFrom behind a door in the corridor leading to the Beta-Minus geography room, a ringing soprano voice called, \"One, two, three, four,\" and then, with a weary impatience, \"As you were.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Malthusian Drill,\" explained the Head Mistress. \"Most of our girls are freemartins, of course. I'm a freemartin myself.\" She smiled at Bernard. \"But we have about eight hundred unsterilized ones who need constant drilling.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIn the Beta-Minus geography room John learnt that \"a savage reservation is a place which, owing to unfavourable climatic or geological conditions, or poverty of natural resources, has not been worth the expense of civilizing.\" A click; the room was darkened; and suddenly, on the screen above the Master's head, there were the Penitentes of Acoma prostrating themselves before Our Lady, and wailing as John had heard them wail, confessing their sins before Jesus on the Cross, before the eagle image of Pookong. The young Etonians fairly shouted with laughter. Still wailing, the Penitentes rose to their feet, stripped off their upper garments and, with knotted whips, began to beat themselves, blow after blow. Redoubled, the laughter drowned even the amplified record of their groans. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"But why do they laugh?\" asked the Savage in a pained bewilderment. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Why?\" The Provost turned towards him a still broadly grinning face. \"Why? But because it's so extraordinarily funny.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIn the cinematographic twilight, Bernard risked a gesture which, in the past, even total darkness would hardly have emboldened him to make. Strong in his new importance, he put his arm around the Head Mistress's waist. It yielded, willowily. He was just about to snatch a kiss or two and perhaps a gentle pinch, when the shutters clicked open again. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Perhaps we had better go on,\" said Miss Keate, and moved towards the door. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"And this,\" said the Provost a moment later, \"is Hypnop\u00e6dic Control Room.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHundreds of synthetic music boxes, one for each dormitory, stood ranged in shelves round three sides of the room; pigeon-holed on the fourth were the paper sound-track rolls on which the various hypnop\u00e6dic lessons were printed. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"You slip the roll in here,\" explained Bernard, interrupting Dr. Gaffney, \"press down this switch \u2026\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"No, that one,\" corrected the Provost, annoyed. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"That one, then.

Death conditioning begins at eighteen months. Every tot spends two mornings a week in a Hospital for the Dying. All the best toys are kept there, and they get chocolate cream on death days.

It was all arranged. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nOn their way back to London they stopped at the Television Corporation's factory at Brentford. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Do you mind waiting here a moment while I go and telephone?\" asked Bernard.\nThe Savage waited and watched. The Main Day-Shift was just going off duty. Crowds of lower-caste workers were queued up in front of the monorail station-seven or eight hundred Gamma, Delta and Epsilon men and women, with not more than a dozen faces and statures between them. To each of them, with his or her ticket, the booking clerk pushed over a little cardboard pillbox. The long caterpillar of men and women moved slowly forward. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"What's in those\" (remembering The Merchant of Venice) \"those caskets?\" the Savage enquired when Bernard had rejoined him. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"The day's soma ration,\" Bernard answered rather indistinctly; for he was masticating a piece of Benito Hoover's chewing-gum. \"They get it after their work's over. Four half-gramme tablets. Six on Saturdays.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe took John's arm affectionately and they walked back towards the helicopter. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLenina came singing into the Changing Room. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"You seem very pleased with yourself,\" said Fanny. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"I am pleased,\" she answered. Zip! \"Bernard rang up half an hour ago.\" Zip, zip! She stepped out of her shorts. \"He has an unexpected engagement.\" Zip! \"Asked me if I'd take the Savage to the feelies this evening. I must fly.\" She hurried away towards the bathroom. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"She's a lucky girl,\" Fanny said to herself as she watched Lenina go. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThere was no envy in the comment; good-natured Fanny was merely stating a fact. Lenina was lucky; lucky in having shared with Bernard a generous portion of the Savage's immense celebrity, lucky in reflecting from her insignificant person the moment's supremely fashionable glory. Had not the Secretary of the Young Women's Fordian Association asked her to give a lecture about her experiences? Had she not been invited to the Annual Dinner of the Aphroditeum Club? Had she not already appeared in the Feelytone News\u2013visibly, audibly and tactually appeared to countless millions all over the planet? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHardly less flattering had been the attentions paid her by conspicuous individuals. The Resident World Controller's Second Secretary had asked her to dinner and breakfast. She had spent one week-end with the Ford Chief-Justice, and another with the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury. The President of the Internal and External Secretions Corporation was perpetually on the phone, and she had been to Deauville with the Deputy-Governor of the Bank of Europe. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"It's wonderful, of course. And yet in a way,\" she had confessed to Fanny, \"I feel as though I were getting something on false pretences. Because, of course, the first thing they all want to know is what it's like to make love to a Savage. And I have to say I don't know.\" She shook her head. \"Most of the men don't believe me, of course. But it's true. I wish it weren't,\" she added sadly and sighed. \"He's terribly good-looking; don't you think so?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"But doesn't he like you?\" asked Fanny. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Sometimes I think he does and sometimes I think he doesn't. He always does his best to avoid me; goes out of the room when I come in; won't touch me; won't even look at me.

Well, now there'd be a real chance, she thought, as she scented herself after her bath. Dab, dab, dab\u2013a real chance. Her high spirits overflowed in a song. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n''Hug me till you drug me, honey; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Kiss me till I'm in a coma; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nHug me, honey, snuggly bunny; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nLove's as good as soma.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe scent organ was playing a delightfully refreshing Herbal Capriccio\u2013rippling arpeggios of thyme and lavender, of rosemary, basil, myrtle, tarragon; a series of daring modulations through the spice keys into ambergris; and a slow return through sandalwood, camphor, cedar and newmown hay (with occasional subtle touches of discord\u2013a whiff of kidney pudding, the faintest suspicion of pig's dung) back to the simple aromatics with which the piece began. The final blast of thyme died away; there was a round of applause; the lights went up. In the synthetic music machine the sound-track roll began to unwind. It was a trio for hyper-violin, super-cello and oboe-surrogate that now filled the air with its agreeable languor. Thirty or forty bars\u2013and then, against this instrumental background, a much more than human voice began to warble; now throaty, now from the head, now hollow as a flute, now charged with yearning harmonics, it effortlessly passed from Gaspard's Forster's low record on the very frontiers of musical tone to a trilled bat-note high above the highest C to which (in 1770, at the Ducal opera of Parma, and to the astonishment of Mozart) Lucrezia Ajugari, alone of all the singers in history, once piercingly gave utterance. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSunk in their pneumatic stalls, Lenina and the Savage sniffed and listened. It was now the turn also for eyes and skin. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe house lights went down; fiery letters stood out solid and as though self-supported in the darkness. THREE WEEKS IN A HELICOPTER . AN ALL-SUPER-SINGING, SYNTHETIC-TALK1NG, COLOURED, STEREOSCOPIC FEELY. WITH SYNCHRONIZED SCENT-ORGAN ACCOMPANIMENT. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Take hold of those metal knobs on the arms of your chair,\" whispered Lenina. \"Otherwise you won't get any of the feely effects.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe Savage did as he was told. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThose fiery letters, meanwhile, had disappeared; there were ten seconds of complete darkness; then suddenly, dazzling and incomparably more solid-looking than they would have seemed in actual flesh and blood, far more real than reality, there stood the stereoscopic images, locked in one another's arms, of a gigantic negro and a golden-haired young brachycephalic Beta-Plus female. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe Savage started. That sensation on his lips! He lifted a hand to his mouth; the titillation ceased; let his hand fall back on the metal knob; it began again. The scent organ, meanwhile, breathed pure musk. Expiringly, a sound-track super-dove cooed \"Oo-ooh\"; and vibrating only thirty-two times a second, a deeper than African bass made answer: \"Aa-aah.\" \"Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah!\" the stereoscopic lips came together again, and once more the facial erogenous zones of the six thousand spectators in the Alhambra tingled with almost intolerable galvanic pleasure. \"Ooh \u2026\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nThe plot of the film was extremely simple. A few minutes after the first Oohs and Aahs (a duet having been sung and a little love made on that famous bearskin, every hair of which\u2013the Assistant Predestinator was perfectly right\u2013could be separately and distinctly felt), the negro had a helicopter accident, fell on his head. Thump! what a twinge through the forehead! A chorus of ow's and aie's went up from the audience. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe concussion knocked all the negro's conditioning into a cocked hat. He developed for the Beta blonde an exclusive and maniacal passion. She protested. He persisted. There were struggles, pursuits, an assault on a rival, finally a sensational kidnapping. The Beta blond was ravished away into the sky and kept there, hovering, for three weeks in a wildly anti-social t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the black madman. Finally, after a whole series of adventures and much aerial acrobacy three handsome young Alphas succeeded in rescuing her. The negro was packed off to an Adult Re-conditioning Centre and the film ended happily and decorously, with the Beta blonde becoming the mistress of all her three rescuers. They interrupted themselves for a moment to sing a synthetic quartet, with full super-orchestral accompaniment and gardenias on the scent organ. Then the bearskin made a final appearance and, amid a blare of saxophones, the last stereoscopic kiss faded into darkness, the last electric titillation died on the lips like a dying moth that quivers, quivers, ever more feebly, ever more faintly, and at last is quiet, quite still. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nBut for Lenina the moth did not completely die. Even after the lights had gone up, while they were shuffling slowly along with the crowd towards the lifts, its ghost still fluttered against her lips, still traced fine shuddering roads of anxiety and pleasure across her skin. Her cheeks were flushed. She caught hold of the Savage's arm and pressed it, limp, against her side. He looked down at her for a moment, pale, pained, desiring, and ashamed of his desire. He was not worthy, not \u2026 Their eyes for a moment met. What treasures hers promised! A queen's ransom of temperament. Hastily he looked away, disengaged his imprisoned arm. He was obscurely terrified lest she should cease to be something he could feel himself unworthy of. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"I don't think you ought to see things like that,\" he said, making haste to transfer from Lenina herself to the surrounding circumstances the blame for any past or possible future lapse from perfection. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Things like what, John?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Like this horrible film.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Horrible?\" Lenina was genuinely astonished. \"But I thought it was lovely.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"It was base,\" he said indignantly, \"it was ignoble.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe shook her head. \"I don't know what you mean.\" Why was he so queer? Why did he go out of his way to spoil things? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIn the taxicopter he hardly even looked at her. Bound by strong vows that had never been pronounced, obedient to laws that had long since ceased to run, he sat averted and in silence. Sometimes, as though a finger had plucked at some taut, almost breaking string, his whole body would shake with a sudden nervous start. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe taxicopter landed on the roof of Lenina's apartment house. \"At last,\" she thought exultantly as she stepped out of the cab. At last\u2013even though he had been so queer just now. Standing under a lamp, she peered into her hand mirror. At last. Yes, her nose was a bit shiny. She shook the loose powder from her puff. While he was paying off the taxi\u2013there would just be time. She rubbed at the shininess, thinking: \"He's terribly good-looking. No need for him to be shy like Bernard. And yet \u2026 Any other man would have done it long ago. Well, now at last.\" That fragment of a face in the little round mirror suddenly smiled at her. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"Good-night,\" said a strangled voice behind her. Lenina wheeled round. He was standing in the doorway of the cab, his eyes fixed, staring; had evidently been staring all this time while she was powdering her nose, waiting\u2013but what for? or hesitating, trying to make up his mind, and all the time thinking, thinking\u2013she could not imagine what extraordinary thoughts. \"Good-night, Lenina,\" he repeated, and made a strange grimacing attempt to smile. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"But, John \u2026 I thought you were \u2026 I mean, aren't you? \u2026\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe shut the door and bent forward to say something to the driver. The cab shot up into the air. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLooking down through the window in the floor, the Savage could see Lenina's upturned face, pale in the bluish light of the lamps. The mouth was open, she was calling. Her foreshortened figure rushed away from him; the diminishing square of the roof seemed to be falling through the darkness. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nFive minutes later he was back in his room. From its hiding-place he took out his mouse-nibbled volume, turned with religious care its stained and crumbled pages, and began to read Othello. Othello, he remembered, was like the hero of Three Weeks in a Helicopter\u2013a black man. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nDrying her eyes, Lenina walked across the roof to the lift. On her way down to the twenty-seventh floor she pulled out her soma bottle. One gramme, she decided, would not be enough; hers had been more than a one-gramme affliction. But if she took two grammes, she ran the risk of not waking up in time to-morrow morning. She compromised and, into her cupped left palm, shook out three half-gramme tablets.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1645846", "artist_names": "Shooting Star",

struck way\nBut something there\nWas lost along the road to Hollywood\nShe used to dream about love\nHer youth was lived out like on a stage\nBut these days she hits the strip tonight\nAll the names

gentle ways\nBut these days she hits the strip at night\nAll the names in lights, and the games to play\nShe speeds around and drives uptown\nAnd pulls out all the stops\nShe'll hit the top someday, someday\nShe's got the face and the lips and the legs\nThat fit mid-America's apple pie ways\nSells herself to the producer's couch\nFeeling down and out on the streets of L.A\nAnd while she's down she's fun to walk on\nUntil she's dead, they all wonder why\nThe applause is not for her but for the silver screen\nAnd manufactured dreams to make you cry\nSo come on give us one more, come on, one

"lyrics": "The Vampire, His Kith And Kin - Chapter 5 LyricsCHAPTER V\n\nTHE VAMPIRE IN LITERATURE\n\nA consideration of the Vampire theme in literature must of necessity be somewhat eclectic, if not even arbitrary in the selection of works which it reviews and with which it sets out to deal. Any exhaustive inquiry is well-nigh impossible, and this not so much, perhaps, on account of the wealth of the material, although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed, as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view. It is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghost-stories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear, and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation, to mass the shadows without derangement, to be occult yet not to be obscure. Accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and death-dealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the Vampire,--using this latter word in its widest sense, as one must employ it when speaking of literature, a caution which here given as regards this Chapter will serve once for all. In such a story, for example, as Dr. M. R. James' Count Magnus[1] is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire? The writer has left the point ambiguous. It is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so, and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing. It will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in Sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in Vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain Count Magnus de la Gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrg\u00e5rd. Even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman, whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church. Reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninety-two years before. Two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate. They are warned: \"No, do not go; we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking. They should be resting, not walking.\" The two men laughed and cried: \"The Count is dead; we do not care for him.\" But in the night the villagers \"hear someone scream, just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him.\" Then they hear a hideous laugh, \"it was not one of those two men that laughed, and, indeed, they have all of them said that it was not any man at all.\" In the morning they go out with the priest, and they find one of the men dead, killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot. \"He was once a beautiful man, but now his face was not there, because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones.\" The other man is standing with his back against a tree, \"pushing with his hands-pushing something away from him which was not there.\"\n\nThere was some vague gossip that the Count had been \"on the Black Pilgrimage, and had brought something or someone back with him.\" During his investigation of the papers the English traveller, Mr. Wraxall, found a Liber nigrae peregrinationis, or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the Count had once journeyed to the city of Chorazin and there adored the prince of the air. In careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum, Mr. Wraxall exclaims: \"Ah, Count Magnus, there you are. I should dearly like to see you.\" He is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions, and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide. In a state of frenzied fear he sets out for England the next day, yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures, a man in a long black cloak and a broad-leafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood. Upon landing at Harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village, when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a cross-road the two horrible creatures. He finds a lodging, but within the next forty-eight hours his pursuers fall upon him. He is discovered dead, and in the district it is still remembered how \"the jury that viewed the body fainted, seven of 'em did, and none of 'em wouldn't speak to what they see, and the verdict was visitation of God; and how the people as kep' the 'ouse moved out that same week and went away from that part.\"\n\nThis story may, I think, certainly be considered as Vampire lore, and although it must, of course, be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural I have related it at some little length here, partly because it is told so excellently well, and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess. It is brief and succinct, although there are many details, but every touch tells. No ghost story should be of any length. The horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity. The ghost is malevolent and odious. In fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness, and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree. The authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which, as we have noticed, is of intent left ill-defined. Nothing could be more crude than an explanation, and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first order.\n\nTo review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas, and which are in truth but few and unimportant, seems to be outside our province here, and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folk-lore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters, and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purpose.\nSince some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the Vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in German Universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men. Thus among the poems of Heinrich August Ossenfelder[2] we have a short piece entitled Der Vampir, which is as follows:\n\nMein liebes M\u00e4gdchen glaubet\nBest\u00e4ndig steif und feste,\nAn die gegebnen Lehren\nDer immer frommen Mutter\nAls V\u00f6lker an der Theyse\nAn t\u00f6dtliche Vampiere\nHeyduckisch feste glauben,\nNun warte nur Christianchen,\nDu willst mich gar nich lieben;\nIch will mich an dir r\u00e4chen,\nUnd heute in Tockayer\nZu einem Vampir trinken.\nUnd wenn du sanfte schlummerst,\nVon deinen sch\u00f6nen Wangen\nDen frischen Purpur saugen.\nAlsdenn wirst du erschrecken,\nWenn ich dich werde k\u00fcssen\nUnd als ein Vampir k\u00fcssen:\nWann du dann recht erzitterst\nUnd matt in meine Arme,\nGleich einer Todten sinkest\nAlsdenn will ich dich fragen,\nSind meine Lehren besser,\nAls deiner guten Mutter?\nThe poet Wieland[3] has a passing reference to the Vampire\n\nDer J\u00fcngling aus den Wolken\nHerab gefallen, stumm und bleich,\nAls h\u00e4tt' ein Vampyr ihm die Adern ausgemolken,\nSteht ganz vernichtet von dem Streich.[4]\n\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that the Vampire entered German literature with Goethe's famous ballad Die Braut von Korinth, but it would be difficult to over-estimate the influence and the popularity of this piece, the subject of which is directly derived from Phlegon of Tralles. The young Athenian who visits his father's old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the Vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride, and who declares:\n\nAus dem Grabe werd' ich ausgetrieben,\nNoch zu suchen das vermifste Gut,\nNoch den schon verlornen Mann zu lieben Und zu saugen seines Herzens Blut.\nIst's um den geschehn,\nMuss nach andern gehn,\nUnd das junge Volk erliegt der Wut.[6]\n\nEven more famous are the charnel horrors of B\u00fcrger's Lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the Gottinger Musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof Brandl gives an ample list[6] has remained a household word.\n\nIn spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary England for German romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of Lenore was published here until 1796, when William Taylor of Norwich printed in the Monthly Review of March his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation. He had, however, by his own account written the translation as early as 1790,[7] and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed, applauded and much discussed in Norwich literary circles. We know that Mrs. Barbauld who visited Edinburgh \"about the summer of 1793 or 1794\"[8] read aloud Taylor's version to a number of enthusiastic admirers. This event was described to Sir Walter Scott by Miss Cranstoun, afterwards Countess Purgstall,[9] although Scott himself mentions that his curiosity \"was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman, who, having heard Lenore once read in manuscript, could only recollect the general outline, and part of a couplet, which, from the singularity of its structure, and frequent recurrence,[10] had remained impressed on his memory.\"[11] This gentleman Was Mr. Cranstoun, the brother of Countess Purgstall, and so her statement is no doubt accurate as Scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister. It was in the course of 1794, or at any rate early in the following year that Scott made his own rendering of the ballad. The account of Taylor's version, Ellenore, which \"electrified\" the assembled company at Dugald Stewart's house when read by the famous Anna Letitia Barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original. Just about this time, however, it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent, and it was not until after some delay that a copy of B\u00fcrger's works was conveyed to him from Hamburg. He immediately devoured the German ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about Englishing it. \"I well recollect\" he writes, \"that I began my task after supper, and finished it about daybreak next morning.\"[12] Scott's friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author,\" and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception. In 1796, besides the public issue of the translations from B\u00fcrger by Taylor and by Scott, no less than three other versions appeared, from the several pens of W. R. Spencer, H. J. Pye and J. T. Stanley. The translation by the last named author was given to the public in an \u00e9dition de luxe at five shillings, as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown.[14] In 1797, a pasquil followed, Miss Kitty: a Parody on Lenora, a Ballad, \"Translated from the German, by several Hands,\" whilst in the following year, Mrs. Taylor turned the popular poem into Italian as a \"Novella Morale.\"[15] Probably the most faithful, if not the most spirited translation, was that by the Rev. J. Beresford which was published in 1800.\n\nIt was in 1797 that Coleridge wrote the first part of Christabel, and German critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of Lenore, since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree. For example, if the narrative of Geraldine be carefully read[16] it must be evident that the following judgment of Professor Brandl is without foundation. This critic writes: \"Ihre Vorgeschichte (of Geraldine) sch\u00f6pfte er grossentheils aus B\u00fcrgers 'Lenore' in Taylors Uebersetzung: die Dame ist, wenigstens ihrer Erz\u00e4hlung nach, auf einem windschnellen Ross entf\u00fchrt und halbtodt vor Furcht hier abgesetzt worden; statt des schwarzen Leichenzuges, der Lenoren auf ihrem Ritt durch die Mondnacht aufstiess, will sie 'den Schatten der Nacht' gekreuzt haben; noch zittert das verdorrte Blatt neben ihr wie aus Herzenangst.\"[17]\n\nAs we might expect, the young Shelley was enchanted by Lenore, and Medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem, which he made with his own hand.\"[18] Dowden tells the story how one Christmas Eve Shelley dramatically related the B\u00fcrger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture \"working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest \"that the company fully expected to see Wilhelm stalk into the parlour.\" In his study of Shelley, Charles Middleton has remarked: \"It is hinted, somewhat plausibly, that the Leonora of B\u00fcrgher first awakened his poetic faculty. A tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination, but his earliest pieces, written about this time, and consisting only of a few ballads, are deficient in elegance and originality, and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself.\"[20] To suggest, as Zeiger would have it,[21] that Lenore influenced the poem which in the romance St. Irvyne[22] Megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison, and which commences:\n\nGhosts of the dead! have I not heard your yelling\nRise on the night-rolling breast of the blast, . . .\nis the merest ineptitude, since these verses are taken almost word for word from \"Lachin y Gair\" in Byron's Hours of Idleness, and that had been published some four years previously.[23]\n\nAs I have elsewhere shown in some detail, Shelley's two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya: or The Moor, which appeared in 1806, and which, as the poet himself declares \"quite enraptured\" him.[24] It is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as Die Braut von Korinth and Lenore the novelists of the Gothic school, soaked though they were in German literature, searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind, do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the Vampire. It is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as Monk Lewis, \"Apollo's sexton,\" who would fain \"make Parnassus a churchyard\";[25] and Charles Robert Maturin who, as he himself confessed, loved bells rung by viewless hands, daggers encrusted with long shed blood, treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry, mad nuns, apparitions,[26] et hoc genus omne; the two lords of macabre romance, should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages. In the Gothic romance we have horror heaped on horror's head; mouldering abbeys, haunted castles, banditti, illuminati, sorcerers, conspirators, murderous monks and phantom friars, apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud: \"Surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders.\" We have such titles as the famous Horrid Mysteries; The Midnight Groan; The Abbot of Montserrat, or, The Pool of Blood; The Demon of Venice; The Convent Spectre; The Hag of the Mountains;[27] and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures, but until we come to Polidori's novel which will be considered later, nowhere, so far as I am aware, do we meet with the Vampire in the realm of Gothic fancy. So vast, however, is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that I hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited. There may be some romance which I have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims, but if such be the case I am at least prepared to say that the Vampire was not generally known to Gothic lore, and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school I think he would have re-appeared on many occasions, for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance, as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines. Inevitably one of the band, T. J. Horseley Carties, Francis Lathom, William Herbert, Edward Montague, Mrs. Roche, Eliza Parsons, Miss M. Hamilton, Mrs. Helme, Mrs. Meeke, Isabella Kelley, and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the Vampire in some funereal episode.\n\nOne might even have supposed that the notes to Southey's Thalaba the Destroyer,[28] must have put them on the track, and surely stanzas eight, nine and ten in Book VIII could not have passed unnoticed:\n\nA night of darkness and of storms!\nInto the Chamber of the Tomb\nThalaba led the Old Man,\nTo roof him from the rain.\nA night of storms! the wind\nSwept through the moonless sky,\nAnd moan'd among the pillar'd sepulchres;\nAnd in the pauses if its sweep\nThey heard the heavy rain\nBeat on the monument above.\nIn silence on Oneiza's grave\nHer father and her husband sate.\nThe Cryer from the Minaret\nProclaim'd the midnight hour.\n\"Now, now!\" cried Thalaba;\nAnd o'er the chamber of the tomb\nThere spread a lurid gleam,\nLike the reflection of a sulphur fire\nAnd in that hideous light\nOneiza stood before them. It was She . . .\nHer very lineaments. . . . and such as death\nHad changed them, livid cheeks and lips of blue;\nBut in her eye there dwelt\nBrightness more terrible\nThan all the loathsomeness of death.\n\"Still art thou living, wretch? \"\nIn hollow tones she cried to Thalaba;\n\"And must I nightly leave my grave\nTo tell thee, still in vain,\nGod hath abandoned thee?\n\n\"This is not she!\" the Old Man exclaim'd;\n\"A Fiend; a manifest Fiend!\"\nAnd to the youth he held his lance;\n\"Strike and deliver thyself!\"\n\"Strike HER!\" cried Thalaba,\nAnd palsied of all power,\nGazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.\n\"Yea, strike her!\" cried a voice, whose tones\nFlow'd with such a sudden healing through his soul,\nAs when the desert shower\nFrom death deliver'd him;\nBut obedient to that well-known voice,\nHis eye was seeking it,\nWhen Moath, firm of heart,\nPerform 'd the bidding: through the vampire corpse\nHe thrust his lance; it fell,\nAnd howling with the wound,\nIts fiendish tenant fled.\nA sapphire light fell on them,\nAnd garmented with glory, in their sight\nOneiza's spirit stood.\n\nIt is important to remark that in his notes[29] upon this passage Southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism, particularly from the Lettres Juives, the Vampires of Gradisch, also the history of Arnold Paul, and the very ample account given by Tournefort. He further says: \"The Turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves. If any man makes affidavit before a judge, that he heard a noise in a man's grave, he [i.e., the body] is, by order, dug up and chopped all too pieces. The merchants (at Constantinople) once airing on horseback, had, as usual, for protection, a Janisary with them. Passing by the burying place of the Jews, it happened that an old Jew sat by a sepulchre. The Janisary rode up to him, and rated him for stinking the world a second time, and commanded him to get into his grave again--Roger North's Life of Sir Dudley North.\"[30]\n\nIt might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the Marquis de Sade Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu and Juliette depict scenes of vampirism, and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case. In the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editions-it was first issued in 1791, 2 vols., 8vo,--until it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as La Nouvelle Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu, suivie de l'Histoire de Juliette, sa soeur, 10 vols., 18mo (of which Justine occupies four and Juliette six) Justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first, and the book has been entirely re-written. In Justine we have the episodes in the house of Monsieur Rodin, and more particularly the orgies of the Comte de Gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims, as also the cruelties of the monster Roland all of which. may well be esteemed vampirism. Many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in Juliette, and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the Muscovite giant Minski, whose favourite meat is human flesh, and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones, and Cordelli, the necrophilist of Ancona.\n\nIn The New Monthly Magazine,[31] 1 April, 1819, was published The Vampyre: a Tale by Lord Byron, which although it may seem to us--steeped in Le Fanu and M. R. James--a little old-fashioned, at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence, being even more admired and imitated on the Continent than in England. It was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of Lord Byron, but had been written by Dr. John William Polidori, physician-companion to the poet. Byron had, as a matter of fact, been writing a work of the same title in imitation of Mrs. Shelley's Frankenstein, but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in Galignani's edition of his works. A first printed, The Vampyre forms a part of extracts from \"A letter from Geneva, with Anecdotes of Lord Byron.\" Here is to be read that \"among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord Byron, Mr. p. B. Shelley, the two ladies and the gentleman (the daughters of Godwin and Dr. Polidori) before alluded to after having perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana[32] began relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of Mr. Shelley's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression. It was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation, that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency, which was undertaken by Lord Byron, the physician, and Miss M. Godwin. My friend, the lady above referred to, had in her possession the outline of each of these stories, I obtained them as a great favour, and herewith forward them to you, as I was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself, to peruse the \u00e9bauches of so great a genius, and those immediately under his influence.\" Upon this the Editor has the following note: \"We have in our possession the Tale of Dr. ------ as well as the outline of that of Miss Godwin. The latter has already appeared under the title of 'Frankenstein, or the modern Prometheus'; the former, however, upon consulting this author, we may, probably, hereafter give to our readers.\"\n\nThe Vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition. This preamble commences: \"The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common; it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human bloodsuckers fattened--and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\"\n\nThe Editor then recounts the famous instance of Arnold Paul, and continues: \"We have related this monstrous rodomontade, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise, but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earth-those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection. This supposition is, we imagine, alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the 'Giaour.'[32]\n\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent,\nThy corse shall from its tomb be rent;\nThen ghastly haunt thy native place,\nAnd suck the blood of all thy race;\nThere from thy daughter, sister, wife, p. 283\nAt midnight drain the stream of life;\nYet loathe the banquet, which perforce\nMust feed thy livid living corse,\nThy victims, ere they yet expire,\nShall know the demon for their sire;\nAs cursing thee, thou cursing them,\nThy flowers are withered on the stem.\nBut one that for thy crime must fall,\nThe youngest, best beloved of all,\nShall bless thee with a father's name--\nThat word shall wrap thy heart in flame!\nYet thou must end thy task and mark\nHer check's last tinge--her eye's last spark,\nAnd the last glassy glance must view\nWhich freezes o'er its lifeless blue;\nThen with unhallowed hand shall tear\nThe tresses of her yellow hair,\nOf which, in life a lock when shorn\nAffection's fondest pledge was worn--\nBut now is borne away by thee\nMemorial o thine agony!\nYet with thine own best blood shall drip\nThy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;\nThen stalking to thy sullen grave\nGo--and with Ghouls and Afrits rave,\nTill these in horror shrink away\nFrom spectre more accursed than they.\"\n\nAfter an allusion to Southey's Thalaba, Tournefort's Travels, and Dom Calmet's classical work, the editor concludes: \"We could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition, and we may, perhaps, resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity; for the present, we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers; and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several other synonimous with it, which are made use of in various parts of the world, namely, Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\"\n\nThe story tells how at the height of a London season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose; some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass.\" This original is invited to every house, and in the course of the winter he meets \"a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey\" he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood.\" Aubrey is greatly fascinated by Lord Ruthven, for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman, and intending to travel upon the Continent he mentions this intention to my Lord, and is \"surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\"\n\nAs they travelled from town to town, Aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters, broken gamblers and the like, but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor. However the recipients of this charity \"inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery.\" Eventually the travellers arrive at Rome, and here Aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from London the most terrible scandals, adulteries and seductions, have come to light. At Rome Aubrey is able to foil Lord Ruthven's plans, frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl, and then he \"directed his steps towards Greece, and, crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens.\" Here he lodges in the house of a Greek, whose daughter Ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty. As he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with Greek legend and tradition, and \"often, as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\"\n\nBefore long it becomes evident that Aubrey is in love with Ianthe, \"and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him.\" He endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield, and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited. When Ianthe's parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen, \"as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\"\n\nHaving given his promise to Ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early. The exploration, however, takes longer than he has supposed, and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm. The steed, alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and tired before a distant hovel in the heart of a solitary wood. \"As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stiffled exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound.\" With a terrific effort Aubrey burst open the door and rushing into the darkness \"found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized, when a voice cried \"again baffled,\" to which a loud laugh succeeded, and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled but it was in vain; he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground; his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hand upon his throat, when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him--he instantly rose and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood was not longer heard.\" Several peasants now hastened into the hut bearing flambeaus which illuminate the scene, and to the horror of all there is discovered hard by, the lifeless body of Ianthe. A curious dagger lies near, but her death was not the result of a blow from this weapon. \"There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:--upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:--to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, 'a Vampyre, a Vampyre!'\" It appears that Ianthe had followed the traveller to watch over his safety. Aubrey is carried back to the city in a raging fever, and the parents of the unfortunate girl die brokenhearted owing to so terrible a loss.\n\nWhilst Aubrey lies ill Lord Ruthven arrives in Athens and establishing himself in the same house nurses the invalid with such care that past differences are forgotten, since Aubrey not only becomes reconciled to his presence but even seeks his company. Together they travel into the wildest interior of Greece, and here in some mountain pass they are attacked by brigands, from whose guns Lord Ruthven receives a shot in the shoulder. His strength strangely decreasing, a couple of days later it is plain to all that he is at the point of death. He now exacts a terrific oath that his companion shall conceal all that is known of him and that the news of his death shall not be allowed to reach England. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see.\" Aubrey binds himself most solemnly by the prescribed oath, and in a paroxysm of hideous laughter Ruthven expires.\n\nAccording to a promise which has been obtained from the robbers by a heavy bribe the body was conveyed to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his death. Aubrey insists that it shall be interred in the ordinary way, but when he is conducted to the place it is found that the body has disappeared, and in spite of the protestations of the band he is convinced that they have buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes. One circumstance, however, gives Aubrey much food for thought. Among the effects of the deceased he discovered a sheath of most curious pattern and make which exactly fits the dagger that had been found in the deserted hut upon the occasion of Ianthe's death.\n\nReturning to England, as he retraces his journey through Rome to his horror Aubrey discovers that in spite of the precautions he had so carefully taken, Lord Ruthven succeeded only too well in his bad designs and now there is bitter sorrow and distress where once reigned peace and happiness. The lady had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship, and Aubrey instinctively divines that she has \"fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe.\"\n\nUpon his arrival in London the traveller is greeted by his sister, whose presentation into society had been delayed until her brother's return from the Continent, when he might be her protector. \"It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the busy scene.\" Upon this gay occasion the crowd was excessive, and as Aubrey heedless and distracted is watching the gay throng a voice which he recognizes only too well, whispers in this ear: \"Remember\n\np. 288\n\nyour oath.\" Turning he sees Lord Ruthven standing near him. A few nights later at the assembly of a near relation among the crowd of admirers by whom his sister is surrounded--the most prominent of the throng--he again perceives the mysterious and horrible figure. Hurrying forward he seizes his sister's arm and requests her immediately to accompany him home. However, before they have had time to retire again does the voice whisper close to him: \"Remember your oath!\"\n\nAubrey now becomes almost distracted. He sees no remedy against a monster who has already once mocked at death. Even if he were to declare all that he knew it is probable that he would hardly be believed. Whenever he attends a social gathering his looks as he scans the company become so suspicious and strange that he soon acquires a reputation for great eccentricity. As the months go on his loathing and his fears drive him well-nigh to madness, so that eventually a physician is engaged to reside in the house and take charge of him. He is a little consoled by the thought that when the year and the day have passed he will at least be able to unburden his mind and be at any rate freed from his terrible oath. It so happens that he overhears a conversation between the doctor and one of his guardians who enlarges upon the melancholy circumstance of her brother being in so critical a state when Miss Aubrey is to be married on the following day. He instantly demands the name of the bridegroom and is told the Earl of Marsden. He requests to see his sister and in an hour or two she visits him. As they are conversing she opens a locket and shows him a miniature of the man who has won her affections. To his horror he perceives that it is a portrait of Lord Ruthven and falling into convulsions of rage he tramples it under foot. In twenty-four hours the period of his oath will have expired, and he implores them to delay the wedding at least for that time. Since there seems no good reason for doing this the request is disregarded, upon which Aubrey falls into so sad a state of utter depression succeeded by an outburst of fury that the physician concludes him to be not far removed from lunacy and doubles the restraint. During the night the busy preparations for the nuptial are ceaselessly continued. It appears that upon the pretext of being her brother's dearest friend and travelling\n\np. 289\n\ncompanion Lord Ruthven had visited the house to inquire after Aubrey during his supposed derangement, and from the character of a visitor gradually insinuated himself into that of an accepted suitor. When the bridal party has assembled Aubrey, neglected by the servants, contrives to make his way into the public apartments which are decorated for the nuptials. Ere he can utter a cry, he is, however, at once perceived by Lord Ruthven who with more than human strength thrusts him, speechless with rage, from the room, at the same time whispering in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to-day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" The attendants at once secure the unhappy man, but he can no longer support his distress. In his agonies a blood vessel breaks and he is incontinently conveyed to bed. This sad accident is kept from his sister; the marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\n\n\"Aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused--he died immediately after.\n\n\"The guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a Vampyre!\"\n\nIt were not easy to overestimate the astounding sensation which was caused by this story, and the narrative is certainly not without considerable merit, for in places the eerie atmosphere is well conveyed, Nor is it difficult to understand the extraordinary influence of the tale, since it introduced a tradition which had been long forgotten and which promised infinite possibilities in the way of that sensation and melodramatic calentures which the period craved. The first separate edition of The Vampyre appeared in 1819, and was published by Sherwood. The first issue of this, which is now very rare, contains a certain amount of preliminary matter concerning the Shelleys, Byron and Godwin. This was omitted in later issues, and accordingly one often finds that copies of The Vampyre are described as First Edition, which is strictly quite correct, although they are the Second Issue,\n\np. 290\n\nand naturally of far less value in a bibliographer's eyes. A large number of reprints increased with amazing rapidity and in the same year the novel was translated into French by Henri Faber, Le Vampire, nouvelle traduite de l'anglais de Lord Byron, Paris, 1819. In February, 1820, there followed under the aegis of Charles Nodier a very obvious imitation, or rather continuation by Cyprien B\u00e9rard, Lord Ruthwen ou les Vampires. \"Roman de C. B. Publi\u00e9 par l'auteur de Jean Sbogar et de Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Aubert.[34] Paris, 1820.\" In 1825, a new translation of Polidori's story was given by Eus\u00e8be de Salles. Nor was Germany behind hand, for The Vampyre was first translated in 1819: Der Vampyr. Eine Erzahlung aus dem Englischen des Lord Byron. Nebst einer Schilderung seines Aufenthaltes in Mytilene. Leipzig, 1819. In the following year there appeared at Frankfort a version by J. V. Adrian of Byron's poems and prose, wherein was included Der Blutsuger. In a collection of Byron's work the first volume of which was published at Zwickau in 1821, The Vampyre again found a place in volume V (1821), translated by Christian Karl Meifsner as Der Vampyr. The tale has also been included in various other continental collections and translations of Byron's work even until a recent date.\n\nYet it was well-known all the while that Polidori was the author of the story, but as Byron's was by far the greater name, so this sensational novella must be attributed to the cavaliero whose romantic adventures and the scandal of whose amours were thrilling the whole of Europe. Writing in the same Year as the great poet's death Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Pichot of the University of Marseilles in his Essai sur le g\u00e9nie et le caract\u00e8re de Lord Byron[35] declared that this spurious issue \"a autant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 faire conna\u00eetre le nom de lord Byron en France, que ses po\u00ebmes les plus estim\u00e9s.\" Publishers insisted upon Le Vampire, \"nouvelle,\" being included among Byron's works, and it is said that Ladvocat was furious when it was represented to him that since it was openly acknowledged that Polidori had written The Vampire, the translation should properly be no longer given among the poet's work nor put forth under his name.\n\nAs might have been expected it was not long before the Vampire appeared upon the stage, and the first play of this kind would seem to be the famous melodrama by Charles\n\np. 291\n\nNodier (with Achille Jouffroy and Carmouche) which with music by Alexandre Piccini and scenery by Ciceri, was produced in Paris on 13th June, 1820, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin, whose directors were the popular M. M. Croznier and Merle. The r\u00f4le of Lord Rutwen was taken by M. Philippe; the celebrated Madame Dorval was Malvina;[36] and the new play had an extraordinary success.\n\nIt was immediately published as Le Vampire, m\u00e9lodrame en trois actes avec un prologue, Par M. M. . . .; Musique, de M. Alexandre Piccini; Decors de M. Ciceri. This might be purchased at 1 fr. 25cs. \"au magasin g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de pi\u00e8ces de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, Chez J.-N. Barba, Libraire, Palais Royal, derri\u00e8re le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, No. 51. \"The characters in the Prologue are Ituriel, ange de la Lune, Mlle. Descotte; Oscar, g\u00e9nie des Mariages, M. Mo\u00ebssard; and Un Vampire, M. Philippe. The scene opens in \"une grotte basaltique,\" the Caledonian caves of Staffa. Oscar and Ituriel discourse of Vampires, and the latter asks: \"Serait-il vrai que d'horribles fant\u00f4mes viennent quelquefois, sous l'apparence des droits de l'hymen, \u00e9gorger une vierge timide, et s'abreuver de son sang?\" This is indeed the case, and it is significant that on the morrow Malvina (Miss Aubray) is to wed \"le comte de Marsden.\" A vision of the sleeping Malvina appears when \"Un spectre v\u00eatu d'un linceuil s'\u00e9chappe de la plus apparente de ces tombes\" and rushes upon her. He is swiftly repulsed by Oscar, the good genius and the curtain falls. The characters in the play are: Lord Rutwen, M. Philippe; Sir Aubray, M. Perrin ou Th\u00e9ringy; Malvina, Mad. Dorval; Brigitte, Mad. St. Amand; Edgar, M. Edmon; Scop, M. Pierson; Petterson, M. Dugy; Lovette, Mlle. J. Vertpr\u00e9; Oscar, M. Mo\u00ebssard; with attendances of Domestiques and Villageois. The drama to a certain extent adroitly follows the lines of the Polidori novel, but with notable changes, which are well contrived and introduced. Lord Rutwen and Aubray have been fellow travellers, but the latter has no suspicion of Rutwen's real nature. In fact he holds him in the dearest affection since once he was saved from death by his friend who, whilst shielding him from a brigand's attack, fell by a chance shot. When Lord Rutwen arrives to claim Malvina's hand it is with delight Aubray hails his preserver on whom he supposed killed by the bandit's gun. It is cleverly explained how\n\np. 292\n\nthe wound did not after all prove fatal, whereupon \"Rutwen, mes desirs sont remplis\" cries Aubray, \"nous allons \u00eatre fr\u00e8res\" (Ils s'embrassent). Lovette a farmer's daughter of the Marsden estate is to wed Edgar, and Rutwen graciously presents himself at the marriage feast. As Lord of the Manor he is received with every respect and homage, but he immediately proceeds to attempt Lovette's virtue. Oscar \"un viellard dont la t\u00eate v\u00e9n\u00e9rable inspire le respect. Sa d\u00e9marche a quelque chose d'imposant et de myst\u00e9rieux,\" has already warned the maiden, and she coldly avoids such ardent importunities. Whilst Rutwen is actually pursuing the coy lass who shuns his embrace, Edgar in a fury fires a pistol at the seducer and he falls crying, \"Je meurs.\" Aubray hastening to the spot is barely in time to receive him in his arms, and with dying lips Rutwen adjures him to swear the following oath. \"Promets-moi que Malvina ne saura point ce qui m'est arriv\u00e9; que tu ne feras rien pour venger ma mort avant que la premi\u00e8re heure de la nuit n'ait sonn\u00e9. Jure-moi le secret sur ce coeur expirant.\" Aubray much moved cries, \"Je to le jure,\" and as Rutwen expires they lay the body gently on the ground. \"A`ce moment on voit la lune planer enti\u00e8rement sur le corps de Rutwen, et \u00e9clairer les gla\u00e7ons de la montagne. La toile tombe.\"\n\nAct III. \"repr\u00e9sente un grand vestibule gothique, la porte de la chapelle se voit au fond.\" Oscar solemnly utters words of warning to Brigitte, who is already full of fears which are not unnoticed by Malvina. When Aubray meets his sister she speaks joyfully of her marriage but as he is about to tell her of the fatal happening suddenly Rutwen appears and seizing his arm \"lui dit d'une voix sombre: 'Songe \u00e0 ton serment'!\" Aubray now realizes that there is some horrid secret and displays violent emotion crying out in broken tones: \"Eloigne-toi fant\u00f4me! . . ma soeur . . . d\u00e9robe-toi, aux poursuites de ce monstre . . . il te dira qu'il est ton \u00e9poux . . . refuse ton serment . . . cet hymen est un crime\" At length he is carried off by the servants who fear that he has lost his senses, an idea Rutwen encourages. In spite of this disorder the bridegroom now hotly presses on the nuptials; the great doors are opened \"et laisse voir la chapelle \u00e9clair\u00e9e,\" Rutwen and Malvina approach the altar. With a wild cry Aubray rushes in to intercept the ceremony,\n\np. 293\n\nupon which the monster drawing his dagger is about to plunge it deep into Malvina's heart when one o'clock strikes,--his power is gone.\" Il laisse tomber son poignard et cherche & s'enfuir, des ombres sortent de la terre et l'entra\u00eenent avec elles; l'Ange exterminateur para\u00eet dans un nuage, la foudre \u00e9clate et les Ombres s'engloutissent avec Rutwen. Pluie de feu. TABLEAU G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL.\"\n\nThe dialogue of this melodrama is spirited, the situations striking and well managed, and even in reading the play, one can clearly visualize that upon the stage it must have been extraordinarily effective, especially when set off with all the attractions of the scene painter's glowing perspectives, the magic craft of the subtle machinist, and the richest adornment of romantic costume.[37] Even before he had introduced the Vampire on to the boards Nodier had prophesied that this macabre monster would win a veritable triumph, and his prediction was amply fulfilled. \"Le Vampire \u00e9pouvantera, de son horrible amour, les songes de toutes les femmes, et bient\u00f4t sans doute, ce monstre encore exhum\u00e9 pr\u00eatera son masque immobile, sa voix s\u00e9pulcrale, son oeil d'un gris mort, . . . tout cet attirail de m\u00e9lodrame \u00e0 la Melpom\u00e8ne des boulevards; et quel succ\u00e8s alors ne lui est pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9!\"[38] On 1st July, 1819, writing in the Drapeau Blanc he was far more serious and far more emphatic: \"La fable du vampire est peut-\u00eatre la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . Elle a partout l'autorit\u00e9 de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de celle de la th\u00e9ologie ni do celle de la, m\u00e9dicine. La philosophie m\u00eame en a parl\u00e9.\"\n\nAll Paris flocked to see Le Vampire, and nightly the Porte-Saint-Martin was packed to the doors. Philippe and Madame Dorval were applauded to the echo by enthusiastic audiences who recalled them again and again after the final tableau. Even the book of the play had an immense circulation and every morning Barba's counter was freshly stocked with huge piles of the duodecimo, which rapidly diminished during the day.\n\nNot a few critics, however, adopted a very uncompromising attitude, and were unsparing in their condemnation of so popular a melodrama. In Les Lettres Normandes, 1820, (tome XI, p. 93) Le Vampire was thus noticed: \"Le m\u00e9lodrame du Vampire dans lequel on voit para\u00eetre un monstre\n\np. 294\n\nqui suce le sang des petites filles et qui offre des Tableaux qu'une honn\u00eate femme ne pout voir sans rougir, est l'ouvrage de MM. Ch. Nodier, r\u00e9dacteur du Drapeau Blanc; Achille Jouffroy, r\u00e9dacteur de La Gazette et auteur des Festes de l'anarchie; et Carmouche autre r\u00e9dacteur du Drapeau Blanc.\" This censure is, however, wholly inspired by political feeling which thus inveighed against the royalist Nodier, and which not unmingled with green jealousy we also find prominent in the Conservateur litt\u00e9raire of April, 1820 (Tome II, p. 245) where we had: \"Pour balancer le succ\u00e8s du Vampire m\u00e9lodrame d\u00e9go\u00fbtant et si monstreux que les auteurs MM. Ch. Nodier et Carmouche m'ont pas os\u00e9 se faire conna\u00eetre, le th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin se pr\u00e9pare \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter la traduction litt\u00e9rale, en prose, de la Marie Stuart de Schiller.\"\n\nYet another critic is even more trenchant and severe: \"Le Vampire Ruthwen veut violer ou sucer dans les coulisses une jeune fianc\u00e9e qui fuit devant lui sur le th\u00e9\u00e2tre: cette situation est-elle morale? . . . Toute la pi\u00e8ce repr\u00e9sente indirectement Dieu comme un \u00eatre faible ou odieux qui abandonne le monde aux g\u00e9nies de l'enfer.\"[39]\n\nYet all these attacks served but to enhance the attraction, and it is remarkable for how many years this continued undiminished. In 1823 a revival of Le Vampire with Philippe and Madame Dorval again thronged the Porte-Saint-Martin to excess. Alexandre Dumas, who was present at this production has recorded how vast was his delight, how ineffable his thrills during the sombre scenes of this sepulchral melodrame. How the theatre applauded the lean livid mask of the Vampire, how it shuddered at his stealthy steps! There are, perhaps, to be found throughout the whole of the many works of Alexandre, Dumas few pages more entertaining than those chapters in his Memoires which relate with rarest humour and not a few flashes of brilliant wit his adventures at a performance of Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1823. It would be difficult to find a livelier, and yet at the same time entirely serious and even critical, account of a theatrical performance. Unfortunately it is too long to give in full. In the edition of Mes M\u00e9moires, Troisi\u00e8me S\u00e9rie, Michel L\u00e9vy, Paris, 1863, it occupies no less than five chapters, LXXIII-LXXVII, and these are none of the shortest, (pp. 136-193). One is tempted to quote some delicious passages, but the\n\np. 295\n\naccount might lose thereby; it must be read as a delightful whole. Yet there is one extract which May certainly be made without impertinence, the story of the Vampire which was related to Dumas by his neighbour \"le monsieur poli qui lisait un Elz\u00e9vir.\" They have discussed the tradition at some length, and incidentally the good bibliophile refers his young acquaintance to the work of Dom Calmet, from whom he gives ample citations. He further remarks that he has resided in Illyria for three years, and he very sharply animadverts upon certain details on Nodier's melodrama which are foreign to the vampire tradition. \"You speak of vampires as though they really existed,\" remarks Dumas. \"Of course they exist,\" said his neighbour dryly. \"Have you ever seen one then?\" \"Most certainly I have.\" \"That was whilst you were in Illyria?\" \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Et vous y avez vu des vampires?\"\n\n\"Vous savez que c'est la, terre claissique des vampires, l'Illyrie, comme la Hongrie, la Servie, la Pologne.\n\n\"Non, je no sais pas . . . je ne sais rien. O\u00f9 \u00e9taient ces vampires que vous avez vus?\n\n\"A Spalatro. Je logeais chez un bonhomme de soixante-deux ans. Il mourut. Trois jours apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 enterr\u00e9, il apparut la nuit \u00e0 son fils et lui demanda \u00e0 manger; son fils le servit selon des desirs; il mangea et disparut. Le lendemain, le fils me raconta ce qui lui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9, me disant que bien certainement son p\u00e8re ne reviendrait pas pour une fois, et m'invitant a me mettre, la nuit suivante, \u00e0 une fen\u00eatre pour le voir entrer et sortir. J'\u00e9tais curieux de voir un vampire. Je me mis \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre; mais, cette nuit-la, il ne vint pas. Le fils me dit, alors, do ne pas me d\u00e9courager, qu'il viendrait probablement la nuit suivante.--La nuit suivante, je me remis donc \u00e0 ma fen\u00eatre, et, en effet, vers minuit, je reconnus parfaitement le vieillard. Il venait du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de cimeti\u00e8re; il marchait d'un bon pas; mais son pas ne faisait aucun bruit. Arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte, il frappa,; je comptai trois coups; les coups r\u00e9sonn\u00e8rent secs sur le ch\u00eane, comme si l'on eut frapp\u00e9 avec un os, et non avec un doigt. Le fils, vint ouvrir la porte, et le vieillard entra. . . .\n\n\"J'\u00e9coutais ce r\u00e9cit avec la plus grande attention, et je commen\u00e7ais \u00e0 pref\u00e8rer les entr'actes au m\u00e9lodrame.\n\n\"Ma curiosit\u00e9 \u00e9tait trop vivement excit\u00e9e, reprit men voisin,\n\np. 296\n\npour que je quittasse ma fen\u00eatre; j'y demeurai donc. Une demi-heure apr\u00e8s, le vieillard sortit; il retournait d'o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait venu, c'est-a-dire du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du cimetiere. A l'angle d'une muraille, il disparut. Presque au m\u00eame instant, ma porte s'ouvrit. Je me retournai vivement, c'\u00e9tait son fils. It \u00e9tait fort p\u00e2le. 'Et bien, lui dis-je, votre p\u00e8re est venu?--Oui . . . L'avez-vous vu entrer? Entrer et sortir. . . Qu'a-t-il fait aujourd'hui? Il m'a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 boire et \u00e0 manger, comme l'autre jour. Et il a bu et mang\u00e9? Il a bu et mang\u00e9 . . . Mais ce n'est pas le tout. . . voici ce qui m'inqui\u00e8te. . . Il m'a dit . . . Ah! il vous a parl\u00e9 pour autre chose que pour vous demander \u00e0, boire et a manger? . . .

Diable! Diable! Eh! oui, justement, voil\u00e0 ce qui me tracasse.' Le surlendemain, on le trouva mort dans son lit! Ce m\u00eame jour, deux ou trois autres, personnes du m\u00eame village qui avaient vu aussi le vieillard, et qui lui avaient parl\u00e9, tomb\u00e8rent malades et moururent \u00e0 leur tour. Il fut donc reconnu que le vieillard \u00e9tait vampire. On s'informa aupr\u00e8s de moi; je racontai ce que favais vu et entendu. La justice se transporta au cimeti\u00e8re. On ouvrit les tombeaux de tous ceux qui \u00e9taient morts depuis six semaines; tous ces, cadavres \u00e9taient en d\u00e9composition. Mais, quand on en vint au tombeau de Kisilova,--c'\u00e9tait le nom du vieillard,--on le trouva les yeux ouverts, la bouche vermeille, respirant \u00e0 pleins poumons, et cependant immobile, comme mort. On lui enfon\u00e7a un pieu dans le coeur; il jeta un grand cri, et rendit le sang par le bouche; puis on le mit sur un b\u00fbcher, on le r\u00e9duisit en cendre, et l'on jeta la cendre au vent. . . . Quelque temps apr\u00e8s, je quittai le pays de sorte que je ne pus savoir si son fils \u00e9tait devenu vampire comme lui.\n\n\"Pourquoi serait-il devenu vampire comme lui? demandai-je.\n\n\"Ah! parce que c'est l'habitude, que les personnes qui meurent du vampirisme deviennent vampires.\n\n\"En v\u00e9rit\u00e9, vous dites cela comme si c'\u00e9tait un fait av\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\n\"Mais c'est qu'aussi c'est un fait av\u00e9r\u00e9, connu, enregistr\u00e9!\"\n\nIt will readily be remembered that in Monte-Cristo when\n\np. 297\n\nduring the performance of Parisina at the Teatro Argentino, Rome, the Count and Haid\u00e9e enter their box, the Countess G------ directing her opera-glass in that direction asks Franz d'Epinay who they may be remarking that as for herself, \"All I can say is that the gentleman whose history I am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up; be looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours, than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!\" \"Oh, he is always as colourless as you now see him,\" said Franz. \"Then you know him?\" almost screamed the countess. \"Oh! pray do, for Heaven's sake, tell us all about--is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse, or what?\" A few moments later when the lady has carefully studied the loge of their mysterious vis-\u00e0-vis, Franz demands: \"Well, what do you think of our mysterious neighbour?\" \"Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living frame,\" was the reply. This fresh allusion to Byron drew a smile to Franz's countenance; although he could not but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him . . . . . Is it possible,\" whispered Franz, \"that you entertain any fear?\" \"I'll tell you,\" answered the countess. \"Byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me he had seen some. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us. Oh! it is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect. The coal-black hair, large bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems burning,-the same ghastly paleness!\"[40]\n\nNearly thirty years after Dumas in collaboration with Maquet utilized the theme of Le Vampire for his own drama of the same name which was given at the Ambigu-Comique, 20th December, 1851, and which may conveniently be considered here.\n\nLe Vampire is described as a \"Drame Fantastique en Cinq Actes, en Dix Tableaux\" and there are very many characters in this remarkable play. The principal parts were taken as follows: Lord Ruthwen, M. Arnault; Gilbert de Tiffauges, M. Goujet; Juan Rozo, a Spanish inn-keeper, M. Coquet;\n\np. 298\n\nBotaro, his son-in-law, M. Curcy; Lazare, M. Laurent; Lahenn\u00e9e, M. Thierry; Jarwick, M. Lavergne; the Ghoul, Mme. Lucie Mabire; H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Tiffauges, Mile. Jane Essler; Juana, Mile. Marie Clarisse; Antonia, Mlle. Daroux; Petra, Rozo's daughter, Mile. Helo\u00efse; and the mystic fairy M\u00e9lusine, Mlle. Isabelle Constant. Lazare is a capital character, but the intrusion from Oriental legend of the ghoul cannot be considered happy. On the other hand the appearance of M\u00e9lusine, whose legend was collected about the end of the fourteenth century by Jean d'Arras, is certainly effective and entirely in keeping with the history, since according to Paracelsus she was an occult power, and in folk lore she is often represented as protecting ancient houses--in Belgium she is the guardian of the old family de Gavre,--whilst one of her four sons became King of Brittany.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to do more than give the very briefest outline of the story as Dumas tells it. The play opens with a crowded scene of merrymakers in the patio of Juan Rozo's inn. They are celebrating the nuptials of his daughter with young Botaro, and every room is occupied by his friends. and acquaintance in festive mood. Juana, who is staying at the hostlery seeks for a guide to the castle of Tormenar, which lies at some little distance, for there she is to meet Don Luis de Figuerroa, whom she will wed upon the following day. She has secretly left the convent of Annunciades, where she was a boarder, since her father has other designs for her hand, and accordingly it is necessary that she should meet her betrothed in some lonely spot. But nobody, not even the good-natured Lazare, the servant of the inn, will conduct her to the haunted castle, \"un ch\u00e2teau qui est en ruine, un ch\u00e2teau qui ne loge que des reptiles, et qui n'h\u00e9berge que des fant\u00f4mes.\" However, a numerous company, amongst whom is Gilbert de Tiffauges, arrives at the inn, and these travellers on being told that they cannot be accommodated in spite of the fact that night is falling, incontinently resolve to take up their quarters in Tormenar, so in spite of the warnings about ghosts and goblins, having once well stocked themselves with wine and food they merrily set forth, Gilbert taking charge of Juana who has confided to him her story. However, a mysterious figure, a lady, apparently of rank, who has been staying at the inn watches them as they take\n\np. 299\n\ntheir departure and mutters to herself as she fixes her gaze upon Juana: \"Il te faut deux heures pour aller retrouver ton beau fianc\u00e9. . . . Je l'aurai joint dans trois minutes!\" She is in fact the ghoul, a female vampire, and with the speed of lightning she has gone to destroy the unfortunate Don Luis.\n\nIn the second Act we see the huge Gothic hall of the old castle. A door opens and from an inner chamber the ghoul rushes out exclaiming: \"Il \u00e9tait jeune! Il \u00e9tait beau! . . . Me voil\u00e0, redevenue jeune et belle!\" The voice of Gilbert is now heard, and with the cry, \"\u00c0 l'an prochain, Gilbert.\" she disappears from sight. It will be remarked that in his treatment of the vampire tradition Dumas has adopted the legend that the vampire must year by year rejuvenate his waning forces by absorbing the life of another and sucking from another's veins fresh blood, a detail which although it may recommend itself to, and legitimately be used by, the dramatist and the writer of romances is actually inexact and but rarely to be met with, and only then in folk-lore not of the first value. The travellers, no small party, spread their provisions upon the huge tables in the old hall and laughing at the stories of ghosts and apparitions are soon in convivial mood. The conversation, however, eventually turns on the supernatural and Gilbert tells of his old home in Brittany, where one room in the castle is hung with the tapestry of the Fairy M\u00e9lusine, representing this lady and all her attendants. The story goes that if any of the family sleeps in that room she will descend from the tapestry and reveal his fortune, warning him of danger should such threaten. Another companion who has sojourned in Epirus speaks of the vampires, the women who will attack men and leave them dead and sapless; the men who will attack women to drink their blood. Just as the words are uttered Lord Ruthwen enters and announces himself as a belated traveller, who, finding no room at Rozo's inn down in the village has made his way thither,-he has even taken Lazare into his service. Presently the company disperse to their several rooms to make themselves as comfortable as may be for the night in such difficult circumstances. To his horror Gilbert discovers in the chamber he is to occupy the body of a young man, strangely pale, with a slight wound in the throat. By a letter he finds near upon the body it is plain that this can be none other\n\np. 300\n\nthan the unfortunate Don Luis. At the same moment a piercing cry is heard, and Juana ghostly pale and dying totters from her room. Gilbert rushes to her assistance just in time to see Lord Ruthwen dart out after her as she falls dead at his feet. In a moment he has drawn his sword and strikes Ruthwen to the heart, before he recognizes who it may be. In faltering accents Ruthwen explains that hearing a cry he has gone to the assistance of the lady, and with his last breath he implores Gilbert, who is well-nigh distracted at the unhappy accident, to bear his body to the hillside, where it may be bathed in the earliest rays of the new moon. This Gilbert promises, and in the final tableau we see the body of Lord Ruthwen laid upon the mountain. The moon slowly issues from the clouds, and as its silver light falls upon the corpse it seems as though the eyes opened and the mouth smiled. A moment more and the Vampire leaps to his feet re-vitalized and with fresh energy for some new demoniac enterprise.\n\nIn Act III. we find ourselves in Brittany, about a year later, at the ch\u00e2teau de Tiffauges where H\u00e9l\u00e8ne awaits her brother's return. After an affectionate greeting he confides to her the secret of his love for Antonia a lady of Spalatro in Dalmatia, and she in her turn informs him that she is about to give her hand to the Baron de Marsden. This latter proves to be none other than Lord Ruthwen, who informs Gilbert that he was sore wounded indeed at Tormenar, but that certain kindly shepherds finding him on the mountain side nursed him back to life. Moreover, he explains his change of name by informing them that his elder brother having recently died, he has succeeded to the title and estates. Visiting Tiffauges in the hope of meeting Gilbert once more, he has fallen a victim to the charms of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. The explanation is cleverly contrived, but at the same time Gilbert is hardly convinced; he feels that there is some mysterious and terrible secret lurking in the background. A happy idea strikes him. He will sleep that night in the tapestry chamber of the lady M\u00e9lusine. The scene that follows must have been extraordinarily effective upon the stage. Gilbert is slumbering, and from their places in the tapestry step forth M\u00e9lusine and her court to warn the scion of her house that danger is near. From the framed canvas and the panels descend with stately stride\n\np. 301\n\nthe old barons to tell their descendant of the horror that encompasses him, M\u00e9lusine reveals the secret.\n\n\"Prions, pour qu' \u00e0 Gilbert Dieu tout-puissant inspire Un g\u00e9n\u00e9reux effort.\nRuthwen est un d\u00e9mon, Ruthwen est un vampire; Son amour, c'est la mort!\"\n\n(One cannot but recall the famous scene in Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore with its subtle admixture of beauty, fantasy and humour.)\n\nIn Act IV of Le Vampire we are shown the accomplishment of Ruthwen's designs against H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Gilbert's frenzied warnings and denunciations are heard with alarm but with unbelief. They whisper that he is a lunatic, and when Ruthwen relates a cunning story of a mischance in Spain which temporarily unsettled Gilbert's reason, a story that seems borne out in every detail by the unhappy brother's horror and despair, the attendants for his own safety seek to restrain their young master. Ruthwen triumphs. But now the ghoul appears and bids him take heed how he seeks Gilbert's life for that is hers, and she will not likely relinquish her prey. Ruthwen defies her and the two vampires part in horrid enmity. Lazare cautions H\u00e9l\u00e8ne that her brother's story is no figment, but it is too late, the vampire seizes his victim and as midnight strikes, he destroys his hapless bride and quaffs his fill from her veins. Too late Gilbert succeeds in forcing an entrance. There is a terrific struggle, and Ruthwen is hurled from the window into the depths of a tremendous valley.\n\nIn the last act we find that in order to escape the pursuit of Ruthwen, who has extricated himself unhurt but filled with designs of even more malignant vengeance, Gilbert has transported Antonia to Circassia. Here, however, we meet the ghoul who, disguising herself under the name of Ziska, obtained admittance to the castle in the quality of an attendant upon Antonia. She informs Gilbert that she alone can save his betrothed from the vampire, and at that moment the ghastly face of Ruthwen is actually seen peering through the window. She demands that he shall relinquish Antonia's hand, and accept her love though it be to death. He refuses to betray Antonia, and at length by a supreme act of renunciation she divulges the secret whereby the Vampire may be annihilated, although this revelation must put an end to her own\n\np. 302\n\nexistence. Ziska explains how Gilbert's sword is to be blessed by a priest with a certain occult formula and if the weapon thus consecrated be driven through the Vampire's heart it will once and for all rid the world of this infernal pest. Yet as she speaks she seems to vanish in flames and they hear her last sad sigh; \"Adieu pour ce monde! Adieu pour l'autre! Adieu pour l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9\"!\n\nThe final scene is a deserted cemetery. \"Tombes, cypr\u00e8s. Fond sombre et fantastique; neige sur la terre; lune rouge au ciel.\" The Vampire lies half in and half out of his grave, grinning hideously. Gilbert is standing near. \"Pour la derni\u00e8re fois, adore Dieu!\" he adjures. \"Non,\" yells the monster. \"Alors, desesp\u00e8re et meurs\"! cries Gilbert and plunges the hallowed sword into the monster's heart. The Vampire falls back into the grave, howling fearfully, and a heavy stone closing him in fast seals him there in the womb of the earth for ever and ever. \"Au nom du Seigneur, Ruthwen, je to scelle dans cette tombe pour l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9\", et Gilbert trace sur la pierre une croix que devient lumineuse. A great aureola fills the sky and. multitudes of rejoicing angels are seen. Among them are H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Juana, smiling in happiest benison, whilst there rises from the earth the body of Ziska, radiant and beautiful, to join the glorious throng among whose immortal ranks she is enrolled by the merits of her great act of renunciation and unselfish love.\n\nThis drama of Dumas is infinitely more elaborate than the play of Nodier, but I am not altogether certain whether it is in some respects so good a work. The first two acts attain a high level; the scene in the tapestry chamber would be most picturesque upon the stage; there are several other telling situations and effective speeches, but as a whole it is too prolix, and we feel that the episode of Antonia in particular is an anti-climax. Nor, as I have remarked before, although material use is made of the character, can one consider the figure of the ghoul entirely in keeping with the rest. Had the level of the opening scenes been maintained we should possess an excellent piece of work. But without concentration and compression that was hardly possible, and here we have the secret of Nodier's success. Although he has an occasional crudity, it may be, which Dumas might not have tolerated, so swift is his action, as is essential to\n\np. 303\n\nmelodrama, so cleverly does he engage the interest of his audience, that we have no time to criticize a roughness here and there, but are rather intent to follow the next turn of the tale.\n\nImmediately upon the furore created by Nodier's Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1819 vampire plays of every kind from the most luridly sensational to the most farcically ridiculous pressed on to the boards. A contemporary critic cries: \"There is not a theatre in Paris without its Vampire! At the Porte-Saint-Martin we have le Vampire; at the Vaudeville le Vampire again; at the Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s les trois Vampires ou le clair de la lune.\"\n\nJean Larat[41] further mentions a play by Paul F\u00e9val, Le fils Vampire. The version by John Wilson Ross of The Loves of Paris, a romance, published by G. Vickers, 3, Catherine Street, Strand, 1846, is said to be \"Translated from the French of Paul F\u00e9val, author of 'The Vampire,' 'The Loves of the Palais-Royal,' 'The Receipt at Midnight,' 'Stella,' 'The Son of the Devil,' etc., etc.\", but it does not appear whether \"The Vampire\" mentioned here is a play or a romance. Probably it is the latter but no such translation is known.\n\nLe Vampire which was produced at the Vaudeville, 15 June, 1820,[42] is a com\u00e9dic-vaudeville in one act by Scribe and M\u00e9lesville. The scene is laid Hungary, \"une salle d'un chateau gothique,\" and the characters are as follows: Le Comte de Valberg, feld-mar\u00e9chal, M. Guillemin; Adolphe de Valberg, son n\u00e9veu, M. Isambert; le Baron do Lourdorff, M. Fontenay; Saussmann, concierge du chateau, M. Hippolyte; Charles, valet du comte, M. Fichet; un Notaire, M. Justin; Hermance de Mansfred, Madame Rivi\u00e8re; Nancy, sa soeur, Madame Lucie; P\u00e9ters, filleul de Saussmann, Madame Minette; with attendance of domestics and wedding guests. This elegant little piece opens with nuptials of Hermance de Mansfred at the castle of the Baron de Lourdorff, to whom she is betrothed. It appears that she has something trifled with the affections of Adolphe de Valberg, now supposed dead. Her sister, Nancy, acknowledges that she loved Adolphe, but kept silence owing to his courtship of Hermance. Adolphe's uncle, the Count de Valberg, who knows nothing of the two ladies, fearing his nephew is unworthily entangled has had him held in military detention at Temesvar, whence\n\np. 304\n\nhowever he has disappeared. The intrigue of the seventeen scenes, although clearly unravelled in the play, is a little complicated, and it must suffice to relate by an accident Adolphe appears at the castle. Upon being asked his name he answers: \"Lord Ruthwen. An Englishman,\" whereupon he is immediately taken to be a Vampire and the servants are thrown into a state of panic. Eventually he is reconciled to his uncle who recognizes him as the brave young hero by whom his life was saved on a recent battlefield; Nancy's fidelity is rewarded with the hand of the man she loves, and who now realizes that Hermance's heart was never his; so that the curtain falls upon a double wedding.\n\nSeveral Pretty lyrics are interwoven with the dialogue and Nancy's first song, to the air \"De sommeiller, encor ma ch\u00e8re from Fanchon la vielleuse, is as follows:\n\nOui, ces paysans respectables\nNous rapellent le bon vieux temps:\nChez eux on croit encore au diable,\nAux vampires, au revenants;\nOn croit \u00e0 toutes les magies,\nAux amours, aux soins assidus,\nAux grands sorciers, aux grands genies . . .\nBref \u00e0 tout ce qu'on ne voit plus!\n\nLes Trois Vampires, ou le clair de, la lune[43] which was being played at the Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s is a thoroughly amusing farce in one act by Brazier, Gabriel, and Armand. It shows the adventures of a bon bourgeois, M. Gobetout, who has so distracted his brain by reading stories of Vampires and ghosts that when one night he sees in his garden three shadowy figures he is well nigh beside himself with terror as he supposes they can be no other than three vampires infesting his house. A little later he catches sight of his two daughters and their abigail who appear actually to be eating with the mysterious strangers. \"Les vampires qui soupent avec mes filles!\" he groans in accents of despair. However it proves that the supper is very material, cold chicken and a glass of good wine, whilst the rendezvous is of an amorous nature, since the visitors are two young sparks and their valet. So the play ends with a triple marriage. One remark of the worthy M. Gobetout was, it is said, nightly greeted with a hurricane of applause. He was wont to murmur in pensive accents: \"Les vampires\n\np. 305\n\nil nous viennent d'Angleterre . . . C'est encore une gentilesse de ces Messieurs . . . ils nous font de jolis cadeaux!\"\n\nAnother farce, Encore un Vampire, which when produced in 1820 at Paris, met with considerable success, was published as by Emile B. L., and yet another vampire burlesque was contributed by A. Rousseau. Les Etrennes d'un Vampire at a minor theatre was billed as from a manuscript \"trouv\u00e9 au cimiti\u00e8re de P\u00e8re-Lachaise.\"\n\nMore amusing is the work of D\u00e9saugiers who in August, 1820, gave Cadet Buteux, vampire, avec relation v\u00e9ridique du prologue et des trois actes de cet \u00e9pouvantable m\u00e9lodrame \u00e9crit sous la dict\u00e9e de ce passeux du Gros Caillou, par son secretaire, D\u00e9saugiers. When published by Rosa, 1820, this libretto bore the motto: \"Vivent les morts!\"\n\nYet another burlesque published by Martinet, 1820, is Le Vampire, m\u00e9lodrame en trois actes, paroles de Pierre de la Fosse de la rue des Morts.[44] A few verses from this vaudeville may be interesting to quote, particularly as showing the long continued popularity of Nodier's melodrama.\n\nLisant pour un sou d'politique\nPlac' Royale, sur un banc,\nJ'tombe, le tour est diabolique,\nA' point nomm\u00e9, sur l'Drapeau blanc.\n\nJ'prends un billet, non pas pour le parterre,\nCes places sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux amis,\nSans l'secours de l'abb\u00e9 Saint-Pierre,\nAvec treiz sous' j'monte au paradis.\n\nAu dernier bane, paix, qu'chacun s'taise\nA' bas la gueule on crie du premier rang,\nL'rideau s'l\u00e8ve et quoique tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l'aise,\nLe croirez-vous, j'vois le P\u00e8re Lachaise,\nDu dernier bane.\n\nThe Vampire is described as \"d'\u00e9chapp\u00e9 de corbillard,\" One sees everywhere\n\nDes fant\u00f4ms, des revenans,\nMettant la t\u00e9te a la fen\u00eatre,\nAfin d'regarder les passans.\n\nThere was even a Polichinel Vampire which when performed at the Circus Maurice in 1822 attracted all who had a mind\n\np. 306\n\nfor a hearty laugh, and a contemporary visitor[45] to Paris merrily wrote that \"Polichinel is the very jolliest fellow in the world.\"[46]\n\nA comic operetta in one act, Le Vampire by Martin Joseph Mengals which was produced at Ghent, 1 March, 1826, deserves no more than passing mention.\n\nJames Robinson Planch\u00e9 speedily adapted Nodier's Le Vampire as The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles, and his version with music by Joseph Binns Hart[47] was brought out at the English Opera House, 9th August, 1820, with T. P. Cooke[48] as Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire. Owing to his fine acting in the part, and perhaps a little to the scenic effects--the scene is laid in the Caverns of Staffa--the play was given nightly to packed houses. It is interesting to remark that for this piece the celebrated vampire trap was invented. Of this I quote the following simple description: \"A vampire trap consists of two or more flaps, usually india-rubber, through which the sprite can disappear almost instantly, where he falls into a blanket fixed to the under surface of the stage. As with the star trap, this trap is secured against accidents by placing another piece or slide, fitting close beneath when not required, and removed when the prompter's bell gives the signal to make ready.\"\n\nThe following account of the production of The Vampire is given by Planch\u00e9 in his Recollections and Reflections, Chapter III.[49] Having just spoken of an Easter piece with which he had furnished Drury Lane, Abudah, or, The Talisman of Oromanes,[50] founded upon one of the Tales of the Genii[51] and which although it had a run of nine nights Planch\u00e9 calls a very poor piece, \"miserably put on the stage,\" he continues to speak of a subsequent success, and tells us: \"A more fortunate melodrama of mine, \"The Vampire, or The Bride of the Isles,\" was produced at the Lyceum, or English Opera House, as it was then called, 9th August, 1820. Mr. Samuel James Arnold, the proprietor and manager, had placed in my hands, for adaptation, a French melodrama, entitled \"Le Vampire,\" the scene of which was laid, with the usual recklessness of French dramatists, in Scotland, where the superstition never existed. I vainly endeavoured to induce Mr. Arnold to let me change it to some place in the East of Europe. He had set his heart on Scotch music and dresses--\n\np. 307\n\nthe latter, by the way, were in stock--laughed at my scruples, assured me that the public would neither know nor care--and in those days they certainly did not--and therefore there was nothing left for me but to do my best with it. The result was most satisfactory to the management. The situations were novel and effective; the music lively and popular; the cast strong, comprising T. P. Cooke, who made a great hit in the principal character, Harley, Bartley, Pearman, Mrs. Chatterley and Miss Love. The trap now so well known as \"the Vampire trap\" was invented for this piece, and the final disappearance of the Vampire caused quite a sensation. The melodrama had a long run, was often revived, and is to this day a stock piece in the country. I had an opportunity many years afterwards, however, to treat the same subject in a manner much more satisfactory to myself, and, as it happened, in the same theatre, under the same management; but of that anon.\"\n\nThe full cast of The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles was originally as follows: \"In the Introductory Vision\"; Unda, Spirit of the Flood, Miss Love; Ariel, Spirit of the Air, Miss Worgman; The Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Lady Margaret, Mrs. Chatterly. \"In the Drama \": Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Ronald, Baron of the Isles, Mr. Bartley; Robert, an English Attendant on the Baron, Mr. Pearman; M'Swill, the Baron's Henchman, Mr. Harley; Andrew, Steward to Ruthven, Mr. Minton; Father Francis, Mr. Shaw; Lady Margaret, Daughter of Ronald, Mrs. Chatterly; Effie, Daughter of Andrew, Miss Carew; Bridget Lord Ronald's Housekeeper, Mrs. Grove. With regard to the costumes of which Planch\u00e9 speaks it is interesting to remark that the principal characters Ruthven and Lady Margaret are described as follows: Ruthven, Silver breast plate, studded with steel buttons; plaid kilt; philibeg; flesh arms and leggings; sandals; Scotch hat and feathers; sword and dagger. Lady Margaret, white satin dress, trimmed with plaid and silver; plaid silk sash; Scotch hat and feather. This is in the true transpontine tradition of Ossianic attire. The play is timed to take one hour and thirty minutes in representation-and Planch\u00e9 has done his work of adaptation very well, although I doubt whether his few slight departures from the original are improvements. Nevertheless he has\n\np. 308\n\ngiven the dialogue a native turn and an ease which were at this period too often lacking in similar versions from the French.\n\nIn 1825, T. P. Cooke visited Paris and appeared as Le Monstre at the Porte-Saint-Martin in Planch\u00e9's melodrama which proved a remarkable success, running for no less than eighty nights.\n\nThe Vampire or The Bride of the Isles has its place among the repertory of Hodgson's \"Juvenile Drama,\" and this in itself is an indication of no small popularity.\n\nIn The Second Maiden's Tragedy,[52] a Globe play of 1611, licensed for the stage by Sir George Buc on 31st October of that year, a macabre drama now generally attributed to Tourneur,[53] there are some remarkable scenes which culminate in something very like necrophilia, and a perverse ill-omened melancholy pervades the whole action. In Act IV the Tyrant, a usurper, ordering soldiers to attend him with \"Lanthornes and a pickax\" makes his way at midnight to the Cathedral, crying:\n\nDeath nor the marble prison my love sleeps in\nShall keep her body lockt up from mine arms.\nI must not be so cozened.\n\nA little later: \"Enter the Tirant agen at a farder dore, which opened, bringes hym to the Toombe wher the Lady lies buried; The Toombe here discouered ritchly set forthe.\" He adjures the sepulchre:\n\nThe house of silence and the Calms of rest\nAfter tempestuous life, I claim of thee\nA mistress one of the most beauteous sleepers\nThat ever lay so cold.\n\nThe vault is forced, whilst the lover soliloquizes:\n\nO the moon rises; what reflection\nIs thrown about the sanctified building,\nE'en in a twinkling, how the monuments glisten\nAs if Death's palaces were all massy silver\nAnd scorned the name of marble. Art thou cold?\nI have no faith in't, yet I believe none.\nMadam; 'tis I, sweet lady, pry'thee speak\n'Tis thy love calls on thee; thy king, thy servant.\nNo! not a word, all prisoners to pale silence\nI'll prove a kiss.\n\np. 309\n\nFirst Soldier:\n\nHere's chill venery!\n'Twould make a pandar's heels ache.

However this merchant of cosmetics is none other than Govianus, the rightful heir, disguised, and he fucuses the dead cheeks and lips with a peter which is confected with a strong poison, so that when the Tyrant lustfully kisses the cold flesh, he is blasted with the venom and falls in the agonies of death. The incident is extremely powerful, if extremely horrible.

Must it be raised?\nOnly to please the wickedness of thine eye?\nDoes all things end with death and not thy lust?\nHast thou devised a new way to damnation,\nMore dreadful than the soul of any sin\nDid ever pass yet between earth and hell?\n\nA very large number of plays are founded upon what may be termed the \"Romeo and Juliet\" motive, the awakening, or the restoration to life in some sort, of a loved one supposed dead, arousing from a trance, it may be, or a coma, a theme admitting almost innumerable variants. In the Italian, French and German theatres alone--nor does this rough list pretend to be exhaustive--we have Sforza d' Oddi's Imorti vivi (1576); Pagnini's Imorti vivi (1600); Rota's La morta viva (1674); Douville's Les morts vivans (1654); Quinault's Le fant\u00f4me amoureux (1659); Boursault's Le Mort vivant (1662); Sedaine's Der Tote ein Freyer (1778); Kurl\u00e4nder's Der tote Neffe; Friedrich Rambach's Der Scheintote; Leopold Huber's Der Scheintote; Theodore Friedrich's Die Scheintoten; F. L. W. Meyer's Der Verstorbene; G. Lebrun's Die Verstorbenen; Tenelli's Der Verstorbene; Holbein's \"romantisches Gem\u00e4lde\" Der Verstorbene; Paers' opera Die lebenden Toten; and a ballet\n\np. 311\n\n(1803) Der lebendige Tote; cum multis aliis quae nunc perscribere longum est.\n\nIt may be convenient here briefly to review the progress of the Vampire in the theatre, at least in his most important appearances.\n\nAn Italian opera, I vampiri, the work of the much applauded Neapolitian composer Silvestro di Palma, which was performed at the Teatro San Carlo[54] in 1800 did not of course take anything from the novel by Polidori which indeed, it preceded by nearly twenty years. but was rather inspired by the famous treatise of Guiseppe Davanzati: Dissertazione sopra i Vampiri di Gioseppe Davanzati Patrizio Fiorentino e Tranese, Cavaliere Gerosolimitano, Arcivescovo di Trani, e Patriarca d'Alessandria. (Seconda edizione.) Nalopi. M.D.CC.LXXXIX. Presso Filippo Raimondi. Con licenzi de' Superiori.\n\nOn 28th March, 1828,[65] at Leipzig, was produced an opera, \"Grosse romantische Oper,\" Der Vampyr, founded on the original French melodrama, the scene being changed from Scotland to Hungary. The libretto is by Wilhelm August Wohlbr\u00fcck and the music by his yet more famous brother-in-law Heinrich August Marschner. Der Vampyr was an enormous success. A free adaptation of this being made by J. R. Planch\u00e9, and produced at the Lyceum, 25th August, 1829, it ran for sixty nights. In his Recollections and Reflections which have before been quoted, Planch\u00e9 commences Chapter X by some account of this. \"In the summer of 1829 I had the opportunity of treating the subject of 'The Vampire' in accordance with my own ideas of propriety. The French melodrama had been converted into an opera for the German stage, and the music composed by Marschner.\n\n\"Mr. Hawes, who had obtained a score of it, having induced Mr. Arnold to produce it at the Lyceum, I was engaged to write the libretto, and consequently laid the scene of action in Hungary, where the superstition exists to this day, substituted for a Scotch chieftain a Wallachian Boyard, and in many other respects improved upon my earlier version. The opera was extremely well sung, and the costumes novel as well as correct, thanks to the kindness of Dr. Walsh, the traveller,[66] who gave me some valuable information respecting the national dresses of the Magyars and the Wallachians.\n\np. 312\n\n\"I am surprised that Marschner's most dramatic and melodious works, 'Der Vampyr,' 'Die Judin,' &c., have not been introduced to our more advanced musical audiences at one or other of our great operatic establishments.\n\n\"The production of 'Der Vampyr' was followed by that of 'The Brigand' at Drury Lane.\"\n\nPolidori's tale formed the basis of a romantic opera in three acts, the libretto of which was from the pen of C. M. Heigel, and the music by p. von Lindpaintner. This was seen at Stuttgart on 2 Ist September, 1828, and it proved a remarkable success. It was announced as being from \"Byron's famous tale,\" although at this date such an attribution can hardly have deceived any.\n\nOn 25th May, 1857, there was produced in Berlin a \"Komischen Zauber-Ballet Morgano\" by Paul Taglioni with music by J. Hertzel. The scene is laid in Hungary during the seventeenth century, and in the sixth tableau Elsa dances an infernal lavolta with the vampires in their haunted castle, but she is rescued by her lover, Retzka, who slays the vampire Morgano with a consecrated poniard. In 1861 at Milan appeared a ballet by Rotta, Il vampiro, with music by Paolo Giorza. Guten Abend Herr Fischer! oder, Der Vampyr is a light vaudeville in one act by G. Belly and G. L\u00f6ffler, with music by W. Telle, which had some success in its day. Ein Vampyr by Ulrich Franks (Ulla Wolf) given at Vienna in 1877 is a farce taken from Scribe.\n\nIn England Dion Boucicault's[57] The Vampire, in three acts was produced at the Princess's Theatre, London, 19th June, 1852, when the author made his first appearance before a metropolitan audience. Of this drama the following criticism, if criticism it may be called, was given by Henry Morley in his \"Journal of a London Playgoer.\" It must be remembered that Morley continually shows himself extremely prejudiced and his censure must not be taken any more seriously than we regard the ill-word of many critics to-day, for example, the shrill petulant piping and the childish miffs of St. John Ervine in the sullens. Under 19th June Morley writes: \"If there be any truth in the old adage, that 'when things are at the worst they must mend,' the bettering of Spectral Melodrama is not distant; for it has reached the extreme point of inanity in the new piece which was produced on\n\np. 313\n\nMonday at the Princess's Theatre, under the attractive title of The Vampire.\n\n\"Its plot is chiefly copied from a piece which some years ago turned the Lyceum into a Chamber of Horrors; but it has been spun out into three parts, facetiously described as 'Three Dramas': the little period of a century has been interposed between each part; and, in order that the outrage on the possible shall be complete, the third part is projected forward into the year that will be 1860! By this ingenious arrangement, the resuscitation of the original Vampire has been enabled to supply the lovers of the revolting at the Princess's with three acts of murder--that is, two consumated, and one attempted; but, as the delicate process of vampirical killing is exactly after the same pattern in each case, the horror is quite worn out before the career of the creature terminates. Nothing but tedious trash remains.\n\n\"To 'an honest ghost' one has no objection; but an animated corpse which goes about in Christian attire, and although never known to eat, or drink, or shake hands, is allowed to sit at good men's feasts; which renews its odious life every hundred years by sucking a young lady's blood, after fascinating her by motions which resemble mesmerism burlesqued; and which, notwithstanding its well-purchased longevity, is capable of being killed during its term in order that it may be revived by moonbeams--such a ghost as this passes all bounds of toleration.\n\n\"The monster of absurdity was personated by its reviver Mr. Boucicault, with due paleness of visage, stealthiness of pace, and solemnity of tone; the scenery, especially a moonlit ridge amidst the heights of Snowdon, was beautiful, and the costumes were prettily diversified; but the dreary repetition of fantastical horror almost exhausted even the patience which a benefit enjoins. Unfortunately, the mischief of such a piece, produced at a respectable theatre, does not end with the weariness of the spectators, who come to shudder and remain to yawn; for it is not only 'beside the purpose of playing,' but directly contravenes it; and though it may be too dull to pervert the tastes of those who witness its vapid extravagances, it has power to bring discredit on the most genial of arts.\"\n\nIt may be pointed out that this account, probably through ignorance, possibly of intent, is deliberately inaccurate. p. 314 Although confessedly a poorer play than Planch\u00e9's The Vampire Dion Boucicault's drama is not derived from the earlier piece, but both are taken from the same source, Polidori's romance. Seeing that Henry Morley was Emeritus Professor of English Literature in University College, London, it were reasonable to suppose that he should have been acquainted with Polidori's novella. Or perhaps I rather ought to say that therefor it was not to be expected he should have known of this famous work.\n\nBoucicault afterwards revived The Vampire as The Phantom, and this was given in London with good applause. The American cast of the characters of The Phantom, \"As Produced at Wallack's Theatre, New York City,\" is as follows: In Act I (1645), The Phantom, Dion Boucicault; Lord Albert Clavering, Mr. J. B. Howe; Sir Hugh Neville of Graystock, Mr. Ralton; Sir Guy Musgrave, Mr. Etynge; Ralph Gwynne, Mr. Levere; Davy, Mr. T. B. Johnstone; Lucy Peveryl, Miss Agnes Robertson; Ellen, Miss Alleyne; Maud, Miss Ada Clare; Janet, Mrs. H. P. Grattan. In Act II (1750), Alan Raby, Dion Boucicault; Colonel Raby, Mr. Ralton; Edgar, his nephew, Mr. J. B. Howe; Dr. Rees, Mr. Burnett; Curate, Mr. Paul; Corporal Stump, Mr. Peters; Ada Raby, Miss Agnes Robertson; Jenny, Mrs. L. H. Allen.\n\nSubsequently, I presume when The Phantom was given in London, some modifications were made which seem to me most decidedly to be improvements. The first act was placed in the latter part of the reign of Charles II, and two hundred years were supposed to elapse between the first and the second acts. This necessitated trifling changes in the dialogue at certain points; and naturally a complete alteration of costume to a modern style for Act II. In fact the script of the play which is printed in Dicks' Standard Plays, No. 697, (c. 1887) under \"Costume\" gives the following direction\": \"The costumes in the First Act are of the period of the latter part of the reign of Charles the Second. In the Second Art the respective characters are dressed in the provincial costume of Wales at the middle of the present century, The following description of Alan Raby's costume for each act will show the necessity of a complete change in the style of dress which this drama requires.\n\nAlan Raby.--First Act: A Puritan's suit of black serge, bound with black velvet---cloak and breeches to match-black\n\np. 315\n\nbelt and buckle-black gauntlets---shirt collar thrown back so as to show the throat bare-black stockings-black velvet shoes with strap across the instep--black sugar-loaf hat and broad riband and steel buckle--phosphoric livid countenance--slightly bald head--long black lank hair combed behind the ears--bushy black eyebrows and heavy black moustache. 2nd dress: Black dress coat and overcoat of the same colour--black trousers--black waistcoat--black kid gloves, white wristbands over them--white cravat and black German hat--all modern, and such as would be worn by a gentleman at the present time.\" In the theatre such a contrast would have proved very effective.\n\nI notice that Boucicault has in certain scenes borrowed his situations pretty freely from Le Vampire of Dumas, and occasionally he has even conveyed actual dialogue from the French play.\n\nAt the commencement of The Phantom we are shown a room in a Welsh inn, and it appears that Davy and Janet the hostess have just been married. A sudden storm sends Lucy Peveryl thither for shelter, and she confides to Janet that she is on her way to meet at sundown her cousin Roland Peveryl, who is a fugitive and proscribed. On this account he dare not openly seek her hand, but the lovers are secretly betrothed. He has promised to meet her, in order to bid her farewell for a time, in the most unfrequented spot, the ruins of Raby Castle. No sooner does Janet hear that name than she cries out with horror, and speaks of a fearful story connected with the place. They are interrupted by the arrival of Lord Clavering with a party of guests, amongst whom are friends of Lucy. She frankly informs them of her rendezvous, and they decide to accompany her, more especially as the inn has not sufficient accommodation for the travellers, who resolve to take provisions and wine and spend the night in the deserted chambers of the old castle. Davy endeavours to prevent them, nor are his efforts altogether selfish. He tells them: \"No one ever sought a night's shelter in the ruins of Raby Castle, that ever lived to see the morning. . . . Within the ruins of Raby dwells some terrible thing--man or fiend! . . . No traveller that knows the road will ever venture near that spot after nightfall; but strange wayfarers, benighted in the storm have wandered to this place of shelter, and the next morning they are found--dead--each with a wound in his throat in the right side, from which they\n\np. 316\n\nhave evidently bled to death;--but no blood is spilt around, the face is white and fixed, as if it had died of horror.\" \"And he, my betrothed,\" cries Lucy, \"Roland is there.\" Nevertheless the company laugh at these old stories and determine to make their way to the old castle. This they actually find in far better state than they have been led to expect, and their servants who have insisted upon Davy showing them the way soon get a very fair supper from the provisions they have purchased at his inn. Roland Peveryl is not to be found, but whilst they are eating a stranger enters, a Puritan, and announces himself as Gervase Rookwood, a traveller who has lost his way in the mountains. Davy, however, almost collapses with terror. He recollects that many years before the castle belonged to Sir Owen Raby, a noble cavalier, while Alan Raby, his younger brother had joined the forces of Cromwell. Taking advantage of this difference the traitor one midnight with a band of Puritan soldiers surprises the castle, and butchers the sleeping garrison, killing his brother with his own hand. About a year later, however, the tables are turned, the Royalists recapture the place, Alan Raby is seized, and in their rage they hurl the fratricide from a window which hung shudderingly over a fearful precipice. Curiously enough no trace of the body could ever be recovered. But Davy recognizes that Gervase Rookwood is none other than Alan Raby. Here we have the old belief that a man guilty of some, monstrous crime, in this case rebellion against the King and the murder of a brother, is compelled to return as a vampire. When the company disperse to their various apartments for the night Lord Clavering is horrified to discover in his room the dead body of young Roland Peveryl, \"a wound deep in his throat, but bloodless.\" At the same moment a piercing scream is heard and Lucy Peveryl rushing from her chamber with her hands wildly clasping her neck falls dead in Lord Clavering's arms. Seeing as he thinks a shadowy form that steals from her room he draws a pistol and fires. When the company hurry in with lights they discover Alan Raby has been shot. In faltering accents the dying man explains that hearing a cry for help he hastened to the lady's assistance. He will only forgive Lord Clavering on one condition. \"When I have breathed my last, let my body be conveyed amongst the peaks of Snowdon, and there exposed to the first rays of the rising\n\np. 317\n\nmoon which touch the earth.\" This is done, and the first act concludes with a tableau of the peaks of Snowdon, whilst from behind the clouds there sails high in the heaven a silver sickle that strikes the corpse with her argent shaft of mystic light. The vampire wakes, and leaps to his feet crying in exultant tones: \"Fountain of my life: once more thy rays restore me. Death! I defy thee!\"\n\nIt cannot escape notice that in this act there are many parallels with Le Vampire of Dumas. Raby Castle is the Castle of Tormenar; Lucy Peveryl is Juana; Roland Peveryl, Don Luis de Figuerroa; Lord Clavering, Gilbert de Tiffauges; and Davy the gracioso Lazare.\n\nTwo centuries have flown. Raby Castle is now inhabited in possession of Colonel Raby, whose daughter is betrothed to her cousin Edgar. It has been falsely reported that this latter fell in battle, but the scene opens with his return. When the sad news first arrived Ada Raby was stricken almost to death, and, as they believed, actually died; but she was recalled to life by a mysterious stranger, since which hour she seems to, have fallen completely under his influence and in some extraordinary way only to respond to his power. This is none other than Gervase Rookwood, who now appears and informs Colonel Raby that he and none other is the lawful lord of Raby Castle. The Colonel's claim lies in the fact that when years before the last of the old Raby family, Sir Alan Raby died, or rather was killed, and no will could be found, the estate reverted to a distant branch of the Rabys, now represented by the Colonel. However, a document is produced in the handwriting of Alan Raby, his will, wherein he bequeaths the estate to Gervase Rookwood and the Rookwood successors. It seemed as though such a title cannot be resisted, but Doctor Rees, a scholar of occultism, is filled with the gravest suspicions of the stranger. In a \"Dictionary of Necromancy, a rare work by Dr. Dee,\" he has read of vampires, and he divines the demoniac nature of the pretended Rookwood. In a trancelike state Ada Raby has rejected Edgar and is to be given to the stranger, when Dr. Rees examining the documents discovers that the will of Sir Alan Raby, which must be some two hundred years old, although the hand is doubtless that of Raby as the archives prove, is written upon paper which has a watermark of 1850, \"scarcely five years old.\" The vampire who\n\np. 318\n\nendeavours to assassinate Edgar, is killed by a charmed bullet. Whilst his limbs relax in death the hypnotic spell vanishes from Ada's mind and she is united to her lover. But to their horror they notice that as the moonlight touches the body of Alan Raby where he has fallen, his members begin to twitch anew with life. Dr. Rees seizes the vampire and hurls the body into the darkest chasm of the mountain side, where no beam nor ray can ever penetrate or find the smallest chink of entrance.\n\nThe Phantom is, of course, somewhat old-fashioned and a little stilted, as was the mode, in its diction. No doubt some of the situations could be revised and far more neatly turned, yet on the whole I conceive that it should prove of its kind excellent fare in the theatre, and some scenes, at least, in capable hands were not without emotional appeal, I had almost said a certain impressiveness. Far worse dramas have (not undeservedly) earned their meed of approbation and applause.\n\nOn 15th August, 1872, was advertised: \"Royal Strand Theatre. Production of a Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, entitled 'The Vampire,' written by R. Reece.\" There was indeed a bounteous bill of fare. At seven was given a farce, The Married Bachelor; at 7.30 Byron's Not Such a Fool as He Looks; \"At Half Past Nine the new and original Burlesque, a little Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, called The Vampire, written by R. Reece. The new Music by John Fitzgerald, the New Scenery Painted by H. P. Hall; Dresses by May, Mrs. Richardson and Assistants; Machinery by Wood; Properties by Ball. The Piece produced under the direction of Mrs. Swanborough, Mr. J. Wallace, and Mr. Reece.\" The house, says the Era, 18th August, 1872, was crowded for this \"satirical burlesque.\" His play, the author wrote, was founded upon \"a German legend, Lord Byron's story, and a Boucicaultian drama.\" The Vampire, according to Reece, is a plagiarist who lives on other people's brains. The title r\u00f4le was acted by Edward Terry who kept the audience in roars of laughter. \"Mr. Terry's make-up as the Vampire was something extraordinary, and he worked with unflagging energy to add 'go' to the novelty.\" During a picnic in the ruins of Raby Castle the Vampire endeavours to steal the note books of Ada Raby (Miss Emily Pitt) and Lady Audley Moonstone (Mrs. Raymond) two lady novelists, so that he may utilize their efforts for his weekly instalment of the \"penny dreadful\" and other fiction.\n\np. 319\n\nHe is attacked by the two lovers of the ladies, Lord Albert Clavering (Miss Bella Goodall) and Edgar (Miss Topsy Venn), and a good deal of broadest farce follows. \"The author was cordially greeted upon his appearance before the curtain, and the latest Strand burlesque may be noted as an undoubted success.\" The Illustrated London News, 24th August, 1872, although very justly doubting the propriety of the subject as a theme for travesty highly praised Edward. Terry \"as the Hibernian plagiarist with the broadest of brogues and the most ghastly of faces.\" As Allan Raby he haunts the ruins of Raby Castle, Raby Hall, and the Peak of Snowdon, seeking to filch the notebooks of tourists, \"from which he may gather materials for a three-volume novel which he has been engaged by a publisher to compose.\"\n\nOn Monday, 27th September, 1909, at the Paragon Theatre was produced The Vampire, a \"two-scene sketch,\" adapted by Mr. Jos\u00e9 G. Levy from the French of Mme. C. le Vylars and Pierre Souvestre. \"It is a capitally written little piece conceived. in the grand Guignol vein;\" The Stage, 30th September, 1909. The first scene is Harry le Strang's smoking-room. Harry has been infatuated with a demi-mondaine named Sonia, who shot herself in a fit of remorse. The despairing lover is in communication with a Hindoo spiritualist Seratsih, who has evoked the spirit of the dead woman, now become a vampire and preying upon Harry's vitality and reason. An old friend, Jack Harlinger, in order as he thinks to save the situation persuades his own fianc\u00e9e, Olga Kay, to personate the ghost of Sonia. The result is swift tragedy, for the maddened Harry le Strang shoots her dead destroying the vampire, whilst he himself falls at the revolver of Jack Harlingen Harry le Strang was played by Charles Hanbury; Jack Harlinger, Lauderdale Maitland; Seratsih, Clinton Barrett; and Olga Kay, Janet Alexander. The piece was very well received.\n\nThe Vampire, a Tragedy in Five Acts, by St. John Dorset (the Rev. Hugo John Belfour), Second Edition, 1821,[60] does not appear to have been acted. It was dedicated to W. G. Macready, Esq., whose kindness the author acknowledges in most grateful terms. The story is Oriental, the same being laid in Alexandria, and it is a \"moral\" vampire that is shown by the poet. In his \"advertisement\" he quotes a passage\n\np. 320\n\nfrom the Examiner, when noticing Planch\u00e9's melodrama wrote: \"There are Vampires who waste the heart and happiness of those they are connected with, Vampires of avarice, Vampires of spleen, Vampires of debauchery, Vampires in all the shapes of selfishness and domestic tyranny.\" This is his theme, and although his pages have considerable merit I do not conceive that his scenes would have been entirely successful on the stage, since they are poetical and reflective rather than dramatic,\n\nIn Germany sensational fiction was long largely influenced by Polidori, and we have such romances as Zschokke's Der tote Gast, Spindler's Der Vampyr und seine Braut, Theodor Hildebrand's Der Vampyr, oder die Totenbraut. Edwin Bauer's roman \u00e0 clef the clever Der Baron Vampyr,\" which was published at Leipzig in 1846, hardly concerns as here, whilst Ewald August K\u00f6nig's sensational Ein moderner Vampyr,[62] which appeared in 1883, or Franz Hirsch's Moderne Vampyr,[63] 1873, productions which only use in their titles the word \"Vampire\" to attract,--one might say, to ensnare attention, are in this connexion no more deserving of consideration than mere chap-books and pedlar's penny-ware such as Morelli's Der Vampyr, and Dr. Seltzam's pornographic Die Vampyre der Residenz.\n\nUndoubtedly the vampire tradition has never been treated with such consummate skill as by Th\u00e9ophile Gautier in his exquisite prose poem La Morte Amoureuse, which first appeared in the Chronique de Paris on 23rd and 26th June, 1836, when the young author was not quite twenty-five. Although the theme is not original yet perhaps nowhere beside has it been so ingeniously moulded with such delicacy of style, with such rich and vivid colouring, with such emotion and such repression. The darker shadows of the tradition are suggested rather than portrayed, yet none can deny that there is an atmosphere of sombre mystery, even a touch of morbid horror which with complete artistry the writer allows us to suspect rather than to comprehend. The very vagueness of the relation adds to the illusion. We hardly know whether Romuald is the young country priest occupied in prayer and good works, or whether he is the Renaissance seignior living a life of passion and hot extravagance. As he himself cries: \"Sometimes I thought I was a priest who dreamed every night that be was a nobleman, sometimes that I was a nobleman who dreamed that he was a\n\np. 321\n\npriest. I could no longer distinguish dreams from real life; I did not know where reality began and illusion ended. The dissolute, supercilious young lord jeered at the priest, and the priest abhorred the dissipations of the young lord.\" But were he humble priest, or were he profligate patrician, one emotion remained eternally the same, his love for Clarimonde. At length the Abb\u00e9 Serapion dissolves the glamour. Sternly he bids young Romuald accompany him to the deserted cemetery where Clarimonde lies buried; he exhumes the body, and as he sprinkles it with holy water it crumbles into dust. Then also has the lord Romuald gone for ever. There only remains the poor priest of God broken and alone, who grows old in an obscure parish in the depths of a wood, and who well-nigh half a century after scarcely dares to stir the ashes of that memory.\n\nThere are in English not a few stories which deal with the vampire tradition, and many of these are well imagined and cleverly contrived; the morbid horror of the thing has often been conveyed with considerable power, but yet it will, I think, be universally allowed that no author has written pages comparable to this story of Gautier. It is hardly to be disputed that the best of the English vampire stories is Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla, which the authorities upon the bibliography of this author[64] have not traced further back than its appearance in the collection entitled In A Glass Darkly, 1872,[65] Carmilla which is a story of some length, containing sixteen chapters, is exceedingly well told and it certainly exhibits that note of haunting dread which is peculiar to Le Fanu's work. The castle in Styria and the family who inhabit it are excellently done, nor will the arrival of Carmilla and the mysterious coach wherein sat \"a hideous black woman, with a sort of coloured turban on her head, who was gazing all the time from the carriage window, nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with gleaming eyes and large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in fury,\" easily be forgotten.\n\nIt must suffice to mention very briefly but a few short stories in English where the vampire element is present. E. F. Benson has evoked real horror in his The Boom in the Tower and the horrible creature tangled in her rotting shroud all foul with mould and damp who returns from her accursed grave is loathly to the last degree.\n\np. 322\n\nThe Flowering of the Strange Orchid, by H. G. Wells, introduces a botanical vampire. An orchid collector is found dead in a jungle in the Andaman Islands, with a strange bulb lying near him. This is brought to England and carefully tended by a botanist until it comes to flower. But when at last the blossoms burst open great tendrils suddenly reach out to grasp the man sucking his blood with hideous gusts. The unfortunate wretch has to be violently torn away from the plant which drips with blood scare e in time to save his life.\n\nThis idea closely resembles Fred M. White's story, The Purple Terror, which appeared in the Strand Magazine, September, 1899, Vol. xviii, No. 105. Here Lieutenant Will Scarlett, an American officer and a number of his men have to make their way across a certain tract of Cuban Territory. Spending the night in a country posada they are attracted by a pretty dancing girl who is wearing twined round her shoulders a garland of purple orchids larger than any known variety. The blossoms which a blood-red centre exhale a strange exotic perfume. Scarlett is fired with the enthusiasm of giving a new orchid to the horticultural world, and on the following morning a native, named Tito, undertakes to guide him to the spot. He learns that the natives call them \"the devil's poppies\" and that the flowers grow in the high trees where their blossoms cling to long green tendrils. As night falls the little company arrives at a plateau ringed by tall trees whose branches are crowned with great wreaths of the purple flower nestling amid coils of long green ropery. To their alarm they note that the ground is covered with bleaching bones, the skeletons of men, animals, and birds alike. Yet perforce they must camp there rather than risk the miasma of the lower valley. Scarlett keeps watch. In the darkness there is a rustling sound and suddenly a long green tendril furnished at the end with a sucker armed with sharp spines like teeth descends and snatches one of the men from the ground. As it is about to withdraw Scarlett with inconceivable swiftness slashes it through with his knife. But the man's clothing has even in that moment been cut through by the razor spines and his body is marked by a number of punctures where his blood is oozing in great drops. Immediately half-a-dozen and more lithe living cords with fanged mouths fall groping for their prey. The men are hurriedly awakened and with\n\np. 323\n\ndifficulty they extricate themselves by sending their whingers, ripping and tearing in every direction. It appears that the vampire poppies at night send down these tendrils to gather moisture. Anything which the fearful suckers can catch they drain dry, be it man or beast or bird. Lieutenant Scarlett and his men have been deliberately led into this trap by Tito, who is madly jealous of their compliments to Zara, the dancing-girl. They hold him prisoner and threaten him with condign punishment at headquarters.\n\nAlgernon Blackwood brings together two types of vampires in his story The Transfer. One is a human being, the psychic sponge, who absorbs and seems to live upon the vitality of others. He is thus described by the governess: \"I watched his hard, bleak face; I noticed how thin he was, and the curious oily brightness of his steady eyes. And everything he said or did announced what I may dare to call the suction of his presence.\" There is also a yet more horrible monster, if one may term it so, the Forbidden Corner, an arid barren spot in the midst of the rose garden, naked and bald amid luxuriant growth. A child who knows its evil secret says: \"It's bad. It's hungry. It's dying because it can't get the food it wants. But I know what would make it feel right.\" When the human vampire ventures near this spot it exerts its secret strength and draws him to itself. He falls into the middle of the patch and it drinks his energy. He lives on, but he seems to be nothing more than a physical husk or shell without vitality. As for the Forbidden Corner \"it lay untouched, full of great, luscious, driving weeds and creepers, very strong, full fed and bursting thick with life.\"\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle in his little story, The Parasite, has depicted a human vampire or psychic sponge in the person of Miss Penelosa, who is described as being a small frail creature, \"with a pale peaky face, an insignificant presence and retiring manner.\" Nevertheless she is able to obsess Professor Gilroy who says: \"She has a parasite soul, yes, she is a parasite; a monster parasite. She creeps into my form as the hermit crab creeps into the whelk's shell.\" To his horror he realizes that under her influence his will becomes weaker and weaker and he is bound to seek her presence. He resists for a while, but the force becomes so overmastering that he is compelled to yield, loathing himself as he does so. When he visits her,\n\np. 324\n\nwith a terrific effort he breaks the spell and denounces her unhallowed fascination in burning words. However, his victory is short indeed. She persecutes him most bitterly, and when he unburdens his troubles to his college professor the only result is a prescription of chloral and bromide, which promptly goes into the gutter. With devilish craft the vampire destroys his reputation as a scholar, and brings about ill-natured gossip and comment. She is able to confuse his brain during his lectures, so that he talks unintelligible nonsense and his classes become the laughing-stock of the university, until at length the authorities are obliged to suspend him from his position. Almost in despair he cries: \"And the most dreadful part of it all is my loneliness. Here I sit in a commonplace English bow-window looking out upon a common-place English street, with its garish buses and its lounging policemen, and behind me there hangs a shadow which is out of all keeping with the age and place. In the home of knowledge I am weighed down and tortured by a power of which science knows nothing. No magistrate would listen to me. No paper would discuss my case. No doctor would believe my symptoms. My own most intimate friends would only look upon it as a sign of brain derangement. I am out of all touch with my kind.\"\n\nThe unfortunate victim is driven even deeper still by this unhallowed influence, which causes him to rob a bank, violently assault a friend, and finally to come within an ace of mutilating the features of his betrothed. At length the persecution ceases with the sudden death of the vampire, Miss Penelosa.\n\nThe True Story of a Vampire is a pathetic little story, very exquisitely told, in Studies of Death, by Stanislaus Eric, Count Stenbock, who wrote some verses of extraordinary charm in Love, Sleep, and Dreams; Myrtle, Rue, and Cypress; The Shadow of Death; and who at least once in The Other Side told a macabre legend with most powerful and haunting effect. A mysterious Count Vardaleh visits the remote styrian castle of old Baron Wronski, and before long attains an occult influence over the boy heir, Gabriel. The lad wastes away, and Count Vardaleh is heard to murmur: \"My darling, I fain would spare thee; but thy life is my life, and I must live, I who would rather die. Will God not have any mercy on me? Oh, oh! life; oh, the torture of life! . . . O Gabriel, my beloved! My life, yes, life--oh, my life? I am sure this is\n\np. 325\n\nbut a little I demand of thee. Surely the superabundance of life can spare a little to one who is already dead.\" As the boy lies wan and ill, the Count enters the room and presses a long feverish kiss upon his lips. Vardaleh rushes forth, and can never be traced again. Gabriel has expired in the agony of that embrace.\n\nIn a novel, The Vampire, by Reginald Hodder, a woman who is the leader of an occult society is forced to exercise her powers as a vampire to prevent the ebbing of her vitality. Here her ravages are psychic rather than physical, albeit in fact the two so closely commingled that they are not to be separated. A curious feature in the tale is that this woman is represented as putting forth her energies through the medium of a metallic talisman, and various struggles to gain possession of the object form the theme of the story. It falls into the hands of persons who would employ it for evil purposes, when it constitutes a very formidable menace, but at the last after a number of extraordinary happenings it is happily recovered.\n\nThe traditional, but yet more horrible vampire is presented to us by F. Marion Crawford in For the Blood Is the Life. Here a young man, who has been loved by a girl whose affection he was unable to return, is after her death vampirised by her, and when his friends suspect the truth they determine to rescue him. They find him upon her grave, a thin stream of blood trickling from his throat. \"And the flickering light of the lantern played upon another face that looked up from the feast,--upon two deep, dead eyes that saw in spite of death--upon parted lips redder than life itself--upon gleaming teeth on which glistened a rosy drop.\" The situation is effectively dealt with according to the good old tradition. A hawthorn stake is driven through the heart of the vampire who emits a quantity of blood and with a despairing shriek dies the last death.\n\nAlmost equally vivid in its details must be accounted the tale, Four Wooden Stakes, by Victor Roman. The ghastly events in the lonely old house with its little grey crypt, some ten miles from the small town of Charing, a place of not more than fifteen hundred souls, are most vividly described. There lived the Holroyds, the grandfather, the father, and three brothers. Whilst in South America the grandfather \"was\n\np. 326\n\nattacked while asleep by one of those huge bats. Next morning he was so weak be couldn't walk. That awful thing had sucked his life blood away. He arrived here, but was sickly until his death, a few weeks later.\" So says Remson Holroyd, who is left the sole survivor of the family, and who has summoned his old college friend to help him solve the secret of the hideous doom which is taking toll one by one. The grandfather was not buried in the usual way; but, as his will directed, his remains were interred in the vault built near the house. Remson Holroyd continues: \"Then my dad began failing and just pined away until he died. What puzzled the doctors was the fact that right up until the end he consumed enough food to sustain three men, yet he was so weak he lacked the strength to drag his legs over the floor. He was buried, or rather interred with grand-dad. The same symptoms were in evidence in the cases of George and Fred. They are both lying in the vault. And now, Jack, I'm going, too, for of late my appetite has increased to alarming proportions, yet I am as weak as a kitten.\" The next morning the visitor finds himself so weak that he is hardly able to rise and he feels a slight pain in the neck. \"I rushed to examine it in the mirror. Two tiny dots rimmed with blood--my blood--and on my neck! No longer did I chuckle at Remson's fears, for it, the thing, had attacked me--as I slept.\" The host himself is in a state of utter exhaustion. That night watch is kept by the friend, and as from his concealment he is gazing into Remson's room he notices \"a faint reddish glow outside one of the windows. It apparently emanated from nowhere. Hundreds of little specks danced and whirled in the spot of light, and as I watched them fascinated, they seemed to take oil the form of a human face. The features were masculine, as was also the arrangement of the hair. Then the mysterious glow disappeared.\" After a few moments there appears a vague form of which the watcher is able to distinguish the head, and to his horror he sees that the features are the same as those of a portrait of the grandfather which is hanging in the picture gallery of the house. \"But oh, the difference in expression! The lips were drawn back in a snarl, disclosing two sets of pearly white teeth, the canines over developed and remarkably sharp. The eyes, an emerald green in colour, stared in a look of consuming hate.\" The horror is revealed. The house is infested by a vampire. In the morning\n\np. 327\n\nthe two friends visit the vault. \"As if by mutual understanding, we both turned toward the coffin on our left. It belonged to the grandfather. We unplaced the lid, and there lay the old Holroyd. He appeared to be sleeping; his face was full of colour, and he had none of the stiffness of death. The hair was matted, the moustache untrimmed, and on the beard were matted stains of a dull brownish hue. But it was his eyes that attracted me. They were greenish, and they glowed with an expression of fiendish malevolence such as I had never seen before. The look of baffled rage on the face might well have adorned the features of the devil in hell.\" They drive a stake through the living corpse, which shrieks and writhes, whilst the gushing blood drenches coffins and floor spurting out in great jets over the very walls. The head is severed from the body, and as the final stroke of the knife cut the connexion a scream issued from the mouth; and the whole corpse fell away into dust, leaving nothing but a wooden stake lying in a bed of bones.\" The remaining three bodies are treated in the same way, and thus the thrall of the curse is lifted from the old house, ten miles from the little town of Charing.\n\nAlthough the genius of Charles Baudelaire, when his art required it, shrank from no extremity of physical horror, yet in his exquisite poem Le Vampire he has rather portrayed the darkness and desolation of the soul:\n\nToi qui, comme un coup de couteau,\nDans mon coeur plaintif est entr\u00e9e;\nToi qui, forte comme un troupeau\nDe d\u00e9mons, vins, folle et par\u00e9e.\n\nDe mon esprit humili\u00e9\nFaire ton lit et ton domaine\n--Inf\u00e2me a qui je suis li\u00e9\nComme le forcat a la cha\u00eene,\n\nComme au jeu le joueur t\u00eatu,\nComme \u00e0 la bouteille l'ivrogne,\nComme aux vermines la charogne,\n--Maudite, maudite sois-tu!\n\nJ'ai pri\u00e9 le glaive rapide\nDe conquerir ma libert\u00e9\nEt j'ai dit au poison perfide\nDe secourir ma l\u00e2chet\u00e9.\n\np. 328\n\nHelas! le poison et le glaive\nM'ont pris en d\u00e9dain et m'ont dit\nTu n'es pas digne qu'on t'enl\u00e8ve\nA ton esclavage maudit.\n\nImb\u00e9cile!--de son empire\nSi nos efforts te d\u00e9livraient,\nTes baisers ressusciteraient\nLe cadavre de ton vampire!\n\nIn England there is a poem--truly of a very different kind--which appears in the life of the famous scientist, James Clerk Maxwell, by Lewis Campbell and William Garnett, verses written by Maxwell in 1845 when he was fourteen Years of age. The verses should not perhaps, because of the youth of the author, be criticized too sharply, and although they show Wardour Street fustian and gimcrack, since the piece is of no great length it may pardonably be quoted here. It is not entirely without a certain feeling after the right atmosphere, and much will be forgiven on account of the precocity. It is grandiosely entitled The Vampyre: Compylt into Meeter by James Clerk Maxwell.\"\n\nThair is a knichte rydis through the wood,\nAnd a douchty knichte is hee.\nAnd sure bee is on a message sent,\nHe rydis sae hastilie.\nHe passit the aik, and hee passit the birk,\nAnd bee passit monie a tre,\nBot plesant to him was the saugh sae slim,\nFor beneath it hee did see\nThe boniest ladye that ever hee saw,\nScho was sae schyn and fair.\nAnd thair scho sat, beneath the saugh,\nKaiming hir gowden hair.\nAnd then the knichte--\"Oh ladye brichte,\nWhat chance has broucht you here?\nBut sae the word, and ye schall gang\nBack to your kindred dear,\"\nThen up and spok the ladye fair--\n\"I have nae friends or kin,\nBot in a little boat I live,\nAmidst the waves' loud din.\"\nThen answered thus the douchty knichte\"\nI'll follow you through all,\nFor gin ye bee in a littel boat,\nThe world to it seemis small.\" p. 329\nThey goed through the wood, and through the wood,\nTo the end of the wood they came:\nAnd when they came to the end of the wood\nThey saw the salt sea faem.\nAnd when they saw the wee, wee boat,\nThat daunced on the top of the wave,\nAnd first got in the ladye fair,\nAnd then the knichte sae brave.\nThey got into the wee, wee boat\nAnd rowed wi' a' their micht\nWhen the knichte sae brave, he turnit about,\nAnd lookit at the ladye bricht\nHe lookit at her bonnie cheik,\nAnd bee lookit at hir twa bricht eyne,\nBot hir rosie cheik growe ghaistly pale,\nAnd schoe seymit as scho deid had been.\nThe fause, fause knichte growe pale with frichte.\nAnd his hair rose up on end,\nFor gane-by days cam to his mynde,\nAnd his former love he kenned.\nThen spake the ladye--\"Thou, fause knichte,\nHast done to me much ill,\nFor didst forsake me long ago,\nBot I am constant still:\nFor though I ligg in the woods sae cald,\nAt rest I canna bee\nUntil I sucks the gude lyfe blude\nOf the man that gart me dee.\"\nHee saw hir lipps were wet wi' blude,\nAnd hee saw hir lufolesse eyne,\nAnd loud bee cry'd, \"get frae my syde,\nThou vampyr corps encleane!\"\nBut no, bee is in hir magic boat,\nAnd on the wyde, wyde sea;\nAnd the vampyr suckis his gude lyfe blude,\nSho suckis him till hee dee.\nSo now beware, whoe'er you are,\nThat walkis in this lone wood:\nBeware of that deceitfull spright,\nThe ghaist that suckis the blude.\n\nThe Vampire Bride, a ballad by the Hon. Henry Liddell, has considerable merit, It may be found in The Wizard of the North, The Vampire Bride, and other Poems, Blackwood, Edinburgh, and Cadell, London, 1833. These stanzas are founded upon the old tale of the knight who having placed a ring--some say his wedding-ring--around the finger of the statue of Venus whilst he is a quoiting, when he would reclaim it\n\np. 330\n\nfinds that the finger is crooked so that the jewel may not be withdrawn, whilst that night a phantom claims him as her spouse. With difficulty is he freed from the thrall of the succubus.\n\nIn 1845 there was published at the Columbian Press Weston-super-mare, a little book entitled The Last of the Vampires, by Smyth Upton. The chief, some critics might say the only, merit of this tale is its excessive rarity. The narrative is somewhat curiously divided into Epochs, the first of which takes place in 1769, the second in 1777, the third and last in 1780. Chapter I opens in an English village named Frampton, but in Chapter II \"we find ourselves upon the borders of Bohemia\" in the Castle Von Oberfels. Four chapters of no great length and somewhat disconnected in their sequence comprise the First Epoch. A little later we meet with the mysterious Lord de Montfort, and apparently he has just committed a murder, since he is one of the two men who stand in a dreary outhouse adjoining Montfort Abbey. \"Red blood, yet warm, stains their murderous hands, and is seen also in pools upon the floor; the same marks are observable, also, on their clothes.\" \"The scene is a fearful one; it is one of those of which the mere recital makes the blood run cold,\" and the writer wisely does not attempt the task. In the penultimate chapter of this extraordinary production we are introduced to \"a certain young German, the Baron Von Oberfels,\" who weds Mary Learmont, the elder daughter of \"Sir James Learmont, who being a Baronet, was, moreover, a Knight of the Bath and M.P.\" Unfortunately the Baron \"was one of that horrible class, the Vampires! He had sold his soul to the evil one, for the enjoyment of perpetual youth; being bound, besides, to what are understood to be the penalties of that wretched and accursed race. Every tenth year a female was sacrificed to his infernal master. Mary Learmont was to be the next victim; may she escape the threatened doom.\" But apparently, so far as I can gather, she is not so lucky for we are vaguely told \"The Baron and his bride departed on his wedding tour. Her father and mother never hear of her more.\" A page or two later there is \"a midnight wedding\" at the Castle Von Oberfels. Of the bride we are told nothing save that she had a \"fair presence.\" \"The Baron Von Oberfels was there, once more arrayed in the\n\np. 331\n\ngarments of a bridegroom.\" The ceremony proceeds. The grand organ peals; the heavenly voices of white-robed choristers added greatly to the beauty of the scene. \"But hark! another noise is heard; sulphureous smoke half fills the sacred building; the floor opens for an instant; and mocking shrieks are audible as the spirit of the Last of the Vampires descended into perdition.\"\n\nI am bound to acknowledge that after a somewhat careful reading of this curious and most disjointed little piece of seventy-six pages the only impression with which I am met is that Mr. Smyth Upton knew nothing whatsoever of what the word vampire connotes. The idea of the victims who are sacrificed for the sake of eternal youth is, of course fairly common and was very effectively utilized by G. W. M. Reynolds in his romance The Necromancer, which ran in Reynolds's Miscellany from Saturday, 27th December, 1851, to Saturday, 31st July, 1852.[66] Incidentally it maybe remarked as a somewhat curious fact that this prolific novelist never availed himself of the vampire tradition in his melodramatic chapters.\n\nThe Vampyre. \"By the Wife of a Medical Man,\" 1858, is a, violent teetotal tract, of twenty-seven short chapters presented in the guise of fiction. The villain of the piece is \"The Vampyre Inn,\" and the dipsomaniac hero--if it be allowable to use the term in such a context--is given to ravings such as these: \"They fly--they bite--they suck my blood--I die. That hideous 'Vampyre!' Its eyes pierce me thro'--they are red--they are bloodshot. Tear it from my pillow. I dare not lie down. It bites--I die! Give me brandy--brandy--more brandy.\"\n\nA Vampire of Souls, by H. M. P., published in 1904, is a book of little value. The hero, George Ventnor, when aged twenty, is killed in a railway accident, and the narrative consists of his after experiences which are singularly material and crude. There is, perhaps, a good touch here and there, but the thing certainly does not deserve to be rescued from oblivion.\n\nIt will have been noticed that beyond the titles these two last works have really little or nothing to do with vampires at all, but we may now consider a romance which may at least be ranked as a very serious rival to--in my opinion it is far ghostlier than--its famous successor Dracula. Varney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, is undoubtedly the best novel\n\np. 332\n\nof Thomas Preskett Prest, a prolific writer of the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth century. It is true that his productions published by the well-known Edward Lloyd, of 231, Shoreditch,[67] may be classed as simple \"shockers,\" but none the less he has considerable power in this kind, and he had at any rate the craft of telling his story with skill and address. There is a certain quality in his work, which appeared during the years from 1839 to the earlier fifties, that is entirely lacking in the productions of his fellows. To him have been ascribed, doubtless with some exaggeration, well nigh two hundred titles, but the following list comprises, I believe, his principal romances: Ela, the Outcast, or, the Gipsy of Rosemary Dell; Angelina, or, the Mystery of S. Mark's Abbey, \"a Tale of Other Days \"; The Death Grasp, or, A Father's Curse; Ernnestine De Lacy, or, The Robbers' Foundling; Gallant Tom, or, The Perils of a Sailor Ashore and Afloat, \"an original nautical romance of deep and pathetic interest \"; Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street (the most famous of Prest's novels); Newgate (which has some capital episodes); Emily Fitzormond; Mary Clifford; The Maniac Father, or, The Victim of Seduction; Gertrude of the Rock; Rosalie, or, The Vagrant's Daughter; The Miller's Maid; Jane Brightwell; Blanche, or, The Mystery of the Doomed House; The Blighted Heart, or, The Priory Ruins; Sawney Bean, the Man-eater of Midlothian; The Skeleton Clutch, or, The Goblet of Gore; The Black Monk, or, The Secret of the Grey Turret[68]; The Miller and His Men, or, The Secret Robbers of Bohemia. To Prest also has been attributed, but I conceive without foundation, Susan Hoply, an audacious piracy upon the famous novel by Mrs. Crowe, Susan Hopley.\n\nVarney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, was first published in 1847. It contains no less than CCXX chapters and runs to 868 pages. The many incidents succeed each other with such breathless rapidity that it were well-nigh impossible to attempt any conspectus of the whole romance. The very length would make this analysis a work of extreme difficulty, and incidentally we may note the amazing copiousness of Prest which must ever remain a matter for wonderment. Such a romance, for example, as Newgate runs to no less than on, hundred and forty-nine chapters comprising 772 pages. The Maniac Father has fifty-four chapters, each of considerable\n\np. 333\n\nlength, which total 604 pages, and I have not selected these on account of their exceptional volume.\n\nVarney the Vampire was among the most popular of Prest's productions, and on account of its \"unprecedented success\" it was reprinted in 1853 in penny parts. To-day the book is unprocurable and considerable sums have been for many years in vain offered to secure a copy. Indeed, it may be noted that all Prest's work is excessively scarce.\n\nIt is hardly an exaggeration to affirm that of recent years there have been few books which have been more popular than Brain Stoker's Dracula, A tale, and certainly there is no sensational romance which in modern days has achieved so universal a reputation. Since it was first published in 1897, that is to say one and twenty years ago, it has run into a great number of editions, and the name has veritably become a household word. It will prove interesting to inquire into the immediate causes which have brought this book such wide and enduring fame. It has already been remarked that it is well-nigh impossible for a story which deals with the supernatural or the horrible to be sustained to any great length. Elements which at first are almost unendurable, will lose their effect if they are continued, for the reader's mind insensibly becomes inured to fresh emotions of awe and horror, and Dracula is by no means briefly told. In the ordinary reprints (Tenth Edition, 1913) it extends to more than four hundred pages, nor does it escape the penalty of its prolixity. The first part, \"Jonathan Harker's Journal,\" which consists of four chapters is most admirably done, and could the whole story have been sustained at so high a level we should have had a complete masterpiece. But that were scarcely possible. The description of the journey through Transylvania is interesting to a degree, and even has passages which attain to something like charm. \"All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear.\" Very effective is the arrival of the English traveller at the \"vast ruined castle, from, whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose\n\np. 334\n\nbroken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.\" Very adroitly are the various incidents managed in their quick succession, those mysterious happenings which at last convince the matter-of-fact commonplace young solicitor of Exeter that he is a helpless prisoner in the power of a relentless and fearful being. The continual contrasts between business conversations, the most ordinary events of the dull listless days, and all the while the mantling of dark shadows in the background and the onrushing of some monstrous doom are in these opening chapters most excellently managed.\n\nSo tense a strain could not be preserved, and consequently when we are abruptly transported to Whitby and the rather tedious courtships of Lucy Westenra, who is a lay figure at best, we feel that a good deal of the interest has already begun to evaporate. I would hasten to add that before long it is again picked up, but it is never sustained in the same degree; and good sound sensational fare as we have set before us, fare which I have myself more than once thoroughly enjoyed, yet it is difficult not to feel that one's palate, has been a little spoiled by the nonpareil of an antipast. This is not to say that the various complications are not sufficiently thrilling, but because of their very bounty now and again they most palpably fail of effect, and it can hardly escape notice that the author begins to avail himself of those more extravagant details of vampirism which frankly have no place outside the stories told round a winter's hearth, It would have been better had he confined himself to those particulars which are known and accepted, which indeed have been officially certified and definitely proved. But to have limited himself thus would have meant the shortening of his narrative, and here we return to the point which was made above.\n\nIf we review Dracula from a purely literary point of approach it must be acknowledged that there is much careless writing and many pages could have been compressed and something revised with considerable profit. It is hardly possible to feel any great interest in the characters, they are labels rather than individuals. As I have said, there are passages of graphic beauty, passages of graphic horror, but these again almost entirely occur within the first sixty pages. There are some capital incidents, for example the method by which Lord p. 335 Godalming and his friend obtain admittance to No. 347 Piccadilly. Nor does this by any means stand alone.\n\nHowever, when we have--quite fairly, I hope--thus criticized Dracula, the fact remains that it is a book of unwonted interest and fascination. Accordingly we are bound to acknowledge that the reason for the immense popularity of this romance, the reason why, in spite of obvious faults it is read and re-read--lies in the choice of subject and for this the author deserves all praise.\n\nIt might not have seemed that Dracula would have been a very promising subject for the stage, but nevertheless it was dramatized by Hamilton Deans and produced at the Wimbledon Theatre on 9th March, 1925. This version was performed in London at the Little Theatre, 14th February, 1927. On the preceding Thursday the Daily Mirror published a photograph of the late Mr. Brain Stoker accompanied by the following paragraphs. \"Herewith, one of the very few photographs of the late Brain Stoker, who, besides being Sir Henry Irving's manager for years, was an industrious novelist. As I have already said, a dramatic version of his most famous book, 'Dracula,' is to be done at the Little on Monday, and the scene of the Grand Guignol plays is appropriate, for the new piece, I hear, is so full of gruesome thrills that, in the provinces women having been carried fainting from the auditorium. Truly we take our pleasures sadly.\n\n\"The dramatic adaptation is by Hamilton Deans, whose grandfather, Colonel Deans, and the Rev. Abraham Stoker, Bram's father, lived on adjoining estates in County Dublin. Young Bram and Hamilton Deane's mother, then a young girl, were great friends. Stoker had the book 'Dracula' in his mind, and the young people used to discuss its possibilities. Strange that it should be young Hamilton Deane who has dramatized the book and brought the play to London.\"\n\nAt the Little Theatre the cast of Dracula was as follows: Count Dracula, Raymond Huntley; Abraham van Helsing, Hamilton Deane; Dr. Seward, Stuart Lomath; Jonathan Harker, Bernard Guest; Quincey P. Morris, Frieda Hearn; Lord Godalming, Peter Jackson; R. M. Renfield, Bernard Jukes; The Warden, Jack Howarth; The Parlourmaid, Hilda Macleod; The Housemaid, Betty Murgatroyd; Mina Harker, Dora Mary Patrick.\n\np. 336\n\nBy no stretch could it be called a good play, whilst the presentation, at the best, can hardly be described as more than reasonably adequate. In one or two instances the effects, upon which so much depends and which obviously demanded the most scrupulous care, were so clumsily contrived as to excite an involuntary smile. \"It was only a step from the devilish to the ridiculous on Monday night,\" said the Era, 16th February, 1927. Very remarkable was a lady, dressed in the uniform of a hospital nurse who sat in the vestibule of the theatre, and it was bruited that her services were required by members of the audience who were overcome owing to the horrors of the drama. I can only say that I find this canard impossible to believe, quodcumque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi. As an advertisement, and it can surely have been nothing else, the attendance of a nurse was in deplorable taste. I am informed that after the first few weeks a kind of epilogue was spoken when all the characters were assembled upon the stage, and it was explained that the audience must not be distressed at what they had seen, that it was comically intended for their entertainment. So gross a lapse of good manners, not to speak of the artistic indecorum, is hardly credible.[69]\n\nConfessedly the play was extremely weak, and yet such is the fascination of this subject that it had an exceptional success, and triumphantly made its way from theatre to theatre. On 25th July, 1927, Dracula was transferred to the Duke of York's; on the 29th August, following to the Prince of Wales, on 10th October to the Garrick; and all the while it was given to thronging houses. It has also toured, and at the present moment is still touring the provincial theatres with the most marked success, the drama being given with more spirit and vigour than originally was the case at the Little, and Wilfrid Fletcher in particular playing the lunatic Renfield with a real touch of wistful pathos and uncanny horror. This is is extremely instructive, and it is curious that the vogue of the \"vampire play\" in London should be repeated almost exactly after the interval of a century. On 5th November, 1927, a new version of Dracula by Charles Morrel was presented at the Court Theatre, Warrington.\n\nIn America the dramatization of Dracula was produced at the Shubert, New Haven, 19th September, 1927. This was given at the Fulton, New York, upon the following 5th October.\n\np. 337\n\nJonathan Harker was acted by Terence Neil; Abraham Van Helsing by Edward Van Sloan; Renfield by Bernard Jukes; and Count Dracula by Bela Lugoni .\n\nAs I have before remarked, the striking fact that an indifferent play should prove so successful can, I think, only be attributed to the fascination of the theme.

protocol and keeping the system running\nCompetition we gunning, your spot you better run it\nSo many years in the game but yet we still running\n\n[Verse 1: Termanology]\nMost important thing you got in this life is your health\nDon't distort it or destroy acquiring wealth\nIt's like a storm around the corner just fire in hell\nNo more crying for help, now I rely on myself\nI decided I felt enough pain, fuck shame\nI'm still picking up sluts, fucking them in the Mustang\nMan I never trust a bitch cause these slut dames\nPlay smut games, throw dirt in your shit like what name\nThe devil is evil, sometimes it come as your friend\nBut that's the one he sent to deceive you\nYour eyes open enough, just for me to read through\nKeep sneaking end up in Satan's bed with his people\nI never mislead you, speaking you the truth to the end\nIn the church, tears pouring again\nI roll with the drug smugglers, hustlers and the G's\nBut still pour my heart out when it comes to these beats\n[Chorus: Termanology]\nYoung or old, never fold, never catch me running\nFollowing protocol and keeping the system running\nCompetition we gunning, your spot you better run it\nSo many years in the game but

game but yet we still running\n\n[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]\nI hurt your feelings buddy, we working with silly money\nYou playing with silly putty, your nose is still putty\nPockets is real chubby, sort of like Checker\nG your home wrecker, fuck up your home sector\nIs she a bone inspector, you get the chrome Heckler\nJust eat your dome flesh up, I'll give you stone pressure\nWe tryna raise bread up, my shit can raise the dead up\nTwenty eight days later, zombie bullets ate your face up\nThe nickel plate face up, Nicholas Cage your face off\nCome in and knock your face off, my lawyer knock the case off\nYou better knock your shit off, Homie I knock your shit off\nFive, Four, Three, Two, One, Zero rocket lift off\nCome in your hit get lost, you cross the line get crossed\nNothing in line big boss, I flick your mind switch off\nHis whole line kick off, remember times in the North\nNow bring it down to the south, and let 'em find shit out\nYou might also like[Chorus: Termanology]\nYoung or

getting thin\nTell the truth, you ain't see me getting in, but I did it again\nMajor deals, Sony pub, entourage, ratchet Monday\nNever had a hit, but shit nigga made a stack of money\nI'm the definition of what legends should be\nIs it me, nobody better than G and they never could be\nYou could not compare entertainer to an innovator\nBut his songs do not belong in the incinerator\nIt's like he Rakim's cousin, like he kin to Jada\nBut its no relation, his flow come with extended flavor\nHard work and dedication, like he Floyd boy\nHell nah, y'all ain't fucking with your boy boy\nHe went from Ill Street Blues, to spitting real street news\nA real street dude, you might wanna avoid boy\n[Chorus: Termanology]\nYoung or old, never fold, never catch me running\nFollowing protocol and

It\u2019s April, well after two in the morning, and we\u2019re packed into a narrow recording studio in Burbank, California, the same studio where the 28-year-old rapper from Philadelphia has spent most other nights this year. The building is hidden in a residential neighborhood behind a high, automatic gate; the room reeks of berry-flavored blunt wraps and has a murky, claustrophobic atmosphere, like what I imagine it must feel like to be aboard a submarine, albeit one with a bar stocked with bottles of Ciroc and bowls of red grapes. Members of Meek\u2019s entourage, old friends who he now semi-employs for a variety of unspecific tasks, drift in and out of sleep in the next room.\n\nThe same two tracks have been playing on loop for several minutes, as Meek and Nicki Minaj, his girlfriend, argue gently over which song should be released as a single from his sophomore album, Dreams Worth More Than Money, which he\u2019s scheduled to complete within the week. Because the couple can\u2019t seem to agree, Nicki, who is dressed in a black T-shirt that says \u201cFEELING MYSELF,\u201d cheerfully suggests that they poll the room. The producer, Bangladesh, crouched over his MacBook, cocks his head to the side; the engineer, Cruz, who has been dropping ice cubes into the base of an enormous hookah, puts down his tongs.\n\nFor the single, Meek wants an irrefutable pop song. \u201cI can see a crowd of people singing it,\u201d he says of his pick, which they\u2019re tentatively calling \u201cBad.\u201d He waves his lighter in the air and sways as it plays through. For her part, Nicki has been pleading with him to trust her proven pop instincts, which are leaning firmly toward the other option, \u201cAll Eyes on You.\u201d \u201cYour voice sounds ill, the flow sounds ill,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is going to get played on the radio. It\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d Both songs are slow-burning, sensual ballads that seem slightly at odds with Meek\u2019s traditionally louder, brasher sound, but this is part of the project of the new record, as he explains it: to present an \u201colder, more experienced Meek Mill.\u201dDreams Worth More Than Money was originally scheduled to be released last year, but it was pushed back by Meek\u2019s label, Atlantic, after he was sentenced to six months in prison. (He has been on probation since 2008 for a gun charge, and was sentenced last July for not communicating with the court to its satisfaction.) Though he admits he\u2019s \u201cgetting anxious\u201d about the looming deadline, he\u2019s clearly not thrilled at the idea of finishing it via focus group. \u201cOnly one person in the room knows how to make a Meek Mill record,\u201d he says, stating the obvious. Still, he plays along.\n\n\u201cAll in favor of the first single being \u2018Bad,\u2019 put your hands up,\u201d Nicki says, standing up to count the votes. No one moves. \u201cAll in favor of \u2018All Eyes on You\u2019?\u201d She is persuasive. Making hip-hop work in the pop world is her specialty, after all. Hands come up, one by one. \u201cOh my god, Rihmeek,\u201d Nicki groans exaggeratedly, invoking Meek\u2019s middle name for effect. \u201cEvery hand went up, baby. Now you got a roomful of honest opinions. You can take it or leave it.\u201d\n\nHe leaves it. Either betrayed or bemused\u2014it\u2019s always difficult to tell\u2014Meek is done. He turns back to his computer screen, waving off the vote as pointless. \u201cHonest opinions is cool,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my mind\u2019s made up.\u201d He laughs a little, and at that, at least for the night, the conversation is over.\nOne afternoon, we take a break from the studio to shoot photos for this magazine and drive north up the Pacific Coast Highway in a black limousine van, heading for a secluded cove in Malibu called El Matador Beach. Opposite the sea are endless rows of palms trees, adobe mansions, and scattered construction vehicles lining the base of the Santa Monica Mountains. In the van, I sit beside Meek\u2019s personal stylist, Sade, who tells me that Meek rarely wears the same shoes twice anymore\u2014especially his Timberlands, she says, which are \u201cone wear\u201d only. Meek is stretched out in the seat behind us, fast asleep and snoring lightly with his mouth open. Occasionally we hit a bump, and he wakes up with a start.\n\nMeek is over a decade into his career, which began back in Philadelphia, where he was a local celebrity well before anyone elsewhere knew his name. His style, since the beginning, has been excitable and assertive, honed over years of raucous neighborhood rap battles (\u201cMy voice gives off energy,\u201d as he puts it). The support of Rick Ross, who enlisted Meek in 2011 for his gaudy, era-defining Maybach Music Group empire, helped bring on a series of hits\u2014nationally impactful, ubiquitous singles like \u201cTupac Back,\u201d \u201cIma Boss,\u201d \u201cAmen,\u201d and \u201cBurn,\u201d songs that spawned controversies, tribute freestyles, poor imitations, and new catchphrases. Still, Meek retained his sense of reckless momentum and immediacy, and his writerly insistence on showing rather than telling. (He wasn\u2019t \u201carrested\u201d on 2012\u2019s exhilarating, virtually percussion-less \u201cDreams and Nightmares (Intro),\u201d for example; he was In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists.)\n\nThese days he divides his time between Los Angeles and Miami, living entirely out of luxury hotels. At the moment, he\u2019s staying in a five-star establishment in Beverly Hills, where the d\u00e9cor is a disorienting maze of mirrors and black tile, and the room service menu includes bottles of champagne in the $400 range. When he\u2019s in album mode, he spends every night in the studio, usually working until seven or eight in the morning and sleeping until mid-afternoon. In the daylight, he often appears exhausted and physically drained. Of his three-year-old son, who still lives in Philly, he admits that he sees him \u201cnot as much as I should, but we make it worth it.\u201d\n\nMeek isn\u2019t the only one anxious to finish his album. On the trip to Malibu, he is surrounded, as he is most days, by a small cadre of management and marketing professionals, each of them with a stake in his career. There are representatives from his management firm, Roc Nation; his record label, Atlantic Records; and Maybach Music Group, a subsidiary of Atlantic; plus his own longtime manager, Phil Smith, an older, no-nonsense problem-solver from back home who wears thick glasses, a white T-shirt, and seems perpetually, mysteriously tense.\n\nWe park alongside the highway and walk to the edge of a steep cliff overlooking the beach. Seagulls seem to be flying directly underneath us. Meek\u2019s good friend Chino Braxton\u2014a spry 18-year-old professional supercross rider who Meek discovered online and signed to his imprint, Dream Chasers, as its first and only athlete\u2014peers over the cliff\u2019s edge and grimaces at the ocean. \u201cThat\u2019s some scary shit,\u201d he says. Meek rubs his hands together, kicks some pebbles over the edge, and agrees.\n\nMeek descends the winding clay path down to the beach below, which is dotted with caves and huge, alien rock formations. Saint-like in pure white, he\u2019s photographed as he walks\u2014not only by us, but by everyone else who happens to be at the beach today. Young teenagers with iPhones, couples relaxing on bright towels\u2014everyone snaps a photo. Even those who don\u2019t immediately recognize him seem to know that they should. As if to strike back against the flurry of amateur paparazzi, Meek pulls out his own phone and takes a picture of a couple posing for wedding photos on a grassy outcropping. Later that day, I notice he\u2019s posted it on his Instagram, with the caption, \u201cThey getting married on a hill in Malibu.\u201d By the next morning, for whatever reason, it will receive over 40,000 likes.\n\n\"It ain\u2019t really time to get married yet. We\u2019re still learning each other, feeling each other out.\" \u2014Meek Mill\n\nMeek has been established as an artist for some time now, well known to faithful rap fans as a demanding stylist with great promise, but it is only in the last several months that he has emerged as something else, a public figure on the national stage. Though it seems cynical to say so, this can partially be attributed to his prison sentence: his months behind bars only added to the sense of anticipation and aura surrounding his music and also helped to clarify, in the minds of his audience, that there is something solemn and significant at stake for Meek in all of this. It gave his career a narrative arc, however tragic or unstable. It also gave him ample time to consider his goals. In prison, one of his friends told me, Meek \u201cnever mentioned the money or the endorsements he lost. What he talked about was the way he was going to handle his business when he got out. He said he was going to make it bigger than ever, and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d\n\nSince his release, Meek has also become a person of interest to the tabloid press, who have been enthusiastically tracking his movements with half-true stories about parties he threw and grudges he holds. Most recently, his relationship with Nicki Minaj has been the subject of rigorous speculation, with various outlets reporting that a ring he bought her in Miami was an engagement ring. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely real,\u201d he says of their relationship, \u201cbut it ain\u2019t really time to get married yet. We\u2019re still learning each other, feeling each other out.\u201d Not that it matters: the story has been printed. Meek\u2019s grandmother has been calling him about that one (\u201cWhatever she sees on TV, she believes,\u201d he says), and other celebrities, most notably Drake, have started congratulating them publicly, lending credence to the idea.\n\nFrom the perspective of his label, anything that keeps Meek in the news is a net positive. He could always use the help. Meek\u2019s first studio album, 2012\u2019s Dreams and Nightmares, debuted at #2 on the Billboard charts and went on to sell a few hundred thousand copies, but it wasn\u2019t the blockbuster some had hoped for. His singles have had extraordinary reach but not always in a manner conducive to chart success or to the label making money; the YouTube views are there, that is, but the songs haven\u2019t always made it to iTunes in time to monetize the hype. His income comes mostly from touring and promotional deals, like product placement in music videos and his personalized, gold chrome-painted Monster headphones. You could say he embodies the challenges and contradictions of the present-day music industry\u2019s relationship with street rap: Meek has made a fortune for himself, but it remains to be seen whether he can do the same for Atlantic Records.In Malibu, as the sun goes down, Meek storms the beach with furious confidence, stomping on sand castles and leaping off sharp rocks at the edge of the surf. Someone has brought a portable speaker along to set the mood, and the rumbling beats only add to the sense that we are disrupting everyone\u2019s peaceful evening. In his music, this is Meek\u2019s default setting: disruption, a kind of irrepressible, fluid abandon. It\u2019s there in his personality, too, but only in flashes. Back at the top of the cliff, Meek notices a small rabbit in the dry brush. \u201cSee that rabbit right there?\u201d he asks us, his eyes glowing. \u201cWhat color is it?\u201d asks Chino, suddenly excited. It\u2019s brown. Meek makes his approach slowly, carefully, and takes a photo with his phone. Then with both hands, he mimes a rifle, lines up the rabbit in his sights, and fires.\n\nA self-produced 2010 documentary about Meek\u2019s life, released to accompany his mixtape Mr. Philadelphia, covers the subject of his father\u2019s murder in some depth. It was South Philadelphia, 1989. Meek, who was born Robert Williams, was a toddler. His uncle Ronald is interviewed in the film and describes his brother as the \u201cblack sheep of the family.\u201d Ronald was at work when he got the phone call telling him his brother had been shot. It had apparently occurred during an attempted robbery, though the details have remained unclear over the years. Ronald drove to the scene and found a crowd surrounding his brother\u2019s body, which lay in the street, \u201cmotionless.\u201d He remembers it vividly, remembers seeing the \u201cbottom of his sneaker hanging out from under that white blanket.\u201d\n\nMeek\u2019s mother, Kathy Williams, moved him and his older sister, Nasheema, to North Philly, where they lived in a small, three-bedroom apartment on Berks Street, not far from Temple University. Kathy had grown up in poverty, her mother having passed away when she was young. To support the family, she cut hair and worked other jobs as they presented themselves, \u201cboosting\u201d from the supermarket when they didn\u2019t. At home, Meek was shy and rarely spoke. Growing up, he felt the pull of South Philly, where most of his extended family still lived\u2014where his father had lived. As he\u2019d later put it, jarringly, in the 2008 song \u201cFirst of All,\u201d I fell in love with the streets I lost my dad to.\n\nAs a kid, Meek became acquainted with another of his dad\u2019s brothers, a pioneering local DJ known as Grandmaster Nell. If you were to plug the details of Meek\u2019s life into a hero\u2019s journey structure, Nell would be the early mentor, the wise guru. He looks the part, with an oddly shaped beard and sage\u2019s demeanor that give him the aura of a desert mystic. Nell was a legendary figure in the Philadelphia hip-hop scene of the late-\u201980s, an innovator on the turntables and a crucial influence on DJ Jazzy Jeff, who, with fellow Philly native Will Smith, would win the first-ever Grammy for Best Rap Performance, in 1989. Meek remembers wandering into his grandmother\u2019s basement and seeing spray-paint all over the walls, the remnants of Nell\u2019s parties. He and his cousins would sneak into his uncle\u2019s room, he told me, and \u201che\u2019d have all the equipment in there\u2014the turntables, the big speakers\u2014and we\u2019d turn it all on.\u201d\"Everybody don\u2019t always make it, but there\u2019s always that guy back in the hood that was the shit and inspired the people that did make it.\u201d \u2014Meek Mill\nBy the time Meek started trying to rap himself, the landscape of Philly hip-hop had changed, darkened, shifting toward a model of rappers as gritty, strong-willed realists, morally complicit in the fallen environment they document. In the late \u201990s and early 2000s, the Philadelphia rappers everyone idolized were Beanie Sigel and his State Property crew, including locals Freeway and Peedi Crakk. There was also Major Figgas, Gillie Da Kid, Diamond District, Chic Raw, and Vodka. \u201cEverybody don\u2019t always make it,\u201d Meek says of his hometown scene, \u201cbut there\u2019s always that guy back in the hood that was the shit and inspired the people that did make it.\u201d If his uncle was that guy for The Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff, early aughts street rappers like Chic Raw and Vodka were those guys for Meek. He watched their DVDs religiously and emulated them.\n\nYou can find videos online of Meek\u2019s early teenage years, when he would battle-rap on street corners in a hoodie, his hair pulled back into cornrows. \u201cI was just learning my flow,\u201d he says of this period, and he was also learning to write. He\u2019d stay up well past midnight filling thick notebooks\u2014\u201crap books\u201d\u2014with phrases and verses that he\u2019d later draw on. \u201cEverything was about competition,\u201d he says of his battling years, \u201cand it helped shape some us growing up. It makes you ambitious as a kid.\u201d He formed a group called Bloodhoundz, and they\u2019d buy blank CDs and jewel cases at Kinkos, encouraging friends to burn copies to spread around. \u201cIf you hear the quality of it, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d he says. \u201cBut people was feeling me at the time. That was some raw shit, spending our last money putting a mixtape out.\u201d\n\nMeek\u2019s greatest leap forward came in the couple of years spanning his solo Flamers mixtape series, the first of which was released in the summer of 2008. The centerpiece was a skittish, hypnotic song called \u201cIn My Bag.\u201d It was his first real regional hit; he made a music video for the song and even worried briefly that he couldn\u2019t top its success. It led directly to his meeting the Philly music scene impresario Charlie Mack, immortalized in the Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff song \u201cCharlie Mack (1st Out of the Limo),\u201d who\u2019s credited with discovering Boyz II Men (and now Meek). \u201cHe was with me when I was a kid,\u201d Meek says of his former manager, with whom he parted ways amicably a few years ago. \u201cHe raised me through the game.\u201d From the release of the first Flamers volume, it took Meek roughly two years to go from a period he now remembers as a time of \u201cblack-eyed peas and hot dogs for dinner\u201d to his local reign, when he was suddenly \u201cMr. Philadelphia,\u201d the hottest in the city. Looking back, you can actually pinpoint this transition, the very moment Meek realized he could do this forever: he marked it by cutting his hair. He\u2019d always worn it in braids, but he never would again. \u201cIt was time to start fitting in, get cleaned up,\u201d he says of this decision. \u201cI was about to be on TV.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne night, Meek and I meet up at a seafood restaurant not far from his hotel, where we are joined at the last minute by Rick Ross, his longtime mentor and boss at Maybach Music Group. The place is dimly lit and pretentious, the kind of restaurant where waiters make a point to say \u201cquite so\u201d rather than \u201cyes.\u201d Flowing across the length of the floor is a glass-covered stream filled with live koi. We climb the stairs to a table on the second floor and run into T.I., who is dressed nondescriptly in a gray hoodie, and who throws open his arms to pull in Meek for a bear hug. It\u2019s the sort of coincidence that might seem more startling were we not in a five-star restaurant in Beverly Hills.\n\nLike most people Meek has crossed paths with lately, T.I. excitedly congratulates him on his engagement. \u201cI ain\u2019t engaged,\u201d Meek says sheepishly, but T.I. isn\u2019t having any of it. \u201cYou never asked her, \u2018Will you be my girlfriend?\u2019 But she is your girlfriend,\u201d he says. \u201cYou may not have asked her, \u2018Will you marry me?\u2019 But you are engaged.\u201d Meek shrugs, unable to argue with this logic. \u201cI\u2019ve said my part,\u201d T.I. says, backing away with his hands up. \u201cAs long as you know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nIt was T.I. who originally tried to sign Meek to his Grand Hustle imprint in 2008, before his own prison sentence ensured that he wouldn\u2019t be around to shepherd the younger rapper in the ways he needed. This is where Rick Ross stepped in. Ross models himself as a paternalistic mogul, a self-made empire-builder in the tradition of Uncle Luke or Birdman. He credits Twitter with his discovery of Meek. Stopping in Philadelphia for a concert, Ross asked his Twitter followers to recommend a local artist he should work with, and the response was rapid and near unanimous. \u201cAt that moment,\u201d Ross tells me, \u201cyou would\u2019ve thought Meek was the only rapper in Philly.\u201d The local DJ Cosmic Kev connected the two of them, and to Meek\u2019s surprise, Ross followed through, eventually offering him a contract.\n\n\u201cRoss changed my life. He changed my whole family\u2019s lives,\u201d Meek says over a plate of roasted crab and garlic noodles. \u201cRoss met my grandma a lot of times. She thinks Rick Ross is her boyfriend. She\u2019s like, \u2018Where my baby at?\u2019\u201d Ross smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s my baby girl,\u201d he says, taking a bite out of a crab puff. When Meek returned to prison last year, Ross visited him. He recalls trudging along the fence with Meek, who wore a yellow jumpsuit and was openly despondent. \u201cI heard his disappointment,\u201d Ross says. \u201cThe rage he felt that he couldn\u2019t communicate his situation in the courtroom. I remember telling him, \u2018You\u2019re not going to make this a personal fight.\u2019\u201d As they walked the yard, the other inmates noticed the two rappers together and began banging on the walls in tribute. \u201cYou just started hearing that beating go around the whole building,\u201d Ross says. The guards requested that he leave.Meek remains frustrated by the way he\u2019s been treated by the system. Even the original gun charge, which has haunted him now for years, is a matter of context as he sees it. \u201cMy dad got killed in South Philly,\u201d he explains. \u201cAin\u2019t nobody save him. The cops didn\u2019t save him, and I don\u2019t even think about the cops saving me, so I just took action to protect myself.\u201d Ever since then, he says, he\u2019s been trapped in a structure that makes no effort to appreciate his sacrifices, his worth, or his ambition. \u201cWhen you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m not shit,\u201d he says, \u201cyou got to look at it from my point of view. I always wanted to say this to the judge: \u2018Think about your son. If your son grew up in the neighborhood, and his father was dead, but he\u2019s able to rise up above it all and start taking care of you, your mother, and your whole family? He\u2019s taking responsibility.\u2019 So when you got a white lady in a courtroom, who don\u2019t know you from a can of paint, saying I\u2019m not shit and I need to be put in jail? That\u2019s offensive to me. I look at that as racism. I take that personally.\u201d\n\nThis is a feeling embedded in Meek\u2019s music, a bleak awareness that his own society doesn\u2019t value him. It\u2019s most upfront in songs like 2013\u2019s \u201cLil Nigga Snupe,\u201d a chilling track inspired by the murder of the 18-year-old Louisiana rapper Lil Snupe, who, like Chino Braxton, had been discovered by Meek and signed to his label. Instead of pedantry or certainty, Meek offers a profound, deeply human ambiguity: So what\u2019s a nigga \u2018sposed to do?/ Tell \u2018em put the guns down or tell lil nigga shoot?/ Cause they\u2019ll do the same to me, do the same shit to you. It\u2019s a question that\u2019s often just below the surface in Meek\u2019s music: what are we supposed to do?\n\nThe challenge for Meek, going forward, will be to continue producing material like \u201cSnupe\u201d\u2014difficult songs addressing difficult issues that resonate with the community that propelled him to success in the first place\u2014while also reaching for the kind of mass pop-cultural relevance that he, Nicki, and Atlantic Records all believe him to be capable of. Judging by the portion of the album he played in the studio, Meek doesn\u2019t see these worlds as contradictory. There are clear pop efforts, like the two songs that Meek and Nicki argued over that night in the studio, but they are part of a larger texture, no more or less important than anything else. Confessional, wounding songs recount providing for his mother and sister; songs with halting, jazz-like piano riffs and drums fall over themselves and never entirely cohere; hazy, impressionistic ballads feature hooks sung by Future; and there\u2019s an operatic anthem that Meek says he likes because it reminds him of ancient Rome.\n\n\u201cMonster,\u201d a single Meek put out this past winter, finds him reflecting on the darker implications of his current situation\u2014nocturnal, rich, and restless. The money turned me to a monster, he says repeatedly on the hook. I ask him about this song at dinner, and he tells me that he means the sentiment \u201cin a good and bad way. Being who I am, in my position, you can\u2019t just be nice. You have to give people some direction. You got to be a monster.\u201d I tell him this seems surprisingly dark, and he nods. Rick Ross, reaching across the table for another crab puff, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s all dark,\u201d he says.When Meek needs a refuge from the pressure of the studio and his bourgeoning public life, he turns to dirt bikes. His cousin gave him his first dirt bike in his early teens, a green Kawasaki KX80, and he\u2019s been street-riding ever since. Fans have come to associate him with riding, illegal on the street but increasingly popular in urban areas all over the country. This past March, on the night of his \u201cWelcome Back\u201d concert in Philadelphia, around 70 dirt bikes and ATVs were confiscated by the Philadelphia Police, who had gotten wind that a \u201cride out\u201d was being held in Meek\u2019s honor. Almost anytime he travels now, including during a recent trip to the Bahamas, he requests that someone find him a bike.\n\nOne afternoon in L.A., still bleary-eyed from the studio session the night before, Meek and Chino rent two Yamaha four-wheeler ATVs and have them driven downtown to an industrial neighborhood in the Arts District. Meek, who I had watched earlier in the afternoon pay cash for the $2,000 jacket he\u2019s wearing, grabs a can of gasoline and pours it not at all carefully into the vehicle\u2019s tank, spilling some over the edges. Chino, grinning in a way that seems alarming, grabs one of the ATV\u2019s grips and starts revving the engine in encouragement. At the slightest smell of gasoline, Meek\u2019s stress and fatigue seem instantly diminished.\n\nThey chose this block because it\u2019s relatively desolate (\u201cI don\u2019t think cops go down there,\u201d was how they phrased it), but it turns out to be a common route for semi-trucks. As Meek and Chino get used to the ATVs, racing them quickly up and down the street, they begin weaving in and out of the lumbering trucks. They get increasingly brazen, driving doughnuts that leave wide black orbs of burnt rubber in the pavement. Placing their knees firmly on the backs of the seats, they pull up their handlebars until the ATVs stand vertically on their back wheels. Teenagers and construction workers gather to watch, taking photos with their phones.\nAfter about an hour, a group of six or seven other riders pull up on their own bikes. At first, Meek seems wary. (\u201cUsually when you run into some dudes you don\u2019t know in a back lot, it\u2019s about something,\u201d he will tell me later.) But they reveal themselves as fans, saying they\u2019d seen Meek riding on Instagram moments before and recognized from the photos that he must have been nearby. Soon the street fills up with fumes and roaring engines and blurred movement. It\u2019s chaos, and at the center of it all is Meek, by this time completely awake and in his element, waving his arms like the conductor of a dissonant symphony. He smiles bigger than I have ever seen him smile, and then he hops on the back of Chino\u2019s ATV and they speed off around the corner, leaving the rest of us in a cloud of sparks and dust.2Embed"},

numbers, and dream of what I would do when I hit.\n\nI saw people on their long, wild spending sprees, after big hits. I don't mean just hustlers who always had some money. I mean ordinary working people, the kind that we otherwise almost never saw in a bar like Small's, who, with a good enough hit, had quit their jobs working somewhere downtown for the white man. Often they had bought a Cadillac, and sometimes for three and four days, they were setting up drinks and buying steaks for all their friends. I would have to pull two tables together into one, and they would be throwing me two- and three-dollar tips each time I came with my tray.\n\nHundreds of thousands of New York City Negroes, every day but Sunday, would play from a penny on up to large sums on three-digit numbers. A hit meant duplicating the last three figures of the Stock Exchange's printed daily total of U.S. domestic and foreign sales.\n\nWith the odds at six hundred to one, a penny hit won $6, a dollar won $600, and so on. On $15, the hit would mean $9,000. Famous hits like that had bought controlling interests in lots of Harlem's bars and restaurants, or even bought some of them outright. The chances of hitting were a thousand to one. Many players practiced what was called \"combinating.\" For example six cents would put one penny on each of the six possible combinations of three digits. The number 840, combinated, would include 840, 804, 048, 084, 408, and 480.\n\nPractically everyone played every day in the poverty-ridden black ghetto of Harlem. Every day, someone you knew was likely to hit and of course it was neighborhood news; if big enough a hit, neighborhood excitement. Hits generally were small; a nickel, dime, or a quarter. Most people tried to play a dollar a day, but split it up among different numbers and combinated.\n\nHarlem's numbers industry hummed every morning and into the early afternoon, with the runners jotting down people's bets on slips of paper in apartment house hallways, bars, barbershops, stores, on the sidewalks. The cops looked on; no runner lasted long who didn't, out of his pocket, put in a free \"figger\" for his working area's foot cops, and it was generally known that the numbers bankers paid off at higher levels of the police department.\nThe daily small army of runners each got ten percent of the money they turned in, along with the bet slips, to their controllers. (And if you hit, you gave the runner a ten percent tip.) A controller might have as many as fifty runners working for him, and the controller got five percent of what he turned over to the banker, who paid off the hit, paid off the police, and got rich off the balance.\n\nSome people played one number all year. Many had lists of the daily hit numbers going back for years; they figured reappearance odds, and used other systems. Others played their hunches: addresses, license numbers of passing cars, any numbers on letters, telegrams, laundry slips, numbers from anywhere. Dream books that cost a dollar would say what number nearly any dream suggested. Evangelists who on Sundays peddled Jesus, and mystics, would pray a lucky number for you, for a fee.\n\nRecently, the last three numbers of the post office's new Zip Code for a postal district of Harlem hit, and one banker almost went broke. Let this very book circulate widely in the black ghettoes of the country, and -- although I'm no longer a gambling person -- I'd lay a small wager for your favorite charity that millions of dollars would be bet by my poor, foolish black brothers and sisters upon, say, whatever happens to be the number of this page, or whatever is the total of the whole book's pages.\n\nEvery day in Small's Paradise Bar was fascinating to me. And from a Harlem point of view, I couldn't have been in a more educational situation. Some of the ablest of New York's black hustlers took a liking to me, and knowing that I still was green by their terms, soon began in a paternal way to \"straighten Red out.\"\n\nTheir methods would be indirect. A dark, businessman-looking West Indian often would sit at one of my tables. One day when I brought his beer, he said, \"Red, hold still a minute.\" He went over me with one of those yellow tape measures, and jotted figures in his notebook. When I came to work the next afternoon, one of the bartenders handed me a package. In it was an expensive, dark blue suit, conservatively cut. The gift was thoughtful, and the message clear.\n\nThe bartenders let me know that this customer was one of the top executives of the fabulous Forty Thieves gang. That was the gang of organized boosters, who would deliver, to order, in one day, C.O.D., any kind of garment you desired. You would pay about one-third of the store's price.\n\nI heard how they made mass hauls. A well-dressed member of the gang who wouldn't arouse suspicion by his manner would go into a selected store about closing time, hide somewhere, and get locked inside when the store closed. The police patrols would have been timed beforehand. After dark, he'd pack suits in bags, then turn off the burglar alarm, and use the telephone to call a waiting truck and crew. When the truck came, timed with the police patrols, it would be loaded and gone within a few minutes. I later got to know several members of the Forty Thieves.\n\nPlainclothes detectives soon were quietly identified to me, by a nod, a wink. Knowing the law people in the area was elementary for the hustlers, and, like them, in time I would learn to sense the presence of any police types. In late 1942, each of the military services had their civilian-dress eyes and ears picking up anything of interest to them, such as hustles being used to avoid the draft, or who hadn't registered, or hustles that were being worked on servicemen.\n\nLongshoremen, or fences for them, would come into the bars selling guns, cameras, perfumes, watches, and the like, stolen from the shipping docks. These Negroes got what whitelongshoreman thievery left over. Merchant marine sailors often brought in foreign items, bargains, and the best marijuana cigarettes to be had were made of the gunja and kisca that merchant sailors smuggled in from Africa and Persia.\n\nIn the daytime, whites were given a guarded treatment. Whites who came at night got a better reception; the several Harlem nightclubs they patronized were geared to entertain and jive the night white crowd to get their money.\n\nAnd with so many law agencies guarding the \"morals\" of servicemen, any of them that came in, and a lot did, were given what they asked for, and were spoken to if they spoke, and that was all, unless someone knew them as natives of Harlem.\n\nWhat I was learning was the hustling society's first rule; that you never trusted anyone outside of your own close-mouthed circle, and that you selected with time and care before you made any intimates even among these.\n\nThe bartenders would let me know which among the regular customers were mostly \"fronts,\" and which really had something going; which were really in the underworld, with down-town police or political connections; which really handled some money, and which were making it from day to day; which were the real gamblers, and which had just hit a little luck; and which ones never to run afoul of in any way.\nThe latter were extremely well known about Harlem, and they were feared and respected. It was known that if upset, they would break open your head and think nothing of it. These were old-timers, not to be confused with the various hotheaded, wild, young hustlers out trying to make a name for themselves for being crazy with a pistol trigger or a knife. The old heads that I'm talking about were such as \"Black Sammy,\" \"Bub\" Hewlett, \"King\" Padmore and \"West Indian Archie.\" Most of these tough ones had worked as strongarm men for Dutch Schultz back when he muscled into the Harlem numbers industry after white gangsters had awakened to the fortunes being made in what they had previously considered \"nigger pennies\"; and the numbers game was referred to by the white racketeers as \"nigger pool.\"\n\nThose tough Negroes' heyday had been before the big 1931 Seabury Investigation that started Dutch Schultz on the way out, until his career ended with his 1934 assassination. I heard stories of how they had \"persuaded\" people with lead pipes, wet cement, baseball bats, brass knuckles, fists, feet, and blackjacks. Nearly every one of them had done some time, and had come back on the scene, and since had worked as top runners for the biggest bankers who specialized in large bettors.\n\nThere seemed to be an understanding that these Negroes and the tough black cops never clashed; I guess both knew that someone would die. They had some bad black cops in Harlem, too. The Four Horsemen that worked Sugar Hill -- I remember the worst one had freckles -- there was a tough quartet. The biggest, blackest, worst cop of them all in Harlem was the West Indian, Brisbane. Negroes crossed the street to avoid him when he walked his 125th Street and Seventh Avenue beat. When I was in prison, someone brought me a story that Brisbane had been shot to death by a scared, nervous young kid who hadn't been up from the South long enough to realize how bad Brisbane was.\n\nThe world's mostly unlikely pimp was \"Cadillac\" Drake. He was shiny baldheaded, built like a football; he used to call his huge belly \"the chippies' playground.\" Cadillac had a string of about a dozen of the stringiest, scrawniest, black and white street prostitutes in Harlem. Afternoons around the bar, the old-timers who knew Cadillac well enough would tease him about how women who looked like his made enough to feed themselves, let alone him. He'd roar with laughter right along with us; I can hear him now, \"Bad-looking women work harder.\"\n\nJust about the complete opposite of Cadillac was the young, smooth, independent-acting pimp, \"Sammy the Pimp.\" He could, as I have mentioned, pick out potential prostitutes by watching their expressions in dance halls. Sammy and I became, in time, each other's closest friend. Sammy, who was from Kentucky, was a cool, collected expert in his business, and his business was women. Like Cadillac, he too had both black and white women out making his living, but Sammy's women -- who would come into Small's sometimes, looking for him, to give him money, and have him buy them a drink -- were about as beautiful as any prostitutes who operated anywhere, I'd imagine.\n\nOne of his white women, known as \"Alabama Peach,\" a blonde, could put everybody in stitches with her drawl; even the several Negro women numbers controllers around Small's really liked her. What made a lot of Negroes around the bar laugh the hardest was the way she would take three syllables to say \"nigger.\" But what she usually was saying was \"Ah jes' luuv ni-uh-guhs --.\" Give her two drinks and she would tell her life story in a minute; how in whatever little Alabama town it was she came from, the first thing she remembered being conscious of was that she was supposed to \"hate niggers.\" And then she started hearing older girls in grade school whispering the hush-hush that \"niggers\" were such sexual giants and athletes, and she started growing up secretly wanting to try one. Finally, right in her own house, with her family away, she threatened a Negro man who worked for her father that if he didn't take her she would swear he tried rape. He had no choice, except that he quit working for them. And from then until she finished high school, she managed it several times with other Negroes -- and she somehow came to New York, and went straight to Harlem. Later on, Sammy told me how he had happened to spot her in the Savoy, not even dancing with anybody, just standing on the sidelines, watching, and he could tell. And once she really went for Negroes, the more the better, Sammy said, and wouldn't have a white man. I have wondered what ever became of her.\n\nThere was a big, fat pimp we called \"Dollarbill.\" He loved to flash his \"Kansas City roll,\" probably fifty one-dollar bills folded with a twenty on the inside and a one-hundred dollar bill on the outside. We always wondered what Dollarbill would do if someone ever stole his hundred-dollar \"cover.\"\n\nA man who, in his prime, could have stolen Dollarbill's whole roll, blindfolded, was threadbare, comic old \"Fewclothes.\" Fewclothes had been one of the best pickpockets in Harlem, back when the white people swarmed up every night in the 1920's, but then during the Depression, he had contracted a bad case of arthritis in his hands. His finger joints were knotted and gnarled so that it made people uncomfortable to look at them. Rain, sleet, or snow, every afternoon, about six, Fewclothes would be at Small's, telling tall tales about the old days, and it was one of the day's rituals for one or another regular customer to ask the bartender to give him drinks, and me to feed him.\n\nMy heart goes out to all of us who in those afternoons at Small's enacted our scene with Fewclothes. I wish you could have seen him, pleasantly \"high\" with drinks, take his seat with dignity -- no begging, not on anybody's Welfare -- and open his napkin, and study the day's menu that I gave him, and place his order. I'd tell the cooks it was Fewclothes and he'd get the best in the house. I'd go back and serve it as though he were a millionaire.\n\nMany times since, I have thought about it, and what it really meant. In one sense, we were huddled in there, bonded together in seeking security and warmth and comfort from each other, and we didn't know it. All of us -- who might have probed space, or cured cancer, or built industries -- were, instead, black victims of the white man's American social system. In another sense, the tragedy of the once master pickpocket made him, for those brother old-timer hustlers, a \"there but for the grace of God\" symbol. To wolves who still were able to catch some rabbits, it had meaning that an old wolf who had lost his fangs was still eating.\n\nThen there was the burglar, \"Jumpsteady.\" In the ghettoes the white man has built for us, he has forced us not to aspire to greater things, but to view everyday living as survival -- and in that kind of a community, survival is what is respected. In any average white neighborhood bar, you couldn't imagine a known cat-man thief regularly exposing himself, as one of the most popular people in there. But if Jumpsteady missed a few days running in Small's, we would begin inquiring for him.\n\nJumpsteady was called that because, it was said, when he worked in white residential areas downtown, he jumped from roof to roof and was so steady that he maneuvered along window ledges, leaning, balancing, edging with his toes. If he fell, he'd have been dead. He got into apartments through windows. It was said that he was so cool that he had stolen even with people in the next room. I later found out that Jumpsteady always keyed himself up high on dope when he worked. He taught me some things that I was to employ in later years when hard times would force me to have my own burglary ring.\n\nI should stress that Small's wasn't any nest of criminals. I dwell upon the hustlers because it was their world that fascinated me. Actually, for the night-life crowd, Small's was one of Harlem's two or three most decorous night spots. In fact, the New York City police department recommended Small's to white people who would ask for a \"safe\" place in Harlem.\nThe first room I got after I left the railroad (half of Harlem roomed) was in the 800 block of St. Nicholas Avenue. You could walk into one or another room in this house and get a hot fur coat, a good camera, fine perfume, a gun, anything from hot women to hot cars, even hot ice. I was one of the very few males in this rooming house. This was during the war, when you couldn't turn on the radio and not hear about Guadalcanal or North Africa. In several of the apartments the women tenants were prostitutes. The minority were in some other racket or hustle -- boosters, numbers runners, or dope-peddlers -- and I'd guess that everyone who lived in the house used dope of some kind. This shouldn't reflect too badly on that particular building, because almost everyone in Harlem needed some kind of hustle to survive, and needed to stay high in some way to forget what they had to do to survive.\n\nIt was in this house that I learned more about women than I ever did in any other single place. It was these working prostitutes who schooled me to things that every wife and every husband should know. Later on, it was chiefly the women who weren't prostitutes who taught me to be very distrustful of most women; there seemed to be a higher code of ethics and sisterliness among those prostitutes than among numerous ladies of the church who have more men for kicks than the prostitutes have for pay. And I am talking about both black and white. Many of the black ones in those wartime days were right in step with the white ones in having husbands fighting overseas while they were laying up with other men, even giving them their husbands' money. And many women just faked as mothers and wives, while playing the field as hard as prostitutes -- with their husbands and children right there in New York.\n\nI got my first schooling about the cesspool morals of the white man from the best possible source, from his own women. And then as I got deeper into my own life of evil, I saw the white man's morals with my own eyes. I even made my living helping to guide him to the sick things he wanted.\n\nI was young, working in the bar, not bothering with these women. Probably I touched their kid-brother instincts, something like that. Some would drop into my room when they weren't busy, and we would smoke reefers and talk. It generally would be after their morning rush -- but let me tell you about that rush.\n\nSeeing the hallways and stairs busy any hour of the night with white and black men coming and going was no more than one would expect when one lived in a building out of which prostitutes were working. But what astonished me was the fullhouse crowd that rushed in between, say, six and seven-thirty in the morning, then rushed away, and by about nine, I would be the only man in the house.\n\nIt was husbands -- who had left home in time to stop by this St. Nicholas Avenue house before they went on to work. Of course not the same ones every day, but always enough of them to make up the rush. And it included white men who had come in cabs all the way up from downtown.\n\nDomineering, complaining, demanding wives who had just about psychologically castrated their husbands were responsible for the early rush. These wives were so disagreeable and had made their men so tense that they were robbed of the satisfaction of being men. To escape this tension and the chance of being ridiculed by his own wife, each of these men had gotten up early and come to a prostitute.\n\nThe prostitutes had to make it their business to be students of men. They said that after most men passed their virile twenties, they went to bed mainly to satisfy their egos, and because a lot of women don't understand it that way, they damage and wreck a man's ego. No matter how little virility a man has to offer, prostitutes make him feel for a time that he is the greatest man in the world. That's why these prostitutes had that morning rush of business. More wives could keep their husbands if they realized their greatest urge is to be men.\n\nThose women would tell me anything. Funny little stories about the bedroom differences they saw between white and black men. The perversities! I thought I had heard the whole range of perversities until I later became a steerer taking white men to what they wanted. Everyone in the house laughed about the little Italian fellow whom they called the \"Ten Dollar A Minute Man.\" He came without fail every noontime, from his little basement restaurant up near the Polo Grounds; the joke was he never lasted more than two minutes . . . but he always left twenty dollars.\n\nMost men, the prostitutes felt, were too easy to push around. Every day these prostitutes heard their customers complaining that they never heard anything but griping from women who were being taken care of and given everything. The prostitutes said that most men needed to know what the pimps knew. A woman should occasionally be babied enough to show her the man had affection, but beyond that she should be treated firmly. These tough women said that it worked with them. All women, by their nature, are fragile and weak: they are attracted to the male in whom they see strength.\n\nFrom time to time, Sophia would come over to see me from Boston. Even among Harlem Negroes, her looks gave me status. They were just like the Negroes everywhere else. That was why the white prostitutes made so much money. It didn't make any difference if you were in Lansing, Boston, or New York -- what the white racist said, and still says, was right in those days! All you had to do was put a white girl anywhere close to the average black man, and he would respond. The black woman also made the white man's eyes light up -- but he was slick enough to hide it.\n\nSophia would come in on a late afternoon train. She would come to Small's and I'd introduce her around until I got off from work. She was bothered about me living among the prostitutes until I introduced her to some of them, and they talked, and she thought they were great. They would tell her they were keeping me straight for her. We would go to the Braddock Hotel bar, where we would meet some of the musicians who now would greet me like an old friend, \"Hey, Red -- who have we got here?\" They would make a big deal over her; I couldn't even think about buying a drink. No Negroes in the world were more white-woman-crazy in those days than most of those musicians. People in show business, of course, were less inhibited by social and racial taboos.\n\nThe white racist won't tell you that it also works in reverse. When it got late, Sophia and I would go to some of the after-hours places and speakeasies. When the downtown nightclubs had closed, most of these Harlem places crawled with white people. These whites were just mad for Negro \"atmosphere,\" especially some of the places which had what you might call Negro soul. Sometimes Negroes would talk about how a lot of whites seemed unable to have enough of being close around us, and among us -- in groups. Both white men and women, it seemed, would get almost mesmerized by Negroes.\n\nI remember one really peculiar case of this -- a white girl who never missed a single night in the Savoy Ballroom. She fascinated my friend Sammy; he had watched her several times. Dancing only with Negroes, she seemed to go nearly into a trance. If a white man asked her to dance, she would refuse. Then when the place was ready to close, early in the morning, she would let a Negro take her as far as the subway entrance. And that was it. She never would tell anyone her name, let alone reveal where she lived.\n\nNow, I'll tell you another peculiar case that worked out differently, and which taught me something I have since learned in a thousand other ways. This was my best early lesson in how most white men's hearts and guts will turn over inside of them, whatever they may have you otherwise believe, whenever they see a Negro man on close terms with a white woman.\n\nA few of the white men around Harlem, younger ones whom we called \"hippies,\" acted more Negro than Negroes. This particular one talked more \"hip\" talk than we did. He would have fought anyone who suggested he felt any race difference. Musicians around the Braddock could hardly move without falling over him. Every time I saw him, it was \"Daddy! Come on, let's get our heads tight!\" Sammy couldn't stand him; he was under-foot wherever you went. He even wore a wild zoot suit, used a heavy grease in his hair to make it look like a conk, and he wore the knob-toed shoes, the long, swinging chain -- everything. And he not only wouldn't be seen with any woman but a black one, but in fact he lived with two of them in the same little apartment. I never was sure how they worked that one out, but I had my idea.\n\nAbout three or four o'clock one morning, we ran into this white boy, in Creole Bill's speakeasy. He was high -- in that marijuana glow where the world relaxes. I introduced Sophia; I went away to say hello to someone else. When I returned, Sophia looked peculiar -- but she wouldn't tell me until we left. He had asked her, \"Why is a white girl like you throwing yourself away with a spade?\"\n\nCreole Bill -- naturally you know he was from New Orleans -- became another good friend of mine. After Small's closed, I'd bring fast-spending white people who still wanted some drinking action to Creole Bill's speakeasy. That was my earliest experience at steering. The speakeasy was only Creole Bill's apartment. I think a partition had been knocked out to make the living room larger. But the atmosphere, plus the food, made the place one of Harlem's soul spots.\n\nA record player maintained the right, soft music. There was any kind of drink. And Bill sold plates of his spicy, delicious Creole dishes -- gumbo, jambalaya. Bill's girl friend -- a beautiful black girl -- served the customers. Bill called her \"Brown Sugar,\" and finally everyone else did. If a good number of customers were to be served at one time, Creole Bill would bring out some pots, Brown Sugar would bring the plates, and Bill would serve everyone big platefuls; and he'd heap a plate for himself and eat with us. It was a treat to watch him eat; he loved his food so; it was good. Bill could cook rice like the Chinese -- I mean rice that stood every grain on its own, but I never knew the Chinese to do what Bill could with seafood and beans.\n\nBill made money enough in that apartment speakeasy to open up a Creole restaurant famous in Harlem. He was a great baseball fan. All over the walls were framed, autographed photographs of major league stars, and also some political and show business celebrities who would come there to eat, bringing friends. I wonder what's become of Creole Bill? His place is sold, and I haven't heard anything of him. I must remember to ask some of the Seventh Avenue old-timers, who would know.\n\nOnce, when I called Sophia in Boston, she said she couldn't get away until the following weekend. She had just married some well-to-do Boston white fellow. He was in the service, he had been home on leave, and he had just gone back. She didn't mean it to change a thing between us. I told her it made no difference. I had of course introduced Sophia to my friend Sammy, and we had gone out together some nights. And Sammy and I had thoroughly discussed the black man and white woman psychology. I had Sammy to thank that I was entirely prepared for Sophia's marriage.\n\nSammy said that white women were very practical; he had heard so many of them express how they felt. They knew that the black man had all the strikes against him, that the white man kept the black man down, under his heel, unable to get anywhere, really. The white woman wanted to be comfortable, she wanted to be looked upon with favor by her own kind, but also she wanted to have her pleasure. So some of them just married a white man for convenience and security, and kept right on going with a Negro. It wasn't that they were necessarily in love with the Negro, but they were in love with lust -- particularly \"taboo\" lust.\n\nA white man was not too unusual if he had a ten-, twenty-, thirty-, forty-, or fifty-thousand-dollar-a-year job. A Negro man who made even five thousand in the white man's world was unusual. The white woman with a Negro man would be with him for one of two reasons: either extremely insane love, or to satisfy her lust.\n\nWhen I had been around Harlem long enough to show signs of permanence, inevitably I got a nickname that would identify me beyond any confusion with two other red-conked and well-known \"Reds\" who were around. I had met them both; in fact, later on I'd work with them both. One, \"St. Louis Red,\" was a professional armed robber. When I was sent to prison, he was serving time for trying to stick up a dining car steward on a train between New York and Philadelphia. He was finally freed; now, I hear, he is in prison for a New York City jewel robbery.\n\nThe other was \"Chicago Red.\" We became good buddies in a speakeasy where later on I was a waiter; Chicago Red was the funniest dishwasher on this earth. Now he's making his living being funny as a nationally known stage and nightclub comedian. I don't see any reason why old Chicago Red would mind me telling that he is Redd Foxx.\n\nAnyway, before long, my nickname happened. Just when, I don't know -- but people, knowing I was from Michigan, would ask me what city. Since most New Yorkers had never heard of Lansing, I would name Detroit. Gradually, I began to be called \"Detroit Red\" -- and it stuck.\n\nOne afternoon in early 1943, before the regular six o'clock crowd had gathered, a black soldier sat drinking by himself at one of my tables. He must have been there an hour or more. He looked dumb and pitiful and just up from the Deep South. The fourth or fifth drink I served this soldier, wiping the table I bent over close and asked him if he wanted a woman.\n\nI knew better. It wasn't only Small's Paradise law, it was the law of every tavern that wanted to stay in business -- never get involved with anything that could be interpreted as \"impairing the morals\" of servicemen, or any kind of hustling off them. This had caused trouble for dozens of places: some had been put off limits by the military; some had lost their state or city licenses.\n\nI played right into the hands of a military spy. He sure would like a woman. He acted so grateful. He even put on an extreme Southern accent. And I gave him the phone number of one of my best friends among the prostitutes where I lived.\n\nBut something felt wrong. I gave the fellow a half-hour to get there, and then I telephoned. I expected the answer I got -- that no soldier had been there.\n\nI didn't even bother to go back out to the bar. I just went straight to Charlie Small's office.\n\n\"I just did something, Charlie,\" I said. \"I don't know why I did it --\" and I told him.\n\nCharlie looked at me. \"I wish you hadn't done that, Red.\" We both knew what he meant.\n\nWhen the West Indian plainclothes detective, Joe Baker, came in, I was waiting. I didn't even ask him any questions. When we got to the 135th Street precinct, it was busy with police in uniform, and MP's with soldiers in tow. I was recognized by some other detectives who, like Joe Baker, sometimes dropped in at Small's.\n\nTwo things were in my favor. I'd never given the police any trouble, and when that black spy soldier had tried to tip me, I had waved it away, telling him I was just doing him a favor. They must have agreed that Joe Baker should just scare me.\n\nI didn't know enough to be aware that I wasn't taken to the desk and booked. Joe Baker took me back inside of the precinct building, into a small room. In the next room, we could hear somebody getting whipped. Whop! Whop! He'd cry out, \"Please! Please don't beat my face, that's how I make my living!\" I knew from that it was some pimp. Whop! Whop! \"Please! Please!\"\n\n(Not much later, I heard that Joe Baker had gotten trapped over in New Jersey, shaking down a Negro pimp and his white prostitute. He was discharged from the New York City police force, the State of New Jersey convicted him, and he went off to do some time.)\n\nMore bitter than getting fired, I was barred from Small's. I could understand. Even if I wasn't actually what was called \"hot,\" I was now going to be under surveillance -- and the Small brothers had to protect their business.\n\nSammy proved to be my friend in need. He put the word on the wire for me to come over to his place. I had never been there. His place seemed to me a small palace; his women really kept him in style. While we talked about what kind of a hustle\n\nI should get into, Sammy gave me some of the best marijuana I'd ever used.\n\nVarious numbers controllers, Small's regulars, had offered me jobs as a runner. But that meant I would earn very little until I could build up a clientele. Pimping, as Sammy did, was out. I felt I had no abilities in that direction, and that I'd certainly starve to death trying to recruit prostitutes.\n\nPeddling reefers, Sammy and I pretty soon agreed, was the best thing. It was a relatively uninvolved lone-wolf type of operation, and one in which I could make money immediately. For anyone with even a little brains, no experience was needed, especially if one had any knack at all with people.\n\nBoth Sammy and I knew some merchant seamen and others who could supply me with loose marijuana. And musicians, among whom I had so many good contacts, were the heaviest consistent market for reefers. And then, musicians also used the heavier narcotics, if I later wanted to graduate to them. That would be more risky, but also more money. Handling heroin and cocaine could earn one hundreds of dollars a day, but it required a lot of experience with the narcotics squad for one to be able to last long enough to make anything.\n\nI had been around long enough either to know or to spot instinctively most regular detectives and cops, though not the narcotics people. And among the Small's veteran hustler regulars, I had a variety of potentially helpful contacts. This was important because just as Sammy could get me supplied with marijuana, a large facet of any hustler's success was knowing where he could get help when he needed it. The help could involve police and detectives -- as well as higher ups. But I hadn't yet reached that stage. So Sammy staked me, about twenty dollars, I think it was.\n\nLater that same night, I knocked at his door and gave him back his money and asked him if I could lend him some. I had gone straight from Sammy's to a supplier he had mentioned. I got just a small amount of marijuana, and I got some of the paper to roll up my own sticks. As they were only about the size of stick matches, I was able to make enough of them so that, after selling them to musicians I knew at the Braddock Hotel, I could pay back Sammy and have enough profit to be in business. And those musicians when they saw their buddy, and their fan, in business: \"My man!\" \"Crazy, Red!\"\n\nIn every band, at least half of the musicians smoked reefers. I'm not going to list names; I'd have to include some of those most prominent then in popular music, even a number of them around today. In one case, every man in one of the bands which is still famous was on marijuana. Or again, any number of musicians could tell you who I mean when I say that one of the most famous singers smoked his reefers through a chicken thighbone. He had smoked so many through the bone that he could just light a match before the empty bone, draw the heat through, and get what he called a \"contact\" high.\n\nI kept turning over my profit, increasing my supplies, and I sold reefers like a wild man. I scarcely slept; I was wherever musicians congregated. A roll of money was in my pocket. Every day, I cleared at least fifty or sixty dollars. In those days (or for that matter these days), this was a fortune to a seventeen-year-old Negro. I felt, for the first time in my life, that great feeling of free! Suddenly, now, I was the peer of the other young hustlers I had admired.\n\nIt was at this time that I discovered the movies. Sometimes I made as many as five in one day, both downtown and in Harlem. I loved the tough guys, the action, Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca, and I loved all of that dancing and carrying on in such films as Stormy Weather and Cabin in the Sky. After leaving the movies, I'd make my connections for supplies, then roll my sticks, and, about dark, I'd start my rounds. I'd give a couple of extra sticks when someone bought ten, which was five dollars' worth. And I didn't sell and run, because my customers were my friends. Often I'd smoke along with them. None of them stayed any more high than I did.\n\nFree now to do what I pleased, upon an impulse I went to Boston. Of course, I saw Ella. I gave her some money: it was just a token of appreciation, I told her, for helping me when I had come from Lansing. She wasn't the same old Ella; she still hadn't forgiven me for Laura. She never mentioned her, nor did I. But, even so, Ella acted better than she had when I had left for New York. We reviewed the family changes. Wilfred had proved so good at his trade they had asked him to stay on at Wilberforce as an instructor. And Ella had gotten a card from Reginald who had managed to get into the merchant marine.\n\nFrom Shorty's apartment, I called Sophia. She met me at the apartment just about as Shorty went off to work. I would have liked to take her out to some of the Roxbury clubs, but Shorty had told us that, as in New York, the Boston cops used the war as an excuse to harass interracial couples, stopping them and grilling the Negro about his draft status. Of course Sophia's now being married made us more cautious, too.\n\nWhen Sophia caught a cab home, I went to hear Shorty's band. Yes, he had a band now. He had succeeded in getting a 4-F classification, and I was pleased for him and happy to go. His band was -- well, fair. But Shorty was making out well in Boston, playing in small clubs. Back in the apartment, we talked into the next day. \"Homeboy, you're something else!\" Shorty kept saying. I told him some of the wild things I'd done in Harlem, and about the friends I had. I told him the story of Sammy the Pimp.\n\nIn Sammy's native Paducah, Kentucky, he had gotten a girl pregnant. Her parents made it so hot that Sammy had come to Harlem, where he got a job as a restaurant waiter. When a woman came in to eat alone, and he found she really was alone, not married, or living with somebody, it generally was not hard for smooth Sammy to get invited to her apartment. He'd insist on going out to a nearby restaurant to bring back some dinner, and while he was out he would have her key duplicated. Then, when he knew she was away, Sammy would go in and clean out all her valuables. Sammy was then able to offer some little stake, to help her back on her feet. This could be the beginning of an emotional and financial dependency, which Sammy knew how to develop until she was his virtual slave.\n\nAround Harlem, the narcotics squad detectives didn't take long to find out I was selling reefers, and occasionally one of them would follow me. Many a peddler was in jail because he had been caught with the evidence on his person; I figured a way to avoid that. The law specified that if the evidence wasn't actually in your possession, you couldn't be arrested. Hollowed-out shoe heels, fake hat-linings, these things were old stuff to the detectives.\n\nI carried about fifty sticks in a small package inside my coat, under my armpit, keeping my arm flat against my side. Moving about, I kept my eyes open. If anybody looked suspicious, I'd quickly cross the street, or go through a door, or turn a corner, loosening my arm enough to let the package drop. At night, when I usually did my selling, any suspicious person wouldn't be likely to see the trick. If I decided I had been mistaken, I'd go back and get my sticks.\n\nHowever, I lost many a stick this way. Sometimes, I knew I had frustrated a detective. And I kept out of the courts.\n\nOne morning, though, I came in and found signs that my room had been entered. I knew it had been detectives. I'd heard too many times how if they couldn't find any evidence, they would plant some, where you would never find it, then they'd come back in and \"find\" it. I didn't even have to think twice what to do. I packed my few belongings and never looked back. When I went to sleep again, it was in another room.\n\nIt was then that I began carrying a little .25 automatic. I got it, for some reefers, from an addict who I knew had stolen it somewhere. I carried it pressed under my belt right down the center of my back. Someone had told me that the cops never hit there in any routine patting-down. And unless I knew who I was with, I never allowed myself to get caught in any crush of people. The narcotics cops had been known to rush up and get their hands on you and plant evidence while \"searching.\" I felt that as long as I kept on the go, and in the open, I had a good chance. I don't know now what my real thoughts were about carrying the pistol. But I imagine I felt that I wasn't going to get put away if somebody tried framing me in any situation that I could help.\n\nI sold less than before because having to be so careful consumed so much time. Every now and then, on a hunch, I'd move to another room. I told nobody but Sammy where I slept.\n\nFinally, it was on the wire that the Harlem narcotics squad had me on its special list.\n\nNow, every other day or so, usually in some public place, they would flash the badge to search me. But I'd tell them at once, loud enough for others standing about to hear me, that I had nothing on me, and I didn't want to get anything planted on me. Then they wouldn't, because Harlem already thought little enough of the law, and they did have to be careful that some crowd of Negroes would not intervene roughly. Negroes were starting to get very tense in Harlem. One could almost smell trouble ready to break out -- as it did very soon.\n\nBut it was really tough on me then. I was having to hide my sticks in various places near where I was selling. I'd put five sticks in an empty cigarette pack, and drop the empty-looking pack by a lamppost, or behind a garbage can, or a box. And I'd first tell customers to pay me, and then where to pick up.\n\nBut my regular customers didn't go for that. You couldn't expect a well-known musician to go grubbing behind a garbage can. So I began to pick up some of the street trade, the people you could see looked high. I collected a number of empty Red Cross bandage boxes and used them for drops. That worked pretty good.\n\nBut the middle-Harlem narcotics force found so many ways to harass me that I had to change my area. I moved down to lower Harlem, around 110th Street. There were many more reefer smokers around there, but these were a cheaper type, this was the worst of the ghetto, the poorest people, the ones who in every ghetto keep themselves narcotized to keep from having to face their miserable existence. I didn't last long down there, either. I lost too much of my product. After I sold to some of those reefer smokers who had the instincts of animals, they followed me and learned my pattern. They would dart out of a doorway, I'd drop my stuff, and they would be on it like a chicken on corn. When you become an animal, a vulture, in the ghetto, as I had become, you enter a world of animals and vultures. It becomes truly the survival of only the fittest.\n\nSoon I found myself borrowing little stakes, from Sammy, from some of the musicians. Enough to buy supplies, enough to keep high myself, enough sometimes to just eat.\n\nThen Sammy gave me an idea.\n\n\"Red, you still got your old railroad identification?\" I did have it. They hadn't taken it back. \"Well, why don't you use it to make a few runs, until the heat cools?\"\n\nHe was right.\n\nI found that if you walked up and showed a railroad line's employee identification card, the conductor -- even a real cracker, if you approached him right, not begging -- would just wave you aboard. And when he came around he would punch you one of those little coach seat slips to ride wherever the train went.\n\nThe idea came to me that, this way, I could travel all over the East Coast selling reefers among my friends who were on tour with their bands.\n\nI had the New Haven identification. I worked a couple of weeks for other railroads, to get their identification, and then I was set.\n\nIn New York, I rolled and packed a great quantity of sticks, and sealed them into jars. The identification card worked perfectly. If you persuaded the conductor you were a fellow employee who had to go home on some family business, he just did the favor for you without a second thought. Most whites don't give a Negro credit for having sense enough to fool them -- or nerve enough.\n\nI'd turn up in towns where my friends were playing. \"Red!\" I was an old friend from home. In the sticks, I was somebody from the Braddock Hotel. \"My man! Daddy-o!\" And I had Big Apple reefers. Nobody had ever heard of a traveling reefer peddler.\n\nI followed no particular band. Each band's musicians knew the other bands' one-nighter touring schedules. When I ran out of supplies, I'd return to New York, and load up, then hit the road again. Auditoriums or gymnasiums all lighted up, the band's chartered bus outside, the dressed-up, excited, local dancers pouring in. At the door, I'd announce that I was some bandman's brother; in most cases they thought I was one of the musicians. Throughout the dance, I'd show the country folks some plain and fancy lindy-hopping. Sometimes, I'd stay overnight in a town. Sometimes I'd ride the band's bus to their next stop. Sometimes, back in New York, I would stay awhile. Things had cooled down. Word was around that I had left town, and the narcotics squad was satisfied with that. In some of the small towns, people thinking I was with the band even mobbed me for autographs. Once, in Buffalo, my suit was nearly torn off.\n\nMy brother Reginald was waiting for me one day when I pulled into New York. The day before, his merchant ship had put into port over in New Jersey. Thinking I still worked at Small's, Reginald had gone there, and the bartenders had directed him to Sammy, who put him up.\n\nIt felt good to see my brother. It was hard to believe that he was once the little kid who tagged after me. Reginald now was almost six feet tall, but still a few inches shorter than me. His complexion was darker than mine, but he had greenish eyes, and a white streak in his hair, which was otherwise dark reddish, something like mine.\n\nI took Reginald everywhere, introducing him. Studying my brother, I liked him. He was a lot more self-possessed than I had been at sixteen.\n\nI didn't have a room right at the time, but I had some money, so did Reginald, and we checked into the St. Nicholas Hotel on Sugar Hill. It has since been torn down.\n\nReginald and I talked all night about the Lansing years, about our family. I told him things about our father and mother that he couldn't remember. Then Reginald filled me in on our brothers and sisters. Wilfred was still a trade instructor at Wilberforce University. Hilda, still in Lansing, was talking of getting married; so was Philbert.\n\nReginald and I were the next two in line. And Yvonne, Wesley, and Robert were still in Lansing, in school.\n\nReginald and I laughed about Philbert, who, the last time I had seen him, had gotten deeply religious; he wore one of those round straw hats.\n\nReginald's ship was in for about a week getting some kind of repairs on its engines. I was pleased to see that Reginald, though he said little about it, admired my living by my wits. Reginald dressed a little too loudly, I thought. I got a reefer customer of mine to get him a more conservative overcoat and suit. I told Reginald what I had learned: that in order to get something you had to look as though you already had something.\n\nBefore Reginald left, I urged him to leave the merchant marine and I would help him get started in Harlem. I must have felt that having my kid brother around me would be a good thing. Then there would be two people I could trust -- Sammy was the other.\n\nReginald was cool. At his age, I would have been willing to run behind the train, to get to New York and to Harlem. But Reginald, when he left, said, \"I'll think about it.\"\n\nNot long after Reginald left, I dragged out the wildest zoot suit in New York. This was 1943. The Boston draft board had written me at Ella's, and when they had no results there, had notified the New York draft board, and, in care of Sammy, I received Uncle Sam's Greetings.\n\nIn those days only three things in the world scared me: jail, a job, and the Army. I had about ten days before I was to show up at the induction center. I went right to work. The Army Intelligence soldiers, those black spies in civilian clothes, hung around in Harlem with their ears open for the white man downtown. I knew exactly where to start dropping the word. I started noising around that I was frantic to join . . . the Japanese Army.\n\nWhen I sensed that I had the ears of the spies, I would talk and act high and crazy. A lot of Harlem hustlers actually had reached that state -- as I would later. It was inevitable when one had gone long enough on heavier and heavier narcotics, and under the steadily tightening vise of the hustling life. I'd snatch out and read my Greetings aloud, to make certain they heard who I was, and when I'd report downtown. (This was probably the only time my real name was ever heard in Harlem in those days.)\n\nThe day I went down there, I costumed like an actor. With my wild zoot suit I wore the yellow knob-toe shoes, and I frizzled my hair up into a reddish bush of conk.\n\nI went in, skipping and tipping, and I thrust my tattered Greetings at that reception desk's white soldier -- \"Crazy-o, daddy-o, get me moving. I can't wait to get in that brown\" -- very likely that soldier hasn't recovered from me yet.\n\nThey had their wire on me from uptown, all right. But they still put me through the line. In that big starting room were forty or fifty other prospective inductees. The room had fallen vacuum-quiet, with me running my mouth a mile a minute, talking nothing but slang. I was going to fight on all fronts; I was going to be a general, man, before I got done -- such talk as that.\n\nMost of them were white, of course. The tender-looking ones appeared ready to run from me. Some others had that vinegary \"worst kind of nigger\" look. And a few were amused, seeing me as the \"Harlem jigaboo\" archetype.\n\nAlso amused were some of the room's ten or twelve Negroes. But the stony-faced rest of them looked as if they were ready to sign up to go off killing somebody -- they would have liked to start with me.\n\nThe line moved along. Pretty soon, stripped to my shorts, I was making my eager-to-join comments in the medical examination rooms -- and everybody in the white coats that I saw had 4-F in his eyes.\n\nI stayed in the line longer than I expected, before they siphoned me off. One of the white coats accompanied me around a turning hallway: I knew we were on the way to a head-shrinker -- the Army psychiatrist.\n\nThe receptionist there was a Negro nurse. I remember she was in her early twenties, and not bad to look at. She was one of those Negro \"firsts.\"\n\nNegroes know what I'm talking about. Back then, the white man during the war was so pressed for personnel that he began letting some Negroes put down their buckets and mops and dust rags and use a pencil, or sit at some desk, or hold some twenty-five-cent title. You couldn't read the Negro press for the big pictures of smug black \"firsts.\"\n\nSomebody was inside with the psychiatrist. I didn't even have to put on any act for this black girl; she was already sick of me.\n\nWhen, finally, a buzz came at her desk, she didn't send me, she went in. I knew what she was doing, she was going to make clear, in advance, what she thought of me. This is still one of the black man's big troubles today. So many of those so-called \"upper-class\" Negroes are so busy trying to impress on the white man that they are \"different from those others\" that they can't see they are only helping the white man to keep his low opinion of all Negroes.\n\nAnd then, with her prestige in the clear, she came out and nodded to me to go in.\n\nI must say this for that psychiatrist. He tried to be objective and professional in his manner. He sat there and doodled with his blue pencil on a tablet, listening to me spiel to him for three or four minutes before he got a word in.\n\nHis tack was quiet questions, to get at why I was so anxious. I didn't rush him; I circled and hedged, watching him closely, to let him think he was pulling what he wanted out of me. I kept jerking around, backward, as though somebody might be listening. I knew I was going to send him back to the books to figure what kind of a case I was.\n\nSuddenly, I sprang up and peeped under both doors, the one I'd entered and another that probably was a closet. And then I bent and whispered fast in his ear. \"Daddy-o, now you and me, we're from up North here, so don't you tell nobody. . . . I want to get sent down South. Organize them nigger soldiers, you dig? Steal us some guns, and kill us crackers!\"\n\nThat psychiatrist's blue pencil dropped, and his professional manner fell off in all directions. He stared at me as if I were a snake's egg hatching, fumbling for his red pencil. I knew I had him. I was going back out past Miss First when he said, \"That will be all.\"\n\nA 4-F card came to me in the mail, and I never heard from the Army anymore, and never bothered to ask why I was rejected.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 79, "api_path": "/songs/646744", "artist_names": "URLtv (Ft.

Lyrics[Vocals: Debra Laws, Ronnie Laws]\n\n[Verse 1]\nAll my love is all I have\nAnd my dreams are very special\nAll my life I looked for you\nAnd today my dreams come true\nYou need me and I need you\nLove and us is very special\nThings you seem to do divine\nYou looked straight into my eyes\nI know our love was meant to be\n'Cause our souls touched tenderly\nLove is life and life is living, it's very special\n[Chorus]\nIn my heart there was you, only\nLove is life, what dreams come true\nAnd even though I can't have you, baby\nDesires like these are true for you\n\n[Verse 2]\nHold my hand and take my life\nThrough these days adventure rules\nOnce my love was truly great\nThen my life was sewed together\nA change in life can bring good things\nWhen you're here, love so supreme\nClose to you, our lips should meet\nTo remember days so sweet\nI need you and you need me, very special\nOur love is joyous, yeah, we can make it\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my heart there was you, only\nLove is life, what dreams come true\nAnd even though I can't have you, baby\nDesires like these are true for you\n\n[Verse 1]\nAll my love is all I have\nAnd my dreams are very special\nAll my life I looked for you\nAnd today my dreams come true\nYou need me and I need you\nLove and us is very special\nThings you seem to do divine\nYou looked straight into my eyes\nI know our love was meant to be\nBecause our souls touched tenderly\nLove is life and life is living, it's very special\nYou might also like[Break]\n\n[Bridge]\nThen your love excited me, baby\nDays full of joy, no tears\nCannot keep this feeling inside, dearly\n'Cause a girl like me has realized that\n\n[Outro]\nAll my love is all I have\nAnd my dreams are very special\nAll my life I looked for you\nAnd today

explanation... both of us know what's goin' on\nAn unspoken late night invitation\nTo keep 'til tomorrow when you're back where you belong\n\nBut you're mine... tonight... somebody else's in the morning light\nBut you're mine... tonight.. and that's all right\n\nI feel emotion in the making... kissing the lips that never lie\nBut I can tell someone else is waiting\nTo play in the fire I see burning in your eyes\nBut you're mine... tonight... somebody else's in the morning light\nBut you're mine... tonight.. and that's all right\n\nDon't know how often I have held you\nDon't really know what this means\nIt's so hard for me not to tell you\nYou've been the star of my dreams\n\nIt's foolish to think of revealing... how I've been yours for so long\nThere's just no future in the feeling\nA taste of your love.. then tomorrow you'll be gone\n\nBut you're mine... tonight... somebody else's in the morning light\nBut you're mine... tonight.. and that's all right\n\nBut you're mine... tonight... somebody else's in the morning light\nBut you're mine... tonight.. and that's all rightYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 18, "api_path":

FADE IN:\nCLOSE SHOT A WHISKEY TUMBLER\n\nThat sits on an oak side bar under a glowing green bankers\nlamp, as two ice cubes are dropped in. From elsewhere in\nthe room:\n\nMan (off)\nI'm talkin' about friendship. I'm talkin' about\ncharacter. I'm talkin' about--hell, Leo, I ain't\nembarassed to use the word--I'm talkin' about\nethics.\nWhiskey is poured into the tumbler, filling it almost to\nthe rim, as the offscreen man continues.\n\n. . . You know I'm a sporting man. I like to\nmake the occasional bet. But I ain't that\nsporting.\n\nTHE SPEAKER\n\nA balding middle-aged man with a round, open face. He\nstill wears his overcoat and sits in a leather chair in the\ndark room, illuminated by the offscreen glow of a desk\nlamp. This is Johnny Caspar.\n\nBehind him stands another man, harder looking, wearing an\novercoat and hat and holding another hat--presumably\nCaspar's. This is Bluepoiont Vance.\n\nCaspar (cont'd)\nWhen I fix a fight, say--if I pay a three-to-one\nfavorite to throw a goddamn fight--I figure I got\na right to expect that fight to go off at three-\nto-one. But every time I lay a bet with this\nsonofabitch Bernie Bernheim, before I know it the\nodds is even up--or worse, I'm betting the short\nmoney. . .\nBehind Caspar we hear the clink of ice in the tumbler and a\nfigure emerges from the shadows, walking away from the\nglowing bar in the backgound.\n\n. . . The sheeny knows I like sure things. He's\nselling the information I fixed the fight. Out-\nof-town money comes pourin' in. The odds go\nstraight to hell. I don't know who he's sellin'\nit to, maybe the Los Angeles combine, I don't\nknow. The point is, Bernie ain't satisfied with\nthe honest dollar he can make off the vig. He\nain't satisfied with the business I do on his\nbook. He's sellin' tips on how I bet, and that\nmeans part of the payoff that should be ridin' on\nmy hip is ridin' on someone else's. So back we\ngo to these questions--friendship, character,\nethics.\n\nThe man with the whiskey glass has just passed the camera\nand we cut to the:\n\nREVERSE\n\nAnother well dressed, middle aged man, behind a large\npolished oak desk, listening intently. This is Leo. He is\nshort but powerfully built, with the face of a man who has\nseen things.\nThe man with the whiskey enters frame and passes Leo to\nlean against the wall behind him, where he listens quietly.\n\nCaspar\n. . . So its clear what I'm sayin'?\n\nLeo\nClear as mud.\n\nCaspar purses his lips but continues unfazed.\n\nCaspar\nIt's a wrong situation. It's gettin' so a\nbusinessman can't expect no return from a fixed\nfight. Now if you can't trust a fix, what can\nyou trust? For a good return you gotta go\nbettin' on chance, and then you're back with\nanarchy. Right back inna jungle. On account of\nthe breakdown of ethics. That's why ethics is\nimportant. It's the grease makes us get along,\nwhat separates us from the animals, beasts a\nburden, beasts a prey. Ethics. Whereas Bernie\nBernheim is a horse of a different color ethics-\nwise. As in, he ain't got any. He's stealin'\nfrom me plain and simple.\n\nLeo leans back in his chair.\n\nThe man behind Leo raises the whiskey glass to his lips.\n\nHe is trimmer and younger than Leo, perhaps in his thir-\nties, dark-complected, with a pencil mustache and a gaunt\nintensity that is not entirely healthy-looking. This is\nTom.\n\nAs he drinks, he studies Caspar and Bluepoint.\n\nLeo\nYou sure it's Bernie, selling you out?\n\nFor the first time the man behind Caspar speaks:\n\nBluepoint\nIt ain't elves.\n\nLeo\nNobody else knows about the fix?\n\nCaspar\nNo one that ain't got ethics.\n\nLeo\nWhat about the fighters you pay to tank out?\n\nBluepoint\nWe only pick fighters we can put the fear of God\nin.\n\nLeo\nAny other bookies know? You play anyone else's\nbook?\n\nCaspar\nI lay an occasional bet with Mink Larouie.\n\nBluepoint\nBut it ain't Mink, I'll vouch for that.\n\nLeo\nHow do you know?\n\nCaspar shakes his head.\n\nCaspar\nIt ain't Mink. Mink is Bluepoint's boy.\n\nLeo\nMm. And of course, Bluepoint always knows about\nthe fix.\n\nBluepoint\nWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\n\nLeo\nLet it drift. All it means is a lot of people\nknow.\n\nCaspar\nI guess you ain't been listening. Sure other\npeople know. That's why we gotta go to this\nquestion of character, determine just who exactly\nis chiseling in an my fix. And that's how we\nknow it's Bernie Bernheim. The Motzah Kid.\nCause ethically, he's kinda shaky.\n\nLeo\nYou know Bernie's chiseling you because he's a\nchiseler. And you know he's a chiseler because\nhe's chiseling you.\n\nAirily:\n\nCaspar\nSometimes you just know.\n\nLeo\n. . . So you wanna kill him.\n\nBluepoint\nFor starters.\n\nLeo nods, thinking. He swivels to look interrogatively at\nTom.\n\nTom gives an almost imperceptable shrug. The ice cubes in\nhis glass clink.\n\nLeo turns back to Caspar, pauses.\n\nLeo\n. . . Sorry, Caspar. Bernie pays me for protec-\ntion.\n\nTom, peering over his drink, does not entirely conceal his\nsurprise.\n\nCaspar stares at Leo, his mouth open. It is not the\nresponse he expected.\n\nCaspar\n. . . Listen, Leo, I ain't askin, for permission.\nI'm tellin' you as a courtesy. I need to do this\nthing, so it's gonna get done.\n\nLeo\nThen I'm telling you as a courtesy that you'll\nhave trouble. You came here to see if I'd kick\nif you killed Bernie. Well there's your answer.\n\nCaspar's voice is harder:\n\nCaspar\nListen Leo, I pay off to you every month like a\ngreengrocer--a lot more than the Motzah--and I'm\nsick a gettin' the high hat--\n\nLeo\nYou pay off for protection, just like everyone\nelse. Far as I know--and what I don't know in\nthis town ain't worth knowing--the cops haven't\nclosed any of your dives and the O.A. hasn't\ntouched any of your rackets. You haven't bought\nany license to kill bookies and today I ain't\nselling any. Now take your flunky and dangle.\n\nCaspar is staring at Leo. He looks at Tom, then rises\nslowly to his feet. Back at Leo:\n\nCaspar\nYa know I'm tryin'. . . I'm tryin not to raise my\nvoice in anga. I've always gone along to get\nalong. But you make me lay off the Matzoh and\nyou're givin' me the needle. I told you the\nsheeny was robbin' me blind, I told you I wanna\nput him in the ground and I'm telling you now I'm\nsick a the high hat.\n\nHe swipes his hat from Bluepoint.\n\n. . . You think I'm some guinea fresh off the\nboat and you think you can kick me. But I'm too\nbig for that now.\n\nHe puts his hands on the desk and leans towards Leo.\nThe cords stand out on his ndck.\n\nI'm sick-of takin' the strap from you, Leo. I'm\nsick a marchin' down to this goddamn office to\nkiss your Irish ass and I'm SICK A THE HIGH HAT!\n\nCaspar stops, out of breath. He is red faced and panting.\nBluepoint has put a gently restraining hand an his shoul-\nder.\n\nLeo and Tom stare at Caspar impasssively.\n\nAfter a beat Caspar shuts his mouth. His eyes lose some of\ntheir glaze. He looks at Bluepoint's hand, turns and\nstrides towards the door.\n\nCaspar\n. . . Youse fuckin' fancy-pants, all of ya.\n\nHe opens the docr, but Leo's voice stops him.\n\nLeo\n(softly)\nJohnny. You're exactly as big as I let you be\nand no bigger and don't forget it. Ever.\n\nCaspar looks at Lea from the open doorway. After a beat he\nchuckles.\n\nCaspar\nAts right, Leo, you're the big-shot around here.\n\nHe dances over at Tom again, then back to Leo:\n\n. . . And I'm just some schnook likes to get\nslapped around.\n\nHe leaves, Bluepoint following, shutting the door.\n\nAfter a beat Tom crosses in front of the desk and sits down\nin the chair Caspar has just vacated. Leo chuckles and\nleans back in his chair.\n\nLeo\nTwist a pig's ear. Watch him squeal.\n\nTom swallows the last of his drink and stares ruminatively\ndown at his glass.\n\nTom\n. . . Bad play, Leo.\n\nLeo, unfazed, grins at Tom.\n\nLeo\nGot up on the wrong side, huh?\n\nTom\nSame side as always.\n\nLeo\nThat's what I mean. Still owe money to--who's\nyour bookie? Lazarre?\n\nTom\nMm.\n\nLeo\nI could put it right for you.\n\nTom\nThanxs Leo, I don't need it.\n\nLeo\nIn a pig's eye. You haven't played a winner in\nsix weeks. People'll speak ill of me if I let\nhim break your legs.\n\nTom grins back, for the first time.\n\nTom\nPeople'll say I had it coming.\n\nLeo\nAnd they'll be right, but that ain't the point.\nCall me a big-hearted slob, but I'm gonna square\nit for ya.\n\nHe picks up a phone on his desk and starts to dial.\n\n. . . Yeah, I think I'll do that, this very same\nnight. Looking at you moping around takes away\nall my . . . What did you call it? Joy de veever.\n\nTom stands and walks over to the desk.\n\nTom\nJoi de vivre.\n\nHe takes the receiver from Leo and prongs the phone.\n\nLeo\nWell look, if your gonna laugh at me, the hell\nwith you.\n\nTom walks to the door, putting an his hat.\n\nTom\nAnd with you. I'll square myself with Lazarre if\nyou don't mind. Thats why God invented cards.\n\nHe pauses in the doorway and turns back to Leo.\n\n. . . There is something you can do for me.\n\nLeo\nName it.\n\nTom\nThink about what protecting Bernie gets us.\nThink about what offending Caspar loses us.\n\nLeo chuckles good-naturedly.\n\nLeo\nCome on, Tommy, you know I don't like to think.\n\nTom has stepped into the hallway and, just as he closes the\ndoor:\n\nTom\nYeah. Well, think about whether you should start.\n\nThe door clicks shut.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\n2. FADE IN:\nTHE WOODS CREDIT SEQUENCE\n\nAlthough it is day, the tree cover gives an effect of\nalmost cathedral-like darkness. The sun filters down\nthrough the leaves in gently shifting patterns.\n\nWe hear only the sound of the wind and the creaking and\ngroaning of tree limbs in the breeze.\n\nHead titles are supered over the dissolving series of woods\nscenes.\n\nIn the last woods scene the angle is low--almost ground-\nlevel. The sun dapples the floor of the forest, which is\ncarpeted with pine needles.\n\nWith a whoosh of rustling leaves the wind gusts a fedora\ninto frame. For a moment it lies still in the foreground,\nsunlight rippling over it, making it seem almost alive.\nThen the wind picks up again and the hat tumbles away from\nus, end over end, in slow motion into the background,\nimpossibly far away until . . . it dissappears.\n\nAs we fade out, we hear a distant knocking.\n\n3. FADE IN:\nCLOSE SHOT TOM\n\nUnshaven, eyes closed, motionless.\n\nThe head credits continue over this one-shot scene.\n\nThe knocking continues, faintly, offscreen. As we hear a\ndoor opening we pull back to a looser shot, revealinq that\nTom is slumped back on a tired green sofa.\n\nA fat hand enters to shake Tom's shoulder.\n\nVoice\nWake up, Tommy.\n\nWithout ocening his eyes:\n\nTom\nI'm awake.\n\nVoice\nYou're eyes were shut.\n\nTom\nWho're you gonna believe?\n\nTom sits up, though it seems like an effort. He looks\nsick.\n\nFrom a small mirror behind the couch we see that we are in\nthe back room of a gambling establishment. The leavings of\na card game litter a table in the middle background.\n\nTom\n. . . How'd I do?\n\nVoice\nWhat do you think. You're a millionaire. You\ngonna remember your friends?\n\nTom reaches up to feel his head, and looks stupidly about.\n\nTom\n. . . Where's my hat?\n\nVoice\nYou bet it, ya moron. Good thing the game broke\nup before you bet your shorts.\n\nAfter a beat of staring at nothing in particular, Tom\nabruptly lurches to his feet and staggers out of frame.\n\nThe other man sits heavily onto the couch that Tom has just\nvacated. He is Fat Tony, a big man wearing an apron.\n\nHe watches as we hear Tom, offscreen, staggering across the\nroom, bumping into something which scrapes and then\nclatters over, opening a door, staggering across tile, and\nthen vomiting.\n\nFat Tony watches with mild interest.\n\nFinally:\n\nTom's Voice\n. . . Who left with my hat?\n\nTony\nVerna. Verna and Mink.\n\nTom\n. . . Who?\n\nLouder:\n\nTony\nMink and Verna.\n\nOffscreen we hear a tap running.\n\nTom\n. . . Thunderclap running tonight?\n\nTony\nYeah.\n\nTom\nWhat's she leave at?\n\nTony\nThree-to-one, more'n likely. Lay off, Tom. You\nshouldn't go deeper in the hole.\n\nTom\nTell Lazarre I want five hundred on the nose.\n\nTony shrugs.\n\nTony\nYou would have it.\n\nTom\n. . . Somebody hit me?\n\nTony\nYeah. Mink hit you.\n\nTom\n. . . Whyzat?\n\nTony inspects a hangnail on his thumb.\n\nTony\nYou asked him to.\n\n4. CUT TO:\nA HALLWAY\n\nA loose shot looking over Tom's shoulder as he knocks on an\npartment door. Head credits continue.\n\nThe door swings open and Verna, an attractive but hard-\nlooking woman in her late twenties or early thirties looks\ncoldly out at Tom.\n\nTom\n(still slightly woozy)\nMiss me?\n\nVerna\nYou again. What now?\n\nTom\nI want my hat.\n\nVerna\n. . . Is that all you came for?\n\nTom\nYeah. I want my hat.\n\nVerna\nI won it. It's mine.\n\nTom\nWhat're you gonna do with it?\n\nVerna\nDrop dead.\n\nShe slams the door.\n\nThere is a long, motionless beat. Tom raises his hand and\nknocks again, missing the door completely on his first try.\n\nAfter a knock or two the door swings open again.\n\nTom\nI need a drink.\n\nVerna\nWhy didn't you say so.\n\nShe steps away from the door and Tom enters the apartment.\nAs the door clicks shut we cut to black, and the last of\nthe movie's head credits.\n\nMusic clays under the credits, mixed in with the woods\nsounds we heard earlier. As the last of the credits is\nfading to black we hear a distant knocking, and from black\nwe:\n\n5. CUT TO:\nCLOSE SHOT A FEDORA\n\nLying on a marble bureau top in a dark room. A gently\nrippling cookie plays over it--light from a streetlamp\nthrown through a curtained window. Reflected in the bureau\nmirror behind the fedora we see the soft glow of a burning\ncigarette.\n\nREVERSE\n\nTracking in on Tom, sitting in bed, smoking, staring at the\nbureau. The rippling street light plays over him from the\nwindow. We hear a distant knocking.\n\nWIDER\n\nThe bedroom, as Tom swings his legs around and gets out of\nbed.\n\nTom throws on a dressing gown and leaves the bedroom\nthrough its double oak pocket doors, closing the doors\nbehind him.\n\n6. LIVING ROOM\n\nAlso dark, lit only by streetlight filtering in.\n\nThe knocking is louder here. Tom crosses the room,\nsilhouetted against the windows, to the apartment's front\ndoor. Light fans in as he opens it.\n\nShiftng uncomfortably in the hallway is Leo, in an\novercoat and fedora.\n\nLeo\n'Lo, Tommy. Sorry about the hour.\n\nTom\nI'll live. What's the rumpus?\n\nLeo\nCan i come in?\n\nTom thinks about this for the slightest beat.\n\nTom\nSure.\n\nHe lets Leo precede him into the living room.\n\nTom turns on a lamp that sits on a rolling bar.\n\n. . . Drink?\n\nLeo\nI wouldn't mind. . . I tried calling earlier.\n\nTom\nI got home late.\n\nAs Tom sits down facing Leo with two drinks:\n\nLeo\nWell. . . Sorry about the hour.\n\nTom\nUh-huh.\n\nHe waits, with no apparent impatience.\n\nThe older man is uncomfortable; he is having trouble\nfinding the words. Finally he lifts his glass and swallows\nit in one gulp.\n\nLeo\n. . . Not bad. . .\n\nTom\nBetter than the paint we sell at the club.\n\nLeo\nThat it is. . . That it is. . .\n\nTom\nThought about cutting Bernie loose?\n\nLeo is shuffling his hat nervously from hand to hand.\n\nLeo\nCan't do it, Tommy, can't do it. . . That's sort\nof why I'm. . . Tommy. . . I don't know where\nVerna is.\n\nTom fixes him with a level stare, then takes a sip of his\ndrink.\n\nTom\nUh-huh.\n\nLeo\nI know what you're thinking: What else is new?\nBut the situation now, I'm worried. . .\n\nTom blows out air.\n\nTom\nVerna can take care of herself. Maybe better\nthan you can.\n\nLeo\nWhat does that mean?\n\nTom stands up, takes Leo's glass and walks back over to the\nbar.\n\nTom\nWant another?\n\nLeo\nNo. What does that mean?\n\nTom turns to look at Leo, pauses, then decides to speak:\n\nTom\nHow far has she got her hooks into you?\n\nLeo\nThat's a hell of a question.\n\nTom\nIt's a grift, Leo. If she didn't need you to\nprotect her brother from Johnny Caspar, d'you\nthink she'd still go with you on slow carriage\nrides through the park? That is the deal, isn't\nit? You keep Bernie under wraps 'till Caspar\ncools down?\n\nLeo\nJesus but you're a prickly pear. What's wrong\nwith her wanting her brother taken care of?\n\nTom\nNot a thing. I don't blame her. She sees the\nangle--which is you--and she plays it. She's a\ngrifter, just like her brother. They probably\nhad grifter parents and grifter grandparents and\nsomeday they'll each spawn little grifter kids--\n\nLeo\nStop it, Tommy. I don't like to hear my friends\nrun down. Even by other friends.\n\nTom shrugs.\n\nTom\nFriendship's got nothing to do with it.\n\nLeo\nThe hell you say. You do anything to help your\nfriends. Just like you do anything to kick your\nenemies.\n\nTom\nWrong, Leo. You do things for a reason.\n\nLeo\nOkay, Tom, you know the angles--Christ, better\nthan anybody. But you're wrong about this. You\ndon't know what's in Verna's heart. . .\n\nTom stares down into his drink. There is an awkward pause.\nThen finally, without looking up:\n\nTom\nLeo, throw her down. And her brother, too. Dump\nher.\n\nLeo looks like he has just been stepped on.\n\nLeo\nJesus, Tom. . . Verna's okay. . .\n\nHe nods to himself.\n\nShe's a little wild, but she's okay. I\nlike her.\n\nTom smiles.\n\nTom\nYeah, you like her. Like the Kaiser likes\ncabbage. You're dizzy for her.\n\nLeo scowls at Tom.\n\nLeo\nWhat of it? Jesus, Tom, ain't you ever been bit\nby that bug?\n\nTom\nLeo, if she's such an angel, why are you looking\nfor her at four in the morning?\n\nLeo digs his hands into his pockets and slouches back,\nprofoundly embarassed.\n\nLeo\nI put a tail on her this afternoon.\n\nTom\nHah!\n\nLeo\nYeah, I asked Rug Daniels to follow her around--\njust, you know, just to keep her out of trouble.\n\nTom\nAnd to tell you what trouble she was managing to\nwhip up herself.\n\nLeo\nIt wasn't to spy, Tom; I was worried. After that\nmeeting with Caspar, well--you can't be too\ncareful.\n\nTom\nUh-huh. And what did Rug tell you that has you\nscurrying over here?\n\nLeo\nThat's just it. Nothing. He's disappeared.\n\nTom laughs humorlessly.\n\nTom\nSo you've lost your ladyfriend and the tail you\nput an her.\n\nLeo\nI guess it does sound pretty sorry at that. . .\n\nHe looks from his empty glass up to Tom.\n\n. . . Help me out, Tom. I wouldn't know where to\nstart looking. You know Rug's crowd, you know\nthe people Verna runs with. I'm just worried\nnow, with things the way they are between me and\nCaspar--\n\nTom gives a wave of disgust.\n\nTom\nYou shouldn't be confronting Johnny Caspar, it's\nwhat I've been trying to tell you. You can't\ntrade body blows with him. He's gotten too\nstrong.\n\nFor the first time Leo displays some testiness:\n\nLeo\nI reckon I can still trade body blows with any\nman in this town. . .\n\nHe sighs, looks back down at his drink.\n\n. . . Except you, Tom.\n\nTom\nAnd Verna.\n\nLeo smiles good-naturedly.\n\nLeo\nOkay, give me the needle. I am a sap, I deserve\nit. . .\n\nHe stands and walks to the door.\n\nTom doesn't move. His eyes remain fixed on the chair Leo\nhas just vacated.\n\nLeo pauses in the open doorway.\n\n. . . Thanks for the drink. Let me know if you\nhear anything. . .\n\nThe door closes and he is gone.\n\nTom grimaces and stands up. Sunlight is just starting to\ncome in through the windows, defining for the first time\nthe corners of the large semi-circular room as Tom walks\nacross it to the bedroom. Distant early-morning traffic\nnoise is filtering up from the street.\n\n7. INT BEDROOM\n\nAs Tom opens the double oak doors and enters, leaving them\nopen.\n\nHe crosses to the bed and sits an its edge, hunched\nforward, thinking. Behind him, a woman stirs.\n\nWoman\n(sleepily)\nWho was that?\n\nTom\nLeo. . .\n\nHe takes a cigarette from the nightstand and lights it.\n\n. . . He's looking for you.\n\nVerna stiffens.\n\nVerna\nDid you tell him I was here?\n\nTom\nNo.\n\nVerna relaxes.\n\nVerna\nDid you put in a good word for my brother?\n\nTom\nNo.\n\nVerna\nYou said you would.\n\nTom\n. . . I said I'd think about it.\n\nVerna\nWhat did you tell him?\n\nTom is lost in thought. He exhales smoke.\n\nTom\n. . . Did you see Rug Daniels last night?\n\nVerna\nNo. What did you tell Leo?\n\nTom finally turns to face her. After looking at her for a\nbeat:\n\nTom\n. . . I told him you were a tramp and he should\ndump you.\n\nA shoe flies past his head and hits the wall behind him.\n\nVerna\nYou're a son of a bitch, Tom.\n\n7. EXT ALLEYWAY EARLY MORNING\n\nWe are on an extreme close shot of a small dog. Behind\nhim, in the distance, we can see the mouth of the alley.\n\nThe dog is on point, perfectly still, one front leg crooked\nand raised off the ground, his ears pointed straight up,\nhis eyes in a fixed stare.\n\nA MAN\n\nis slouched, half-sitting, against the wall of the alley.\nHe is motionless. His mouth is agape. His eyes are rolled\nup in a lifeless stare.\n\nHe is wearing an overcoat but it is unbuttoned and reveals\na blood stain in the middle of his chest. His fedora lies\non the ground near one of his splayed hands.\n\nThere is something subtly odd about his hair.\n\nCLOSE SHOT A LITTLE BOY\n\nPerhaps five years old. He stares down at the dead man in\nfront of him.\n\nCLOSE SHOT THE MAN\n\nStaring vacantly.\n\nTHE BOY\n\nAfter a moment, he reaches forward.\n\nTHE MAN\n\nAs the boy's hand enters frame. The boy pokes once at the\nman's shoulder.\n\nThere is no reaction.\n\nThe boy touches the top of the man's head.\n\nThe man's hair slips forward a couple of inches over over his\nforehead.\n\nTHE BOY\n\nStaring.\n\nTHE MAN\n\nAlso staring, his skewed hairpiece ill becoming his stunned\nexpression.\n\nThe boy reaches forward and takes the hairpiece off the\nman's head. Now a bald man stares off into smace, still\nlooking stunned, still quite dead.\n\nWIDE SHOT THE ALLEY\n\nThe dead man and the little bov face each other in profile\nin the middle foreground. In the background, between them,\nthe little boy's dog faces us, still on point, still\nwhining.\n\nThe little boy is fascinated by the hairpiece he holds. He\nturns it over and around, and looks from it to the dead\nman.\n\nSuddenly the boy turns and runs, away from us, towards the\nmouth of the alley, still clutching the hairpiece.\n\nAs he passes the dog it turns and runs after him, wagging\nits tail, happy to be leaving.\n\nFADE OUT\n\n9. FADE IN:\nINT DINER EVENING\n\nA man sits facing us at the counter in the foreground. His\nface is hidden by the newspaper he is reading.\n\nThe page of the newspaper being presented to the camera\nbears a story headlined: GANGSTER SLAIN. The subhead:\nPolitician's \"Aide\" Found Dead in Alley.\n\nAfter a beat the diner drops the paper to the counter, and\nwe see that it is Tom, wearing overcoat and hat. He is\ngrimacing at whatever he was reading. He stands and digs\ninto his pocket.\n\nREVERSE\n\nLooking down at the newspaper an the counter, next to a\nsteaming cup of coffee. Tom's hand enters to put some\nchange on the counter, leaves, and we hear his receding\nfootsteps.\n\nThe headlined story on the page Tom was reading is:\nTHUNDERCLAP INJURED IN RACING MISHAP.\n\n10. CUT TO:\nTRACKING IN TO CLOSE SHOT PLAQUE\n\nSet into the brick of a building's exterior, it reads:\nSHENANDOAH CLUB. In script underneath: Members Only.\n\n11. INT THE CLUB NIGHT\n\nTracking towards the front door as Tom enters. He puts his\ncoat and hat on the check counter.\n\nTom\nHello, Beryl--\n\nHer arm sweeps across frame to slap Tom hard.\n\nCheck Girl (off)\nAin't you got a conscience?\n\nTom stares dumbly.\n\nON BERYL\n\nA diminutive woman in a french maid's uniform with a pill\nbox hat. She rocks her weight on one leg with her hands\nproceed defiantly on her hips.\n\n. . . It's a little voice inside that tells you\nwhen you been a heel!\n\nTom\nMine's been mum lately--what'd I do?\n\nBeryl\nStood me up is all. Made me wait an hour and a\nhalf is all? Or maybe you don't remember sayin'\nyou'd pick me up after work last night. I seen\nheels in my time, sure, plenty of 'em! But none\nso low as couldn't tell me to my face when they\nwas sick of me! . . .\n\nShe throws a check number at him.\n\n. . . You know where you can stick it!\n\n12. CUT TO:\nTRACKING SHOT\n\nPulling Tom as he walks across the gambling floor. He is\njoined bv a nervous young man in a tuxedo.\n\nMink\n'Lo Tom. What's the rumpus?\n\nTom\nMink.\n\nMink throws a glance back in the direction of the coat\ncheck.\n\nMink\n. . . I see you got your hat back.\n\nTom\nYeah, what of it.\n\nMink\nNot a thing, Tommy. I got not a thing to say.\nListen, Bernie wants to see you. It's important.\n\nTom\nWell I'm right here, and I'm not made of glass.\n\nMink\nYeah, but he's nervous walkin' around in public.\nHe's a right guy, but he's nervous, Tommy! He's\nvery nervous! Who wouldn't be?!\n\nTom looks at Mink for the first time.\n\nTom\nMink--\n\nMink\nThe spot he's in, who wouldn't be! He asked me\nto ask you to ask Leo to take care of him. You\nknow, put in a good word with Leo. Leo listens\nto you. Not that Leo wouldn't help the Motzoh\nanyway! A guy like Bernie? A square gee like\nthe Motzah! A straight shooter like him?\n\nTom\nI don't get it, Mink--\n\nMink\nWhat's to get?! It's as plain as the nose--\n\nTom\nI thought you were Bluepoint's sycophant.\n\nMink\nYeah Tom, that's right. But a guy can have more\nthan one friend, can't he? Not that I'd want\nBluepoint to know about it, but a square gee like\nthe Motzah? He's a right guy, Tom! He's a\nstraight shooter! I know he's got a mixed\nreputation, but for a sheeny he's got a lot a\ngood qualities!\n\nTom has reached the foot of a large staircase. He turns to\nlook at Mink with mild curiosity.\n\nTom\nWhy should I care what happens to Bernie?\n\nMink\nC'mon Tom, you like Bernie dontcha?\n\nTom\nI don't like anybody, Mink, you know that.\n\nMink\nWell, you like his sister.\n\nTom\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\n\nMink\nNothing, Tom. If it ain't my business I got not\na thing to say.\n\nTom studies Mink for a beat.\n\nTom\nWhat's going an between you and Bernie?\n\nMink\nNothin, Tom! We're just friends--you know,\namigos?\n\nHe sics on his cigarette and looks nervously around the\nfloor, then back at Tom, who stares coolly back.\n\nTom\nYou're a fickle boy, Mink. If Bluepoint found\nout you had another \"amigo\"--well, I don't peg\nhim for the understanding type.\n\nMink is startled. In a high shrill voice, as Tom walks up\nthe stairs, clutching his drink:\n\nMink\nFind out!? How would he find out?! Damnit Tom,\nme and you ain't even been talking! Jesus Tom,\ndamnit, Jesus!\n\n13. INT LEO'S OFFICE\n\nPulling Tom as he enters the office.\n\nLeo (off)\n'Lo, Tom. You know O'Gar. . .\n\nREVERSE\n\nLeo faces us from behind his desk.\n\nSeated in two chairs facing the desk, twisting around to\ngreet Tom, are two men. O'Gar is a large man wearing a\npolice uniform. Dale Levander wears a suit; a florid man\nwith a shock of white hair, in his mid-sixties.\n\nLeo\n. . . and the mayor.\n\nTom\nI ought to. I voted for him six times last May.\n\nLevander chuckles.\n\nLevander\nAnd that ain't the record, either.\n\nTom is crossing to the bar.\n\nLeo\nVerna turned up. She's downstairs.\n\nTom, his back to Leo as he pours a drink, stiffens.\n\nTom\n. . . She say where she'd been?\n\nLeo\nNo, I uh. . . didn't want to press her. Hear\nabout Rug?\n\nDrink in hand, Tom turns and crosses to perch an a corner\nof Leo's desk.\n\nTom\nYeah, R.I.P.\n\nLeo\nThey took his hair, Tommy. Jesus that's strange.\nWhy would they do that?\n\nTom\nMaybe it was Injuns.\n\nLeo\nEye-ties, more like it. Giovanni Casparro.\n\nTom\nSo you figure it was Caspar bumped Rug?\n\nLeo, with a puzzled smile, glances at O'Gar and the mayor,\nand then back at Tom.\n\nLeo\n. . . Well it's pretty obvious ain't it?\n\nTom\nMm. . . So what's the plan?\n\nLeo\nJump on the guinea hard. With both feet.\n\nHe looks at the mayor who shifts uncomfortably in his seat.\n\n. . . Give him the low-down, Dale.\n\nMayor\nYes, well. . . Leo here has just reminded us that\nMr. Caspar operates several clubs in our city\nwherein the patrons imbibe of rum and play at\ngames of chance.\n\nMorosely:\n\nO'Gar\nAnd we're sunnosed to stop the party.\n\nTom\nUh-huh. . .\n\nLooking at Leo, he jerks his head towards the two men.\n\n. . . They don't seem too happy about it, Leo.\n\nO'Gar\nNaw, it ain't that, Tom.\n\nMayor\nJesus, Tom! We do as we're told!\n\nTom ignores them.\n\nTom\nMaybe they're right not to like it. Stirring up\nthis hornets' nest won't be good for anyone. And\nit'll mean killing.\n\nLeo\nWell I'm not thrilled about it either, but I\ncan't just lay down to Caspar.\n\nTom\nYou could do worse. You might not like it, but\ngiving up Bernie Bernheim is a pretty small price\nto pay for peace. Business is business and a\nwar's going to hurt everybody. Bernie plays with\nfire, he's got to deal with the consequences--\neven if that means he gets bumped off.\n\nLeo\nSweet Jesus, Tom, that ain't even the point\nanymore. Caspar pooped Rug. The day I back down\nfrom a fight, Caspar is welcome to the rackets,\nthis town, and my place at the table. I didn't\nstart this thing, but--\n\nTom's voice is sharp:\n\nTom\nYou did start it--you and Verna--\n\nThe mayor has risen to his feet. Uncomfortably:\n\nMayor\nWe can dangle, Leo, if you'd prefer.\n\nLeo\nSiddown Dale, we're all friends here.\n\nTom\n--and Caspar hasn't broken the rules, Bernie has-\n-and you too, by helping him. And if that isn't\nenough, consider that if you make it a war, you\nhave more to lose than Caspar.\n\nLeo is getting up from behind the desk and walking over to\nstare out the window.\n\nLeo\nOkay, but more to beat him with. Jesus, Tom, the\ntwo of us've faced worse odds.\n\nTom\nBut never without reason. It helps to have one.\n\nLeo doesn't reply. Tom is irritated, but shrugs indif-\nference.\n\n. . . Well, it's your call.\n\nHe gets to his feet and starts for the door.\n\n. . . My opinion use to count for something\naround here, but it's always yours to take or\nleave.\n\nLeo has turned from the window and is striding after Tom,\ngesturing appologetically.\n\nLeo\nAw, c'mon Tommy. Its not like that. . .\n\nThe door clicks shut.\n\n. . . Goddamnit. Goddamn kid is just like a\ntwist.\n\n14. CUT TO:\nFAT TONY\n\nTending the downstairs bar as Tom stalks over.\n\nTom\nGimme a stiff one.\n\nTony\nNo small talk, huh? They shoot vour nag?\n\nTony has finished pouring a shot of whiskey which Tom\nimmediately knocks back.\n\nTom\nIf there's any justice. Verna around?\n\nTony\nShe stepped into the ladies, room. You got\nLazarre's five hundred?\n\nTom\nHe'll have to carry me for a few days.\n\nTom is pouring himself another drink.\n\nTony\nHe ain't gonna like that. Couldn't, you get it\nfrom Leo?\n\nTom is irritated:\n\nTom\nIt's not Leo's debt. I'll pay my own way.\n\nTony\nI admire a man of principle. Does this go on the\ntab?\n\nDrink in hand, Tom is already walking away.\n\n15. INT LADIES' LOUNGE\n\nAs Tom bangs through the door, still carelessly holding his\ntumbler of whiskey. A rogue lock of hair hangs down over\nhis forehead.\n\nTom\nClose your eyes, ladies, I'm coming through.\n\nREVERSE\n\nThe hubbub of female voices evaporates as all turn to look\nat the male intruder.\n\nThe lounge's decor is done in various shades of pink. Some\nof the women apply make-up facing the large bulb-encircled\nmirrors on overstuffed seashell shaped pink chairs. Other\nwomen sit, smoking, in the banquettes that line the other\nwall.\n\nAll react to Tom's entrance with surprise mixed with\nvarious degrees of outrage, and they hurry to gather their\nthings and leave. The one exception is Verna, who looks at\nTom with unperturbed distaste.\n\nAs he crosses to her seashell chair:\n\nTom\nWho's the warpaint for?\n\nVerna\nGo home and dry out.\n\nTom\nYou don't need it for Leo, believe me. He\nalready thinks you're the original Miss Jesus.\n\nShe glances hurriedly around the lounge, but the last of\nthe women are already leaving.\n\nVerna\n. . . What the hell's the matter with you?\n\nTom\nWhat's the matter with you? Afraid people might\nget the right idea?\n\nVerna studies him for a beat.\n\nVerna\nLeo's got the right idea. I like him, he's\nhonest and he's got a heart.\n\nTom weaves a couple of steps closer to her.\n\nTom\nThen its true what they say. Opposites attract.\n\nVerna\nDo me a favor and mind your own business.\n\nShe turns back to the mirror and starts applying her\nlipstick. Tom drops down to face her in the mirror.\n\nTom\nThis is my business. Intimidating helpless women is\npart of what I do.\n\nVerna\nThen find one and intimidate her.\n\nTom swallows the rest of his drink in one gulp.\n\nTom\nLeo's upstairs getting ready to shoot himself in\nthe foot on your account.\n\nVerna\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\nTom\nHe's gonna go to the mat for your brother. And\nit's gonna hurt him.\n\nVerna\nI don't know Leo's business, but he's a big boy.\n\nTom\nHe used to be.\n\nVerna causes with the lipstick. She looks at Tom intently\nbut her tone softens.\n\nVerna\nLook. What do you want, Tom? You want me to\npretend I don't care what happens to Bernie?\nWell I do. He's my brother and I don't want him\nto get hurt. If Leo wants to help him out I'll\nstep out with him, show him a good time in\nreturn. There's no harm in that.\n\nTom\nThere's a name for that kind of business arrange-\nment.\n\nVerna\nI'll do what I have to for Bernie and there's no\nreason for you to try and queer that. Regardless\nof what you think of me, Bernie's a decent guy.\n\nTom\nA straight shooter, huh? A square gee?\n\nVerna\nYeah, sneer at him like everyone else. Just\nbecause he's different. People think he's a\ndegenerate. People think he's scum. Well he's\nnot.\n\nTom\nPoor misunderstood Bernie.\n\nVerna swivels around to stare quizzically at Tom.\n\nVerna\n. . . What is this about? You want me to stop\nseeing Leo . . . Why don't you just say so?\n\nTom\nI want you to quit spinning Leo in circles and\npointing him where to go.\n\nVerna\nI forgot--that's your job, isn't it?\n\nTom\nI'll do what I have to to protect Leo. I'm\nasking you--politely, for me--to leave him alone.\nI don't have to ask. If I told him about our\nlittle dance last night, your pull would dry up\npretty fast.\n\nNow Verna is irritated:\n\nVerna\nSo would yours. I don't like being threatened.\n\nTom\nI don't like being played for a sucker. That\ngame might work with Leo but it won't work with\nme.\n\nVerna\nYou think last night was just more campaigning\nfor my brother?\n\nTom\nI can see the angles. . .\n\nHe grabs her by the arm and drags her roughly to her feet.\n\n. . . And I know if there was a market for little\nold ladies, you'd have Grandma Bernheim first on\nline.\n\nVerna\n(struggling to get out of his grasp)\nYou're a pathetic rumhead.\n\nTom\nAnd I love you, Angel.\n\nTom takes her hat off, tosses it onto the chair, and kisses\nher roughly on the lips.\n\nVerna breaks away and socks him on the jaw. Tom staggers\nback, upsetting a table of toiletries and landing against a\nbanquette.\n\nHe throws his empty whiskey glass at Verna.\n\nShe ducks and it smashes into the mirror.\n\nThey stand staring at each other for a beat, breathing\nhard. Tom has a smear of lipstick near one side of his\nmouth.\n\nFinally:\n\nVerna.\n. . . I suppose you think you've raised hell.\n\nShe picks up her stole and heads for the door.\n\nTom stands staring at her back, swaying, ever so slightly.\n\nTom\nSister, when T've raised hell you'll know it.\n\n16. CUT TO:\nINT TOM'S APARTMENT\n\nA wide shot, facing the semi-circular windows, the door of\nthe apartment behind us. A large easy chair in the middle\nforeground faces away from us: a smaller chair is at the\nwindow end of the room, facing us.\n\nAt the cut we hear the ringing of the telephone.\n\nOffscreen we can hear the unhurried scrape of a key in the\nlock, then the door opening, then the door closing.\n\nTom's back enters frame as he strolls into the room and\nthen disappears briefly through an open doorway to the\nright. We hear an icebox door opening and closing, and\nthen Tom reenters again, still not reacting to the insis-\ntently ringing phone. He is now holding a balled-up towel.\n\nHe walks over to the facing chair at the window end of the\nroom, shrugs off his overcoat, drapes it on the chair,\nsits, crosses his legs, takes off his hat, tosses it onto\nthe upraised toes of his crossed leg, tilts his head back,\nand presses the towel against his forehead--apparently it\nis an icepack.\n\nWe are beginning to track slowly towards him.\n\nAfter a beat he takes out a cigarette, lights it, and\nreaches back for the phone that refuses to stop ringing.\n\nTom\nYeah. . .\n\nHe casually looks forward, just off to one side, at a\nspecific point in space. He does not react to whatever he\nis hearing.\n\n. . . I need a couple days. . . Because I don't\nhave it now. . .\n\nWe are almost in close shot now. His gaze is still fixed\nand emotionless.\n\n. . . Because I say so. . . What would be good\nenough?. . . Well, if it'll make him feel any\nbetter, tell Lazarre he can send someone by to\nbreak my legs. I won't squawk.\n\nHe prongs the earpiece, still looking off. The track has\nstopped in close shot. He exhales a stream of smoke, then\nafter a beat:\n\n. . . 'Lo, Bernie.\n\nREVERSE\n\nSlouched in a chair, in the corner of the room, facing Tom,\nis Bernie Bernheim. He is about thirty and wears his\novercoat and hat and a good-natured smile. He holds an\napple in one hand and a paring knife in the other. The\nlong peel of the apple corkscrews down off the knife.\n\nBernie\n'Lo, Tom. What's the rumpus?\n\nTom\nC'mon in, make yourself at home.\n\nBernie\nYeah, you weren't here so I thought I'd do that.\nDidn't wanna answer the phone, though. Figured\nit wasn't for me.\n\nTom\nUh-huh.\n\nAfter a silent beat, Bernie chuckles.\n\nBernie\n. . . I get it, get to the point, huh? Okay.\nThe point is: I'm a good guy.\n\nTom\nI've heard that from a lot of people today.\n\nBernie slices off an apple section and holds it out to Tom,\nwho shakes his head.\n\nBernie\nGood guy, lot of friends--that's the way it\nworks. Maybe if you appreciated me a little\nmore, you wouldn't be making waves with Leo.\n\nHe pops the slice in his mouth.\n\nIt's a bad time to be doing that. I mean, right\nnow we're both in a jam. I hear you're on a bad\nstreak, short of funds, and I've got that\npsychotic guinea mad at me. Don't ask me why;\nI'm just a small-timer trying to get by, like\neveryone else. I need help from my friends.\nLike Leo. And you.\n\nTom\nLeo gets your sister, what're you selling me?\n\nBernie\nC'mon Tom, its not like that at all. Wasn't\nmy idea. She'll sleep with anyone, you know\nthat. She's even tried to teach me a thing or\ntwo about bed artistry. Can you believe that--my\nown sister! Some crackpot idea about saving me\nfrom my friends. . .\n\nBernie laughs pleasantly.\n\nShe's a sick twist all right. I guess some\nguys like that.\n\nTom\nShe speaks highly of you.\n\nBernie shrugs.\n\nBernie\nYeah, well, you stick by your family. The point\nis, I can help you with your debts if that would\nmake us friends. My motto is, a guy can't have\ntoo many. Big payday Saturday, Tom. You could\nbe in on it.\n\nFor the first time, Tom is interested.\n\nTom\nAnother fix? Which fight?\n\nBernie\nWell that's confidential at the moment. But it\ndoesn't have to stay that way.\n\nTom gives Bernie a speculative eye.\n\nTom\nHow d'you know about it? Caspar isn't laying any\nmore bets with you.\n\nBernie\nMm.\n\nTom gives a humorless smile.\n\nTom\n. . . You must really have Mink jumping through\nhoops.\n\nBernie is getting to his feet wiping the knife blade on his\ncoat.\n\nBernie\nLike I say, you can't have too many.\n\nHe pauses at the open door, looks up and down the hall and\nturns to look at Tom.\n\n. . . We got a deal?\n\nTom\n. . . I'll think about it.\n\nOn his way out:\n\nBernie\nI wouldn't want it any other way.\n\nOn the click of the door latch we cut to:\n\n17. STREET DAY\n\nPulling Tom along the sidewalk.\n\nTom\nCud. . .\n\nHe is calling out to a short rail-like man lounging against\na building who joins him as he walks. Cud has small sharp\nfeatures except for one cheek, which is hugely distended by\na wad of chewing tobacco.\n\n. . . My credit still good with you?\n\nCud gives a so-so flutter of his hand.\n\n. . . Give me a hundred across on Tailor Maid in\nthe third tonight.\n\nCud shakes his head.\n\nCud\nLazarre won't like it.\n\nTom\nTry fifty across.\n\nCud shrugs.\n\nCud\nI'll try. That'll make another one-fifty you owe\nhim.\n\nTom\nOnly if I lose, Cud.\n\nCud\nTommy, the way you're goin'--horses got knees?\n\nTom\nI dunno. Fetlocks.\n\nCud\nWell the way you're goin', if I was a horse I'd\nbe down on my fetlocks prayin' you don't bet on\nme.\n\nAnother man, a huge man, has walked up to flank Tom's other\nside. This is Frankie.\n\nFrankie\nDrift, small guy.\n\nCud\nDrop dead, ape.\n\nFrankie\nC'mon Tom, my boss wants to see you. He didn't\nhave time to engrave nothin' formal.\n\nCud starts to fade away.\n\nCud\nI'll see you later, Tommy. I gotta go spit.\n\n18. INT ROOM\n\nIt is a large room with a couple of card tables, straight-\nbacked chairs, a ratty sofa--a sparsely furnished card room\noff the main floor of a club.\n\nAt the cut we are tracking behind Tom into the room as\nFrankie and Tic-Tac, a small ferret-faced-man, escort him\nin. We hear a woman's voice speaking rapid-fire Italian.\n\nBluepoint is sitting on the couch, wearing his overcoat and\nhis hat pushed back an his forehead.\n\nSitting at one of the card tables is Caspar. With him is\nhis wife, a short, very round Italian woman, and his son,\nJohnny Jr. Johnny Jr., about five years old, is also very\nround. He wears a suit with short pants that reveal\ndimpled knees.\n\nBluepoint, an the couch, is watching the domestic scene\nwithout any particular warmth.\n\nCaspar\nWhaddya mean he's eatin' too much? Whadduz the\ngoddamn doctor know?\n\nHe turns to the little boy.\n\n. . . What you eat for lunch?\n\nJohnny Jr.\nA hot dog.\n\nCaspar\nJust a hot dog?\n\nThe boy shakes his head.\n\nJohnny Jr.\nA hot dog and mustard.\n\nCaspar throws his head back and roars with laughter.\n\nCaspar\nA hot dog with mustard! A hot dog with mustard!\nYou hear that, Bluepoint! The kids as smart as a\nwhip! Even Uncle Bluepoint thinks that's funny.\n\nBluenpoint's face is a solem mask.\n\n. . . Whadduz the goddamn doctor know!\n\nCaspar wipes away tears of mirth and digs in his pocket\nwith his left hand. Extending two closed fists towards the\nboy:\n\n. . . G'head, which hand is the penny in?\n\nThe boy touches his right fist.\n\n. . . Choose again.\n\nThe boy just looks at him.\n\n. . . Okay, here ya go. Take the penny. Shiny\nnew penny.\n\nTo his wife.\n\n. . . Take the kid. Wait in the car. Give'm\na penny, boys.\n\nTic-Tac and Frankie dig in their pockets for change as the\nboy and his mother cross to the door.\n\nFrankie\nI ain't got a penny, boss.\n\nCaspar has turned his attention to a check book that lies\non the table in front of him. As he writes:\n\nCaspar\nAh, well, that's a penny ya owe him. 'Lo Tom,\nwhat's the rumpus? You like kids?\n\nTom\nNo.\n\nAbsently:\n\nCaspar\nUh-huh. Have a seat. G'ahead.\n\nHe tears out the check.\n\n. . . Well, you're missin' out on a complete\nlife. I know, kids, big deal, but still, I'm\ntellin' ya.\n\nHe blows on the check.\n\n. . . Anyway. . . Thanks for comin' by. I just\nwrote this check out to your bookmaker, Lazarre.\nIt's for an even fifteen hundred, which is more\nthan I hear you owe him but I figure you can\nalways use some money on the cuff, a high roller\nsuch as yaself whaddya say?\n\nTom\n. . . Thanks.\n\nCaspar laughs.\n\nCaspar\nAlways the yapper, huh? Well, you're welcome.\nYou wanna know why I'm putting you square with\nLazarre?\n\nTom\nNot particularly.\n\nCaspar\nBad feeling. It ain't a good thing. It's a\npoison, kid. I want everybody to be friends. I\ndo this, you're friends with Lazarre, he's\nfriends with you, and you're friends with me.\nAnd all you gotta do, show you're a friend, is to\ngive me Bernie Bernheim. You know it's the right\nthing anyway; I can't keep any discipline if I\ncan't punish the people I need to punish. The\nMotzah steals from me, I can't have Leo givin'\nhim a shiny new penny. . . You find some way to\nmake Leo understand that.\n\nTom\nSo the deal is, I give you the Motzah, smooth it\nover with Leo, and you bail me out with Lazarre.\n\nCaspar\nYeah, then we're all friends again: You, me,\nLeo, Bluepoint.\n\nBluepoint sneers from the couch:\n\nBluepoint\nWe can maybe have tea sometime.\n\nCaspar\nC'mon, Bluepoint. Friends is a mental state.\nWuddya say, kid?\n\nTom\n. . . I'll think about it.\n\nCaspar\nHe'll think about it. Hear that, Bluepoint?\nThat's terrific. The kid's a thinker.\n\nBluepoint\nDoes he want a pillow for his head?\n\nCaspar\nOkay kid, think about it. It's a mental state.\nBut make it quick, my family's waitin'.\n\nTom\nI'll think about it and tell you later.\n\nBluepoint\nHe needs to think in the thinking room.\n\nCaspar shakes his head sadly.\n\nCaspar\nKid, if it'll help you think, you should know\nthat if you don't do this you won't be in any\nshape to walk outa here.\n\nTom considers this.\n\nTom\n. . . Would that be physically, or just a mental\nstate?\n\nCaspar stares at him for a beat, then slowly starts to tear\nup the check.\n\nCaspar\n. . . That ain't friendly, kid. I make you a\nnice offer, I get the high hat.\n\nHe gets up and walks over to the door. Tic-Tac opens it\nfor him and precedes him out.\n\nBefore following Caspar out the door, Bluepoint grins at\nTom.\n\nBluepoint\nToo bad for you, smart guy.\n\nHe leaves, shutting the door.\n\nThe room is quiet.\n\nTom looks at Frankie, the large man, who looks back.\n\nFrankie stands, takes off his suit coat, and hangs it\ncarefully on a rack by the door.\n\nHe approaches Tom.\n\nTom\nHold it.\n\nFrankie complies. Tom is standing and shrugging off his\ncoat. He folds it neatly and turns to lay it on the chair\nhe was in.\n\nWhen he turns around again he is holding the chair and he\nsmashes it into Frankie's face.\n\nFrankie staggers back but doesn't drop. He reaches up to\nhis nose and his hand comes away bloody.\n\nFrankie\n. . . Jesus, Tom.\n\nTom still holds the chair.\n\nFrankie looks at him for a moment, then walks over to the\ndoor, opens it, and leaves, shutting it behind him.\n\nThe room is very quiet. Tom stands facing the door, still\nholding the chair. After a beat or two, he starts to put\nit down.\n\nThe door opens and he quickly raises the chair again.\n\nTic-Tac, the little man with the hawk nose, is striding\ninto the room, briskly approaching Tom. Frankie, the\ngorilla, follows cautiously.\n\nTic-Tac blocks Ton's swing of the chair with his forearm,\nwraps both arms around it and pulls it awav from Tom. As\nFrankie circles Tom, Tic-Tac tosses the chair across the\nroom.\n\nFrankie, now behind Tom, wallops him in the small of the\nback. The blow sends him staggering towards Tic-Tac, who\ncracks him in the jaw.\n\nFrankie grabs Tom's hair and yanks his head back as Tic-Tac\nworks on his midsection. Tom's hands are reaching back to\ngrope for Frankie.\n\nStill holding his hair with one hand, Frankie cuffs Tom\nawkwardly on the side of the head. Tom staggers around and\nTic-Tac, now behind him, also hits him on the side of the\nhead.\n\nTom goes down. His head hits the floor with a thunk.\n\nWe are on a low angle an the floor. Behind Tom's head, in\nthe background, we see the door to the room.\n\nThe door splinters in with a loud crash.\n\nFrankie's feet are walking up alongside Tom's head, as blue\nuniforms stream into the room.\n\nFrankie\nJust in the nick of time, huh?\n\nHe brings his foot back to deliver a walloping kick to the\nback of Tom's head. On the impact we cut to:\n\nBLACK\n\nOver black we hear the sound of running water.\n\n19. FADE IN:\nTOM\n\nGasping for air as his head is pulled out from under a\nrunning faucet.\n\nThe uniformed policeman who was holding him there and is\nnow pulling him back up, grins at him.\n\nCop\nNo harm done. Unless your friend broke his foot.\n\nTom is still woozy.\n\nTom\n. . . Wuzzit. . . How long. . . What day is it?\n\nCop\nFriday, 12th of September, 1929. Same as when\nyou left us, about ten seconds ago. . .\n\nHe is leading Tom by the arm out of the cramped bathroom,\nback into the card room where he was beat up. Another cop\nhas Frankie cuffed in a straightbacked chair and is taking\nroundhouse swings at him. He pauses, breathing heavily.\n\nSecond Cop\n. . . 'Lo, Tom. Care to skin a knuckle an your\nplaymate here?\n\nTom\nNo. . . thanks, Delahanty. . .\n\nAs Tom and the first cop leave the card room:\n\nSecond Cop\nWell if you change your mind, we'll be inter-\nrogatin' for a while. . .\n\nTom and his escort are emerging onto the casino floor.\n\nFirst Cop\nWhat was that party about, anyway?\n\nTom\nWe do this every weekend.\n\nBlue uniforms are everywhere. Some are escorting tuxedoed\npatrons and employees to the exit; some wield axes on the\ngaming equipment; others are using nightsticks to smash the\nbottles behind the bar. Tom winces at this and lights a\ncigarette.\n\nTom\nJesus. . .\n\nHe takes a battle and glass from a table as they walk by.\n\n. . . What the hell is the matter with you\npeople?\n\nFirst Cop\nWell, they said make it hurt. . . So we make it\nhurt.\n\n22. EXT THE BUILDING\n\nWe see that the building's facade claims to be SABBATINI'S\nANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES.\n\nTom weaves across the street with his battle and glass\ntowards O'Gar, the police chief, leaning against a squad\ncar, chewing a toothpick. He is watching morosely as his\nmen load other men into paddywagons; the street is clogged\nwith police vehicles.\n\nTom\nDrink, O'Gar?\n\nO'Gar does not bother to look at Tom as they talk; he is\nunhappily watching the spectacle.\n\nO'Gar\nI'm an duty.\n\nTom pours himself a glass.\n\nTom\nTo Volstead. . .\n\nHe tosses back a shot.\n\n. . . Any news on Rug?\n\nO'Gar\nStill dead, far as I know.\n\nTom\nGet a slug out of him?\n\nO'Gar\nYeah, a .22. Listen, Tom, I'm just the chief\naround here, so don't bother telling me if you\ndon't happen to feel like it, but what the hell\nis Leo doing?\n\nTom\nOurs is not to reason why, friend.\n\nO'Gar\nBalls. Look at this mess. Make him listen to\nyou, Tom. It ain't right, all this fuss over one\nsheeny. Let Caspar have Bernie--Jesus, what's\none Hebrew more or less?\n\nHe nods at the building.\n\n. . . We're burning our mealticket here.\n\nTom\nLeo'll do what suits him, and you'll do what he\ntells you. Last I heard Leo's still running this\ntown.\n\nO'Gar\nHe won't be for long if this keeps up. It's no\ngood for anyone--you said as much yourself.\n\nTom\nFirst off, O'Gar, I can say what I please to Leo\nand about him. . .\n\nHe taps him on the chest.\n\n. . . You can't. Second, once Leo decides--\nthat's that. And if that sticks going down,\nthere are plenty of other coppers wouldn't mind\nbeing chief, and could swallow it clean.\n\nO'Gar looks chastened.\n\nO'Gar\nJesus, Tom, I was just speculatin' about a\nhypothesis. I know I don't know nothin'. It's\njust a damn mess is all--\n\nHe is interrupted by gunfire from an upper story of the\nfacing building.\n\nO'Gar's men react, finding cover, returning the fire.\n\nO'Gar unholsters his gun as he and Tom scramble for cover.\n\n. . . a goddamn mess.\n\n23. HALLWAY\n\nWe are shooting over Tom's shoulder as he knocks at the\ndoor to Verna's apartment.\n\nAfter a beat, Verna opens the door.\n\nOn seeing who it is she starts to swing the door shut.\n\nTom puts his toe in the doorway and leans into the door.\n\nAs he pushes his way in:\n\nTom\nThanks, don't mind if I do.\n\n24. INT APARTMENT\n\nAs Verna gives up and Tom enters.\n\nVerna walks over to the phone. As she dials, Tom tosses\nhis hat onto a chair and checks the apartment to see if\nthey're alone.\n\nVerna\nHello, officer, I'd like to report an intruder at\n346 West--\n\nTom grabs the phone away from her.\n\nTom\nWho's this?. . . 'Lo, Shad, Tom Duchaisne here.\nWe won't be needing any today. . . That's right,\nmy mother. She didn't recognize me. Lemme talk\nto Mulvaney.\n\nHe takes a flask out of his packet and looks across the\nroom towards Verna.\n\n. . . Miss me?\n\nVerna\nDrop dead.\n\nWe hear a voice barking through the line and Tom turns back\nto the phone.\n\nTom\n. . . 'Lo Sean, tell O'Car to send a car over to\nLeo's tonight. If we're going to be banging away\nat Caspar we ought to be ready for him to bang\nback. . . Yeah.\n\nHe hangs up the phone and tips the flask back, draining the\nlast drop.\n\nVerna\nWhat do you want?\n\nTom is crossing to the bar.\n\nTom\nI was in the neighborhood, feeling a little\ndaffy. Thought I'd drop in for an apperitif.\n\nHe pours himself a drink.\n\n. . . Rug Daniels is dead.\n\nVerna\nGee, that's tough.\n\nTom\nDon't get hysterical. I've had enough excitement\nfor one nigit without a dame going all weepy on\nme.\n\nVerna\nI barely knew the gentleman.\n\nTom\nRug? Bit of a shakedown artist. Not above the\noccasional grift, but you'd understand that. All\nin all not a bad guy, if looks, brains and\npersonality don't count.\n\nVerna\nYou better hope they don't.\n\nHe gives her a sick grin.\n\nTom\n. . . Yeah well, we're none of us the saint I\nhear your brother is.\n\nVerna\nWho killed him?\n\nTom\nLeo thinks Caspar did.\n\nVerna\nBut you know better.\n\nTom\nI do now. Caspar just tried to buy me into\nsettling his tiff with Leo, which held hardly do\nif he was waging war. So I figure you killed\nhim, Angel. You or Saint Bernard.\n\nVerna\nWhy would I--or my brother--kill Rug Daniels or\nanybody else?\n\nTom\nRug was following you. He knew about you and me.\nThat wouldn't help your play with Leo, would it?\n\nHe looks at her. She holds his gaze.\n\nVerna\nYou think I murdered someone. Come on, Tom, you\nknow me a little.\n\nTom\nNobody knows anybody--not that well.\n\nVerna\nYou know or you wouldn't be here.\n\nTom\nNot at all, sugar. I came to hear your side of\nthe story--how horrible Rug was, how he goaded\nyou into it, how he tried to shake you down--\n\nVerna\nThat's not why you came either.\n\nTom shrugs.\n\nTom\nTell me why I came.\n\nVerna looks at him.\n\nVerna\nThe oldest reason there is.\n\nTom\nThere are friendlier places to drink.\n\nVerna\nWhy can't you admit it?\n\nTom\nAdmit what?\n\nVerna\nAdmit you don't like me seeing Lee because you're\njealous. Admit it isn't all cool calculation\nwith you--that you've got a heart--even if it's\nsmall and feeble and you can't remember the last\ntime you used it.\n\nTom\nIf I'd known we were going to cast our feelings\ninto words I'd have memorized the Song of\nSolomon.\n\nVerna smiles.\n\nVerna\n. . . Maybe that's why I like you, Tom. I've\nnever met anyone made being a sonofabitch such a\npoint of pride.\n\nShe turns to walk across the room.\n\n. . . Though one day you'll pay a crice for it.\n\nTom grabs her wrist.\n\nTom\nOkay, Verna. But until then, let's get stinko.\n\nHe draws her close.\n\nVerna\n. . . Let's do something else first.\n\nShe reaches up, takes off his hat, and tosses it casually\naway. We pan with the hat to where it lands on the floor,\nin front of a curtained window.\n\nTom (off)\nYeah. Let's do plenty.\n\n25. DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\nANOTHER WINDOW NIGHT\n\nA living room window, open, its white sheers billowing\nlazily in the draft.\n\nFaintly, from another room in the house, we can hear a\nphonograph playing John McCormack singing \"Danny Boy\".\n\nAt the cut we hear a thump, close by, and briefly the\nsounds of a struggle. We then hear a breathy, gurgling\nsound, which quickly subsides.\n\nThe living room is late-night quiet.\n\nThe shot is a lateral track, which brings us off the window\nto an end table in the foreground. On the end table is a\npouch of Bull Durham, a package of rolling papers, a cup of\ncoffee with steaming rising off of it, and a section of a\nnewspaper. The draft gently lifts a couple rolling papers\noff the table.\n\nThe continuing track takes us off the end table and,\nbooming down, shows us an upset chair and the legs of the\nman who occupied it.\n\nWe track along the man's body to discover that he is face-\ndown on the section of newspaper he was reading, blood\noozing out of his slit throat onto the newspaper.\n\nThe continuing track shows that, between the fingers of one\noutflung hand, a cigarette burns. It is resting on the\nnewspaper.\n\nWe see the feet of another man who is turning and walking\naway from the man on the floor, into the background. We\npan over to watch him recede, framing out all of the dying\nman except his outflung hand and cigarette.\n\nAs the walking man recedes, more and more of his topcoated\nbody crops in. By the time he reaches the house's front\ndoor, in the deep background, we can see him full figure.\n\nThe newspaper in the foreground is crackling into flame.\nThe rug it rests on is beginning to smoke and discolor.\n\nAs the man in the background opens the front door we jump\nin:\n\nOVER HIS SHOULDER\n\nWaiting in the darkness just outside is another man in a\ntopcoat and fedora. He is holding two tommy guns.\n\nThe men do not exchange words.\n\nThe man outside hands his partner a tommy gun and follows\nhim as he walks back into the house.\n\nStill faint, we continue to hear \"Danny Boy\". We also hear\nthe lick of flames.\n\n26. A VICTROLA\n\nThe song is louder at the cut. We are in an upstairs\nbedroom.\n\nLEO\n\nStretched out an his bed, wearing a robe over his pyjamas,\nsmoking a cigar, listening--but only to the phonograph.\nIts sound covers any other noise in the house.\n\n27. STAIRWAY\n\nA close track on the two pairs of feet climbing the stairs.\nWe see only the feet, the swaying hems of the topcoats and,\noccasionally dipping into frame, the muzzles of the two\ntommy guns.\n\n26. BEDROOM\n\nLeo, is motionless, looking down, a puzzled expression.\n\nHIS POV\n\nThe floor.\n\nThin smoke is beginning to sift up through the floorboards.\n\n28. STAIRWAY\n\nTracking on the approaching feet. The song grows louder.\n\n26. BEDROOM\n\nLeo, looking, slowly taking the cigar from his mouth.\n\nBEDROOM DOOR\n\nFrom inside as--CRASH--it is kicked in.\n\nLEO\n\nHitting the floor and rolling under the bed.\n\nTHE TWO GUNMEN\n\nStriding into the room.\n\nLEO\n\nOn his belly under the bed, facing the door, swinging a\nhandgun in front of him.\n\nHIS POV\n\nFrom floor level, the bottom of the mattress above us, the\nfloorboards stretching away.\n\nThe bed crops the two gunmen mid-shin as they swing their\nguns up, firing.\n\nRAT-TAT-TAT-TAT--the hems of their coats sway as they fire.\n\nThe floorboards in front of us are pocked by bullet hits\nthat walk across the floor towards the bed and hit the\nmattress.\n\nThe mattress above us dances under the gunfire as ticking\nsprays down at the floor.\n\nSmoke curls up throuch the floorboards.\n\nLEO\n\nJaw clamped on his cigar, he starts firing.\n\nHIS POV\n\nBlood spurts as one gunman takes a hit in the ankle.\n\nHe staggers and his tommy gun clatters to the floor.\n\nLEO\n\nStill firing.\n\nHIS POV\n\nThe other gunman is ducking out the door.\n\nThe injured gunman pitches forward, head towards us, his\nhat rolling off.\n\nLEO\n\nFiring.\n\nHIS POV\n\nA bullet hit in the top of the fallen man's head.\n\nLEO\n\nRolling out from under the bed.\n\nHe stoops to pick up the dead man's tommy gun. Thick smoke\nseeps up through the floor.\n\nThe phonograph plays.\n\nLeo ducks through another door.\n\n28. HALLWAY\n\nFacing down the length of the dark hallway, towards the\nmouth of the stairs.\n\nAs Leo leaps across frame in the foreground, to enter a\nfacing room, muzzle flashes erupt at the end of the hall--\nwhere the other gunman has been waiting in the darkness.\n\n29. SECOND ROOM\n\nLeo throws open a window.\n\n30. EXT\n\nAs Leo rolls out onto the long sloping eave of a front\nporch.\n\nHis gun skates down the eave and falls. Leo grabs the rain\ngutter, hangs by his hands and drops down to the front\nlawn.\n\nThe first floor of the house is in flames.\n\nFrom a high angle the camera swoops down on Leo as he picks\nup the gun and backs away from the house, looking up at the\nsecond story. His open robe flaps in the breeze. The dead\ncigar is still clamped between his teeth.\n\nLEO'S POV\n\nThe second floor window that he just emerged from.\nStaccato gunfire erupts in the dark room.\n\nThe strobing gunfire makes a strobing shadow of the gunman,\nwhose back is to us as he rakes the room with fire.\n\nLEO\n\nFiring, the gun jumping and bucking in his hands.\n\n29. INSIDE THE ROOM\n\nThe gunman, riddled with bullets and showered with broken\nglass, spins around, his thompson still firing uncontrol-\nlably.\n\nBullets dance across the walls and ceiling, blast out the\nremaining glass and sing harmlessly into the trees outside.\n\nBACK TO LEO\n\nAs we hear the screech of skidding tires. A black coupe\ntakes a curve on the street behind him, machine gun fire\nspitting out of the back window.\n\nLeo turns, in the glow of the fanning flames, walking\ncalmly into the street, firing at the receeding car.\n\nON THE CAR\n\nGrowing smaller, still snitting fire and lead.\n\nPULLING LEO\n\nStill walking calmly up the street, the gun still bucking\nin his hands. Bullets whistle by and claw up the pavement\naround him.\n\nBEHIND LEO\n\nHis robe whips back in the breeze. He fires again and we\nhear the distant sound of shattering glass. The car\nweaves, runs up off the road, hits a tree and bursts into\nflame.\n\nA figure emerges from the car and staggers off into the\ndarkness. He is on fire.\n\nCLOSE ON LEO\n\nAs he stops, squinting, raising the gun.\n\nHIS POV\n\nThe burning gunman zig-zagging into the darkness.\n\nBACK TO LEO\n\nA faint smile curls around the cigar. He drops the muzzle\nof the gun.\n\nLeo\nHuhh. . .\n\nThe shell of the car explodes in a fireball as we:\n\n31. CUT TO:\nUPSTAIRS HALLWAY SHENANDOAH CLUB\n\nThe explosion echoes over the cut as we track up the\nhallway behind Tom and a tall cadaverous man with pre-\nmaturely white hair. This is Dead Terry McGill.\n\nGunmen of every description line the hallway, lounging\nagainst the walls, barely acknowledging the two men.\n\nTom\nWho's winning?\n\nTerry\nWe are, for the nonce.\n\nTom\nWhat's the disposish?\n\nTerry\nLast night? Four to one. Dana Cudahy went up\nwith the house.\n\nTom\nAnd theirs?\n\nTerry\nOne burned.\n\nTom\nThe other three?\n\nTerry\nLead.\n\nTom\nWhose?\n\nTerry\nLeo's.\n\nHe is opening the door to admit Tom. In a low, gravelly\nvoice:\n\n. . . The old man's still an artist with a\nthompson.\n\n32. INT LEO'S OFFICE\n\nAs Tom enters.\n\nLeo is bellowing into the phone:\n\nLeo\n--well find him, goddamnit! Go see if he fell in\nthe john! And get him, over here!\n\nHe slams down the phone.\n\n. . . Sonofabitch! No chief! Who's running the\ngoddamned store?\n\nTom goes to the bar to pour himself a drink.\n\nTom\nCan't raise O'Gar?\n\nLeo\nNo, nor the mayor either.\n\nTom\nHmm.\n\nHe takes a sip.\n\n. . . That's not good. They're running.\n\nLeo\nThey wouldn't dare.\n\nTom\nI don't know, Leo. I warned you not to hit\nCaspar's club--\n\nLeo\nI'm still here, ain't I?\n\nTom\nCaspar's play hurt you anyway.\n\nLeo\nHah! That sorry sonofabitch just slit his own\nthroat. He just made me decide to step on him--\n\nTom\nListen to me Leo. Last night made you look\nvulnerable. You don't hold elected office in\nthis town. You run it because people think you\nrun it. Once they stop thinking it, you stop\nrunning it.\n\nLeo\nJesus, Tom, sounds like a bad break for me I\nwasn't killed.\n\nTom\nI mean it, Leo. Start taking Caspar seriously.\n\nLeo\nDon't sing me the blues again, Tommy. I need\nyour help. He shoots, we gotta answer--\n\nTom\nThat's what got you in this mess.\n\nLeo\nI know, I know. Retreat to win. Give up Bernie.\nThat'll solve all our problems.\n\nTom\nIt won't anymore, I'll grant that. Now its\neither you or Caspar. But going toe-to-toe with\na psychopath'll get you nowhere. It'll force\neveryone to choose sides just when you're looking\nshaky.\n\nLeo\nThe hell I do!\n\nTom\nThen where's the mayor? Why aren't there any\npolice here? Why weren't there police at your\nplace last night?\n\nLeo\nI didn't ask for any.\n\nTom\nI did.\n\nLeo chuckles.\n\nLeo\nMother hen, huh? What's the matter, Tommy, you\nthink I can't take care of myself?\n\nTom\nI know you can't. Here's the smart play, Leo:\nyou lay back, give up Bernie, let Caspar think\nhe's made his point. Wait for him to show you a\nweakness--\n\nLeo\nPlease, Tom. . .\n\nTom stares at him.\n\nTom\nYou're sticking on Bernie. Sticking your neck\nout for a guy who'd chop you off at the heels if\nthere was two bits in it.\n\nLeo leans back in his chair, puts his feet up, and gazes\nout the window.\n\nLeo\n. . . Tom, it ain't all as clear-cut as you make\nit. . . Bernie's--Well hell, you know about me\nand Verna. . . Things now are--not that I haven't\nbeen a gentleman, but. . . I, uh. . . I plan to\nask her to marry me, Tom.\n\nThere is a long, awkward silence. Leo avoids Tom's look\nbut finally responds to the silence:\n\n. . . I guess you think that's a bonehead play.\n\nTom\nDo you think she wants you to?\n\nLeo\nHow the hell do I know, Tom?. . . I think she\ndoes. . . Yeah, 'course she does. I know, I\nknow, you think different but--well, we just\ndiffer on that.\n\nTom\nLeo.\n\nTom takes a deep breath, and exhales.\n\n. . . Caspar didn't kill Rug.\n\nAbsently:\n\nLeo\nCourse he did.\n\nTom\nNo. Think about it. Just this one time. Who\nwas Rug following?\n\nThis gets Leo's attention. He turns to look at Tom.\n\nLeo\n. . . Huh?\n\nTom\nIt needn't have been that sinister. A strange\nman, following her down a dark alley, late at\nnight. . . I've told you, Leo, she can take care\nof herself.\n\nLeo stares at Tom. He seems somewhat dazed.\n\nLeo\n. . . Tom, why're you saying that? Christ, Tom.\nI just told you, I plan to. . .\n\nTom\nThey pulled a .22 slug out of him. A pop gun,\nLeo--a woman's gun.\n\nLeo\n. . . That's a whiskey dream. Verna wouldn't\npanic--shoot someone--just because he was\nfollowing her.\n\nHe gazes off again, shaking his head.\n\n. . . No. . . It wouldn't have happened that way\nin the first place, and if it had she would have\ntold me. . . I know you don't like her, Tom, but\nI trust Verna as much as I trust you.\n\nTom\nOn her account you'll burn the town down.\n\nLeo\nDon't worry, Tom. We'll still be standing when\nthe smoke clears.\n\nTom's tone is gentle:\n\nTom\nOkay Leo. Then maybe it wasn't that innocent.\nMaybe Rug knew something she didn't like him\nknowing, and wouldn't want you to know. He was\nfollowing her. He knew who she was seeing. He\nknew where she was sleeping, and who with. . .\n\nLeo has taken his feet off the sill and has turned back to\nface Tom. He studies him carefully.\n\nLeo\nMaybes don't make it so.\n\nTom's suddenly very earnest, almost beseeching.\n\nTom\nThey're more than maybes. You've trusted me\nbefore, and never lost anything by it. Trust me\non this.\n\nLeo\nThis is too important.\n\nTom\nI don't ask much, and I don't ask often. Trist\nme on this.\n\nLeo\nTommy--\n\nTom\nTrust me on this or the hell with you.\n\nLeo\nYou don't mean that.\n\nTom\n. . . She was at my place. The night Rug was\nfollowing her; the night you dropped by.\n\nLeo is still staring impassively at Tom. Tom doesn't\nflinch from his gaze.\n\nAfter a long beat Leo gets up slowly from his chair, walks\nover to the window, shoves his hands in his pockets and\ngazes out.\n\nFor a moment Tom looks at Leo's motionless back, but he has\nnothing left to say. He rises, plucks his hat from the\ndesk and goes to the door. Before exiting, he looks back.\n\nLeo, in long shot, is still gazing out the window.\n\nTom exits.\n\n33. HALLWAY\n\nPulling Tom up the hall.\n\nBehind him we can see the door to Leo's office opening and\nLeo coming out. He strides up the hall after Tom.\n\nTom turns as Leo reaches him.\n\nLeo, without breaking stride, seems to walk right into him,\nthrowing a punch that catches Tom on the chin and sends him\nstumbling back, his hat flying off.\n\nThe men 1ining the hall watch with casual interest.\n\nTom staggers into one of the men who catches him. Another\nman has picked up Tom's hat and now hands it to him. The\nfirst man shoves Tom back into the middle of the hall just\nin time for the approaching Leo to land another punch\nagainst his jaw.\n\n34. This blow sends Tom rolling down the staircase, still\nclutching his hat.\n\nLeo is clomping down the stairs; his army of private\nretainers clomp down behind him. In his shirtsleeves and\nchomping an unlit cigar, Leo looks like a labor leader\ntaking the rank and file to the barricades.\n\nTom claws himself up the wall to his feet.\n\nLeo has reached the floor and still without breaking stride\nuppercuts Tom with a blow that straightens him up and sends\nhim staggering like a drunk into gamblers in evening\ndresses and tuxedos.\n\nA path clears for Leo and his entourage. He has not\nslackened his pace, but is also not hurrying. Tom weaves,\nwatching Leo approach, but makes no attempt to defend\nhimself.\n\nLeo grabs his own wrist with one hand and swings his elbow\nup to catch Tom with a sharp blow on the side of his face.\n\nTom spins into a screaming lady in a sequined evening dress\nand sinks to the floor grabbing at her bodice and skirt for\nsupport. She bats at him with her handbag as he slips\ndown.\n\nFat Tony emerges from the crowd and helps Tom to his feet.\nHe raises his hand to stop Leo.\n\nTony\nOkay, Leo. I'll throw him out.\n\nLeo stops, panting. He is looking at Tom, but speaking to to\nTony.\n\nLeo\n. . . Yeah. Do that. . . It's the kiss-off. If\nI never see him again it'll be soon enough.\n\n35. CUT TO:\nTOM'S APARTMENT\n\nWide shot of his living room, facing the windows. It is\nnight.\n\nTom sits with his back to us at the window, feet propped up\non the sill. He is smoking a cigarette. A full ashtray on\na table at his side indicates that he has been sitting\nthere for some time.\n\nWe are slowly tracking in.\n\nThe telephone sits on the the arm of his chair. After a\nmoment he stubs out the cigarette, picks up the phone and\ndials.\n\nTom\n. . .'Lo Frankie its Tom, how's the flunky\nbusiness?. . . I've had worse; your ventilator\nhealing up?\n\nOffscreen we hear a knocking at the door to the apartment.\nTom ignores it.\n\n. . . Tell Caspar its already forgotten. I'd\nlike to see him. . .\n\nThe knocking continues.\n\n. . . All right, do what you have to do and let\nme know.\n\nHe cradles the phone, lights another cigarette, takes a\ndrag, blows a thoughtful cloud of smoke and turns to face\nthe door. After a beat he rises and leaves frame.\n\nTHE DOOR\n\nAs Tom swings it open. Verna stands in the hallway\noutside. After a wordless beat she moves past him into the\napartment. Tom turns and follows her.\n\nHe walks over to his bar, pours two drinks, then crosses\nthe room to Verna who has seated herself, hands her a drink\nand sits down in a chair facing hers.\n\nVerna\n. . . It worked, whatever you did; Leo told me\nwe're quits. But you know I didn't have anything\nto do with Rug.\n\nTom\nMaybe not. . . Anyway, that isn't what soured him\non you.\n\nThe thought is bitter but her tone isn't:\n\nVerna\nOh, you and me, huh? You always take the long\nway around to get what you want, don't you Tom.\n. . . You could have just asked.\n\nTom looks at her.\n\nTom\n. . . What did I want?\n\nVerna returns his look, then answers evenly:\n\nVerna\nMe.\n\nAfter a beat Tom, his eyes still on Verna, brings the glass\nto his lips and takes a sip. The ice cubes clink.\n\nFADE OUT\n\n36. FADE IN:\nTHE BEDROOM\n\nTom sits perched on the edge of the bed, smoking a ciga-\nrette. Verna is in bed behind him. The lamp on the\nnightstand is burning a faint yellow.\n\nThe telephone rings.\n\nAs Tom reaches for it, Verna stirs behind him.\n\nTom\nYeah?\n\nHe reaches over to switch off the light; when he does the\nroom remains illuminated by dull gray light; it is dawn.\n\n. . . Yeah yeah, when?. . . Okay.\n\nHe hangs up, and continues to smoke, staring absently off.\n\nVerna\n. . . You're still up?\n\nTom answers without turning to face her:\n\nTom\nYeah.\n\nVerna\n. . . What're you chewing over?\n\nTom\n. . . Remembering something. . .\n\nVerna\nWhat was it?\n\nTom turns to look at her, then turns back and looks out the\nwindow.\n\nTom\nJust a dream. I was walking in the woods, don't\nknow why. . . The wind came up and blew my hat\noff. . .\n\nVerna\nAnd you chased it, right? You ran and ran and\nfinally you caught up to it and picked it up but\nit wasn't a hat anymore. It had changed into\nsomething else--something wonderful.\n\nTom\nNo. It stayed a hat. And no I didn't chase it.\nI watched it blow away. . .\n\nHe takes a drag an the cigarette.\n\n. . . Nothing more foolish than a man chasing his\nhat.\n\nTom rouses himself, rises, and we pan to follow as he picks\nup a shirt and starts buttoning it in the bureau mirror.\n\nVerna\nWhere're you going?\n\nTom\nOut.\n\nVerna stares at him.\n\nVerna\n. . . Don't let on more than you have to.\n\nTom shrugs.\n\nTom\nJust have to do a few things.\n\nVerna\nYou and Leo might still be able to patch\nthings up.\n\nTom grimaces into the mirror.\n\nTom\nMe and Leo are finished. Nothing's going to\nchange that.\n\nVerna\nYou never know. He's got a big heart.\n\nTom\nWe're quits--as far as I'm concerned, never mind\nhim. And if Leo did want me back he's an even\nbigger sap than I thought.\n\nVerna\n. . . Then why don't we just pick up and leave\ntown? There's nothing keeping you here. I know\nthere's nothing keeping me.\n\nTom is starting to knot a tie.\n\nTom\nWhat about Bernie?\n\nVerna\nHe could come with us.\n\nTom\nYou, me and Bernie. Where would we go, Verna?\nNiagara Falls?\n\nVerna\nWhy do you hate him?\n\nTom\nI don't hate anyone.\n\nVerna\nOr like anyone.\n\nTom\nWhatever. Where is Bernie?\n\nVerna looks at him.\n\nVerna\nWhy?\n\nTom\nLeo can't protect him anymore. I ought to tell\nhim to skip.\n\nVerna\nThe Royale. Room three-oh-two.\n\nShe gazes off.\n\n. . . I guess we both double-crossed Leo, there's\nno getting around that. I guess he's well rid of\nboth of us.\n\nTom\nMm.\n\nVerna\nThe two of us, we're about bad enough to deserve\neach other.\n\nTom\nAre we?\n\nVerna\nWe're a couple of heels, Tom. Yes we are.\n\n37. PULLING TOM\n\nInto a dark office. Behind him, Frankie, his nose swathed\nwith bandages, is closing the door from the outside.\n\nCaspar (off)\n'Lo, Kid. You know O'Gar. . .\n\nTOM'S POV\n\nCaspar sits behind his desk. Bluenoint sits slouched on a\ncouch to one side, wearing his hat, his hands jammed into\nthe pockets of his overcoat.\n\nIn two chairs facing the desk, away from us, sit two men\nwho are twisting around to smile at Tom.\n\nCaspar\n. . . and the mayor.\n\nTom\n'Lo, boys.\n\nMayor\nTom's a big booster. Always has been.\n\nCaspar\nS'fine, s'fine. Well, Tom and me's got the\nproverbial fat to chew--\n\nThe mayor and O'Gar are already rising to their feet.\n\nMayor\nWell, let us know if you need anything. . .\n\nCaspar\nYeah, happy days. Have a seat, kid. . .\n\nTom sits into one of the vacated chairs facing Caspar.\n\n. . . So you had enough time to think about it?\n\nTom\nYeah, well, circumstances have changed.\n\nCaspar\nDon't I know it. Last night, I know Bluepoint\nwas disappointed the bulls showed up before\nFrankie and Tic-Tac could really pin your ears\nback, but I said, Relax, Bluepoint, I got a\nfeeling about this kid. Take the long view. The\nkid and Leo are gonna go bust-o. If the kid ain't\nready yet, well, he soon will be. Matter of\ntime. I said, the kid's too smart for Leo.\nThat's what I said. Like a psychic. Ask\nBluepoint if I didn't. Like a goddamn psychic.\nG'ahead. Ask him.\n\nTom turns to look at Bluepoint.\n\nTom\nYou vouch for this psychic business?\n\nFrom the couch, Bluepoint sneers:\n\nBluepoint\nThat's right, smart guy.\n\nCaspar cheerfully continues, oblivious to any hostility in\nthe room:\n\nCaspar\nI know you knew protecting the Motzah was a dumb\nidea. I know you been wise to all of Leo's dumb\nideas lately. Only a matter of time. Bust-o.\n\nHe chuckles.\n\n. . . That's why last night we didn't put the arm\non you. Only Leo.\n\nTom\nSeeing how you squiffed your play on Leo, I can\nbe only so grateful.\n\nBluepoint\nThat's brave, coming from Little Miss Punching\nBag.\n\nCaspar\nC'mon Bluepoint. Friends now, huh?\n\nBluepoint\nNuts.\n\nCaspar smiles at Tom.\n\nCaspar\nSo we get a little jingle. And I figure you know\nLeo's on his way out. It's only a matter of time\nbefore we get him. Am I right, kid?\n\nTom\nMaybe.\n\nCaspar laughs.\n\nCaspar\nWhat maybe. You know or you wouldn't be bust-o.\nSo I guess you're looking for a job?\n\nTom\nI might be.\n\nCaspar laughs.\n\nCaspar\nYou got references? You been to college, kid?\nWe only take yeggs what's been to college. Ain't\nthat right, Bluepoint?\n\nBluepoint says nothing. His scowl is set in cement.\n\n. . . I'm jokin', of course. We all know you can\nbe useful to us, a smart kid such as yaself, the\nman who walks behind the man and whispers in his\near. I guess you could be useful, in spades.\n\nTom\nYeah. I can do plenty for you. But the fact is\nthat right now Leo's still got all his vital\nsigns and once he hears about this he'll be more\nanxious to get to me than to either of you.\n\nCaspar\nI'm tellin' ya not to worry about Leo. We got\nplans for him.\n\nTom\nYeah? What?\n\nBluepoint\nNot so fast there, Kaputnik.\n\nThere is a beat through which Caspar continues to smile at\nTom.\n\nCaspar\n. . . I think what the Bluepoint is trying to say\nis, there'll be time to talk about that. That\ncan be tabled for a later date. See, the last\ntime we jawed you gave-me the high hat. So I\nguess I'm sayin', maybe we want your confidence\nbefore we give you ours. You gotta put somethin'\non the table. Ante up.\n\nTom\nFair enough. Where shall we start.\n\nCaspar\nHear that, Bluepoint? All business! I told you\nhe was a good kid! Where shall we start! All\nbusiness!. . .\n\nHe rocks back in his chair and dries his eyes. Tom smiles\npleasantly. Finally Caspar sighs.\n\n. . . Well, we could start for instance with the\nMotzah. . . Like where's the Motzah? You could\nmaybe tell us that. . .\n\nTom\nThe Royale. Room three-oh-two. You might find\nMink with him.\n\nBluepoint\nThe hell you say.\n\nTom\nSure, Bernie and Mink are as cozy as lice.\n\nHe turns to look at Bluepoint.\n\n. . . And it ain't just business.\n\nCaspar looks at Bluepoint. Bluepoint's eyes bare into Tom.\n\nBluepoint\nThis guy's lying.\n\nTom shrugs.\n\nTom\nWhy would I?\n\nBluepoint\nThis guy's wrong. This guy's all wrong. Mink is\nclean and this clown is a smart guy.\n\nCaspar is still staring at Bluepoint, no longer smiling.\n\nCaspar\nEasy enough to find out, ain't it? You find\nMink, bring him back here.\n\nHe nods at Tom.\n\n. . . You go down to the car. I'll send Frankie\nand Tic-Tac with you to the Royale. If Bernie's\nthere, Frankie and Tic-Tac'll take care of him.\n\nBluepoint\nAnd if he's not there?\n\nTom shrugs.\n\nTom\nI'll sit facing the corner in a funny hat.\n\n38. CUT TO:\nINT CAR\n\nTom sits behind the wheel of the parked car; we are an his\nprofile.\n\nTom's face is rigidly set; we don't know why as we watch\nhim for a short beat.\n\nBAM--with a loud impact Bernie Bernheim's face is slammed\nagainst the driver's window. Tom still faces forward.\n\nBernie is wailing as he is muscled back away from the\nwindow by two topcoated torsos--their faces above the car\nwindow.\n\nThey muscle Bernie out of frame towards the rear of the car\nand we hear the back door being opened.\n\nBernie's voice, off, is near hysteria:\n\nBernie\nFrankie, let me go, I'm prayin' to ya, Jesus God-\n-Tom! Jesus!\n\nAs Frankie and Tic-Tac pile Bernie into the back, we\ncontinue to hold on Tom's face. He still does not react.\n\nBernie\n. . . Are you part of this?! You can't be part\nof this! I think these guys're gonna whack me!\nYou gotta talk to 'em, Tommy!\n\nFrankie\nYou gimme a headache, you little sheeny.\n\nTo Tom:\n\nTic-Tac\nOkay, we're going to Miller's Crossing.\n\nTom still doesn't react. There is a beat of Bernie's crying.\nFinally:\n\nFrankie\n. . . Lets go!\n\nAs Tom reaches forward and starts the car:\n\nBernie\nYou're not part of this! Tom! Help me! These\nguys are gonna whack me!\n\nTic-Tac\nWhack you inna mouth you don't shut up.\n\n39. MILLER'S CROSSING WIDE\n\nDay. A wooded area outside of town. The wind blows.\n\nThe car pulls into frame and stops on the shoulder. The\nbackseat passengers--Frankie, Tic-Tac and Bernie--emerge;\nTom remains in the driver's seat.\n\nBernie is weeping, loudly; he has lost control. Frankie\ntakes out a gun and whacks him smartly on the side of his\nhead. The blow sends him stumbling over towards Tic-Tac,\nwho kicks him down.\n\nThe blows haven't quelled Bernie's sobbing.\n\nTic-Tac\nI don't want you runnin' anywhere.\n\nFrankie takes a swig from his flask and hands it to Tic-\nTac, who leans in the car window.\n\nINT CAR\n\nTom gazes forward, jaw set, eyes off the doings outside.\n\nAs Tic-Tac hands his gun in through the window:\n\nTic-Tac\nOkay. Take him in the woods and whack him.\n\nTom\nHuh? I don't. . .\n\nTic-Tac\nYeah, that's right, the boss wants you to do it.\nMake sure you're with the good guys.\n\nTom stares dumbly at the gun. Tic-Tac holds it, grip\ntowards Tom, motionless.\n\nAfter a beat he takes the gun.\n\nTic-Tac\nYou know how to do this, right? You gotta\nremember to put one in his brain. Your first\nshot puts him down, then you put one in his\nbrain. Then he's dead, then we go home.\n\nTom opens his door.\n\nWIDE EXT\n\nBernie is still on the ground, sobbing, not responding to\nFrankie who prods him with his foot.\n\nFrankie\nGet up.\n\nBernie\nI can't get up! I can't get up!\n\nFrankie drags him to his feet.\n\nFrankie\nGet up and walk, you chiselin' little yid.\n\nHe pushes him towards the woods and reaches for the whiskey\nflask.\n\nBernie stumbles off; Tom follows him.\n\n40. TRACK\n\nThrough the woods, pulling the two men, Bernie in the\nforeground. Tree limbs groan in the wind.\n\nBernie is stumbling, his clothes rumpled and dirty, his\nface stained by tears and blood from the gun blow. His\nshaking voice strains for a tone of reasonableness:\n\nBernie\n. . . Tommy, you can't do this. You don't bump\nguys. You're not like those animals back there.\n. .\n\nTom marches on, face drawn, silent.\n\n. . . It's not right, Tom. They can't make us do\nthis. It's a wrong situation. They can't make\nus different people than we are. We're not\nmuscle, Tom. I never killed anybody. I used a\nlittle information for a chisel, that's all. I\ncouldn't help it, Tom, it's my nature. Somebody\nhands me an angle, I play it. I don't deserve to\ndie for that! D'you think I do? I'm just a\ngrifter! Huh, Tom?\n\nStill no response from Tom. Bernie is fighting a losing\nbattle to keep himself from whining.\n\n. . . But I'll tell you what, I never crossed a\nfriend. Huh, Tom? Never killed anybody, never\ncrossed a friend. Nor you, I'll bet. We're not\nlike those animals. You can't do this! You're\nnot like those animals. This is not us! This is\nsome hop dream!\n\nTom's face is a ---ny mask. Bernie is losing control\nagain. He starts to weep.\n\n. . . It's a dream! Tommy! I'm praying to you!\nI can't die! I can't die! Out here in the\nwoods! Like a dumb animal! I can't die!\n\nHe turns and sinks to his knees, wailing, his hands clasped\nin front of him, staring up at Tom.\n\n. . . You can't kill me. I'm praying to you!\nlook in your heart! I'm praying to you! Look in\nyour heart!\n\nTom stares down at Bernie, his face drawn and pale.\n\n. . . I'm praying to you! Look in your heart!\n\nSlowly Tom raises the gun and levels it at Bernie's head.\n\n. . . Look in your heart! Look in your--\n\nBOOM! The gun blast is deafening. With it, Bernie's\nsobbing abruptly stops.\n\nThe shot echoes away in the woods, taking the wind with it,\nleaving silence.\n\nCLOSE BERNIE\n\nStill kneeling, in shock, staring wide-eyed at Tom.\n\nFinally, whispering:\n\nBernie\n. . . Tommy.\n\nTom\nShutup. You're dead, get me?\n\nStill whispering:\n\nBernie\nI understand. I'm dead. God bless you--\n\nTom\nShutup. You have to disappear. You have to\nblow, for good. Nobody can see you, nobody can\nknow.\n\nBernie\nGod bless you--\n\nTom\nGo somewhere no one knows you. Anyone sees you,\nyou really are dead, I don't care, you're not my\nproblem any more.\n\nBernie\nOf course not. Of course not. You've done your\nshare. Thank you. Don't worry, I understand.\nThank you--\n\nTom\nShutup. Just get the hell out, before I change\nmy mind.\n\nBernie is already on his feet, and running.\n\nCLOSE ON TOM\n\nWatching Bernie go.\n\nTRACKING\n\nPulling Bernie as he runs. Foreground trees flash by. In\nthe background we see Tom standing, his gun dangling at his\nside.\n\nBoom!--another gun blast. Running, Bernie reacts, but Tom\nhas only fired into the ground.\n\nOn the echo of the shot we cut to:\n\n41. WIDE THE ROAD\n\nTic-Tac and Frankie are leaning against the car, trading\nthe flask back and forth.\n\nIn the background, Tom emerges from the woods.\n\nFrankie\nPut one in his brain?\n\nTom takes a few steps more before answering:\n\nTom\n. . . Yeah.\n\nFrankie\nAttaboy.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nOver black we hear the sound of coins being dropped into a\nphone box.\n\n42. FADE IN\n\nLooking down a deserted street towards a glowing phone\nbooth on a dark corner. Tom stands inside the booth\nwaiting, the receiver to his ear.\n\nTom\nMink? Tom Duchaisne. Where've you been?. . .\n\nCLOSE ON TOM\n\nInside the phone booth.\n\n. . . Well you're lucky, Bluepoint's been looking\nfor you. Bernie's dead--Stop wailing and listen\nto me. Caspar knows you were in on selling out\nhis fix. . . I guess I gave him that idea. Sorry\nMink, we were chatting and it just slipped out.--\nShutup and let me talk. You've gotta make\nyourself missing, but let me know where you hole\nup. You're gonna say some things for me. . .\nSome stories. About Bluepoint, to Caspar--don't\nworry, I'll let you know. For now just dis-\nappear. . . Yeah, I got you into it. Just\nremember, Mink, I'm the only one who can get you\nout.\n\nTom hangs up the phone, turns around and opens up the glass\ndoor.\n\nWHOMMMP! A fist slams into his stomach, driving him back\ninto the phone booth, knocking his hat off of his head.\n\nThe man who hit him leans down, picks up the hat, dusts it\noff and hands it into the booth. It is Dead Terry, the\ntall cadaverous man we saw earlier outside of Leo's office.\nA cigarette dangles from his lower lip.\n\nBehind him a black sedan is parked at the curb. Three or\nfour gunmen stand on the sidewalk looking warily up and\ndown the road.\n\nTom looks up, the color drained from his face, and reaches\nfeebly out for his hat.\n\nTom\n'Lo, Terry. Getting out the vote?\n\nDead Terry flicks his cigarette away and smiles.\n\nTerry\nMessage from Leo. Leo says, if you're smart\nyou'll sit this one out--not that he cares one\nway or the other. Leo says if you're on the\nwrong side you take your chances, like anyone\nelse. Leo says he gives no special favors.\nThat's all.\n\nTom\nMm. . .\n\nTerry starts to turn away.\n\n. . . Tell Leo he's not God on the throne, he's\njust a cheap mick political boss with no brains\nand an office that looks like a French whore-\nhouse.\n\nTom moves to exit the booth but Terry lays a hand on his\nshoulder.\n\nTerry\nOne more thing. . .\n\nHe cracks Tom across the chin with a clean left hook,\nknocking him back into the booth again.\n\nTom rubs his chin, looking up at Terry.\n\nTom\nLeo say that too. . . ?\n\nAs Terry and the gunmen get into the car:\n\nTerry\nNo, I said that. Cross Leo and next time I'll\nsay plenty.\n\nWe FADE OUT as the door slams and the car roars off.\n\nOver black we hear:\n\nCaspar\nWhen you're right you're right, but you never say\nI told you so.\n\n43. FADE IN\n\nOn Tom, sitting into frame in Caspar's office.\n\nTom\nSo what'm I right about?\n\nBehind his desk, Caspar is smiling.\n\nCaspar\nWell, I'll tell ya, but first you gotta promise\nnot to say I told you so.\n\nTom's eyes hold an Caspar's. He is taking out a pack of\ncigarettes.\n\nTom\nI never say that. And I don't like people who\ndo.\n\nCaspar\nMink was robbin' me right along with the Mptzah.\n\nTom\n. . . What convinced you of that?\n\nCaspar\nMink Larouie took a powder. We can't find him.\nBluepoint's makin' excuses for him, but personal-\nly, I think you were right. I think Mink and\nBernie was in it together. I think Mink heard\nyou'd bumped the Motzah, and lit out. The lousy\nsonofabitch.\n\nHis eyes on Caspar, Tom takes out a cigarette, lights it,\ntakes a deep drag.\n\nTom\n. . . I told you so.\n\nCaspar laughs.\n\nCaspar\nOkay. You got a lip on ya. Ats all right. I\ndon't generally care for it, but that's all\nright. . . You were a good sport to bump the\nMotzah. I just like to make sure my friends is\nmy friends. So.\n\nHe throws his hands up.\n\n. . . Friends, right?\n\nTom\nHow d'you know Mink skipped?\n\nCaspar\nBluepoint can't find him.\n\nTom\nSo he says.\n\nCaspar stares at Tom.\n\nCaspar\nMeanin' what, exactly?\n\nTom\nMaybe nothing. . . I didn't give it much thought\nuntil now, since a guy will say pretty much\nanything when he knows his number is up, but just\nbefore I bumped Bernie he swore to me that\nBluepoint and Mink were setting him up. That\nthey were the ones that were selling out your\nfix.\n\nCaspar looks at Tom.\n\nCaspar\n'Zat so. . .\n\nHe thinks for a beat.\n\n. . . Like you say, a guy'll say anything.\n\nTom\n. . . Uh-huh. So why isn't Bluepoint here?\n\nCaspar\nWell. . .\n\nHe figdets.\n\n. . . He don't care for you, kid. Maybe it's\nonly fair to tell you. . . After you left us, he\ntried to sell me on a double-cross. He says to\nme, why don't we double-cross you and give you\nthe bump once we get the Motzah. But I figure a\ndeals a deal, you're square with me, you bump the\nMotzah, I'll hold up my end. Question of ethics.\nEverything above board, that's how I like it, so\neverybody knows who's a friend and who's an\nenemy. . . But Bluepoint wouldn't cross me. We\ngo back.\n\nTom\nUh-huh. . . Course, there's always that wild card\nwhen love is involved. . .\n\nCaspar is staring intently at Tom. After a beat:\n\nCaspar\n. . . I know Mink is Bluepoint's boy, but I still\ndon't make it that way.\n\nTom\nMm. Well, then there's nothing to worry about.\n\nCaspar seems lost in thought:\n\nCaspar\nYeah. . .\n\nWe hear the door to the office open offscreen and Johnny\nJr. runs into frame clutching a scrolled piece of paper.\n\nJohnny Jr.\nPoppa! Poppa! I got a prize from the--\n\nCaspar holds his hand up to quiet the youngster, still\nlooking at Tom.\n\nCaspar\nJust a minute.\n\nAs Tom rises to his feet:\n\n. . . Course, there's no reason not to be\ncareful--\n\nJohnny Jr.\nPoppa! Poppa! The sisters gave me a--unnnh!\n\nCascar has cuffed him sharply on the side of the head.\nHe points at Tom.\n\nCaspar\nShaddap! You take a page outta this guy's book.\nA little less you talk and a little more you\nthink!\n\nCascar looks at Tom and smiles.\n\n. . . Kids. Ya gotta be firm. Anyways. You\nknow what I'm sayin'. No reason to worry but no\nreason not to investigate, neither. If Mink is\naround I want you to find him. He can tell us\nwhat's what. . .\n(to Johnny Jr.:)\n. . . What's a matter, somebody hit you, what's a\nmatter, we ain't friends anymore?. . .\n\nHe picks up Johnny Jr., who is crying softly, and sets him\nin his lap. Encouraged by the attention, the child starts\nwailing. Caspar bounces him on his knee and raises his\nvoice over the sobs:\n\n. . . If you find him, I wanna talk to him alone.\nThat's how you get the straight dope. Man-to-\nman. Just me, Mink. . .\n\nHe pats his jacket where his shoulder holster is.\n\n. . . and my friend roscoe. Y'understand what\nI'm sayin'?\n\nTom takes a contemplative drag on his cigarette.\n\nTom\n. . . It ain't complicated.\n\n44. CUT TO:\nCLOSE SHOT A MAN'S FACE\n\nCrunch!--being hit by a gloved hand.\n\nThe blow and the man's grunt echo.\n\nCLOSE ON A NEWSPAPER\n\nAs the noise of fists against flesh continues, echoing, in\nthe background.\n\nThe newspaper headline reads: PARTY BOSS LOOSES MUNICIPAL\nCONTRACT. The subhead reads: Liam (Leo) O'Bannon Removed\nFrom City Highway Commission; New Construction Contracts\nTo Raffo Bros.\n\nON TOM\n\nLeaning against a pillar in a large bare room with a\nhardwood floor. He is reading the newspaper.\n\nWe are in a gym. In a ring in the background two boxers\nare sparring as two or three old men with towels slung over\ntheir shoulders and elbows hooked over the ropes idly\nwatch, and offer occasional bits of half-hearted advice.\n\nWe hear high heels echoing across the floor and Verna\nenters.\n\nTom\nYou should leave town for a few days; things are\ngoing to heat up here. Go out to the Pallisades;\nI'll join you once I'm done.\n\nVerna\n. . . I can't find Bernie. Did you find him?\n\nTom looks out at the fighters in the background, avoiding\nVerna's look.\n\nTom\n. . . Yeah.\n\nVerna\nIs he leaving?\n\nTom\nHe left.\n\nVerna\nWhere to?\n\nTom\n. . . He didn't say. You should--\n\nShe reaches out to touch his hand--\n\nVerna\nThanks.\n\nShe leans in to embrace him.\n\nTom's eyes drift up to the fighters.\n\n45. EXT THE GYM\n\nPeeling paint on its blackened-out window reads: Gleason's\nGym. Training in The Sweet Science.\n\nVerna is exiting the gym in long shot.\n\nWe pull back to bring Bluepoint into frame. He sits in the\ndriver's seat of a car, watching through his side window as\nVerna recedes. Quietly:\n\nBluepoint\nWhat's he up to?\n\nAn offscreen voice, a passenger:\n\nVoice\nI dunno.\n\nBluepoint\nThat's Bernie's sister, isn't it?\n\nVoice\nI dunno.\n\nBluepoint thinks, a short beat.\n\nBluepoint\nWhat's he seeing her for?\n\nVoice\nI dunno, maybe he's--\n\nBluepoint\nShutup. Get outta the car. Stick with the\nbighead.\n\nBluepoint reaches for the ignition, as we hear the car door\nopen.\n\n. . . I'll see where the twist flops.\n\n46. CUT TO:\nINT SPEAKEASY\n\nA hand swings through frame holding the barrel of a gun,\nsmashing the butt into a surprised face.\n\nWith a loud crash the surprised man stumbles back into a\ntable and hits the floor. Legs and the skirts of an\novercoat approach the prostrate, round, middle-aged man and\nstart kicking him.\n\nHe rolls across the floor trying to shield himself from the\nblows.\n\nVoice (off)\nC'mon, get up. I just wanna talk.\n\nAnother Voice (off)\nYeah, get up. He ain't gonna hurt ya.\n\nRound Man\nHe already hurt me! He broke my goddamn nose!\n\nWhisper, the man standing over him, has a long scar across\nhis neck. He has a rasping voice:\n\nWhisper\nSo what? I had my nose broke once.\n\nRound Man\nI already paid Leo's men.\n\nBert, another enforcer, is down at the end of the bar with\nTom.\n\nBert\nYou still pay Leo for protection? Is he protec-\ntin' you?\n\nAs he kicks at the little round man:\n\nWhisper\nWe's protectin' you. Johnny Caspar's runnin'\nthings or maybe you ain't heard.\n\nIn the background Whisper continues to hector and kick at\nthe round man as Bert and Tom talk in the foreground.\n\nTom\nSo Bluepoint hasn't got a line on Leo yet?\n\nBert\nNot that I know about. He's been lookin', but I\nguess Leo's been movin' around and--hoist this\nover the bar, will ya?--and thingslve been kinda\nhectic.\n\nHe is handing Tom a briefcase. As Tom leans over the bar\nto drop it behind:\n\nTom\nDo me a favor--let me know if he finds anything.\n\nBert is pouring himself a drink.\n\nBert\nYeah, okay--\n\nWhisper, gun drawn, calls from the back of the bar:\n\nWhisper\nI'm gonna put this one to sleep, wuddya think\nBert?\n\nBert shrugs into his overcoat.\n\nBert\nYeah, okay.\n\nTom\nIf you kill him he won't be able to think things\nover.\n\nWhisper\nHe don't seem like such a hot thinker.\n\nTom\nYou'll think about what you've learned here,\nwon't you Louie?\n\nRound Man\nYou bet, Tom, I'll think plenty!\n\nBert shrugs.\n\nBert\nAh, what the hell. . .\n\nThe round man scrambles to his feet and runs out the back\ndoor. Whisper puts away his gun and saunters over to Tom\nand Bert.\n\nAs the three men head for the front door:\n\nBert\n. . . If we can't trust a dago, the whole thing's\nhopeless anyway.\n\n47. EXT SPEAKEASY\n\nAs the three men emerge into the afternoon sun.\n\nTom\nSo, are we winning?\n\nBert gives a so-so flutter of his hand.\n\nBert\nIt's tough. Leo's still got some teeth left.\nHis men bushwhacked Tony Campisi last night, slit\nhis throat.\n\nWhisper\nYeah? He die?\n\nBert\nI said, they slit his throat.\n\nWhisper\nSo what, genius? I had my t'roat slit once.\n\nTom\nSure Whisper, but normal people's brains need\noxygen--\n\nBOOM!--Behind the three men the front of the speakeasy\nblows--glass flying, flame licking out.\n\nThough there is commotion among the passers-by, Tom, Bert\nand Whisper don't even turn around to look.\n\nBert\nGet the car, will ya Whisper?\n\nAs Whisper trots out into the street:\n\nTom\nDon't tell Bluepoint I was asking about him.\n\nBert\nYeah yeah.\n\nTom\nCaspar just wanted me to check up, make sure he's\ndoing everything he can--\n\nThere is a faint but distinct popping sound.\n\nTom looks into the street.\n\nWhisper is staggering around, as if drunk. He turns to\nface Tom and Bert.\n\nHe lurches toward them. A red stain is blossoming on his\nchest.\n\nThe ambient hubbub fades to total silence; we hear only the\ncrisp staggering scuffle of Whisper's shoes as he stumbles\ninto the foreground, looking stunned.\n\nHe drops.\n\nA woman screams.\n\nNoise wells up.\n\nBert is unhoistering his gun, looking up.\n\nTom looks where Bert is looking.\n\nFACING ROOFTOP\n\nA man with a distinctive shock of white hair--Dead Terry\nMcGill. He puts up his gun and starts running along the\nroof.\n\nBERT\n\nStarts running along the street to keep pace, firing up at\nthe facing roof.\n\nA POLICE CAR\n\nSiren wailing, up on two wheels, taking a speeding turn\nonto the street.\n\nIt is speeding towards Bert.\n\nPULLING BERT\n\nRunning, he is pointing, and bellowing at the car:\n\nBert\nLeo's man! Up there!\n\nPOLICE CAR\n\nCops with guns hang out every window. They start firing.\n\nTRACKING TOWARDS BERT\n\nBert\n. . . Up there! Leo's--\n\nA hail of bullets cuts him to pieces. A limp rag, he hits\nthe road.\n\nThe police car squeals to a halt in front of his corpse. A\nsergeant and his men pile out.\n\nTom is sauntering over, smoking a cigarette.\n\nSergeant\n'Lo, Tom. Chalk one up for the good guys, huh?\n\nTom\nYeah, Caspar'll be thrilled. You just shot one\nof his apes.\n\nSergeant\nBullshit!\n\nTom's attention is drawn by something down the street.\n\nHIS POV\n\nAbout a block away, a man with white hair is crossing the\nstreet, from the side where the sniper's shot came from.\n\nSergeant (off)\nI'm tellin' you that's Two-Toe Jackson! He's\nLeo's!\n\nBACK TO TOM\n\nAs he starts to leave.\n\nTom\nIt's Bert Sachetti, Caspar's bang-man.\n\nBehind him the Sergeant bellows at another cop:\n\nSergeant\nBullshit! Take his shoes off. Count his goddamn\ntoes!\n\n48. INT DINER\n\nDead Terry McGill sits at a stool looking angrily down at a\ncup of coffee. Tom enters to sit next to him.\n\nThrough the windows behind them, we can see people running\nback and forth on the street, a fire engine racing past--\nfurious activity, its noise muted inside the diner.\n\nTom\n'Lo, Terry. You weren't aiming at me, were you?\n\nTerry does not even look over at him. Sullenly:\n\nTerry\nIn the first place, I don't know what you're\ntalking about. In the second place, if I had\nbeen aiming at you I'd've hit you. In the third\nplace, I don't know what you're talking about in\nthe first place.\n\nHe tosses some coins onto the counter and gets up. We hold\non Tom as Terry talks to Tom's back:\n\n. . . I'd like to have, believe me. Leo won't\nlet me--yet. But I'll bring him around.\n\nHe puts a hand on Tom's stoulder and swivels him around.\nTerry clenches a fist and draws it back to throw a punch.\n\nTom and Terry look at each other, Tom making no movement to\ndefend himself.\n\nAfter a long beat, Terry uncldnches his fist and sneers:\n\n. . . I won't give you the satisfaction.\n\n49. CUT TO:\nDOORKNOB\n\nAs--CRASH--a foot enters to kick it and the door in.\n\nINT VERNA'S APARTMENT\n\nVerna is backing away from the door--behind us--into the\napartment. Bluepoint strides into frame.\n\nBluepoint\nKnow who I am?\n\nVerna continues to back away; Bluepoint continues to\nadvance.\n\nVerna\nYeah, Johnny Caspar's shadow. Did he stay in bed\ntoday?\n\nBluepoint\nJesus. I open my mouth, the whole world turns\nsmart. . .\n\nHe glances around the room. Verna is backing around the\ncouch. Bluepoint continues to follow her.\n\n. . . What business d'you have with Tom Duchaisne?\n\nVerna\nNone.\n\nShe continues to back away; Bluepoint continues to follow.\n\nBluepoint\nYou're Leo's twist, right?\n\nVerna\nMe and Leo are through.\n\nShe picks up her purse from the sill behind the couch and\nrummages. Bluepoint doesn't seem to mind.\n\nBluepoint\nYeah? So you're sluttin' around with Tom now,\nhuh?\n\nVerna has taken a gun from her purse; she levels it at\nBluepoint.\n\nVerna\nGet outta here.\n\nAs he continues to stride towards her:\n\nBluepoint\nOkay, see ya later. . .\n\nHis hand shoots out in a flash--he has grabbed the gun with\none hand, her arm with the other.\n\n. . . Before I go, what's your boyfriend up to?\n\nVerna is stuggling in his grasp to no effect.\n\nVerna\nNothing I know about.\n\nBluepoint drags her close, nose to nose:\n\nBluepoint\nYeah? It doesn't figure for me, your dumping\nLeo for the guy who put a bullet in your brother.\n\nVerna stops resisting and stares at him.\n\nBluepoint stares back at her, thinking.\n\n. . . Didn't tell you, huh?\n\nWe hear a footstep offscreen.\n\nREVERSE\n\nFacing the door, from behind Bluepoint and Verna.\n\nBluepoint wheels, swinging her body in front of his as two\ntopcoated men enter, guns drawn.\n\nBoth intruders hold fire, their shot blocked by Verna. The\ngun in Bluepoint's hand barks once.\n\nThe lead man pitches forward, his gun clattering away.\n\nHis partner is ducking back out the door.\n\nVerna still struggles futilely; Bluepoint keeps his gun,\npeeking out from behind Verna, trained on the empty\ndoorway.\n\nThe man an the floor, still alive, has started clawing\nhimself towards his gun, a few paces away.\n\nBluepoint ignores him. He stares at the open door.\n\nAfter a silent beat, from the hall:\n\nMan In Hall\n. . . Let her go, Bluepoint, there's nothing you\ncan do. Leave by the fire escape. There's more\nof us on the way--\n\nBANG--Bluepoint fires.\n\nWood splinters in the door, which shudders back a few more\ninches towards the wall. The voice from the hall has\nstopped short.\n\nAfter a short silent beat, we hear a gun clattering to the\nfloor outside in the hall.\n\nWe hear fabric drag across wall, and then see the dead man\ndrop to the floor just outside the door.\n\nBluepoint tosses Verna away and saunters unhurriedly over\nto the first man, who has almost reached his gun.\n\nJust as the man's hand closes over it Bluepoint, in stride,\nsteps onto the hand and gun. Most of his weight is on it.\n\nHead cocked, he looks down at the man in front of him.\n\nBluepoint\n. . . You Leo's?\n\nMan\nYeah. He wanted her looked out for.\n\nBluepoint\nWell you did a bang-up job; I'll be sure to tell\nhim. Where is Leo?\n\nMan\n. . . If I tell you, how do know you won't kill\nme?\n\nBluepoint\nBecause if you told me, and I killed you, and you\nwere lying, then I wouldn't get to kill you then.\nWhere's Leo?\n\nThe man is sweating.\n\nMan\n. . . He's--he's moving around. But tomorrow\nnight he's getting his mob together at Whiskey\nNick's.\n\nBluepoint points his gun at the man's head.\n\nBluepoint\nYou sure?\n\nMan\nCheck it. It's gold.\n\nBluepeint\nYou know something, yegg? I believe you.\n\nBANG.\n\nBluepoint straightens up from the body and turns.\n\nLOW AND WIDE ON BLUEPOINT\n\nOne corpse an the floor beside him, the other corpse in the\ndoorway behind him.\n\nHe absently wraps one hand around the warm barrel of the\ngun, then brings the hand up to blow against its open palm.\n\nBluepoint\nGo ahead and run, sweetie . . .\n\nHIS POV THE WINDOW\n\nThe main zoom is now empty. Sheers billow at the window,\nnow open, that let's out on the fire escape. Off:\n\nBluepoint\n. . . I'll track down all a you whores.\n\n50. DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\nWINDOW NIGHT\n\nSheers billow in the breeze.\n\nTOM\n\nSitting up in bed, smoking a cigarette, thinking. The\nbedroom is dark.\n\nThere is a knock at the apartment's front door. Tom\nreacts, but does not immediately rise.\n\nThe knock is repeated.\n\nTom finally throws the covers off and swings his feet\naround to the floor.\n\nBut the knocking stops and another sound brings him up\nshort: The person at the door is now playing with the\nlock.\n\nTom sits motionless, listening.\n\nAfter some rattling we hear the lock spring, then the door\nswinging open, then shut again. We hear footsteps cross\nthe main room, and then the squeak of chair springs.\n\nSilence.\n\nTom rises and walks to the living room doorway. He leans\nagainst the jamb.\n\n51. HIS POV\n\nThe windows throw moonlit squares onto the floor. We can\nsee only the legs of someone sitting in the armchair.\n\nTom\n'Lo, Bernie. Come on in, make yourself at home.\n\nBernie turns on the lamn on the table at his elbow. He\nholds a gun casually in his lap.\n\nBernie\n'Lo, Tom. Thought I'd do that, since you didn't\nseem to be in. Figured it was a bad idea to wait\nin the hall, seeing as I'm supposed to be dead.\n\nTom\nMm.\n\nBernie\nHow'd you know it was me?\n\nTom\nYou're the only person I know'd knock and break\nin.\n\nBernie\nYour other friends wouldn't break in, huh?\n\nTom shakes his head.\n\nTom\nMy other friends wanna kill me, so they wouldn't\nknock.\n\nHe crosses to the chair facing Bernie's.\n\n. . . What's on your mind, Bernie?\n\nBernie\nThings. . . I guess you must be kind of angry.\nI'm supposed to be gone, far away. I guess it\nseems sort of irresponsible, my being here. . .\n\nBernie leaves room for a response but Tom is only listen-\ning.\n\n. . . And I was gonna leave. Honest I was. But\nthen I started thinking. If I stuck around, that\nwould not be good for you. And then I started\nthinking that. . . that might not be bad for me.\n\nTom still doesn't answer.\n\n. . . I guess you didn't see the play you gave\nme. I mean what'm I gonna do? If I leave, I got\nnothing--no money, no friends, nothing. If I\nstay, I got you. Anyone finds out I'm alive--\nyou're dead, so. . . I got you, Tommy.\n\nTom is silent.\n\n. . . What's the matter, you got nothin' to crack\nwise about? Bernie ain't so funny anymore?\n\nBernie's lip is quivering. His voice is softer:\n\n. . . I guess I made kinda a fool a myself out\nthere. . . I was shittin' myself, Tommy. . .\nyou didn't tell anyone about that.\n\nTom\nNo.\n\nBernie\n'Course you know about it. . . its . . . It's a\npainful memory. And I can't help remembering\nthat you put the finger on me, and you took me\nout there to whack me. . . I know you didn't. .\n. I know you didn't shoot me. . . but. . . but--\n\nTom\nBut what have I done for you lately?\n\nBernie\nDon't smart me.\n\nHe stares hard at Tom for a moment.\n\n. . . See, I wanna watch you squirm. I wanna see\nyou sweat a little. And when you smart me, it\nruins it.\n\nBernie gets to his feet, keeping the gun trained on Tom.\n\n. . . There's one other thing I want. I wanna\nsee Johnny Caspar cold and stiff. That's what\nyou'll do for your friend Bernie. . .\n\nHe has opened the door to the flat.\n\n. . . In the meantime I'll stay outa sight. But\nif Caspar ain't stiff in a couple of days I start\neating in restaurants.\n\nThe door shuts behind him.\n\nTom, heretofore very still, springs from the chair, goes to\nthe bedroom and reemerges with a gun.\n\nHe bolts for the door, instinctively grabbing his hat off a\nhook. He is wearing only his boxer shorts, a sleeveless\ntee-shirt, and the hat jammed onto his head.\n\nHe throws open the door.\n\n52. HALLWAY\n\nEmpty.\n\nTom runs to the bannister and looks down.\n\nHIS POV\n\nA flight down, a hand slides down along the railing.\nBernie's trotting footsteps echo in the stairwell.\n\nTOM\n\nHe runs back to his apartment.\n\n53. APARTMENT\n\nTom runs across to the open window and clambers out.\n\n54. FIRE ESCAPE\n\nTom trots down. His bare feet ring dully against the steel\nof the fire escape.\n\nHe reaches the bottom landing, swings over the railing,\nhangs by his hands for one brief moment and then drops.\n\nTHE ALLEY\n\nAs his bare feet hit the pavement. Tom is a silhouette in\nthe lamplight from the end of the alley.\n\nHe straightens from his crouch and runs.\n\nBACK DOOR\n\nOf his apartment building--over Tom's shoulder as he enters\nframe. The empty, brightly lit hall inside runs straight\nthe length of the building to the front door, which is just\nclosing.\n\nTom throws open the back door.\n\n55. HALLWAY\n\nAs Tom runs through toward the front.\n\nBefore reaching the door, he falls violently forward.\n\nHis gun skates away from him across the floor.\n\nHe starts to roll over to look behind him and a crunching\nblow catches him on the chin, snapping his head the rest of\nthe way around and sending him flat onto his back.\n\nBernie, who has emerged from under the staircase, towers\nover him.\n\nBernie\nYou make me laugh, Tommy. You're gonna catch\ncold, then you're no good to me. . .\n\nHe is walking over to Tom's gun, which he picks up and\nunloads into his hand.\n\n. . . What were you gonna do if you caught me,\nI'd just squirt a few and then you'd let me go\nagain.\n\nHe tosses Tom the empty gun and walks out.\n\nTom, white-faced and shivering, pulls himself up to sit\nleaning against the wall.\n\nA first-floor apartment door opens and a sixty-year-old\nwoman emerges, pulling a housecoat tight. She goggles at\nTom.\n\nWoman\nWhy Mr. Duchaisne! What on earth. . .\n\nTom tries a smile that looks idiotic.\n\nTom\nThey took everything. . .\n\nLONG SHOT THE HALL\n\nClucking sympathetically, the old woman is leaning down to\nhelp Tom up. As he drapes an arm over her shoulder:\n\nTom\n. . . I fought like hell but there were too many\nof 'em . . .\n\nFADE OUT\n\n56. CUT TO:\nCLOSE SHOT PLAQUE\n\nSet into an exterior wall, identifying the SHENANDOAH CLUB.\n\n57. INT CLUB\n\nTom, in his overcoat and hat, is walking up to the bar.\n\nTom\n'Lo, Tony. How's the club holding up?\n\nBehind the bar, Tony looks sour.\n\nTony\nWe're managing to squeak by without you. Got\nLazarre's money?\n\nTom\nNo.\n\nTony\nWell, you're not supposed to be here since you\nturned rat.\n\nTom\nRelax, Tony, Leo's not around, is he?\n\nTony\nMaybe Leo's not the only one doesn't care for you\nhere.\n\nTom works to keep his smile.\n\nTom\n. . . Fickle, huh Tony? You could almost be a\ndame.\n\nTony\nPal, you read my mind, you sneak my thoughts.\nJesus, I hope you know what you're doing.\n\nTom\nNo more than usual. The last couple days, you\nbooked any heavy bets on a long shot at Satur-\nday's fights?\n\nTony\nWhy the hell should I tell you?\n\nTom shrugs.\n\nTom\nThe truth is Tony, there's no reason on earth.\n\nStaring at Tom, Tony blows air through his teeth. He sets\nup a drink for Tom.\n\nTony\n. . . Saturday's fights. Yeah. Drop Johnson\nparked two yards on one yesterday. On Sailor\nReese, an undercard bum.\n\nTom downs the drink in a gulp.\n\nTom\nDrop Johnson? He play your book much?\n\nTony\nYou kidding? I didn't even know he could count.\n\nFrom offscreen there is a loud CRASH and, with that, many\nof the club patrons start screaming. Tony looks off and\nTom swivels to look.\n\nTony\nOh Jesus. . . You bring them with you?\n\nAs he shoves off from the bar:\n\nTom\nNo.\n\nUniformed policemen are pouring into the club, wielding\naxes. They destroy everything in their path, sweeping the\nelegantly dressed patrons before them.\n\nTom wades into the sea of blue and nods at Delahanty, the\npoliceman we know from the raid on Caspar's.\n\nTom\n'Lo, Brian. Still fighting the good fight?\n\nDelahanty\n'Lo, Tom. Neither wind nor rain nor snow. . .\n\nTom\nThat's just the mailmen. Is O'Gar here?\n\nDelahanty\nJust look for the long face.\n\n58. EXT THE CLUB\n\nIt is just cracking dawn.\n\nO'Gar is leaning against a car, facing the club, taking in\nthe scene as he glumly chews on a toothpick. The street is\nclogged with police vehicles.\n\nTom approaches.\n\nTom\n'Lo, O'Gar. You don't look happy.\n\nO'Gar\nLook at this mess. Gutting the golden calf\nagain.\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n. . . I don't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nTom\nYeah, it's awful confusing. You know a yegg\nnamed Drop Johnson?\n\nO'Gar\nWe've spanked him a couple times.\n\nTom\nWhere does he flop?\n\nO'Gar\nThe Terminal Hotel on Bay Street, whenever he's\nbroke--which is one hundred percent of always.\nJesus . . .\n\nHe reacts to gunfire from the second story of the club.\n\n. . . Don't nobody ask me, since I'm only the\nchief around here, but I'll tell you my opinion:\nCaspar's just as crazy as Leo. And an eye-tie\ninto the bargain.\n\nAs he heads off:\n\nTom\nWhat's the matter, O'Gar, doesn't anything ever\nsuit you?\n\n59. PULLING TOM\n\nAs he walks along a nearby street; we can still faintly\nhear the sirens and police activity back at the club.\n\nA black touring car is tooling up alongside of him. Tic-\nTac leans out the driver's window. He has welts around his\nmouth and looks like he has been a little roughed up.\n\nTic-Tac\nHop in, Tom, we been lookin' for you.\n\nStill briskly walking:\n\nTom\nI'm busy.\n\nTic-Tac\nHop in anyway, as in you ain't got no choice.\n\nTom\nYou can't hijack me, Tic-Tac, we're on the same\nside now--or didn't you get that far in school?\n\nThe car screeches over to put a wheel on the sidewalk and\nblock Tom's way. The back door swings open and Frankie\nemerges to help Tom in. Like Tic-Tac, Frankie looks a\nlittle worked over.\n\nTom quickly sizes up the situation and decides to comply.\n\n60. INT CAR\n\nAs Tom sits into the back, next to Bluepoint. Frankie\nslides in after him.\n\nBluepoint\nHow'd you get the fat lip?\n\nThe car starts moving.\n\nTom\nOld war wound. Acts up around morons.\n\nBluepoint\nVery smart. What were you doing at the club?\nTalking things over with Leo?\n\nTom\nDon't think so hard, Bluepoint, you might sprain\nsomething.\n\nBluepoint\nYou're so goddamn smart. Except you ain't. I\nget you, smart guy, I know what you are.\nStraight as a corkscrew. Mr. Inside-Outsky.\nLike a goddamn bolshevik, picking up your orders\nfrom Yegg Central. You think you're so goddamn\nsmart.\n\nHe sneers:\n\nYou joined up with Caspar. You bumped Bernie\nBernheim. Down is up. Black is white. Well I\nthink you're half-smart. I think you were\nstraight with your frail and queer with Johnny\nCaspar. And I think you'd sooner join the\nLadies' League then gun a guy down.\n\nHis eyes narrow at Tom.\n\n. . . Then I hear that these two geniuses never\neven saw this rub-out take place.\n\nDefensively:\n\nTic-Tac\nThe boss just said have him do it, he didn't say\nnothing about--\n\nBluepoint\nShutup, or maybe you still got too many teeth.\n\nTic-Tac sulks. Bluepoint turns and gazes out the window of\nthe car.\n\n. . . Everyone's so goddamn smart. Well, we'll\ngo to Miller's Crossing. And we'll see who's\nsmart.\n\n61. EXT WOODS\n\nIt is morning; the sun is now fully up. Bluepoint and Tom\nwalk side-by-side through the woods. Frankie and Tic-Tac\nwalk several steps ahead of them, each off to one side,\nsearching. Frankie is singing an old Neapolitan song.\n\nBluepoint\nY'understand if we don't find a stiff out here,\nwe leave a fresh one.\n\nTom walks a little unsteadily. His shoulders are hunched\nand his hands are jammed into his overcoat packets. He\nstares woodenly forward. Bluepoint laughs softly.\n\n. . . Where're your friends when you need 'em,\nhuh? Where's Leo now?\n\nTom tramps mechanically on. His eyes drift up.\n\nHIS POV\n\nTracking. A canopy of leaves, sprinkled by sunlight.\nThe boughs of the trees sough quietly in the wind.\n\nWe hear the unearthly groaning of the tree limbs.\n\nTOM\n\nLooks forward.\n\nBluepoint calls out:\n\nBluepoint\nHey Tic-Tac, ever notice how the snappy dialogue\ndries up once a guy starts soiling his union\nsuit?\n\nTom tramps on.\n\nHIS POV\n\nThe backs of Frankie and Tic-Tac as they walk on ahead.\n\nFrankie is still singing.\n\nTOM\n\nHe looks stupidly at Bluepoint. He looks ahead.\n\nHe stops abruptly.\n\nBluepoint\nWhat?\n\nTom is still for a moment, then with jerky movements gets\ndown on his knees, hugs a tree with one arm for support,\nand vomits.\n\nBluepoint watches him, then calls out to Frankie and Tic-\nTac:\n\n. . . Okay, there's nothing out here.\n\nHe grabs Tom's hat off his head and flings it away. Then\nhe plants a foot against Tom's side and shoves him to the\nground.\n\nCLOSE ON TOM\n\nAs his face hits the ground.\n\nBluepoint's foot enters; he plants it an the side of Tom's\nneck to keep him pinned.\n\nTOM'S POV\n\nSkewed angle, from the ground.\n\nFrankie is ambling back, singing.\n\nBLUEPOINT\n\nChecking the open chamber of his gun. He snaps it shut.\n\nAs he levels the gun at Tom:\n\nBluepoint\nThink about this, smart guy.\n\nTOM\n\nClosing his eyes.\n\nFrom offscreen:\n\nTic-Tac\nUh-oh, hankie time!\n\nFRANKIE\n\nHe stops singing and turns to look.\n\nTOM\n\nThe foot comes off his neck.\n\nBLUEPOINT\n\nLooking towards Tic-Tac.\n\nTIC-TAC\n\nTaking a handkerchief out of his breast pocket and bringing\nit to his face as he looks at something on the ground in\nfront of him.\n\nBLUEPOINT\n\nHe hauls Tom to his feet and pushes him towards Tic-Tac.\n\nWe track behind the two men as they approach Tic-Tac and\nFrankie enters from the side.\n\nWe cannot yet see what is on the ground in front of him.\n\nTic-Tac\nBirds been at him.\n\nFrankie is taking out his hankie as he draws near.\n\nFrankie\nJesus Christ. . .\n\nHe looks up at Tom as Tom approaches.\n\nOver Tom and Bluepoint's shoulders, stretching away from\nus, face-up, is a body. We cannot see much of its face;\nwhat we do see is pulp.\n\nTic-Tac is laughing, incredulously.\n\nTic-Tac\n. . . I said put one in his brain, not in his\nstinking face. . .\n\nEXTREME LONG SHOT\n\nFour very small men in overcoats and fedoras, looking down\nat the ground; they are dwarfed by the surrounding trees.\n\nVery faintly we can hear:\n\nFrankie\nI told you, Bluepoint, we heard two shots. . .\n\nQUICK FADE OUT\n\n62. CUT TO:\nAPARTMENT BUILDING DOOR BUZZER\n\nA beat-up panel in the building's entryway, listing\ntenants' names and apartments opposite a row of buttons.\n\nA hand coasts along the names and stops at CLARENCE\nJOHNSON/4C, then moves away and presses two other buzzers\non the fifth floor.\n\nAfter a beat, we hear the front door buzz open.\n\n63. FOURTH-FLOOR HALLWAY\n\nTom walks up to 4C, unpocketing a gun. He gently tries the\nknob, which turns, and enters.\n\n64. DROP'S APARTMENT\n\nAs Tom enters.\n\nDrop Johnson is sitting at a table in the living room,\nwhich also serves as kitchen and dining room. He is a\nlarge man with a thick neck, a low forehead, and rather\nvacant eyes.\n\nHe is looking up at Tom, a spoonful of cereal frozen\nhalfway to his mouth, a folded-back newspaper in his other\nhand, opened to the funnies.\n\nTom\n'Lo, Drop. How're the Katzenjammers?\n\nUncomfortably:\n\nDrop\n'Lo, Tom. What's the rumpus?\n\nAs he talks, Tom walks casually around the apartment,\nbumping open doors, sticking his head in each room.\n\nTom\nHad any visitors?\n\nDrop's head swivels to follow Tom around the room; aside\nfrom that he does not move. He speaks cautiously:\n\nDrop\nNo.\n\nTom\nNot ever, Drop?\n\nDrop\n. . . Not lately.\n\nTom nods.\n\nTom\nThen you must be happy to see me.\n\nDrop doesn't respond.\n\n. . . So you didn't see Bernie Bernheim, before\nhe was shown across?\n\nDrop\nNo.\n\nTom\n. . . Seen him since?\n\nDrop maintains a sullen silence.\n\nTom is picking up a hat from a clutter on top of a bureau.\n\nTom\nOne last question, Drop. I hear you've got a lot\nof money on tomorrow's fight. Is that your bet,\nor did you place it for a friend?\n\nDrop\nNo, uh. . . it's my bet. I just. . . I have a\ngood feeling about that fight. . .\n\nTom's stroll through the apartment has brought him behind\nwhere Drop sits.\n\nTom\nA good feeling, huh. When did the feeling return\nto your head?\n\nDrop\n. . . Huh?\n\nTom puts the hat on top of Drop's head. Drop's eyes roll\nup to look at it, but otherwise he still doesn't move.\n\nThe hat, too small, sits ludicrously atop his head.\n\nTom starts toward the door.\n\nTom\nYou've outgrown that one. Must be all the\nthinking you've been doing. . .\n\nHe pauses with his hand on the knob.\n\n. . . Tell Bernie something's come up. He has to\nget in touch. There'll be nothing stirring til I\ntalk to him.\n\nHe slams the door.\n\n65. CUT TO:\nA LARGE WINDOW\n\nWe are looking at the ground-floor window from the street.\nLetters stencilled on the glass identify the SONS OF ERIN\nSOCIAL CLUB.\n\nA topcoated man scurries into frame, knocks out a pane with\nthe grip of a gun, and tosses a small pipelike device\ninside. He scurries away and we pan with him across the\nstreet to reveal a line of cars, police and civilian,\nparked along the far curb. No men are visible except the\nscurrying man, who takes cover behind one of the parked\ncars.\n\nSOCIAL CLUB\n\nA beat. From inside we hear a pair of trotting footsteps--\n\nBOOM! The window blows out, spitting glass into the\nstreet, along with a large dark form.\n\nTHE STREET\n\nGlass showers the pavement and a charred rag-doll of a body\nhits hard, face down, and skids a couple feet. Smoke wisps\nfrom it.\n\nTHE CLUB\n\nA lick of flame from the bomb is already dying and heavy\ngrey smoke is billowing out.\n\nTHE STREET\n\nMen start cautiously rising from behind the cars. A lot of\nmen. Some wear police uniforms; some are civilians. All\nare armed.\n\nTHE CLUB\n\nBillowing smoke.\n\nTHE STREET\n\nThe men have straightened up. A policeman calls through a\nbullhorn:\n\nPoliceman\nAll right. Anyone left in there, come on out,\ngrabbing air. You know the drill.\n\nTHE CLUB\n\nAfter a beat, the front door swings open. A man emerges,\none hand in the air, one holding a handkerchief over his\nmouth.\n\nHe walks into the middle of the street.\n\nOne of the civilians behind the cars fires.\n\nThe man takes the bullet in the chest and drops to the\nground, where he twitches.\n\nThe man who fired, in the foreground, grins. A ripple of\nlaughter runs down the line of men.\n\nTHE CLUB WINDOW\n\nSmoke still pouring out.\n\nWith a RAT-A-TAT-TAT muzzle flashes from inside illuminate\nthe smoke.\n\nTHE STREET\n\nBullet hits chew up the cars and a few of the men; the\nothers drop back down behind the cars and start returning\nfire.\n\nTHE WINDOW\n\nA forbidding black hole in the exterior wall. A second\ntommy has joined the first to pour lead out into the\nstreet.\n\n66. CUT TO:\nRECEPTION AREA\n\nTracking in an a youngish secretary in a severe dress,\nsitting behind a desk.\n\nFaintly, from a distance, we can still hear gunfire.\n\nSecretary\n'Lo, Tom, where've you been hiding?\n\nREVERSE\n\nOn Tom.\n\nTom\nHither and yon. The mayor in?\n\nSecretary\nWith Mr. Caspar.\n\nTom is already heading for the door.\n\nTom\nThat's who I'm looking for. Scare up some\nhootch, will you honey?\n\nSecretary\nSurely. I'll announce you.\n\nAs he opens the door:\n\nTom\nDon't bother, I'm well liked.\n\n67. INT MAYOR'S OFFICE\n\nA grand, high-ceilinged place. Mayor Levander sits behind\nhis desk sputtering, his face turning purple. Caspar,\nsitting across from him, is also turning purple. Sitting\nto one side are two identical thirty-year-old men, appar-\nently twins, mustachiced, silent, respectful, mournful,\ntheir hands clasped over the hats in their laps, wearing\nstiff new-looking suits with old-fashioned collars.\n\nMayor\nI can't do it, Johnny! I'll look ridiculous!\nWhy, it simply isn't done! Assistants, maybe--\n\nCaspar\nFor a mayor, you don't hear so hot! I said head!\nHead of the assessor's office!\n\nMayor\nBut there's two of 'em!\n\nCaspar\nI can count! Co-heads!\n\nMayor\nJohnny, needless to say, this office will do\nanything in its power to assist you and your\ncousins. We did it for Leo, of course, on\ncountless occasions--\n\nCaspar\nDamn right--had every potato eater from County\nCork an the public tit--\n\nMayor\nBut there's a way we do things, hallowed by usage\nand consecrated by time! When we put people on\nthe pad, when Leo was running things, we--\n\nCaspar is furious:\n\nCaspar\nLeo ain't running things! I ain't innarested in\nancient history! I'm running things now!\n\nMayor\nJohnny, no one appreciates that more than I! I\ncan give them jobs! I can give them good jobs!\nI can even give them jobs where thev won't have\nto perform any work, where their lack of English\nwill be no impediment! But I can't--\n\nCaspar\nWhat is this, the high hat?!\n\nThe mayor mops his face with a handkerchief and looks\nbeseechingly at Tom.\n\nMayor\nTom, can you explain it to him? I can put them\nin public works but I can't--\n\nTom\nYou can do whatever the hell Caspar tells you. I\ndon't remember all this double-talk when Leo gave\nyou an order.\n\nThe mayor looks flabbergasted.\n\nMayor\nTom! Jesus!\n\nTom\nStop whimpering and do as you're told.\n\nCaspar\nYou can start by gettin' outta here.\n\nMayor\nBut Johnny, it's my office!\n\nCaspar\nGet outta here! Take it on the heel and toe,\nbefore I whack you one!. . .\n\nThe mayor retreats and Casmar stares at the two men sitting\nto the side.\n\n. . . You too, beat it!\n\nThe two men look at each other, then back at Caspar.\n\nFirst Man\n. . . Partiamo?\n\nCaspar\nYeah, go keep the mayor company. I'll take care\nof ya's later.\n\nThe immigrants rise and leave the room. Caspar takes out a\nhandkerchief and wipes his brow.\n\n. . . Runnin' things. It ain't all gravy.\n\nThe secretary enters the office with a bottle of whiskey, a\nsoda siphon and ice. She places it an the mayor's desk and\nleaves.\n\nWe can still hear faint gunfire and an occasional booming\nexplosion that rattles the windows of the office.\n\nTom\nWhat's the fireworks?\n\nCaspar\nKnockin' over one of Leo's clubs. Sonofabitch\njust won't go belly-up. . . I'm sorry, kid. I\nheard about your little ride this morning.\n\nTom is walking over to pour himself a drink.\n\nTom\nYeah, well sorry don't fix things. We could just\nas easily've missed Bernie's corpse as stumbled\nover it, and I'd be dead now.\n\nCaspar\nI know, I know. But it don't mean Bluepoint's up\nto anything. So he heard some rumor Bernie ain't\ndead, those stories pop up, people seen Dillinger\nin eight states last week. So he hears a story,\nand he don't like you much anyway, so he decides\nto check it out--\n\nTom\nAny stories about Bernie being alive, Bluepoint's\nmade up himself.\n\nCaspar\nAw, you don't know that. It don't even make\nsense--why would he?\n\nTom stares at Caspar for a beat.\n\nTom\n. . . There could be a damn good reason. . .\n\nCaspar squints at Tom.\n\n. . . If you've got a fixed fight coming up. Do\nyou?\n\nCaspar\n. . . Maybe. Okay, yeah, sure. Tomorrow night,\nthe fix is in. What of it?\n\nTom\nBluepoint knows about it?\n\nCaspar\nYeah. . .\n\nHe gazes off.\n\n. . . Okay, I get it.\n\nTom\nIf Bluepoint's been selling you out on these\nfights, and means to again, he'll have to be able\nto point the finger at someone else--\n\nUncomfortably:\n\nCaspar\nYeah, yeah, I get it.\n\nTom\n--but with Bernie dead there ain't a hell of a\nlot of people he can point to.\n\nCaspar\nYeah. Bluepoint sells me out. Makes pretend\nBernie's still doin' it. Ats real pretty.\nBernie leaked the fix, and you take the fall for\nsupposedly not killing him. . . .\n\nHe leans back in the mayor's chair and gazes off, sucking\nhis lips in and out as he thinks. Finally:\n\n. . . But I dunno, why would Bluepoint cross me\nlike that? Money, okay, everybody likes money.\nBut somehow it don't seem like him. And I know\nthe Bluepoint.\n\nTom\nNobody knows anybody. Not that well.\n\nCaspar shakes his head.\n\nCaspar\nMoney don't mean that much to him.\n\nTom shrugs.\n\nTom\nThen it's not just money he's after. He's got a\nwart on his fanny.\n\nCaspar\n. . . Huh?\n\nTom\nA wart. On his fanny. Giving him the fidgets.\nMaybe he's sick of sitting on the couch and maybe\nbehind your desk don't look like a bad place to\nmove to. Maybe he figures the money can help\nmove him there.\n\nCaspar studies Tom.\n\nCaspar\n. . . Kid, you got a lip on ya.\n\nHe looks off again.\n\n. . . I don't generally care for it. But you're\nhonest, and that's something we can't get enough\nof in this business. . . I'll admit, since last\nwe jawed, my stomach's been seazin' up on me.\nBluepoint saying we should double-cross you; you\ndouble-cross once, where's it all end? An\ninnaresting ethical question. I'll find Blue-\npoint, talk to him, straighten it out--\n\nTom laughs bitterly.\n\nTom\nSure, talk to him. Have a chat. Ask him whether\nhe's selling you out. Don't take care of him\nbefore he makes his next move, just sit back and\nlet him make it. You're swimmin' in it.\n\nCaspars eyes flash. Tom's tone softens:\n\n. . . Johnny, my chin's hanging out right along\nside yours.\n\nCaspar goes slack.\n\nCaspar\nYeah.\n\nTom stands up.\n\nTom\n. . . I'd worry a lot less if I thought you were\nworrying enough.\n\nCaspar, miserable, rubs his face. From the distant street,\nwe hear another booming explosion.\n\nCaspar\n. . . But I am, kid. . . Christ. . . running\nthings. . .\n\n68. CUT TO:\nTOM'S APARTMENT\n\nThe phone is ringing at the cut.\n\nWe are looking at the window sill upon which the phone\nsits, with an empty chair facing.\n\nFootsteps approach and Tom sits into frame and takes the\nphone.\n\nTom\nYeah?\n\nThrough the phone:\n\nVoice\nI got your message.\n\nTom\n'Lo, Bernie, I had a dream about you the other\nday.\n\nWe hear Bernie laugh.\n\nBernie\n. . . Yeah? A nightmare?\n\nTom\nOn the contrary; very sweet. I dreamt you were\nlying out at Miller's Crossing with your face\nblown off.\n\nMore laughter.\n\nBernie\n. . . You get a kick out of that?\n\nTom\nI was in stitches. It's Mink, isn't it?\n\nBernie\nI came back and he wasn't happy to see me. Can\nyou beat that, Tom? All he could taik about was\nhow he had to skip, and how much trouble he'd be\nin if anyone found me at his place.\n\nTom\nSome friend.\n\nBernie\nYeah. And you know what a nervous boy he was. I\nfigured, hell, you're a friend. Maybe you could\nuse some insurance.\n\nTom\nThat's you to the gills, Bernie: thoughtful. You\ndidn't happen to keep his gun, did you?\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation:\n\n. . . Didn't Mink have a .22?\n\nBernie\nHeld already ditched it. Why?\n\nAnother hesitation:\n\nTom\n. . . After Rug?\n\nBernie\nYeah. . . How did you know?\n\nDown to business:\n\nTom\nDoesn't matter. Listen, Bernie, I've been\nthinking about our little deal and I've decided\nyou can stick it in your ear.\n\nBernie\n. . . Huh?\n\nTom\nI figure you don't have anything on me that I\ndon't have on you. As a matter of fact, less,\nsince I've decided to leave town. So I'm calling\nyour bluff.\n\nBernie\nWait a minute--\n\nTom\nShutup and let me talk. I'm pulling out of here,\ntomorrow morning. The only thing for you to\ndecide is whether or not I leave behind a message\nfor Caspar that you're still around. If you want\nme to keep my mouth shut, it'll cost you some\ndough.\n\nBernie\nYou can't--\n\nTom\nI figure a thousand bucks is reasonable. So I\nwant two thousand.\n\nBernie\nIn a pig's eye--\n\nTom\nThis isn't a debate, it's instructions. I'm\ngoing out for a while; I'll be back here at four\nthis morning. Bring me the money. If you're not\nat my place, four o'clock, with the dough,\nCaspar'll be looking for you tomorrow.\n\nHe hangs up.\n\n69. CUT TO:\nHALLWAY\n\nWe are close on Tom as, in overcoat and hat, he emerges\nfrom his apartment and looks down at the keys in his hand.\n\nWHAP--A fist swings into frame to connect with Tom's cheek.\nHe falls back.\n\nThree topcoated men loom over him.\n\nFirst Man\nGot any money?\n\nTom is massaging his face.\n\nTom\n. . . No.\n\nThe first man nods at the other two.\n\nFirst Man\nOkay.\n\nThe two men pick Tom off the floor and start to work him\nover. He doesn't resist.\n\nThe first man watches dispassionately.\n\n. . . Third race tonight. By the finish, Tailor\nMaid had a view of the field.\n\nHe lights himself a cigarette.\n\n. . . You oughta lay off the ponies, Tom.\n\nThe two men work in silence for a while. Tom too is\nsilent.\n\nFinally:\n\n. . . Okay.\n\nThe two men back away from Tom, breathing heavily. He\nslides down the wall to the floor.\n\n. . . Lazarre said he's sorry about this. It's\njust getting out of hand.\n\nTom speaks thickly, his head propped against the baseboard:\n\nTom\n. . . Yeah.\n\nFirst Man\nHe likes you, Tom. He said we didn't have to\nbreak anything.\n\nTom\nYeah. Okay. . . Tell him no hard feelings.\n\nFirst Man\nChrist, Tom, he knows that.\n\nWith a jerk of the head the first man signals the other two\nand the trio turns to leave.\n\nFirst Man\n. . . Take care now.\n\n70. CUT TO:\nDOORWAY: NIGHT\n\nWe are looking over Tom's shoulder as he waits in the rain\nin front of a large oak doorway with wrought-iron fretwork.\nAt the cut we hear chimes dying, and the door swings open.\n\nThere is a grand foyer with a parquet floor, unsittable\nfurniture and a large chandelier. A liveried butler looks\ninquiringly out at Tom.\n\nTom\nTom Duchaisne.\n\nButler\nYes sir . . .\n\nHe steps back.\n\n. . . Mr. Caspar is in the great room.\n\nTom is handing the butler his hat.\n\nTom\nSwell. Can you take this?\n\nINT FOYER\n\nAs Tom starts to shrug out of his coat, Caspar is crossing\ntowards him.\n\nCaspar\nKid, what's the rumpus?\n\nCaspar seems as unhappy as last time we saw him.\n\nTom\nI got news.\n\nCaspar\nYeah, news at this end too. My stomach's been\nseazin' up on me.\n\nTom\nMink just told me that he--\n\nThis has woken Caspar up:\n\nCaspar\nYou talked to Mink?!\n\nTom\nYeah, on the phone. Bluepoint wants you to think\nhe's dissappeared, so you can't talk to him, but\nhe's been right here in town.\n\nCaspar\nYou're sure it was Mink?\n\nTom shrugs.\n\nTom\nSee for yourself; he's coming to my place, four\no'clock this morning.\n\nHaving handed the butler his coat and hat, Tom lets Caspar\nlead him towards a pair of double doors.\n\n. . . He's afraid of a cross from Bluepoint. He\ntold me about the fix. Says he'll sing for a\ncouple grand skip money, tell us everyone\ninvolved. . .\n\n71. Caspar opens one of the double doors, and we continue\ntracking behind the two men as they enter the trophy room.\nThe room has the low warm light of a men's club. Outside\nthe dark windows the rain sheets down.\n\nCaspar sits in behind his desk and swivels away to poke\nmorosely with a fire shovel at the blaze in the fireplace.\nIn the foreground, back to us, Tom rests his knuckles an\nthe desk to lean towards Caspar.\n\n. . . But you better take care of Bluepoint right\naway. Mink says if he comes after us its going\nto be tonight.\n\nAs he looks into the fire:\n\nCaspar\nLeo's holed up at Whiskey Nick's dump.\n\nTom is momentarily taken aback.\n\nTom\n. . . How d'you know?\n\nA chuckle comes from behind\n\nREVERSE\n\nOn Tom. In the background, Bluepoint is walking over to\nthe door to the room to close it.\n\nBluepoint\nThat ain't all we know, smart guy.\n\nHe points with a nod towards the couch.\n\n. . . Recognize your playmate?\n\nOn the couch sits Drop Johnson. Drop's face looks worked\non, and is beaded over with sweat.\n\nHaving shut the door, Bluepoint is sauntering over to Tom.\n\n. . . Yeah. You thought I'd quit.\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\nHuh-uh. I followed you this afternoon. And I\nwondered why Einstein would want to talk to a\ngorilla. . .\n\nHe is nose to nose with Tom, smiling at him.\n\n. . . So I grabbed the gorilla. . . And I beat it\nout of him.\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n. . . Give me a big guy, every time. They crack\neasy. Not like you.\n\nTom holds Bluepoint's look.\n\nTom\nIs there a point? Or are you just brushing up on\nyour small talk?\n\nBluepoint\nI like that. Cool under fire. I'm impressed.\n\nVery quickly he delivers two slaps--forehand and backhand.\nTom's head rocks but he recovers to stare back at Blue-\npoint.\n\n. . . The gorilla didn't know whose stiff we\nfound, but I can fill that in. You killed Mink,\nyou sonofabitch.\n\nHe grabs Tom by the lapels, swings him away from the desk,\nand lands a punch on his chin.\n\nTom stumbles backs.\n\nCaspar has turned from the fireplace, watching the doings\nacross the room.\n\nBluepoint moves towards Tom, breathing hard with antici-\npated pleasure.\n\n. . . Come here, bum. I'm gonna send you to a\ndeep dark place. And I'm gonna have fun doing\nit.\n\nBluepoint's hand snakes out and grabs Tom by the front of\nthe coat, hauling him close. He slaps him savagely.\n\n. . . It was Mink, and by God I'll hear you say\nit!\n\nTom\nIs this how you taught Drop his story?\n\nIn one motion Bluepoint's hands wrap around Tom's throat\nchoking him off. As the pressure increases, Tom, purpling,\nsinks to his knees.\n\nBluepoint\nI like the way you think. Maybe when you're dead\nI'll cut your head off, put it on my mantle--\n\nWHANG--a shovel blade swings into frame to smash Bluepoint\nin the face.\n\nHe drops.\n\nFrom somewhere in the room, a scream.\n\nBluepoint is on his hands and knees, one hand pressed over\nhis ruined face, blood pouring from between the fingers.\n\nCaspar\nSonafabitch. . .\n\nHe stands over Bluepoint with the fireplace shovel.\n\n. . . If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a\ndouble-cross artist. I had a feeling 'bout this\nsonofabitch--\n\nHe swings the shovel back and delivers an overhand blow to\nthe top of Bluepoint's head.\n\nBluepoint drops to the floor, instantly motionless.\n\nThe scream, however, continues.\n\nDrop Johnson, on the couch, his eyes wide, his hands\nspastically squeezing his knees, is looking down at\nBluepoint. Drop's mouth is stretched wide. He is scream-\ning.\n\nTom gets slowly to his feet.\n\nCascar looks at Drop.\n\n. . . Shut it, you sonofabitch!\n\nHe is striding over to him with the shovel.\n\n. . . I'll give you something to holler about!\n\nTom intercepts him.\n\nTom\nJohnny. It's okay. Bluepoint made him. It's\nokay. It's not important.\n\nCaspar is panting.\n\nCaspar\nThen have him shut it!\n\nDrop does.\n\nThere is a beat.\n\nIncongruously, Caspar's bellow breaks the silence:\n\n. . . And we do the same to Mink! This very same\nnight!\n\nAnother silence. The rain. The crackle of the fire.\n\nTom's tone is soothing:\n\nTom\n. . . Johnny. We can't double-cross him. He\nwants to spill the whole set-up--\n\nCaspar stares at him through glazed eyes.\n\nCaspar\nI've never let a sonofabitch walk!\n\nTom\nYou've never crossed anyone . . .\n\nCaspar is staring at him. His eyes have lost some of their\nglaze.\n\nTom\n. . . Four o'clock, my place. Mink's coming in\non his own hook so I promised him the money.\nDon't make me out a liar--\n\nDrop is suddenly screaming again.\n\nCaspar looks where Drop is looking:\n\nBluepoint is raising his head, moaning. His face is a mask\nof blood. One hand gropes in his overcoat pocket for his\ngun.\n\nCaspar shouts over Drop's howl as he pulls something from\nhis desk drawer:\n\nCaspar\n. . . Lookit this, kid.\n\nHe strides over to Bluepoint.\n\n. . . Something I try and teach all my boys. . .\n\nWith the gun point blank against the back of Bluepoint's\nhead, he fires.\n\nTom recoils.\n\n. . . Always put one inna brain!\n\n72. A CLOCK\n\nA large wall clock. It is 3:30.\n\nWe are pulling back and down to reveal that we are inside a\ndiner; we are isolating on a section of counter on which\nsits a half-empty cup of coffee and an ashtray half-filled\nwith butts. A hand puts some change on the counter and\nleaves frame.\n\n73. EXT DINER\n\nAs Tom pushes the door open and exits. He tucks his\novercoat collar up as he walks; it is pouring rain.\n\nTom turns at the sound of approaching heels and recognizes\nVerna with some surprise. He glances up and down the\nstreet, but it is deserted. Verna doesn't seem to much\nnotice the rain.\n\nTom\n'Lo, Verna. What's the rumpus.\n\nColdly, as they walk on together:\n\nVerna\nI was just in the neighborhood, feeling a little\ndaffy. What're you doing?\n\nTom\n. . . Walking.\n\nVerna\nDon't let on more than you have to.\n\nTom\nIn the rain.\n\nTom glances at her.\n\n. . . What're you doing out?\n\nVerna\nBernie's dead, isn't he?\n\nThey walk on for a beat, Tom looking down at the sidewalk.\nFinally:\n\nTom\n. . . What makes you think that?\n\nVerna\nThat's no answer.\n\nTom again glances around, and escorts Verna into a dark\ndoorway alcove. It is very small; they have to crowd into\neach other to stay out of the rain. Water drops from the\nbrim of Tom's fedora. He studies her for a beat.\n\nTom\nI can't tell you anything yet.\n\nVerna\nNobody cares, do they? His friends didn't really\nlike him.\n\nTom shrugs.\n\nTom\nHe didn't like his friends.\n\nVerna\nYou're a sonofabitch, Tom. You're someone to\ntalk. You got me to tell you where he was and\nthen you killed him.\n\nShe is raising a gun into frame: She presses it into his\nstomach.\n\nTom stiffens but continues to stare at her calmly.\n\n. . . Tell me why. What was in it for you?\n\nTom\nNothing for me.\n\nVerna\nThen why?\n\nTom\n. . . Giving up Bernie was the only way I could\nsee to straighten things out for Leo.\n\nVerna\nYou said you didn't care about Leo.\n\nTom\nI said we were through. It's not the same thing.\n\nVerna looks at him.\n\nVerna\nI don't understand. I don't care. I don't\ncare what reason you had or thought you had.\n\nShe raises the gun and presses its barrel into the under-\nside of Tom's chin. Tom stiffens but remains calm.\n\nTom\n. . . He's still alive.\n\nVerna stares at him.\n\nVerna\nYou expect me to believe you?\n\nTom\n. . . No.\n\nVerna\nThat's you all over, Tom. A lie and no heart.\n\nVerna pulls back the hammer. There is a long beat.\n\nVerna's eves widen, locked an Tom's.\n\nTom returns her look; his is sympathetic.\n\nVerna starts trembling.\n\nTom's tone is soft, understanding. It's the first time we\nhave ever seen compassion from him.\n\nTom\n. . . It isn't easy, is it Verna?\n\nShe abruptly lurches away and staggers a couple of paces\nonto the sidewalk in the rain. She hugs a lamppost for\nsupport. She is staring down at the street, still trem-\nbling.\n\nTom walks up behind her and rests a hand an her shoulder.\n\n. . . Are you all right?\n\nShe doesn't look around. After a moment:\n\nVerna\n. . . I don't know how you did it.\n\nShe shrugs off his hand and stumbles off down the street.\n\nTom watches her dissappear into the rain.\n\n74. CUT TO:\nTREE LIMBS\n\nNight, but sometime later--it has stopped raining. The\nbranches groan in the wind. As they sway, streetlight\nglitters off the leaves, still wet with rain..\n\nWe are booming down to reveal that we are in front of Tom's\nbuilding, its windows dark. During the boom we hear the\nrumble of an approaching car and the hiss of its tires on\nwet asphalt.\n\nThe boom down ends as the car pulls into frame to stop at\nthe curb with the camera framed on the driver's window.\nThe driver has a small bandage on his left cheek. We hear\nCaspar's voice as we hear him getting out the back:\n\nCaspar\nYa put the razor in cold water, not hot--cause\nmetal does what in cold?\n\nDriver\nI dunno, Johnny.\n\nWe hear the back door slam and Caspar appears in the front\npassenger window.\n\n. . . 'Ats what I'm tellin' ya. It contracts.\n'At way you get a first class shave.\n\nDriver\nOkay, Johnny.\n\nAs Caspar walks off the driver slouches back, pulls his\nfedora over his eyes and folds his arms across his chest.\nA back enters frame in the foreground.\n\nTom's Voice:\n'Lo, Sal. You can dangle.\n\nThe driver looks up, startled.\n\nDriver\n'Lo, Tom. You sure? You don't look so hot.\n\nWe still don't see Tom's face.\n\nTom\nI'm okay. Go ahead, I'll drive him home.\n\nThe driver shrugs.\n\nREVERSE\n\nWider, from the other side of the car, as the car pulls\naway.\n\nTom walks into the foreground, toward his house; we tilt up\nto hold him.\n\nThe low-angle shows us the tree behind Tom, its branches\nstill creaking in the wind.\n\nCrack crack--we hear two gunshots from inside the house.\n\nTom stops momentarily in close shot, looking up, and then\ncontinues on out of frame.\n\n75. OVER TOM'S SHOULDER\n\nWe follow him as he walks into the building and slowly down\nthe first-floor hall.\n\nThe hallway is quiet excent for a light moaning wind.\n\nBeyond Tom we see the door to the first-floor apartment\ncrack open a slit. Hissing:\n\nVoice\nMr. Duchaisne. . .\n\nThe door opens wider. Mrs. Zarpmas, wearing a housecoat,\nher gray hair down in braids, sticks her head out.\n\n. . . There were shots.\n\nTom looks up towards the staircase, then back at Mrs.\nZarpas.\n\nTom\nGo down to the drugstore. Call the police.\n\nShe stares at him, nods. As she drapes on a raincoat:\n\nMrs. Zarpas\nYes, Mr. Duchaisne.\n\nTom\nYou better stay there til the officers arrive.\n\nMrs. Zarpas\nYes . . .\n\nShe pauses.\n\n. . . Will the cats be all right here?\n\nTom stares at her.\n\nFinally, he nods.\n\nTom\n. . . They'll be fine.\n\nMrs. Zarpas returns his dazed nod, and shuffles away.\n\nSo far, upstairs, all is quiet.\n\nPULLING TOM\n\nAs he starts slowly towards the staircase.\n\nTOM'S POV TRACKING FORWARD\n\nA small black object on the staircase--an upside-down\nfedora. Blood drips with a hollow rattle down onto a step,\na couple steps above the hat.\n\nPULLING TOM\n\nHe looks up.\n\nPOV\n\nA head sticks through the balusters of the second story\nlanding return. The body is on its back; the head lolls\nback over the tip of the landing down towards the stair-\ncase.\n\nOur climbing low angle shows us mostly the back of the\nhead. The body's far shoulder has knocked out a baluster\nwhose splintered bottom juts down towards the stairs.\n\nPULLING TOM\n\nStill climbing, looking at the body.\n\nHIS POV\n\nClimbing and panning as we draw even with the head.\n\nIt is Caspar. Blood has been expelled through his nostrils\nover his mouth and chin. His face is deep red. His eyes\nstare glassily at Tom.\n\nPULLING TOM\n\nAs he reaches the top of the stairs and swings around to\nface along the landing. We hear a chuckle, close by. Wind\nis groaning through the hallway.\n\nPOV\n\nIn the middle foreground Caspar lies an the floor; beyond\nhim, Bernie leans against the doorframe in Tom's open\ndoorway, smiling, his arms folded over his chest.\n\nThe balusters stretch away in a regular line, throwing\nvertical shadows upwards against the opposite wall.\n\nBernie\nI get it. You set me up.\n\nTom leans against the wall and looks morosely down at\nCaspar.\n\nBernie\n. . . Anything to avoid a little dirty work\nyourself, huh?\n\nTom doesn't answer.\n\n. . . How'd you know held get it and not me? Or\ndidn't you care?\n\nTom shrugs, still staring down at Caspar.\n\nTom\nI figured you'd come early, and be looking for\nblood. He wouldn't, so you'd likely have the\ndrop on him.\n\nBernie takes his gun out of his overcoat packet and\nsaunters over.\n\nBernie\nYou're a sonofabitch, Tom. I like the way you\nthink. You're right, the bonehead never knew\nwhat hit him.\n\nHe looks down at Caspar, unable to supress a smile.\n\n. . . But if you knew I'd come looking to kill\nyou, how do you know I won't still?\n\nTom shrugs again.\n\nTom\nNothing in it for you, now. With him dead we got\nnothing on each other. Let me have the gun.\n\nBernie\nWhy?\n\nTom jerks his head towards Caspar.\n\nTom\nPin this on Bluepoint. Neither of us wants him\nwalking around after this.\n\nBernie shakes his head.\n\nBernie\nThe cops'll be Leo's now. They won't care what\nthey hang Bluepoint for.\n\nTom shrugs again.\n\nTom\nI guess that's so. If you don't mind keeping the\ngun that killed Caspar. And Mink.\n\nHe stoops down over Caspar's body and starts feeling\nthrough Caspar's pockets, looking for something.\n\n. . . Why did Mink shoot Rug, anyway?\n\nBernie is walking towards him, emptying the bullets from\nhis gun.\n\nBernie\nI dunno, it was just a mix-up. Here.\n\nTom looks back over his shoulder. Bernie hands him the\ngun, which Tom slips into his overcoat packet.\n\n. . . So you're gonna say Bluepoint did this?\n\nAs he goes back to the body:\n\nTom\nMink thought Rug was tailing him?\n\nHe finds Caspar's gun and sets it on the floor, but keeps\nlooking.\n\nBernie\nYeah yeah, you know Mink. Hysterical. Skin full\nof hop, head full of bogeymen. Comes home crying\none day, said he had to pop a guy, one of\nBluepoint's spies.\n\nTom\nRug was following Verna, not Mink. Mink just\nhappened to be with her.\n\nHe has found a wallet and is thumbing through it.\n\nBernie\nYeah. Funny, ain't it? But you know, Mink was\nterrified Bluepoint'd find out me and him were\njungled up together.\n\nTom has taken out the money, rifles it, and replaces the\nwallet.\n\nTom\nAnd I'll bet you'd kept him plenty worried about\nthat, to keep him under your thumb.\n\nBernie\nYeah, so what . . .\n\nBernie is peering over Tom's shoulder at the monev.\n\n. . . Scratch, huh? A little bonus?\n\nTom straightens up, Caspar's gun in hand.\n\nTom\nWhy did Mink take Rug's hair?\n\nBernie shrugs.\n\nBernie\nBeats me, the kid was dizzy. Fifty-fifty on the\ndough? Or maybe I should get a little more,\nsince I did the deed.\n\nTom is stuffing the money into his pocket.\n\n. . . Okay, you keep it. I want you to have it.\n\nTom\nBernie. . .\n\nHe nods towards Caspar's body.\n\n. . . We can't hang this on Bluepoint.\n\nBernie\nHuh? Why not?\n\nTom\nBluepoint's already dead, halfway 'cross town.\n\nBernie's smile is fading.\n\nBernie\nWhat the hell are you talking about?\n\nTom\nBluepoint's dead. It's gotta be you. I mean\nhell, it's your gun.\n\nAlarm is beginning to rise:\n\nBernie\nWhat is this! What the hell are you talking\nabout! . . .\n\nHe looks down at Caspar and then back at Tom.\n\n. . . You took my gun! Just your word against\nmine!\n\nTom pops the chamber of Caspar's gun, glances in, and snaps\nit shut.\n\nTom\nNot necessarily.\n\nBernie's eyes widen.\n\nBernie\nAre you crazy! We're square! You said it\nyourself! We got nothing on each other!\n\nTom\nYup.\n\nBernie fights against hysteria:\n\nBernie\nSo what's in it for you?! There's no angle! You\ncan't just shoot me, like that!\n\nHe sinks to his knees, his voice rising.\n\n. . . Jesus Christ! It don't make sense! Tommy!\nLook in your heart!\n\nTom\nWhat heart.\n\nBANG--Bernie splays backwards from the knees, a bullet\ndrilled neatly through his forehead.\n\nTom drops the gun by Caspar's body.\n\nUnpocketing Bernie's gun, Tom goes over to his corpse and\ndrops it there.\n\nWe pan with Tom's legs to bring his doorway into view as he\nwalks into his apartment, to the window chair in the\nbackground, and sits with his back to us.\n\nThe windows show daylight breaking. Far away a clock\nstrikes the quarter hour.\n\nTom is picking up the phone and dialing. Waiting for an\nanswer, he reaches over to turn off the feeble yellow lamp\nburning chairside.\n\nAs we start to FADE OUT, we can hear Tom talking into the\nphone:\n\nTom\n. . . Tony? Tom. Tell Lazarre I've got his\nmoney. . . Yeah, all of it. And I want to place\na bet on tonight's fight. . .\n\nA BEAT OF BLACK\n\n76. CUT TO:\nTHE HALLWAY\n\nOf Leo's club, leading to his office.\n\nWe are tracking over Tom's shoulder as he walks down the\nhall, led by Dead Terry.\n\nTerry\nThey set you up downstairs?\n\nTom\nHow's that?\n\nTerry\nHootch? Whatever?\n\nTom gestures with the drink he is carrying. Its ice cubes\nclink.\n\n. . . Well thanks for coming, Tom. Leo's real\nanxious to see you. . .\n\nTom\nYeah. I happened to be near.\n\nWe can hear muffled bellowing coming from Leo's office,\ngrowing louder as we approach.\n\nTerry seems embarassed:\n\nTerry\nActually. . . this might not be the best time. . .\n\nThey have pulled up in front of the closed door to Leo's\noffice.\n\nLeo's bellowing, inside, abates for a moment. We can hear\nanother voice, muffled so that we don't hear words, but\nonly the voice's plaintive quality.\n\nLeo's bellowing cuts it short.\n\nTom\n. . . Who's he got in there?\n\nTerry\nO'Gar and the mayor.\n\nAs he leaves frame:\n\nTom\nI'll try again.\n\nTerry calls after him:\n\nTerry\nI'll tell him you stopped by.\n\n77. DOWNSTATRS\n\nPulling Tom as he walks across the gambling floor, drink\nstill in hand.\n\nBehind him we can see workmen busily repairing the damage\ndone to the club in the police raid.\n\nHalfway across the floor Tom stiffens and slows, seeing\nsomething.\n\nVerna is entering the club.\n\nThe two meet.\n\nTom\n'Lo, Verna.\n\nVerna\nSee Leo?\n\nThey both lean against a counterstop and look out at the\nfloor.\n\nTom\nHe was busy.\n\nVerna\nYou should see him. He has something to tell\nyou.\n\nTom\nMaybe I'll run into him.\n\nVerna\nBernie's funeral is tomorrow. You could stop by.\n\nTom\nMaybe.\n\nVerna\n. . . Leo has something to tell you.\n\nTom\nSo you said.\n\nThere is a silent beat. Verna scowls.\n\nVerna\n. . . Tell me something, Tom. Why didn't you\ntell me what was going on? I thought he was\ndead, and you never--\n\nTom\nThere was no point in telling you. It could only\nhave queered things if it had gotten out--\n\nVerna\nJesus, Tom! You don't just talk to people for\nthe play it gives you or doesn't give you! I\nsuffered, you no-heart son of a bitch!\n\nTom lets this drift.\n\nVerna tries to compose herself.\n\n. . . I'm sorry. It's just that things might've\nbeen different. With us. If I'd known that you\nhadn't. . . done anything to him. . .\n\nTom\nYou know now.\n\nVerna looks at him intently.\n\nVerna\nWhat happened that night?\n\nTom still looks at her evenly.\n\nTom\nI went to a bar. Passed out. When I got back to\nmy place they were both dead.\n\nVerna studies him.\n\nVerna\n. . . Passed out, huh?\n\nTom\nYeah.\n\nShe looks at him a beat more, then out at the floor.\n\nVerna\nIt's funny. . . I've never even seen you sleep--\nthough you told me once about a dream you had.\n\nTom\nMaybe I lied.\n\nWHAP! Verna slaps him hard. His head rocks under the\nblow.\n\nVerna\nYou've never been straight with me about any-\nthing! You are a sonofabitch!\n\nShe stalks off.\n\nTom watches her go.\n\nHe raises the drink and rolls it across his slapped cheek.\n\nThe ice cubes clink.\n\n78. CEMETARY\n\nAn small old marble orchard set on a hilltop cleared\nagainst the woods. Stars of David adorn the headstones; in\nthe foreground Bernie's funeral is ending. Present is a\nrabbi, just finishing the chanting of the liturgy, Verna,\nand Leo.\n\nIn the background, on the road at the foot of the hill, Tom\nis emerging from a taxi. It rolls away as he starts up the\nhill.\n\nJust as he arrives, Leo and Verna turn to leave.\n\nTom takes in the scene.\n\nTom\nBig turnout.\n\nVerna\nDrop dead.\n\nShe stalks off, leaving Leo and Tom alone. Leo takes off\nhis yarmulke and fiddles with it uncomfortably. The two\nmen start walking.\n\nLeo\n. . . She's under a lot of strain.\n\nTom\nWell, at least she didn't hit me.\n\nLeo chuckles.\n\nThey walk on.\n\nLeo\nTommy, I'm glad you came. . .\n\nTom\nShe's taking the car.\n\nLeo\nHuh?\n\nLeo looks up.\n\nVerna is getting into the elegant black touring-car that\nwaits at the bottom of the hill. It pulls away.\n\nLeo looks at Tom.\n\n. . . I guess we're walking.\n\nTom\nI guess we are.\n\nThey walk in silence for a beat.\n\nLeo\n. . . We're getting married.\n\nTom stiffens. He brings out:\n\nTom\n. . . Congratulations, Leo.\n\nLeo too is uncomfortable.\n\nLeo\nThe funny thing is. . . She asked me. To tie the\nknot. I guess you're not supposed to say that.\n\nTom\nIt doesn't matter. Congratulations.\n\nLeo\nThanks. . . Hell, Tom! Why didn't you tell me\nwhat you were up to?! I thought you'd really\ngone over--not that I didn't deserve it. But you\ncould have told me.\n\nTom\nTelling you could only've queered things if it\nhad. . .\n\nTom cuts himself off and walks in silence for a moment.\n\n. . . There just wasn't any point.\n\nLeo wants to be encouraging. He nods.\n\nLeo\nI can see that. Well. It was a smart play, all\naround. I guess you know I'm grateful.\n\nTom\nNo need.\n\nLeo is grinning again.\n\nLeo\nI guess you picked that fight with me just to\ntuck yourself in with Caspar.\n\nTom\nI dunno. Do you always know why you do things,\nLeo?\n\nLeo greets this with a puzzled Smile.\n\nLeo\nCourse I do.\n\nHe nods to himself.\n\n. . . It was a smart play.\n\nThey walk on.\n\nTom\nYou'll do fine.\n\nLeo stops, grabs Tom's arm, and the words come cut in a\nrush:\n\nLeo\n. . . Jesus, Tom! I'd give anything if you'd\nwork for me again! I know I've made some\nbonehead plays! I know I can be pig-headed but,\ndamnit, so can you! I need your help, and things\ncan be like they were, I know it! I just know\nit! As for you and Verna--well I understand,\nyou're both young, and--well, damnit, Tom, I\nforgive you!\n\nTom instantly bristles. For the first time, his tone is\nsharp:\n\nTom\nI didn't ask for that and I don't want it.\n\nThe two men stare at each other--Tom's look angry; Leo's,\ndistraught.\n\nTom's look softens.\n\n. . . Goodbye, Leo.\n\nLeo still stares at him, waiting for something else.\n\nWhen nothing is forthcoming he turns and walks away.\n\nTom watches him go. He unpockets a flask and raises it to\nhis lips.\n\nBehind him a tree soughs in the wind.\n\nFADE OUT2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/876115", "artist_names":

mean\nMy mama said \"Girl, I can see that you're a woman\nThere's something that I want you to know\nI spent 27 years with a no income gambler\nAnd we ain't got nothing to show\n\nYou got to get yourself a rich man\nYou got to marry you a rich man\nYou got to live your life, if you wanna be a wife\nI know you got to have love but it's just as easy loving you a rich man\nYou got to get yourself a rich man\nIf you're a poor man's wife, you'll live a poor man's life\nYou can never get your hands on a dime\nAnd you can sing th\u0435 blues and you can pay your dues\nBut you can nev\u0435r pay the man on time\nAnd you can look in the window but you can't buy\nYou'll be wishing in the palm of your hand\nBut there ain't no reason for doing without\nIf you marry to the man who's got the dollar in his hand\n\nAnd that's a rich man\nYou got to marry you a rich man\nYou've got to shop around and when you think you've found\nThe kind of fella you need to know you better check and see if he's a rich man\nYou got to get yourself a rich man\"\n\nWhen I stop and think of all the places in the world\nThat I'd like to get a chance to see\nOf all the brand new cars and all the high class bars\nOut in the world just waiting for me\nAnd I think about Mama in her raggedy dress\nOut in the kitchen working down on her knees\nThen I make me a rule that no destitute fool's\nGonna ever put a ring on me\n\nI'm gonna get myself a rich man\nI'm gonna marry me a rich man\nI'm gonna look so fine, I'm gonna take my time\nI'm gonna fish in the sea, I'm gonna wait 'til I catch me a rich man\nI'm gonna get myself a rich man\nI'm gonna marry me a rich man\nI'm gonna get myself a rich man\nI'm gonna find me a rich man\nI'm gonna have me a rich man\nI'm gonna get myself a rich man\nI'm

"One More Chance LyricsFeel like a fool\nNot realizing all the value you had\nI took a happy ending and made it sad\nThe day I walked away\nAnd left you alone\nWith hardly an explanation\n\nYou stood on your own\nAnd handled the situation\nAnd showed to me\nHow understanding you could be\nNow I'm alone\nLooking back\nAt all the years that we shared\nThinking of the pain\nYou should have been spared\nAfraid to ask forgiveness\nBut where can I go\n\nThere's no one else to turn to\nI still have my pride\nBut now it's time\nTo learn to cast it aside\nAnd come to you with honesty\n\nGive me just one more chance\nSuch a simple thing I'm asking for\nJust one more chance\nIt would be a shame to close the door to\n\nOne more chance\nIsn't that what we pray each night for?\nOne more chance\nIsn't that what we're fighting for?\nWhy throw away a love\nThat needs one more chance\nYou might also likeNow I'm afraid that after all I've said\nYou'll still turn me down\nAnd you'll smile\nAnd say I'll see you around\n\nBut remember that\nYou still have a choice\nAnd I hope and pray you'll make it\n\nYou'll think of my heart\nAnd you won't wanna break it\nAnd I'll prove to you\nThe kind of lady I can be\n\nGive me just one more chance\nSuch a simple thing I'm asking for\nJust one more chance\nIt would be a shame to close the door to\n\nOne more chance\nIsn't that what we pray each night for?\nOne more chance\nIsn't that what we're fighting for?\n\nOne more chance\nDon't you know that we belong together\nOne more chance\nNow I really need you more than ever\nOne more chance\nYou and I can really make it, baby\nOne more chance\nAll you have do is say the words to\n\nOne more chance\nOne more\nOne more chance\nOne more chanceEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

looking up to me\nWith a crown so loud, wear it on my sleeve\nWelcome to the story where the pain is mandatory\nIts taking all the guts\nBut I\u2019ve never seen the glory\nContinue with the scoring even when the rain is pouring\nIt\u2019s a shot clock life so\nConsider this a warning\n\nChorus\nRising up is powerful\nElectric like a lightning bolt\nSwervin\u2019 down a rocky road\nMy pride is

authority is a shot in the dark\nDrive me crazy and I\u2019m outty (Audi) push the button to start\nScratching out the past with a sharp number two\nBut watch the history bleed like a fresh

shit is not redefined\nSecond to none can\u2019t deny logic\nPardon myself while I talk my shit\nI need the VIP seat with the diamond trim\nImma build my own table once I\u2019m finished here\nMinor setback for a major comeback\nIgnoring all the feedback you can keep that\nSupporters giving orders? do we have to recap?\nI\u2019m hitting you with facts let it knock your wig back.

unlike the origins of life. For many years it was recorded only by memory, and relayed only live, and in person. The Blues were born in the North Mississippi Delta following the Civil War. Influenced by African roots, field hollers, ballads, church music and rhythmic dance tunes called jump-ups evolved into a music for a singer who would engage in call-and-response with his guitar. He would sing a line, and the guitar The blues have strongly influenced almost all popular music including jazz, country, and rock and roll and continues to help shape music worldwide. The Blues History it's 12-bar, bent-note melody is the anthem of a race, bonding itself together with cries of shared self victimization. Bad luck and trouble are always present in the Blues, and always the result of others, pressing upon unfortunate and down trodden poor souls, yearning to be free from life's' troubles. Relentless rhythms repeat the chants of sorrow, and the pity of a lost soul many times over.\n\nThis is the [Blues]. The blues form was first popularized about 1911-14 by the black composer W.C. Handy (1873-1958). However, the poetic and musical form of the blues first crystallized around 1910 and gained popularity through the publication of Handy's \"Memphis Blues\" (1912) and \"St. Louis Blues\" (1914). Instrumental blues had been recorded as early as 1913. During the twenties, the blues became a national craze. Mamie Smith recorded the first vocal blues song, 'Crazy Blues' in 1920. The Blues influence on jazz brought it into the mainstream and made possible the records of blues singers like Bessie Smith and later, in the thirties, Billie Holiday The Blues are the essence of the African American laborer, whose spirit is wed to these songs, reflecting his inner soul to all who will listen. Rhythm and Blues, is the cornerstone of all forms of African American music. In northern cities like Chicago and Detroit, during the later forties and early fifties, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, and Elmore James among others, played what was basically Mississippi Delta blues, backed by bass, drums, piano and occasionally harmonica, and began scoring national hits with blues songs.\n\nAt about the same time, T-Bone Walker in Houston and B.B. King in Memphis were pioneering a style of guitar playing that combined jazz technique with the blues tonality and repertoire.  In Memphis, B.B. King invented the concept of lead guitar, now standard in today's Rock bands. Bukka White (cousin to B.B. King), Leadbelly, and Son House, left Country Blues to create the sounds most of us think of today as traditional unamplified Blues. Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup, Wyonnie Harris, and Big Mama Thorton wrote and preformed the songs that would make a young Elvis Presley world renown. In the early nineteen-sixties, the urban bluesmen were \"discovered\" by young white American and European musicians. Many of these blues-based bands like the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, John Mayall's\nBluesbreakers, Cream, Canned Heat, and Fleetwood\nMac, brought the blues to young white audiences, something the black blues artists had been unable to do in America except through the purloined white cross-over covers of black rhythm and blues songs. Since the sixties, rock has undergone several blues revivals.\n\nSome rock guitarists, such as Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, and Eddie Van Halen have used the blues as a foundation for offshoot styles. While the originators like John Lee Hooker, Albert Collins and B.B. King--and their heirs Buddy Guy, Otis Rush, and later Eric Clapton and the late Roy Buchanan, among many others, continued to make fantastic music in the blues tradition. The latest generation of blues players like Robert Cray and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, among others, as well as gracing the blues tradition with their incredible technicality, have drawn a new generation listeners to the blues. W.C. Handy the Father of the Blues wasn't an ordinary Delta bluesman. Handy studied music as a youth, playing the cornet and traveling the South with dance bands playing minstrel and tent shows. Later in life he became a songwriter, bandleader and publisher.\n\nLegend is that while waiting for an overdue train in Tutwiler, Mississippi, in 1903 that he heard an itinerant bluesman playing slide guitar and singing about \"going' where the Southern cross the Dog,\" referring to the junction of the Southern and Yazoo and Mississippi Valley railroads farther south near Moorhead. Handy called it \"the weirdest music I had ever heard.\"In the delta of the Mississippi River, where Robert Johnson was born. They said that Robert Johnson must have waited by the crossroads and gotten his guitar fine-tuned. Not much is known about Johnson other then after the death of his wife in 1930 he decided to become a bluesman. Wandering around the Delta in 1933, he met Son House and Willie Brown. When they heard him play on the guitar startled them. In an amazingly short time, Johnson had turned into a blues guitar master. Blind Lemon Jefferson was indeed blind, unlike other Delta musicians who merely claimed the limitation.\nHe died penniless in Chicago in December 1929, possibly suffering a heart attack when he became disoriented during a snowstorm. Leadbelly was a large man, and given to fits of rage. however, based solely on his musicianship. His \"discovery\" came, in fact, at Louisiana's Angola Prison Farm. Willie Dixon was certainly the single most important presence on the postwar Chicago scene. What distinguished Willie Dixon from most other Delta bluesmen of his day was his ability to read, write, compose, and arrange music talents that were to destine him for legendary status among the bluesmakers. However, it was boxing, not music, that brought Dixon to Chicago in 1936. He was an upstart professional fighter\nwho for a time sparred with the great Joe Louis. Named after a 19th-century American president, young Chester Arthur Burnett earned the nickname that was to become synonymous with the power of his voice \"Howlin' Wolf.\"This lesson enables teachers to use blues music to explore the history of African Americans in the 20th century. By studying the content of blues songs, students can learn about the experiences and struggles of the working-class Southerners who created the music, including the legacies of slavery and the cotton economy in the South. As legendary guitarist Robert Johnson put it, Chicago has been a \u201csweet home\u201d for the blues. The most recognizable cultural signature this city has produced, Chicago blues has diverse and contradictory roots: African American migration from the South and the growth of the modern music industry; regional folk genius and ethnic entrepreneurial savvy. This rich sense of origin and history makes blues music such a celebrated civic resource, one that still shapes cultural and social practice throughout the Windy City.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4533578", "artist_names": "Billy Burnette", "full_title": "Don't Say No by\u00a0Billy\u00a0Burnette", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/be02ad87a48c229e01061516ce5a4fe2.249x249x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/be02ad87a48c229e01061516ce5a4fe2.249x249x1.jpg", "id": 4533578, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 8613973, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1575120224, "path": "/Billy-burnette-dont-say-no-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Billy-burnette-dont-say-no-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/be02ad87a48c229e01061516ce5a4fe2.249x249x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/be02ad87a48c229e01061516ce5a4fe2.249x249x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Don\u2019t Say No", "title_with_featured": "Don't Say No", "updated_by_human_at": 1575120238, "url": "https://genius.com/Billy-burnette-dont-say-no-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/358234", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e6f3bda88e7670483b5f09383960582f.399x594x1.jpg", "id": 358234, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/211ca33c35023a1a05b293cb390e046c.342x342x1.jpg", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Billy Burnette", "slug": "Billy-burnette", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Billy-burnette"}, "artist": "Billy Burnette", "lyrics": "Don\u2019t Say No LyricsHere we are baby just you and me\nHoldin' each other tight as can be\nIf I ask the question and you don't answer me\nWell say not tonight and then I'll leave\nWell say maybe later I don't know\nSay maybe baby but don't say no\n\nHere we are baby under the moonlight\nEverything feels right -

MINUTOLO.\n\nSEV. You will see the origin of the nine blind men, who state nine reasons and special causes of their blindness, and yet they all agree in one general reason and one common enthusiasm. 1\n\nMIN. Begin with the first!\n\nSEV. The first of these, notwithstanding that he is blind by nature, yet he laments, saying to the others, that he cannot persuade himself that nature has been less courteous to them than to him; seeing that although they do not (now) see, yet they have enjoyed sight, and have had experience of that sense, and of the value of that faculty, of which they\n\np. 89\nhave been deprived, while he came into the world as a mole, to be seen and not to see, to long for the sight of that which he never had seen.\n\nMIN. Many have fallen in love through report alone.\n\nSEV. They have, says he, the happiness of retaining that Divine image present in the mind, so that, although blind, they have in imagination that which he cannot have. Then in the sistine he turns to his guide and begs him to lead him to some precipice, so that he may no longer endure this contempt and persecution of nature. He says then:\n\n63.\n\nThe first blind man.\n\nYe now afflicted are, who erst were glad,\nFor ye, have lost the light that once was yours,\nYet happy, for ye have the twin lights known.\nThese eyes ne'er lighted were, and ne'er were quenched;\nBut a more grievous destiny is mine\nWhich calls for heavier lamentation.\nWho will deny that nature upon me\nHas frowned more harshly than on you?\nConduct me to the precipice, my guide,\nAnd give me peace, for there will I a cure\nFor this my dolour and affliction find;\nFor to be seen, yet not to see the light,\nLike an incapable and sightless mole,\nIs to be useless and a burden on the earth\n\np. 90\nNow follows the other, who, bitten by the serpent of jealousy, became affected in the organ of sight. He wanders without any guide, unless he has jealousy for his escort. He begs some of the bystanders, that seeing there is no remedy for his misfortune, they should have pity upon him, so that he should no longer feel it; that he might become as unmanifest to himself as he is to the light, and that they bury him together with his own misfortune. He says then:\n\n64.\n\nThe second blind man.\n\nAlecta has torn from out her dreadful hair,\nThe infernal worm that with a cruel bite,\nHas fiercely fastened on my soul,\nAnd of my senses, torn the chief away,\nLeaving the intellect without its guide.\nla vain the soul some consolation seeks.\nThat spiteful, rabid, rancorous jealousy\nMakes me go stumbling along the way.\nIf neither magic spell nor sacred plant,\nNor virtue hid in the enchanter's stone,\nWill yield me the deliverance that I ask:\nLet one of you, my friends, be pitiful,\nAnd put me out, as are put out my eyes,\nThat they and. I together be entombed.\n\n[paragraph continues] The other follows, who says that he became blind through having been suddenly brought out of the darkness into a great light accustomed to\n\np. 91\n\nbehold ordinary beauties, a celestial beauty was suddenly presented before his eyes--a sun-god--in this manner his sight became dull and the twin lights which shine at the prow of the soul were put out: for the eyes are like two beacons, which guide the ship, and this would happen to one brought up in Cimmerian obscurity if he fixed his eyes suddenly upon the sun. In the sistine he begs for free passage to Hades, because darkness alone is suitable to a dark condition. He says:\n65.\n\nThe third blind man.\n\nIf sudden on the sight, the star of day\nShould shed his beams on one in darkness reared,\nNurtured beneath the black Cimmerian sky,\nFar from the radiance of the glorious sun\nThe double light, the beacon of the soul\nHe quenches. then as a foe he hides.\nThus were my eyes made dull, inept,\nUsed only, wonted beauties to behold.\nConduct me to the land where darkness reigns!\nWherefore being dead, speak I amidst the folk?\nA chip of Hell, why do I mix and move\nAmongst the living, wherefore do I drink\nThe hated. air, since all my pain\nIs clue to having seen the highest good?\n\nThe fourth blind man comes forward, not blind for the same reason as the former one. For as\n\np. 92\n\nthat one was blinded through the sudden aspect of the light, this one is so, from having too frequently beheld it, or through having fixed his eyes too much upon it, so that he has lost the sense of all other light, but he does not consider himself to be blind through looking at that one which has blinded him: and the same may be said of the sense of sight as of the sense of hearing, that those whose ears are accustomed to great noises, do not hear the lesser, as is well known of those who live near the cataracts of the great river Nile which fall precipitously down to the plain.\n\nMIN. Thus, all those who have accustomed the body and the soul to things more difficult and great, are not apt to feel annoyed by smaller difficulties. So that fellow ought not to be discontented about his blindness.\n\nSEV. Certainly not. But one says, voluntarily blind, of one who desires that every other thing be hidden because it annoys him to be diverted from looking at that which alone he wishes to behold. Meanwhile he prays the passers-by to prevent his coming to mischief in any encounter, while he goes so absorbed and captivated by one principal object.\n\nMIN. Repeat his words!\n\nSEV. He says:\n\np. 93\n\n66.\n\nThe fourth blind man.\n\nHeadlong from on high to the abyss,\nThe cataract of the Nile falls down and dulls the senses\nOf the joyless folk to every other sound,\nSo stood I too, with spirit all intent\nUpon. the living light, that lights the world;\nDead henceforth to all the lesser splendours,\nWhile that light shines, let every other thing\nBe to the voluntary blind concealed.\nI pray you save me stumbling 'mongst the stones,\nMake me aware of the wild beast,\nShow me whether up or down I go;\nSo that the miserable bones fall not,\nInto a low and cavernous place,\nWhile 1, without a guide, am stepping on.\n\nTo the blind man that follows, it happens that having wept so much, his eyes are become dim, so that he is not able to extend the visual ray, so as to distinguish visible objects, nor can he see the light, which in spite of himself, through so many sorrows, he at one time was able to see. Besides which he considers that his blindness is not from constitution, but from habit, and is peculiar to himself, because the luminous fire which kindles the soul in the pupil, was for too long a time and with too much force, repressed and restrained by a contrary humour, so that although he might cease from weeping, he\n\np. 94\n\ncannot be persuaded that this would result in the longed-for vision. You will hear what he says to the throng in order that they should enable him to proceed on his way:\n\n67.\n\nThe fifth blind man.\n\nEyes of mine, with waters ever full,\nWhen will the bright spark of the visual ray,\nDarting, spring through each veiling obstacle,\nThat I may see again those holy lights\nThat were the alpha of my darling pain?\nAh, woe! I fear me it is quite extinct,\nSo long oppressed and conquered by its opposite.\nLet the blind man pass on!\nAnd turn your eyes upon these founts\nWhich overcome the others one and all.\nShould any dare dispute it with me,\nThere's one would surely answer him again;\nThat in one eye of mine an ocean is contained.\n\nThe sixth blind man is sightless because, through so much weeping, there remains no more moisture, not even the crystalline and moisture through which, as a diaphanous medium, the visual ray was transmitted, and the external light and visible species were introduced, so that the heart became compressed because all the moist substance, whose office it is to keep united the various parts and opposites, was absorbed, and the amorous affection remains without the effect of tears. Therefore the\n\np. 95\n\norgan is destroyed through the victory of the other elements, and it is consequently left without sight and without consistency of the parts of the body altogether. 1 He then proposes to the bystanders that which you shall hear:\n\n68.\n\nThe sixth blind man.\n\nEyes, no longer eyes, fountains no longer founts,\nYe have wept out the waters that did keep\nThe body, soul, and spirit joined in one,\nAnd thou, reflecting crystal, which from without\nSo much unto the soul made manifest,\nThou art consumed by the wounded heart.\nSo towards the dark and cavernous abyss,\nI, a blind and man, direct my steps.\nAh, pity me, and do not hesitate\nTo help my speedy going. I who\nSo many rivers in the dark days spread out,\nFinding my only comfort in my tears,\nNow that my streams and fountains all are dry,\nTowards profound oblivion lead the way.\n\np. 96\n\nThe next one avers that he has lost his sight through the intensity of the flame, which, proceeding from the heart, first destroyed the eyes, and then dried up all the remaining moisture of the substance of the lover, so that being all melted and turned to flame, he is no longer himself, because the fire whose property it is to resolve all bodies into their atoms, has converted him into impalpable dust, whereas by virtue of water alone, the atoms of other bodies thicken, and are welded together to make a substantial composition. Yet he is not deprived of the sense of the most intense flame. Therefore, in the sistine he would have space made for him to pass; for if anybody should be touched by his fires he would become such that he would have no more feeling of the flames of hell, for their heat would be to him as cold snow.\n\n69.\n\nThe seventh blind man.\n\nBeauty, which through the eyes rushed to the heart,\nAnd formed the mighty furnace in my breast,\nAbsorbing first the visual moisture; then,\nSpouting aloft its grasping flashing flame,\nDevouring every other fluid,\nTo set the dryer element at rest,\nHas thus reduced me to a boneless dust,\nWhich now to its own atoms is resolved. p. 97\nIf anguish infinite your fears should rouse\nMake space, give way, oh peoples!\nBeware of my fierce penetrating fire,\nFor if it should invade and touch you, ye\nWould feel and know the fires of hell\nTo be like winter's cold.\n\nThe eighth follows, whose blindness is caused by the dart which love has caused to penetrate from the eyes to the heart. Hence, he laments not only as being blind, but furthermore because he is wounded and burnt so fiercely, that he believes no other can be equally so. The sense of it is easily expressed in this sonnet:--\n\n70.\n\nThe eighth blind man.\n\nVile onslaught, evil struggle, unrighteous palm,\nFine point, devouring fire, strong nerve,\nSharp wound, impious ardour, cruel body,\nDart, fire and tangle of that wayward god\nWho pierced the eyes, inflamed the heart, bound the soul,\nMade me at once sightless, a lover, and a slave,\nSo that, blind I have at all times, in all ways and places,\nThe feeling of my wound, my fire, my noose.\nMen, heroes, and gods!\nWho be on earth, or near to Ditis or to Jove,\nI pray ye say, when, how, and where did ye\nFeel ever, hear, or see in any place\nWoes like to these, amongst the oppressed\nAmongst the damned, 'mongst lovers?\n\np. 98\n\nFinally comes the last one, who is also mute through not having been able, or having dared, to say that which he most desired to say, for fear of offending or exciting contempt, and he is deprived of speaking of every other thing: therefore, it is not he who speaks, but his guide who relates the affair, about which I do not speak, but only bring you the sense thereof:\n\n71.\n\nThe guide of the ninth blind man.\n\nHappy are ye, oh all ye sightless lovers,\nThat ye the reason of your pains can tell,\nBy virtue of your tears you can be sure\nOf pure and favourable receptions.\nAmongst you all, the latent fire of him\nWhose guide I am, rages most fiercely,\nThough he is mute for want of boldness\nTo make known his sorrows to his deity.\nMake way! open ye wide the way,\nBe ye benign unto this vacant face,\nOh people full of grievous hindrances,\nThe while this harassed. weary trunk\nGoes knocking at the doors\nTo meet a death less painful, more profound.\n\nHere are mentioned nine reasons, which are the cause that the human mind is blind as regards the Divine object and cannot fix its eyes upon it. And of these, the first, allegorized through the first blind\n\np. 99\n\nman, is the quality of its own species, which in so far as the degree in which he finds himself admits, he aspires certainly higher, than he is able to comprehend.\n\nMIN. Because no natural desire is vain, we are able to assure ourselves of a more excellent state which is suitable to the soul outside of this body, in the which it may be possible to unite itself, or to approach more nearly, to its object.\n\nSEV. Thou sayest well that no natural impulse or power is without strong reason; it is in fact the same rule of nature which orders things. So far, it is a thing most true and most certain to well-disposed intellects, that the human soul, whatever it may show itself while it is in the body, that same, which it makes manifest in this state, is the expression of its pilgrim existence in this region; because it aspires to the truth and to universal good, and is not satisfied with that which comes on account of and to the profit of its species.\n\nThe second, represented by the second blind man, proceeds from some troubled affection, as in the question of Love and Jealousy, the which is like a moth, which has the same subject, enemy and father, that is, it consumes the cloth or wood from which it is generated.\n\np. 100\n\nMIN. This does not seem to me to take place with heroic love.\n\nSEV. True, according to the same reason which is. seen in the lower kind of love; but I mean according to another reason similar to that which happens to those who love truth and goodness. which shows itself when they are angry against those who adulterate it, spoil it, or corrupt it, or who in other ways would treat it with indignity, as has been the case with those who have brought themselves to suffer death and pains, and to being ignominiously treated by ignorant peoples and vulgar sects.\n\nMIN. Certainly no one truly loves the truth and the good who is not angry against the multitude; as no one loves in the ordinary way who is not jealous and fearful about the thing loved.\n\nSEV. And so he comes to be really blind in many things, and according to the common opinion he is quite infatuated and mad.\n\nMIN. I have noted a place which says that all those are infatuated and mad, who have sense beyond and outside of the general sense of other men. But such extravagance is of two kinds, according as one goes beyond and ascends up higher than the greater number rise or can rise, and these are they who are inspired with Divine enthusiasm; or by going down\n\np. 101\n\nlower where those are found who have greater defect of sense and of reason than the many, and the ordinary; but in that kind of madness, insensibility and blindness, will not be found the jealous hero.\n\nSEV. Although be is told that much learning makes him mad, yet no one can really abuse him. The third, represented by the third blind man, proceeds from this: that Divine Truth according to supernatural reasoning, called metaphysics, manifests itself to those few to whom it shows itself, and does not proceed with measure of movement and time as occurs in the physical sciences, that is, those which are acquired by natural light, the which, in discoursing of a thing known to reason by means of the senses, proceed to the knowledge of another thing, unknown, the which discourse is called argument; but immediately and suddenly, according to the method which belongs to such efficiency. 1 'Whence a divine has said: \"Attenuati sunt oculi mei suspicientes in excelsum.\" So that it does not require a useless lapse of time, fatigue, and study,\n\np. 102\n\nand inquisitorial act to have it, but it is taken in quickly, as the solar light, without hesitation, and makes itself present to whoever turns himself to it. and opens himself to it.\n\nMIN. Do you mean then, that the student and the philosopher are not more apt to receive this light than the ignorant?\n\nSEV. In a certain way no, and in a certain way yes. There is no difference, when the Divine mind through its providence comes to communicate itself without disposition of the subject; I mean to say when it communicates itself because it seeks and elects its subject; but there is a great difference, when it waits and would be sought, and then according to its own good will and pleasure it makes itself to be found. In this way it does not appear to all, nor can it appear to others, than to those who seek it. Hence it is said, \"Qui qu\u00e6runt, me, invenient me;\" and again--\"Qui sitit, veniat et bibat!\"\n\nMIN. It is not to be denied, that the apprehension of the second manner is made in Time. (Comes with time?)\n\nSEV. You do not distinguish between the disposition towards the Divine light and the apprehension of the same. Certainly I do not deny that it requires time to dispose oneself, discourse,\n\np. 103\n\nstudy and fatigue; but as we say that change takes place in time, and generation in an instant, and as we see that with time, the windows are opened, but the sun enters in a moment, so does it happen similarly in this case.\n\nThe fourth, represented in the following, is not really unworthy, like that which results from the habit of believing in the false opinions of the vulgar, which are very far removed from the opinions of philosophers, and are derived from the study of vulgar philosophies, which are by the multitude considered the more true, the more they appeal to common sense. And this habit is one of the greatest and strongest disadvantages, because as Alcazele and Averroes showed, it is like that which happens to those persons who from childhood and youth are in the habit of eating poison, and have become such, that it is converted into sweet and proper nutriment, and on the other hand, they abominate those things which are really good and sweet according to common nature; but it is most worthy, because it is founded upon the habit of looking at the true light; the which habit cannot come into use for the multitude, as we have said. This blindness is heroic, and is of such a kind that it can worthily satisfy the present heroic\n\np. 104\n\nblind man, who is so far from troubling himself about it that he is able to explain every other sight, and he would crave nothing else from the community save a free passage and progress in contemplation, for he finds himself usually hampered and blocked by obstacles and opposition.\n\nThe fifth results from the disproportion of the means of our cognition to the knowable; seeing that in order to contemplate Divine things, the eyes must be opened by means of images, analogies and other reasonings which by the Peripatetics are comprehended under the name of fancies (fantasmi); or, by means of Being, to proceed to speculate about Essence, by means of its effects and the knowledge of the cause; the which means, are so far from ensuring the attainment of such an end, that it is easier to believe that the highest and most profound cognition of Divine things, is through negation and not through affirmation, knowing that the Divine beauty and goodness is not that which can or does fall within our conception, but that which is above and beyond, incomprehensible; chiefly in that condition called by the philosopher speculation of phantoms, and by the theologian, vision through analogies, reflections and enigmas, because we see, not the true effects and the true species of things,\n\np. 105\n\nor the substance of ideas, but the shadows, vestiges and simulacra of them, like those who are inside the cave and have from their birth their shoulders turned away from the entrance of the light, and their faces towards the end, where they do not see that which is in reality, but the shadows of that which is found substantially outside the cave. Therefore by the open vision which it has lost, and knows it has lost, a spirit similar to or better than that of Plato weeps, desiring exit from the cave. whence, not through reflexion, but through immediate conversion he may see the light again.\n\nMIN. It appears to me that this blind man does not refer to the difficulty which proceeds from reflective vision, but to that which is caused through the medium between the visual power and the object.\n\nSEV. These two modes, although they are distinct in the sensitive cognition, or ocular vision, at the same time are united together in the rational or intellectual cognition.\n\nMIN. It seems to me that I have heard and read that in every vision. the means, or the intermediary is required between the power and the object. Because as by means of the light diffused in the air and the figure of the thing, which in a certain way proceeds from that which is seen, to that which\n\np. 106\n\nsees, the act of seeing is put into effect, so in the intellectual region, where shines the sun of the intellect, acting between the intelligible species formed as proceeding from the object, our intellect comes to comprehend something of the divinity, or something inferior to it. Because, as our eye, when we see, does not receive the light of the fire and of gold, in substance, but in similitude; so the intellect, in whatever state it is found, does not receive the divinity substantially, so that there should be substantially as many gods as there are intelligences, but in similitude; therefore they are not formally gods, but denominatively divine, the divinity and Divine beauty being one, exalted above all things.\n\nSEV. You say well; but for all your well saying, there is no need for me to retract, because I have never said the contrary. But I must declare and explain. Therefore, first I maintain that the immediate vision, so called and understood by us, does not do away with that sort of medium which is the intelligible species, nor that which is the light; but that which is equal to the thickness and density of the crystalline or opaque intermediate body; as happens to him who sees by means of the waters more or less turbid, or air foggy and cloudy, who\n\np. 107\n\nwould believe he was looking as without a medium when it was conceded to him to look through the pure air, light and clear, All which you have explained where it says:\n\n\"When will the bright spark of the visual ray\nDarting, spring through each veiling obstacle.\"\n\n[paragraph continues] But let us return. The sixth, represented in the following, is caused only by the imbecility and unreality of the body, which is in continual motion, mutation, and change, the operations of which must follow the condition of its faculty, the which is a result of the condition of its nature and being. How can immobility, reality, entity, truth be contained in that which is ever different, and always makes and is made, other and otherwise? What, truth, what picture can be painted and impressed, where the pupils of the eyes are dispersed in water, the water into steam, the steam into flame, the flame into air, and this in other and other without end: the subject of sense and cognition turns for ever upon the wheel of mutation?\n\nMIN. Movement is change, and that which is changeable works and operates ever differently, because the conception and affection follow the reason and condition of the subject; and he who sees other and other different and differently must,\n\np. 108\n\nnecessarily be blind as regards that beauty which is one and alone and is the same unity and entity.\n\nSEV. So it is. The seventh, contained allegorically in the sentiment of the seventh blind man, is the result of the fire of the affections, whence some become impotent and incapable of comprehending the truth, by making the affection precede the intellect. There are those who love before they understand: whence it happens that all things appear to them according to the colour of their affections, whereas he who would understand the truth by means of contemplation, ought to be perfectly pure in thought.\n\nMIN. In truth, one sees how much diversity there is in meditators and inquirers, because some, according to their habits and early fundamental discipline, proceed by means of numbers, 1 others by means of images, others by means of order and disorder, others through composition and division, others by separation and congregation, others by inquiry and doubt, others by discussions and definitions,\n\np. 109\n\nothers by interpretations and decypherings, of voices, words, and dialects, so that some are mathematical philosophers, some metaphysicians, others logicians, others grammarians; so there are divers contemplators, who with different affections set themselves to study and apply the meaning of written sentences; whence we find that the same light of truth, expressed in the selfsame book, serves with the same words the proposition of so numerous, diverse, and contrary sects. 1\n\nSEV. That is to say, that the affections are very powerful in hindering the comprehension of the Truth, notwithstanding that the person may not himself perceive it; just as it happens to a stupid invalid who does not say that his mouth is bittered but that the food is bitter. Now that kind of blindness is expressed by him whose eyes are changed and deprived of their natural powers, by that which the heart has given and imprinted upon it, powerful not only to change the sense, but besides that, all the faculties of the soul as the present image shows. According to the meaning of the eighth, the high intelligible object has\n\np. 110\n\nblinded the intellect, as the high superposed sensible has corrupted the senses. Thus it would happen to him who should see Jove in his majesty, he would lose his life and in consequence his senses. As he who looks aloft sometimes is overcome by the majesty. 1 Besides, when he comes to penetrate the Divine species, he passes it like a ray. Whence say the theologians that the Divine word is more penetrating than sharp point of sword or knife. Hence is derived the form and impression\n\np. 111\n\nof His own footstep, upon which nothing else can be imprinted and sealed. Therefore, that form being there confirmed and the new strange one not being able to take its place unless the other yields, consequently he can say, that he has no power of taking any other, if there is one who replaces it or scatters it through the necessary want of proportion. The ninth reason is exemplified, by the ninth who is blind through want of confidence, through dejection of spirit, the which is caused and brought about also by a great love which He fears to offend by His temerity. Whence says the Psalm: \"Averte oculos tuos a me, quia ipsi me avolare fecere.\" And so he suppresses his eyes so as not to see that which most of all he desires, as he keeps his tongue from talking with whom he most wishes to speak, from fear that a defective look or word should humiliate him or bring him in some way into misfortune. And this generally proceeds from the apprehension of the excellence of the object above its potential faculty whence the most profound and divine theologians say, that God is more honoured and loved by silence than by words; as one sees more by shutting the eyes O the species represented, than by opening them, therefore the negative theology of Pythagoras and\n\np. 112\n\nDionysius is more celebrated than the demonstrative theology of Aristotle and the scholastic doctors.\n\nMIN.
