Regarding Internet Governance LyricsThank you, Steve Crocker, for your introduction and for your leadership as the Chairman of ICANN. I also want to thank you, Fadi Chehade, and the entire Board of ICANN for bringing together so many leaders in the global internet community and for taking the lead in advancing the multistakeholder process. And I want to acknowledge Assistant Secretary Larry Strickling and our entire team at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for their daily work on Internet policy issues, domain name system issues, and protecting the Internet as an engine for innovation and prosperity.\n\nWe come together at a time when Internet governance is as important as ever. The fact is that we must do everything we can to protect and preserve this revolutionary platform that is the essential connector of people, economies, and communities across the planet. I do not have to tell anyone in this room that more people are working, shopping, interacting, and learning online than ever before \u2013 all because of the work so many of you have done throughout the years to build and strengthen this system.\n\nI hope all of you will read my friend Walter Isaacson\u2019s wonderful new book, The Innovators.  In it, Walter says that collaborative creativity is what drives technological advancement -- and I quote -- that \u201cinnovation comes from teams more often than from the light bulb moments of lone genius.\u201d Walter is absolutely right. Of course, we owe much to those light bulb moments, but innovators are by nature collaborators. That is, no one person alone can turn a cutting-edge discovery into a world changing product or a service without a team. History makes that clear: it is that same collaboration that has enabled the Internet to become what it is today. Facilitated initially by U.S. government investment through DARPA, the Internet as we now know it was built off of one inventive leap on top of another -- And through the amazing genius ranging from Vint Cerf to Bob Kahn to Steve Crocker to Tim Berners Lee to Marc Andreessen to so many others. Their work has given us the most dynamic communications and connective platform that the world has ever seen.\n\nThe Internet indeed improves quality of life for millions and enables people from all over the globe to achieve greater economic opportunity. Without the Internet, a teenager from a remote village in southern India would not have been able to create his own business.  Abin Jose Tom was 19 years old when he was given a school assignment to create a website. Five years later, Abin\u2019s project is now a global web solutions and design company named Webandcrafts, with more than 550 clients worldwide. We live in an era when all an entrepreneur needs to start, build, and promote a business is a mobile device and a Wi-Fi connection. Put simply, the Internet is a fundamental gateway to new growth for developing nations and continued prosperity for developed nations.\n\nThe Internet is also a vital platform for free expression and the exchange of ideas.  And that is why I stand before you today to make this fundamental promise: the United States will protect and preserve a free, vibrant and open Internet.\n\nAt the Department of Commerce, we are proud to call ourselves America\u2019s innovation and data agency. As someone who comes from the private sector and started five companies, I know first-hand the essential role the Internet plays in making sure businesses are able to compete globally. I have the privilege of being President Obama\u2019s point person on entrepreneurship.  In leading our Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship, I get to work with some of America\u2019s most successful CEOs to inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs at home and abroad. In my 15 months as Secretary, I have visited more than 20 countries.  And everywhere we travel\u2014from Ghana to the Philippines\u2014the innovators we meet make clear that the web is a critical tool needed for success. That is why we must all work together to protect the Internet, and to keep it open and free. Our global economy and the young entrepreneurs of the world are counting on us.\nIndeed, the Internet has become a fixture of modern life, not just in the United States and the West, but in big cities, rural villages, and small towns across the globe. Consider the transformations of recent years:\n\nTwenty years ago, there were 16 million Internet users. Today, that number is over 2.5 billion.\n\nIn 2008, roughly 1.5 billion devices were connected to the Internet. Today, there are an estimated 7.5 billion. By 2018, experts predict that figure to exceed 18 billion.\n\nAnd the people largely driving this growth are living in developing countries, where the number of households with Internet access has more than doubled in the past five years.\n\nAll of this means that we are at a critical moment for ICANN and the important work you do. This means that how we govern and use the Internet is of global importance. This means that consensus decisions related to the Internet domain name system made today in Los Angeles can shape lives and livelihoods in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere not just today but long into the future.\n\nAll of us are stakeholders in a strong and vibrant, global Internet. The Internet has thrived precisely because citizens around the world have a voice in how the Internet is governed. That is why we -- the United States government -- support multistakeholder processes. This is our bedrock principle for Internet governance. Let me be clear about this. The United States will not allow the global Internet to be coopted by any person, entity, or nation seeking to substitute their parochial worldview for the collective wisdom of this community \u2013 you, the community of stakeholders represented so well here today.\n\nAs such, that is why six months ago NTIA announced the decision to transition its stewardship role over the Internet Domain Name System to the global multistakeholder communities. From the inception of ICANN in 1998, the United States government envisioned that its role with respect to the IANA functions would be temporary. Over the years, many stakeholders took comfort in the fact that the United States provided some level of stewardship over ICANN. I have been encouraged by the way the global community and ICANN have stepped up to develop the transition proposal. We rally our allies and will continue to build international coalitions to support multistakeholder governance of the Internet. And we are strong supporters of an ICANN that is committed to the idea of individual voices coming to consensus decisions.\n\nWe must all recognize, however, that this was not inevitable, and we should not take it for granted. We all know that multistakeholder governance, and institutions like ICANN, are under intense and unprecedented pressure and scrutiny. Yet we are confident that the multistakeholder model offers the greatest assurance that the Internet will continue to thrive. And we must work together to ensure that the Internet remains an engine for economic growth, innovation, and free expression. We must continue to work hard to sustain multistakeholder governance, because it has enemies who want to reduce Internet governance to a meeting of governmental technocrats promoting narrow national interests.\n\nWe must make clear this approach is the best tool to secure the openness and the vibrancy of the Internet. We must ensure that ICANN can build on its efforts to strengthen the multistakeholder process and can become directly accountable to the customers of the IANA functions and to the broader Internet community.\n\nNext week, at the International Telecommunication Union Conference in Korea, we will see proposals to put governments in charge of Internet governance. You can rest assured that the United States will oppose these efforts at every turn. We know that those interested in government control tend to be countries that censor content and stifle the free flow of information. We will be clear that these steps are contrary to our belief in the value of free speech \u2013 whether on the Internet, in society, in the public sphere \u2013 both here at home and abroad. We will remind all players \u2013 in each instance \u2013 that the multistakeholder model will preserve and protect a strong and resilient Internet.\n\nIn closing, the world is watching ICANN, and some are waiting for us to fail. But we cannot \u2013 and must not \u2013 let that happen. We have to get this transition right. Make no mistake: I stand by ICANN. I am \u201call in\u201d when it comes to the global debate over Internet governance.  And we will preserve and protect a free and open internet. From the birth of the Internet through the present day, this community has stood together on the cutting edge of the drive to extend access to and the reach of the Internet \u2013 a key path for growth and success in the 21st century. And in every forum, the United States will remain a steadfast champion of the Internet, working to ensure that it remains an open platform for economic opportunity, innovation, and free expression.\n\nBut moving forward, all of us need to step up \u2013 like my friend Walter likes to say:We must collaborate to protect and expand the global Internet;We must collaborate to ensure that the Internet continues to flourish;And we must collaborate to guarantee that the Internet remains a gateway to prosperity and free expression the world over.Thank you all for gathering together today and every day to advance our shared vision of a more open, more free, and more accessible Internet.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1500354", "artist_names": "Jimmy Davis & Junction", "full_title": "Kick The Wall by\u00a0Jimmy\u00a0Davis & Junction", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "id": 1500354, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429892210, "path": "/Jimmy-davis-and-junction-kick-the-wall-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Jimmy-davis-and-junction-kick-the-wall-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "song_art_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Kick The Wall", "title_with_featured": "Kick The Wall", "updated_by_human_at": 1479243945, "url": "https://genius.com/Jimmy-davis-and-junction-kick-the-wall-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/388992", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "id": 388992, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Jimmy Davis & Junction", "slug": "Jimmy-davis-and-junction", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Jimmy-davis-and-junction"}, "artist": "Jimmy Davis & Junction", "lyrics": "Kick The Wall LyricsSometimes she's undecided\nSometimes she just don't care\nShe thinks so one sided\nShe thinks looks are fair\nKick the wall\nYou try but can't quit her\nWhat she wants God only knows\nThis love it doesn't fit her\nShe doesn't keep what she outgrows\nKick the wall\nYou dreamed that she loved you\nYou couldn't keep her away\nWhen it seemed that she wanted you\nBut she can't make you stay\n(Kick the wall)\nIf it makes you feel better\nMakes you feel like a man\n(Kick the wall)\nIf you can't get her\nAt least you'll know you can\nKick the wall\nYou're saying all the things that she wants to hear\nAll the things that you thought that would make it clear\nShe's holding out for someone else\nAnd you know that you're still loving by yourself\nYou take it out on her or something else\n(Kick the wall)\nIf it makes you feel better\nMakes you feel like a man\n(Kick the wall)\nYeah, if you can't get her\nAt least you'll know you can\nKick the wall\n(If it makes you feel better)\nMakes you feel like a man\n(Kick the wall)\nYeah;if you can't get her\nAt least you'll know you can\nKick the wall\n(Kick the wall)\nIf it makes you feel better\nMakes you feel like a man\n(Kick the wall)\nYeah, if you can't get her\nAt least you'll know you can\nKick the wall\n(Kick the wall)\nWhoa, it makes you feel better\nMakes you feel like a man\n(Kick the wall)\nYeah; if you can't get her\nAt least you'll know you can\nKick the wallYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/3303183", "artist_names": "Jellybean (Ft.

be, following you (I'll be, I'll be)\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, girl\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, baby, I shake you from now on\nI'm gonna break down your defenses, one by one\nI'm gonna hit you from all sides, lay

explain how this is gonna work\nWhen you hear this sound (Gun Cock)\nThat means I'm about to go in off the top of my head\nEverything else is pre written\nThese verses are all wordplay\nThe tone and the emotions of the lyrics change\nThey progress in the same way as the album does\nThink of all these verses as the cracks between the songs\nIt's extra. I want to recap what's been going on and start to hint for what's to come\nThis is where I, elaborate on what I mean\nYou know, this\u2019ll, this\u2019ll help explain my ideology\nThere's knowledge hidden in here that's gonna make the album click together\nNo Backups, no editing, it\u2019s just gonna be one vocal track ya know?\nI\u2019m gonna keep it nice and simple\nSimple beat\nAnd I'm a real emcee so I don't need a crazy beat to flex\nI just let my lyrics do the talking\nSo uh, how long did I make this beat?\n45 minutes? Yeesh, alright...Let\u2019s go\nVerse 1\nAyo, don't fuck with me\nDon't fuck with N!cky G\nI run rap like track like Steve P\nOoh-wee\nI got the lyrical heat\nThe inferno that burns through your journal (Mos Def)\nI'm out for blood like a Crip\nI'm swashbuckling ships\nPut my roots with my loot like a pirate\nAll my music, Internet pirate-\n-ed\nI'm violent when my mind is dilate\nI spit so much it drips on my own dick\nThe only thing I'm riding is my own dick\nAnd the only thing I write is my own shit\nThat's a shot at ghostwriters and my consciousness\nSo let me tell you what my options is\nI can either be pompous or an optimist\nAnd I can even sell celibates if I was a black market auctionist, the new clients monogamous\nI got this shit like a gastroenterologist\nI like to pop my zits\nAnd be with\nA B.I.G. butt Notorious (bitch!)\nShut up and listen I got more christenings to give\nI'm a monster like the loch ness\nI could ground you up and eat you like sausage\nAnd if you're easily nauseous don't watch this cause\nI'll go straight for your esophagus\nJust playin, I kill \u2018em with kindness\nI'm full of life like metropolis\nYou know I rock this shit\nSwing a sword at it like a Boblikin\nLeave your one legged friend hobbling\nAnd I got lines like red Robins fries, bottomless\nYou might also likeVerse 2\nSometimes I don't believe in myself like I'm heaven sent\nSometimes I don't feel myself, self-celibate\nI could save a million lives and find a way to talk myself out of the relishment\nCause nothings ever good enough for a perfectionist\nI've been too negligent with my intelligence\nI've been a resident inside of being hesitant\nFocused on the irrelevant\nNo longer can that be my precedent\nTime to develop my replenishment\nAnd Let my actions become the evidence\nI got big shoes to fill now\nI grew up and filled out\nBut a lot of my dreams spilled out\nI robbed myself and took the till out\nFeeling like I shot myself in the face\nWith bullet cases\nPut holes in a lot of situations\nBut now I'm trying to raise my innovations\nClimb to the top of the Appalachians\nWhere I can grasp my aspirations\nThat's why I bleed in every rap that I'm making\nEvery beat is yeast, I been baking\nThe lines are the icing to complete the cake\nI had patterns of bulimia so I stuff my face\nI wilted, but I put new flowers in the vase\nWater myself everyday\nSunk in my roots\nOpened my eyes, to obtuse\nMore than right, then left into flight\nGot high I'm off my vocal pipe\nThen ate the ripe fruit\nHappiness is the pursuit\nShoot any dispute\nAin't no problem I can't compute\nAin't no dispute I can't compute\nAnd I'm en route to becoming the progidy\nI\u2019m en route to becoming the progidy\nI\u2019m en route to becoming the prog\u2026prodigy\nI\u2019m en route to becoming to prodigy I was when I was 10\nExcept now I'm a grown man\nI can really do things now I don't have to pretend\nLike I used to in my bed-\nRoom, look at the starts out my window and tell myself \"I'll be there soon\"\nVerse 3\nI started out as whack\nI took the time to fine tune my craft\nFast forward my time lapse\nNow I rhyme tight with no slack, I'm back, I\u2019m back, I\u2019m back, I\u2019m back\nI'm back and you\u2019re addicted to me like smack\nSo INhale my words like crack\nRelax and let your eyes roll back\nI'll align your spine with a tap\nI can see my abs now I sat up, I got a six-pack now\nBut that doesn't add up, my hunger should mean I'm Santa Claus fat now\nAt last I finally found my knack\nI took the bite from the apple on your mac\nAnd regurgitated it back into this rap\nI got more lines than topography maps\nI more obsessed with myself than making sure that you clap\nBut I know you're sitting there in your chair making your head move forward and back\nI molded these rhymes to be harder than a cast\nI reed(read) and breathe more jazz than a sax\nI stick to my pacts I'm truthful like that\nI snack on anything like a pack of rats\nI'll give you a smack if you say you hate blacks\nBut as a matter of fact, I hate black cats\nIf I see one in my path, fuck that I'll take the long way back\nAnd I'm a scholar in college but don't ever say that I'm frat rap\nThat's whack crap about smashing fat racks and raping girls with fat asses\nIF I EVER SAW THAT HAPPEN I WOULD RIP OFF YOUR NUTSACKS\nI kid, but don't give me a reason to create a bloodbath\n\nChorus\nClips, Clips, Clips, Clips\nReload (Gun Cock)\nReload (Gun Cock)\nReload\u2026Shoot\n\nFreestyle 1\n(I see these things, these things that I bring\nThe metal, wood and clay to which I cling\nWhich I think\nWill be what I die from\nSo I might as well enjoy it now so why run?\nI put the world in my lungs\nI think I\u2019ll die young\nAnd spit it to you as the truth from the blunt that I speak\nAnd spit it to you as the truth from the tongue that I speak\nListen to me spit these bars as I\u2019m freestyling)\n\nVerse 4\nThis is a warpath you can track by the bloodbath\nContractions of a muskrat\nJump the fuck back\nI got my palm on my nutsack\nMy other palm\u2019s in the palms that consist of my dub sac, Ha!\nI got a Backwood under my mustache\nI hide my eyes with some sunglass-es\nI copped for free, fuck your logo fashion\nI'm comfortable with who I am, I don't need to be masked in\nI'm back and back in as the captain of these captions\nAn assassin with verb-al actions\nYou, plus your crew, is still a subtraction\nI'm narcissistic I only think about my rations\nMy mind is the abstract rap contraption so fasten\nYour seat belts, this is a wild ride\nResurrection from a mind that died\nGuided back into the life of light\nThen applied with a wide stride of pride\nNever slip or slide\nNever tongue-tied\nI reside in music to confide\nIn my thoughts ideas and fears\nI'm in gear and I\u2019m not looking at the rear view mirror\nI found my career\nIt appeared at a severe time of fear\nI engineered it to be premier\nAnd Now I see with my ears\nAnd I'm in the clear of the frontier\nFight or flight?\nStress me I might take your life\nSmite ya with the height of what I cite\nTake a bite\nI'm a knight of the night\nI dwell in the moonlight when the ghouls have goon fights\nI'm outright polite face to face\nBut when I write, I might just put you in your place\nI got the sleight of hand, point and case\nI work real hard every day's a rat race\n\nVerse 5\nI'm about to inject you with the verbal slime\nThe vegetables of rhyme\nNutrition for your mind\nPoke your nerves in your spine\nEmcees be all over the place with their rhymes\nWhile mine remain defined\nGlued to perfection\nI kiss the mic with affection\nMy mind is taking time for some stretching\nBending galaxies into my verbal collection\nMy ethics remain the most pristine\nYou don\u2019t know half the shit I've seen\nDrugs, violence and money ain't my scene, that shits obscene\nFailure is not in my genome\nI eat rappers like amino\nAcid I spit, I'm sick make you need chemo\nI got the heart of a king, I'm casino\nI keep my profile on the d low\nThat way if I need to snap a neck, I can creep slow\nI'm quiet but alert like Cappuccino\nFor every rhyme you have, I got a kilo\nI torpedo my ego of being half Latino with rhymes that are jalape\u00f1o\nA mean flow, like a lunch money\nBully\nI got leverage like a pulley\nPull your body in the gully\nThen assassinate ya subtly\nFire rhymes, I\u2019ll boil your blood till its bubbly\nI must boil your blood because I can't leave evidence\nI can't have a conscious that is decadence\nI'm perfecting the elements\nSo I can raise a hell-ish genesis\nInject ya membranous tissues\nWith my sentences\nYour brain is my new residence\nSo prepare for ideas of excellence and long nights of restlessness\nI'm reckless, I'll erode your skeletal with tetanus\nSpit the most venomous\nLeave you stranded in a nebulous\nUnless you're in for my best interest\nI'll show you benevolence\nFly us away on a Pegasus\nLet you benefit from my intelligence\nMy rhymes are the perception of medicine that is perfection\nKnown to cure cancer, bulimia and depression\nThat last one is a self-tested assessment\n\nVerse 6\nI'm back with a bad habit of being a rabbit and too hop to be toe tag-ged\nI'll incinerate you if you discriminately use the term faggot\nBury your skeleton inside of the slime of the maggots\nThat's the way its gotsta happen if you're a foul mouth bastard who thinks backwards you capsize slacker\nStep into my rapture\nThis is chapter, one\nIt's do this or do a backwards gun\nThat last one rhymed with try\nYou imbecile child step into my trial\nLet's see if you follow the crevices or smile\nLet's see if you can decipher my rhyme style\nIt's gold wealth, disguised in stealth\nSubliminal messages that tend to melt\nYour brain it's actually not good for you health\nSo maybe you shouldn't listen to me\nMaybe you should just do your own thing\nBut just know I have a swarm of bees ready to sting\nEmerging, from underneath my lunula fing-ertips\nTalk ya shit, I ain't allergic\nIn fact I'll probably learn it\nChurn it, inside of the pot\nStir it\nTake the recipe and burn it\nThen emerge it\n2.0 the newer version\nAnd now everybody's drinking my syrup\nI'm the best in the west let's not get into a stirrup\nFrom CA through Oregon, Washington to Alberta\n\nChorus\n\nFreestyle 2\n(You wanna hear some words?\nI don't give a fuck about a verb, or a noun, I'm profound\nSniffing out pounds of herb like a hound\nI'm always at work\nSpinning pizzas picture perfect round\nI got a low-key sound and I'm bound\nTo have a Loki crown that's golden brown\nPretty girls pucker like a goldfish mouth\nI\u2019m about to get a sucker on me down south\nI'm losing my marbles like change in the couch\nI guess my mindset is my new allowance)\n\nVerse 7\nI elope, in these dark thoughts of a man\nReaching for the ends to which they span\nI'm creeping on myself I just need the white van\nWeighing actions vs. consequences by the gram\nI've been blowing myself up like \u201842 japan\nI'm the number one rank in any clan\nAnd I'm just speaking frank, Anne\nAnd I\u2019m walking on the plank of the shark tank\nMy boat already sank so I'd better start to thank\nOil the gears as they crank, swivel the gun on the tank\nAnd I'm the dope boy and this here is dank\nEvery song has a ploy, I come out with a shank\nThis ain't a toy, this the gun of a tank\nThis ain't a coin, this is the whole bank\nI'm the dope boy, my product is dank\n\nVerse 8\nI\u2019ll hydrate ya like hydrocortisone\nI'm in my zone I\u2019ve already flown\nMigrated to Oregon\nMy heads a mess I need a comb\nMiss my family kiss \u2018em on the phone\nI'm up and coming\nI'm all up and grown\nI\u2019m tryna compare myself to the legend of Davy Jones\nI'm in construction watch out for my orange cones\nAnd I'm known for drinking milk so I'm not prone to broken bones\nSo come at me with your full blown\nAnd problems about the O-zone\n\nVerse 9\nI came out, I came out\nI came out, I came out\nAnd when my mother came around\nShe said \"I hate your sound\"\nI thought \"Fuck you talking bout now?\"\nShe said \"You're not brown, you didn't grow up downtown, sometimes I think you do these things just to see me frown\"\nI thought \"Fuck off, can't knock me down\"\nI'm not in this for a crown, I'm in this only for the sound\nWho needs to care whether I'm black white or brown?\nIt's only what I say and convey that counts\nI was in the pound, impounded, who let the dogs out?\nI may have been lost but I came back found\nWith a new collar and a shiny name tag on\nA whole new lawn of grass to aim and pee on\nEat sleep and play with repeat on\nBarking at the mailman to be gone\nCause I don't trust the government\nIt seems like they're crooked and crumbling\nI wanna make my paycheck and not funnel it\nBack into paths where I just run a bit\nPeople need structure but government feels fluctuated\nEasily hated, but I think we'd hate it if we didn't make it\nAnd if we didn't have laws we would all have died 100 years ago all too faded, it's undebated\nHuman nature is more destructive than creative\nThat's why you should praise me for being patient\nI got a relation-\n-ship with God\nAnd he says \"Dog\nIt's all backwards, our spots\nResponsibility in you, in knocks\nYou're the new boss, take it out for a shot.\"\nI'm shocked, for a second my heart stopped and my stomach dropped...\nMe and God just flopped...\nSo the first thing I\u2019mma do is smash the crown with a rock\nBurn the throne, no more idols to mock\nMy idea of leadership is like Spock\nRid of emotion and respect the cock (Atmosphere)\nEat, sleep and fuck is what we got\nTake it back to the basics of the block\nI need your help so give me your hand\nThere's a revolution out there for us to understand\nAll of us create it, there's no plan\nShits been spinning the same like a fan\nLet stand, and create a template to end all of what we debate\nThis is a race, keep your pace\n\nChorus\n\nFreestyle 3\n(It courses through my brain\nIt-it-it-it\u2019s

roll a Backwood on my lips\nAnd smoke till my lungs hiccup\nSmart girls are the one\u2019s that gets my dick up)\n\nVerse 27\nHip-hop never died, I just woke her up with a kiss\nLashes exposed her eyes, they told me she loved her Nick\nSlipped in with my dick, now I'm addicted to it\nAll it is, is finding new ways to lick the clit while I spit\nNew ways to express the messages I give\nShe indulges my bliss, told me \u201cDon\u2019t stop, don't quit\nI want you to give me every last inch\u201d\nIn the morning I don't split because I found my niche\nShe's holding a crown and I'm the fresh young prince\nI won't call her a bitch, she's too precious to hit\nEven is she's got blood, I'll go down like a Crip\n\nVerse 28\nI be puff-puff passing on the medical\nBut passing over edibles\nI'm incredibly credible\nMy knowledge goes deep as if I got several\nMinds inside my cranium\nIf Big Bills is closed then I'm gonna be breaking in\nI\u2019m about to eat balls cheesed to perfection\nAnd slices known to give saliva erections\nI'm just messin\u2019 but I remain sincere with my adolescence\nI ran 5 miles today gasping for breath and\nEveryday I eat Oatmeal for breakfast\nI'm trying to grow a mustache\nBut it's hard when I still act like a rug rat\nIt feels great in Colorado to have the sun back\nI'm chasing nirvana like I run track\nYanni rolling backwoods\nSmoke don't make me rap good\nTime slows so much it goes backwards\nIt's the fountain of youth and that's word\nBackwoods of fat herbs\nAnd slaphappy rap masters\nThe rock I'm on makes my ass hurt\nStomach rumbling makes me want to go to the crapper\nOh wait I'm on the beat though\nSit and think about that one for a minute\nI\u2019m aiming for big game shoot and skin it\nHang the antlers to remind myself I\u2019m driven\nAnd I want to be livid in Bolivia\nAnd flip all of our media\nJ.K. Rowling in the deep\nHarry potter nerd but Adele puts me to sleep\nMe and death been known to meet\nAm I lucky or too grim to creep?\nPiling my dreams into a heap\nThen repeat through my speech\n\nVerse 29\nI used to dream about the day that I would die\nBut now I can't stop eating it up like pie\nI got a sweet tooth for equality and love\nAnd if you're full of hate I won't share my drugs\nAddicted to lick the sweat on my upper lip\nNever will I slip when I\u2019m passionate\nI've always been too cocky of myself\nI held up my ego like a belt\nI've had days I felt like my heart could melt\nAnd others where all I did was puff top shelf\nI can break your focus\nTrick you with hocus-pocus\nBullshit ya with no bogus\nLeave your Solo shot Hope-less\nI see more stem and flower than florists\nI'm the hour of power with a flow so enormous\nTalk is cheap just show me where the smoke is\nWithin the universe we're all just tourists\nI eat chips and churros at Torres\nI got the horns of a Taurus and\nI drank the potent potion of emotion in motion\nNow I'm feeling like my soul was stolen\n\nVerse 30\nI don't have a DJ, it's just me\nI also don't have a free day because I'm also an emcee\nI hear these kids rapping about how drake got a Wusa\nBut what's even cooler is I can play 12 scales on a tuba\nI wanna hear a jazz diss track\nThe battle of back-to-back saxes\nBass lines with more scales than basses\nAttacking guitar axes\nPiano strings springing like a mattress\nImprovised not practiced\nThat\u2019s why my rhymes are going down as a classic\n\nChorus\n\nFreestyle 9\n(Practice today makes the perfect practice tomorrow\nLessons on loan I'm living lavish on borrow\nAll I know is I'm living Jack-ish like Sporrow, Sparrow\nDid you catch that? most don't listen\u2026\nRobert's in raves and rancers of dancers\nMore wrong that right? Schrute Dwight\nAnd mama Mary made mad marvelous muffins making Martha managing maniacs maybe moping mopeing mild Mark missing memories, her enemy...\nHaha, what the fuck did that even mean?\nI don\u2019t know, but it sounded heavenly\nShow me someone better than me\nUh, I just smoked a Backwood, I didn\u2019t even get that high\nI got buzzed as fuck though, that Back-tobacco dry, haha\nAnd I'm back in the woods rolling backwoods that are that good\nI'm a slaphappy rap master\nMy favorite sound is the sound of laughter\nI do unseen good deeds like I'm Casper\nI've touched more lives than a badass pastor\nI'm shutting on this beat I treat it like the crapper\nI know too many lines to be a bad actor\nI'm so much more than just a rapper\nListen to my whole album then tell me why after\nAnd I'm just breaking the ice, this cypher\u2019s just the fracture)\n\nOutro\nHaha, Yeah!\nGoddamn that was good\nNot bad for uh, eight takes?\nYeah, yeah, yeah, eight takes\nWho cares man? I\u2019m high right now\n(Eight\u2019s my lucky number motherfucker\nLike Chris Tucker, and Jackie Chan I be kicking it\nI\u2019m getting more livid in\nSplitting these dividends\nTo everyone that be living in)\nAyy, alright\nIt\u2019s like, oh shit, it\u2019s 3:40 in the morning right now\nUm, my computers\u2019 got like eight percent battery left\nYeah, it\u2019s time to call this quits man\nBut uh, I still got half an album left\nI\u2019ll see you on the other side of the moon, Disc 2\nThis is fun but I gotta go to bed man\nAh fuck it who am I kidding? (I\u2019m not going to bed\nI\u2019m about to, I\u2019m about to go home and uh\nYa know just kick more rhymes out my head\nSmoke a little dope till my eyes red\nGo to another planet where I can pretend)\nHaha, alright I\u2019m outta here\nI got motherfucking Clips! Clips!\n(Give me a beat, I\u2019ll shoot and reload\nAnytime, I\u2019ll hit the three-point like a free throw\nYo you see me on the street, give me a word!\nYa know I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m making these freestyles with a cheat code)\nHaha, alright for real\nThird time\u2019s the charm\nG out, I\u2019ll see your motherfuckers after the interlude\nI got Clips!Embed"}, {"_type":

stop the fire burnin'\nYou got a ticket to take me all the way\nWeatherman says it's gonna get hot tonight\nThere's a fever in the air that I can't control\nNow I'm gonna be a fool for love\nBut I think it's all right\nAnd I never wanna let this feeling go\nWeatherman says it's gonna get hot tonight\nAnd I'm gonna fill this burnin' desire\nAnd I'm gonna get lost in love\n'Cause I feel so right\nBaby, I'll raise this flame into a fire\nLost my vision trying to read the writing on the wall\nCaught in fatal fascination\nHeading for a fall\nSweet shining summer angel came to my rescue\nShook off all that old suspicion\nFound a dream come true\n(Repeat chorus)You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/790050", "artist_names":

"Don\u2019t Give Up Lyrics[Verse 1: Peter Gabriel]\nIn this proud land we grew up strong\nWe were wanted all along\nI was taught to fight, taught to win\nI never thought I could fail\nNo fight left or so it seems\nI am a man whose dreams have all deserted\nI've changed my face, I've changed my name\nBut no one wants you when you lose\n\n[Chorus: Kate Bush]\nDon't give up 'cause you have friends\nDon't give up, you're not beaten yet\nDon't give up, I know you can make it good\n[Verse 2: Peter Gabriel]\nThough I saw it all around\nNever thought that I could be affected\nThought that we'd be last to go\nIt is so strange the way things turn\nDrove the night toward my home\nThe place that I was born, on the lakeside\nAs daylight broke, I saw the earth\nThe trees had burned down to the ground\n\n[Chorus: Kate Bush]\nDon't give up, you still have us\nDon't give up, we don't need much of anything\nDon't give up, 'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong\n\n[Bridge: Kate Bush & Peter Gabriel]\nRest your head, you worry too much\nIt's going to be alright\nWhen times get rough, you can fall back on us\nDon't give up, please don't give up\nGot to walk out of here, I can't take any more\nGonna stand on that bridge, keep my eyes down below\nWhatever may come and whatever may go\nThat river's flowing, that river's flowing\n\n[Verse 3: Peter Gabriel]\nMoved on to another town\nTried hard to settle down\nFor every job, so many men\nSo many men no-one needs\nYou might also like[Chorus: Kate Bush]\nDon't give up 'cause you have friends\nDon't give up, you're not the only one\nDon't give up, no reason to be ashamed\nDon't give up, you still have us\nDon't give up now, we're proud of who you are\nDon't give up, you know it's never been easy\nDon't give up 'cause I believe there's a place\nThere's a place where we belong\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Outro: Peter Gabriel & Kate Bush]\nDon't give up, don't give up, don't give up\nDon't give up, don't give up, don't give up\nDon't give up, don't give up, don't give up\nDon't give up, don't give up, don't give up\nDon't give up, don't give up, don't give up2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

so lost and lonely\nIt must come from somewhere deep inside of us\nAnd the operator says:\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Alison Moyet, Maria McKee & Annie Lennox]\n\"All is calm an' all is quiet\nClose your eyes an' sleep tonight\"\n[Chorus: Bob Geldof, Alison Moyet, Maria McKee & Annie Lennox]\nThis is the world calling (All is calm an' all is quiet)\nThis is Earth (Close your eyes an' sleep tonight)\nThis is the world calling (All is calm an' all is quiet)\nThis is us (Close your eyes an' sleep tonight)\n\n[Verse 2: Bob Geldof]\nI'm on a train now\nI'm moving through the yellow fields of rape\nThere's so much beauty\nI wished that I believed enough to pray\nThen the operator replied:\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Alison Moyet, Maria McKee & Annie Lennox]\n\"Spinning 'round, you're wrapped in blue\nThere's no one looks as good as you\"\n\n[Chorus: Bob Geldof, Alison Moyet, Maria McKee & Annie Lennox]\nThis is the world calling (Spinning 'round, you're wrapped in blue)\nThis is us (There's no one looks as good

singer]\nDeep in the graveyard, the poppies blow\nAll the crosses, row and row\nThey are the dead short days ago\nThey live, felt dawn, saw sunset glow\n[Warcloud]\nDon't crowd me, like olive, silk and cotton, tobacco, cake and wine\nMy gats will break your spine, Casanova/Frankenstein type rhyme\nOf central nature, flier raps then box kites\nEntire raps that rock mics\nLike a blue stoplight, 'Buffalo Soldier' vulture\nSmack a wine opener then approach a prospector mulcher\nRage sugar snap peas, gun pop cans with ease\nTin can telephones exploring the razor war zone\nFrom cryptic corridor thrones, beat your shovels or swords\nBeat your swords into shovels\nI chuckle with a couple of foolish kids\nRegion of a body of water that is not reached by sunlight\nMusic escapada with one mic\nRadios and Knick-Knacks, nostra Roby\nLike a love story, quite likely erodes inside me\nSaint John wrote the 'Book of Revelation' in the ____ Islands\nLittle kids smiling, climb off from Taiwan\nHe snatched a mother, guard his purse like heroes\nStone gat, the Hospitallers making Clearose, you _____\nYour so ferocious, dope-ish lyrics like Warcloud, fuck look\nGut your brain relish with a duck hook\nGo in there, construct book, 9 milli's, Perilly\nThat's how the wind write, next right, Mexican windpipe\nTilt my hat brim like, blow you off\nSterling gat, vital collateral force\nStone cross, broke your fucking corpse\nChump ass boys, you better learn how to handle mics\nMiniskirt model spasm my cocker spaniel twice\nToo many guns, too many guns\nThis is the face breaker caper\nYou might also likeChorus\n\n[Juleunique]\nYo, I move like Maximus, across Roman land\nWith plans of revenge to avenge his dead fam'\nThe war warrior, moving in galactic like solar works\nI blast off nuclear missiles 'til my shoulder hurts\nFlaming bow and arrow, pierce you then it sparks you\nFor those that spit flame, I fight fire with fire\nWild like Brownsville, cocktail to blow your cartel\nPierce you with a dart, it's sharp so it'll spark well\nMy head swell from infinite thoughts that I develop\nGeppetto/Stromboli stash jewels 'cause 'Cash Rules'\nRead books like Matthew's, shatter like glass statues\nGet hit with ballistic missiles after you're gunning\nChopped the head of your men and the horse was still running\nChopped the head of your man and the horse was still running\nIn the graveyard\n\nChorus x2\n\n[Warcloud]\nAdditional reporting the city of a million voices\nThe echoes died in the vast bloody expanse\nI'll lead the Great Chiefs to many harvests of victories\nThroughout generations dark apocalypse to your populous\nGrab your binoculars, axes hit you like oxygen\nSeven digit locks and them Chiefs straight from the boxing gym\nLeaving missing chunks from heads, of course though\nHeavy hatchet capable of piercing a human torso\nRearrangement, your God sheltered the injured\nCandy in them bitches like whirl the fuck, the pearl is stuck\nFish roses, native with suit intelligence\nDark brain water, outstanding, scattered, irrelevant\nNew modern development, black gold and red roses\nWeasel bats, squeeze all gats at you evil

circle around the 'Dark Side of the Moon'\n[Juleunique]\nThought flow like a nautical, cold like Antarctica\nHot like Veronica, smooth like a harmonica\nStep in and I'll conquer your, boy you can't come to this\nI draw a line and dare your to step in my circumference\nGradually you suffer a MechWarrior's casualty\nTragedy, Geppetto Stromboli roaming the galaxy\nFrom all degrees I blow your set,

Roommates Wanted sign on the noticeboard.\u2005She\u2005wants non-smoking non-Bush-supporters\u2005with no pets.\n\nMeredith VO: (to city\u2005montage and Izzie/George/Cristina arriving) It's all about lines. The finish line at the end of residency, waiting in line for a chance at the operating table, and then, there's the most important line. The line separating you from the people you work with. It doesn't help to get too familiar. To make friends. You need boundaries between you and the rest of the world. Other people are far too messy. It's all about lines. Drawing lines in the sand, and praying like hell no one crosses them.\n\nWe see Meredith talking to a blonde woman, another intern.\n\nMeredith: Look, I'm sure you're very nice, but I've very particular about who lives in my house and you're just not right.\n\nBlonde: Why? Look, I'm quiet, no loud music, no parties.\n\nMeredith: Where were you when the Challenger exploded?\nBlonde: The what?\n\nMeredith: The space shuttle. Challenger.\n\nBlonde: Uhh, I think I was in kindergarten.\n\nMeredith: Exactly. No.\n\nCut to Izzie, Meredith and George in a corridor.\n\nIzzie: Why do you put up posters for roommates if you don't want roommates?\n\nMeredith: I do want roommates, we're together a hundred hours a week, you want to live together too?\n\nCristina: No. Ooh, you're bringing bribes now? (Meredith has coffee for Bailey)\n\nGeorge: I need a place to live. My mom irons my scrubs. I have to get out of there.\n\nMeredith: It's not a bribe, I don't think it's a good idea.\n\nGeorge: But I can put down last, first and deposit.\n\nCristina: It's totally a bribe.\n\nIzzie: I can cook. And I'm an obsessive cleaner.\nMeredith: No. I just want two total strangers who I don't have to talk to, or be nice to, and it's not a bribe, it's a mocha latte.\n\nBailey: George, you're running the code team, Meredith, take the trauma patients, Cristina, deliver the weekend labs to the patients, Izzie, you're on sutures.\n\nMeredith: Dr Bailey. I was hoping to assist you in the OR today, maybe do a minor procedure? I think I'm ready. Mocha latte?\n\nCristina: If she gets to cut, I want to cut too.\n\nIzzie: Yeah, me too.\n\nGeorge: I wouldn't mind another shot, I mean if everybody else is...\n\nBailey: Stop talking. Every intern wants to perform their first surgery, that's not your job. Do you know what your job is? To make your resident happy. Do I look happy? No. Why? Because my interns are whining. You know what will make me look happy? Having the code team staffed, having the trauma patients answered, having the weekend labs delivered, and having someone down in the Pit, doing the sutures. (takes the mocha latte) No one holds a scalpel until I'm so happy I'm Mary freakin' Poppins.\n\nCristina: Mocha latte my ass.\n\nBailey: Why're y'all standing there? Move!\n\nThey move. Meredith moves to the elevator, where Dr. Shepherd is waiting.\n\nDerek: Seattle has ferry boats.\n\nMeredith: Yes.\n\nDerek: I didn't know that. I've been living here six weeks, I didn't know there were ferry boats.\nMeredith: Seattle is surrounded by water on three sides.\n\nDerek: Hence the ferry boats. (elevator arrives) Now I have to like it here. I wasn't planning on liking it here. I'm from New York. Genetically engineered to dislike everywhere, except Manhattan. I have a thing for ferry boats. (they're in the elevator alone)\n\nMeredith: I'm not going out with you.\n\nDerek: Did I ask you to go out with me? (pause) Do you want to go out with me?\n\nMeredith: I'm not dating you. And I'm definitely not sleeping with you again. You're my boss.\n\nDerek: I'm your boss's boss.\n\nMeredith: You're my teacher. And my teacher's teacher. And you're my teacher.\n\nDerek: I'm your sister, I'm your daughter.\n\nMeredith: You're sexually harassing me.\n\nDerek: I'm riding an elevator.\n\nMeredith: Look, I'm drawing a line. The line is drawn. There's a big line.\n\nDerek: So, this line. Is it imaginary, or do I need to get you a marker?\n\nMeredith stares at him for a second, drops her folders and kisses him. He's just a tad surprised but catches on pretty fast, until the elevator doors ding and Meredith quickly crouches to pick up her folders and leave. Derek stands there looking bemused.\n\nDerek: We'll talk later?\n\nCut to Meredith walking.\n\nNurse: You the surgeon?\n\nMeredith: Yes.\n\nNurse: We've got a rape victim. You better get in there.\n\nNurse 2: 21-year-old female found down at the park, status: post-trauma, she came in with a GCS of 6, BP 80 over 60, head trauma, unequal breath sounds, right pupil is dilated, and she's ready for x-ray. You ready to roll?\n\nMeredith has seen the girl's shoes, which are identical to the ones she wore to work.\n\nNurse 2: Hey!\n\nMeredith: Yeah. Call it in to clear CT, let them know I'm coming, load up the portable monitor, call respiratory for a ventilator, I'll get x-rays while I'm down there.\n\nCut to the rape victim's surgery.\n\nDerek: She's going to spend a hell of a lot of time in recovery and rehab.\n\nBurke: If she survives.\n\nDerek: What is she, like, 5'2, a hundred pounds, she's still breathing after what this guy did to her? If they catch the guy, they should castrate him.\n\nBurke: See how sh1t her hands are? She tried to fight back.\n\nDerek: Tried to? Rape kit came back negative. She kicked his ass.\n\nBurke: So, we have a warrior among us, huh?\n\nMeredith: Alison. Her - her name is Alison.\n\nDerek: Alison.\n\nBurke: I think I may have found the cause of our rupture. (pulls out a piece of flesh) What is this? Does anyone know what this is? (he isn't testing)\n\nMeredith: Oh my god.\n\nBurke: What? Spit it out, Grey.\n\nMeredith: She bit it off.\n\nBurke: Bit off what? (other people echo him)\n\nMeredith: That's his...his pen1s. (shocked groans) She bit off his pen1s.\n\nBurke can't get it into the tray fast enough.\n\nOpening sequence. Burke and Shepherd wash up after the surgery.\n\nBurke: If she can fight off the infection she'll be fine.\n\nDerek: That's all dependant on whether she wakes up in the next 72 hours.\n\nBurke: You know, we should get a drink later. You can tell me the long story of what makes a hot-shot doc leave the Big Apple for Seattle.\n\nDerek: It's a short story actually. Your chief of surgery (Webber) made me an offer I couldn't refuse.\n\nBurke: Richard asked you to come?\n\nDerek: Yeah. Why?\n\nBurke: Oh, nothing.\n\nDerek: See you later.\n\nCut to Cristina and George:\n\nGeorge: Do you know what the code team does? Saves lives. I shock a heart and someone lives to see another day. It's upbeat. It's glass half full.\n\nCristina: Bambi, don't say another word until after the hunter shoots your mother.\n\nGeorge: I don't like you.\n\nCristina: Well, I have a B.A. from Smith, a Ph. D from Berkeley, and an MD from Stanford and I'm delivering lab results. It's going to take me all day to get through these. It's going to take me all day to get through these.\n\nBailey: Then get started.\n\nCristina: Oh, uh, I wasn't complaining. I-I don't -\n\nBailey: This intern was reassigned, so he's mine, now (it's Alex). Have him shadow you for the day. You show him how I do things.\n\nAlex: Alex Karev, nice to meet you.\n\nCristina: The prig who called Meredith a nurse, yeah. I hate you on principle.\n\nAlex: And you're the pushy overbearing kiss-ass, I, uh, I hate you too.\n\nCristina: Oh, should be fun then.\n\nGeorge's pager beeps. Cut to George running along a corridor followed by the code team. They enter a patient's room to beeping.\n\nGeorge: Okay, I'm George O'Malley, I'll be running this code. What've we got?\n\nNurse: We've got a 57-year-old male, he's asystolic. Charge them to 200, please.\n\nNurse 2: Clear.\n\nCut to Izzie and an Asian woman.\n\nIzzie: All right, Mrs. Lu, I'm Dr. Stevens, I'm going to sew up your wound, and you're going to need...yeah, about six stitches. Are you allergic to any medication?\n\nMrs Lu says something in Mandarin.\n\nIzzie: Oh, I'm sorry, I don't - I don't, um...do you speak English?\n\nMrs Lu continues to speak in her language.\n\nIzzie: I'll find, um...(to everyone in the room) does anybody here speak Chinese? (no response).\n\nCut to Meredith carrying a small esky. She knocks at the chief's office, an older woman is in there.\n\nMeredith: Hi, is the chief in?\n\nWoman: He's on his way. Is that it?\n\nMeredith: Yeah.\n\nWoman: Can I see it? (Meredith looks down at the box and up again) No, forget I asked.\n\nWebber: (entering) Meredith, it's good to see you. Hey, I heard your mother was leaving mail? She going back with the U.N.?\n\nMeredith: She's, ah, taking time off.\n\nWebber: To write another book, I suppose.\n\nMeredith nods.\n\nMeredith: Listen, so they said to bring this to you, so...?\n\nWebber: Yes, for the police.\n\nMeredith: Right.\n\nWebber: When did the police say they'll come?\n\nWoman: You know how slow they are. So, she'd better take it with her.\n\nMeredith: What?\n\nWoman: You have to take it with you.\n\nWebber: Chain of custody rules. All medical matter and array must stay with the person who collected it, until it's placed in police custody.\n\nWoman: You collected the specimen, so you have custody.\n\nMeredith: Custody of a pen1s.\n\nWebber: Yes. Until the cops come for it.\n\nMeredith: Okay. Well, what am I supposed to do with the pen1s?\n\nWebber has no answer.\n\nCut to Cristina and Alex giving lab results to a family.\n\nCristina: You have a disorder called multinucleate cell angiohistiocytomum. It's not a cancerous sarcoma, it's very rare but minor. You'll be discharged today, okay?\n\nPatient: I don't need a surgery?\n\nCristina: No.\n\nPatient: I - I'm not going to die, I'm fine?\n\nCristina: Fit as a fiddle, or whatever.\n\nThe family laugh with relief. One kisses and hugs Cristina. She's about as thrilled as you might expect and looks at Alex, who is smiling at her.\n\nCut to Meredith placing her esky on a desk where George is working.\n\nGeorge: What's that?\n\nMeredith: Don't ask, you don't want to know.\n\nGeorge: I do want to know. Really.\n\nMeredith: You really want to know? (he nods) It's a severed pen1s.\n\nGeorge: Oookay. I didn't really want to know.\n\nCristina: I don't know why I have to be the one who gets hugged.\n\nAlex: Because. I don't do that. Besides, you're the ovarian sister here.\n\nCristina: Did you just call me an ovarian si- an ovarian - since when has the possession of ovaries become an insult?\n\nGeorge: Meredith's carrying a pen1s around in a jar.\n\nCristina: Oh, from the rape surgery? (goes to look)\n\nMeredith: Yeah, and it's not a jar, it's a cooler.\n\nCristina: Talk about taking a bite out of crime (leaves)\n\nGeorge: (to Meredith) You okay?\n\nMeredith: Yeah...Alison's shoes. The rape victim, Alison, her shoes. I have the same ones. In my locker. And I normally never wear them, because they're not comfortable, but today I did, and she was wearing the same shoes, and it's just...stupid, and I'm tired, and forget it.\n\nGeorge: You know what you need? (they stare at each other)\n\nMeredith: No. It's sick and twisted. We said last time was the last time. (George looks away). You've been doing it without me?\n\nGeorge: Nancy Reagan lied. You can't just say no. Come on.\n\nMeredith: Do you know what would happen if anyone knew?\n\nGeorge: I'm doing it. You can come with me...or you can stay here, and be miserable.\n\nCut to a baby waking up, and then others. It's a nursery, George and Meredith are outside. George does baby talk.\n\nMeredith: You are such a woman.\n\nGeorge's pager beeps.\n\nGeorge: It's a code. I gotta go.\n\nMeredith watches them and sighs.\n\nMeredith: You are really cute.\n\nWe focus on one baby. Meredith's worried. A close-up shows his face is going blue. Fadeout. Now Meredith's in there, checking him with a stethoscope. He looks okay now. Another intern walks in.\n\nOther intern: What are you doing in here?\n\nMeredith: There were no tests ordered. And the baby has a murmur.\n\nIntern: I know.\n\nMeredith: He turned blue.\n\nIntern: You're surgery, you're not authorised to be in here. Do you know how much trouble you can get into for this?\n\nMeredith: Are you going to do any tests?\n\nIntern: It's a benign systolic ejection murmur. It goes away with age.\n\nMeredith: So you're not going to do any tests.\n\nIntern: He's not your patient, he's not even on your service.\n\nMeredith: Are you sure it's benign?\n\nIntern: I'm a doctor too, you know. You should get out of here.\n\nMeredith gets her pen1s and goes. Cut to Izzie and the Chinese woman.\n\nCristina: You get a good case?\n\nIzzie: No, her. She won't let me sew her up. (Chinese woman speaks again) I wouldn't have called you, but I can't get hold of the translator. Can you just ask her what's wrong?\n\nCristina looks to the woman and back to Izzie.\n\nCristina: No.\n\nIzzie: Why not?\n\nCristina: Because I grew up in Beverley Hills. The only Chinese I know is from a Mr. Chou's menu. Besides, I'm Korean. (leaves)\n\nChinese woman sighs. Cut to Webber running into Burke.\n\nBurke: Chief! So you asked Shepherd to come to Grace.\n\nWebber: He's an old student of mine.\n\nBurke: Oh. He left a private practice because you asked.\n\nWebber: Yes.\n\nBurke: No other reason? Just a favour for an old professor.\n\nWebber: It'll be years before I retire.\n\nBurke: Chief of Surgery is mine. Chief of Surgery is mine.\n\nWebber: It was yours, now I'm not so sure.\n\nBurke: I am the best surgeon at Grace with the lowest mortality rate, you can't just bring some guy in from -\n\nWebber: Now ask me why I'm not so sure about you. Ask me why.\n\nBurke stalks off.\n\nCut to Cristina and Alex.\n\nCristina: Don't people get sick anymore?\n\nAlex: I mean, how are we supposed to get any OR time if everyone's gonna just live?\n\nCristina: Look, I'll take ten, and you take ten. Get in, get out. No smiling, no hugging, no letting them cry, just be quick about it.\n\nAlex: You're the one that's slow.\n\nCristina: I am not the one that's slow. You are slow.\n\nAlex: You wanna bet?\n\nCristina: Yeah, you're on.\n\nCut to Cristina and Alex rushing through the results (separate cases).\n\nCristina: A comprehensive workup -\n\nAlex: - did not reveal any vascular abnormalities.\n\nCristina: Your Doppler was negative,\n\nAlex: for deep venous thrombosis, so there's no need for chronic anti-\n\nCristina: coagulation, or an IBC filter.\n\nAlex: Your biopsy was however positive for -\n\nCristina: a mixed anaerobics -\n\nAlex: non group A streptococcie infection.\n\nCristina: Your BEO and encriatan elevations had us worried -\n\nAlex: about rapidly progressive phlameleonephritis -\n\nCristina: Which could've seen you with an autoimmune disease.\n\nPatient: What does that mean?\n\nCristina: We're not going to amputate your leg.\n\nAlex: You get to keep your kidneys.\n\nCristina: Congratulations (is hugged). You can go home today (hugged by another patient).\n\nAlex: Yeah, yeah. Congratulations. Whatever. (beats a hasty retreat, then we see him backing away from a patient with arms outstretched like a zombie, then he ducks under another patient's arms, who hugs his wife instead while Alex runs for it).\n\nCristina: (in different instances) Congratulations. There's nothing wrong with you. You're gonna be fine. Congratulations.\n\nCut to George running with the code team.\n\nCut to Meredith talking to a bunch of interns.\n\nMeredith: What's your favourite 80s group?\n\nIntern 1: Queen.\n\nMeredith: No.\n\nIntern 2: Twist Your Sister.\n\nMeredith groans and gets up to leave.\n\nIntern 2: It's not like there's a right or wrong answer to that question!\n\nMeredith: (leaving) The Go-Gos, Duran Duran, Eurythmics...\n\nCut to Alex and Cristina rushing around.\n\nAlex: Have a nice day.\n\nCristina: You can go home today.\n\nCut to George running around with the code team, then George standing at the end of a bed, looking unhappy. Beeping noise.\n\nGeorge: Time of death, 15:45.\n\nCut to Meredith looking at the rape victim. Derek comes over.\n\nDerek: Meredith. I've called every hospital in the county. Sooner or later, the guy that did this is going to seek medical attention, and when he does, that pen1s you're carrying around is going to nail him.\n\nMeredith: Where is her family?\n\nDerek: Doesn't have any.\n\nMeredith: No siblings?\n\nDerek: No. Both parents are dead. She just moved to Seattle three weeks ago. Welcome to the city. Meredith, you okay?\n\nMeredith: Yeah. I'm fine, I just...have to do something. I have to go.\n\nDerek: Right. I'm going to sit with her.\n\nCut to Meredith chasing Burke.\n\nMeredith: Dr Burke?\n\nBurke: Mmm?\n\nMeredith: There's a baby up in paeds, I saw him have a tet spell, and I think I hear a murmur.\n\nBurke: Mmm. Did paeds call us for a consult?\n\nMeredith: Actually, no, they're not doing anything about it -\n\nBurke: So you want me to what?\n\nMeredith: If you could just go up and look at him -\n\nBurke: Mm-hmm, not without a paeds consult.\n\nMeredith: Yeah, but -\n\nBurke: I'm a busy man, Grey, and there are rules. Look, it's not like I'm the Chief of something.\n\nHe leaves. Cut to Izzie bandaging up a man's hand.\n\nMan: You're hot.\n\nIzzie: You're drunk. Hold still.\n\nMan: Wait, you're that girl, from that magazine, the one, that red bikini?\n\nIzzie: Yeah, it was pink. I'm done, you can see the nurse outside now.\n\nThe Chinese woman comes up and starts talking again, distressed.\n\nMan: Is she crazy or something?\n\nIzzie: No, I don't think so. (motions for him to leave). Kay, please, please sit down, I really need to look at your arm. (woman does) Okay.\n\nIzzie gets to work, the woman speaks, Izzie looks up at her but doesn't know what to do, so she gets back to the arm wound.\n\nCut to Meredith and Cristina in the lobby.\n\nCristina: What're you doing down here?\n\nMeredith: Just sitting here with my pen1s. What about you?\n\nCristina: Hiding from Alex.\n\nMeredith: I kissed Derek.\n\nCristina: You kissed Derek.\n\nMeredith: In the elevator.\n\nCristina: Oh, you kissed him in the elevator.\n\nMeredith: I was having a bad day. I am having a bad day.\n\nCristina: Oh, so this is what you do on your bad days. Make out with Dr. McDreamy. (they get up to leave)\n\nMeredith: Well, that, and you know, carrying around a pen1s just makes everything seem so shiny and happy.\n\nCristina: Mmm. George said Alison was wearing your shoes.\n\nMeredith: Yeah. It's weird, right?\n\nCristina: It's weird that you care.\n\nMeredith: I think it's weird.\n\nThey hear a car swerve and, looking through the glass at what we can't see, rush outside.\n\nA man is staggering out of his car, his clothes soaked in blood, mainly around his crotch.. He collapses. In seconds there are doctors and nurses checking him. Cut to Meredith calling security and then pulling the man's bed with other hospital staff.\n\nBailey: So, what've we got?\n\nMeredith: Take a look.\n\nBailey: What? (looks) All right, let's get him into OR 1. Meredith, you call the chief and let him know we got the rapist.\n\nCut to Meredith and Cristina, masks on, in the OR.\n\nMeredith: I saw Alison, you can't believe the beating that she took. And then to see this...\n\nCristina: It's like that old saying, you should see the other guy.\n\nBailey: Why are we not attempting to reattach the severed pen1s?\n\nCristina: Teeth don't slice, they tear, you can only reattach with a clean cut. If she wanted to slice him off with a knife...\n\nMeredith: Besides, the digestive juices didn't leave much of the flesh to work with.\n\nBailey: Right, so what do we do?\n\nCristina: Sew him up minus a large part of the family jewels.\n\nBailey: And his outlook?\n\nMeredith: He'll be urinating out of a bag for a very, very long time.\n\nCristina: Not to mention he'll never be able to have s*x again.\n\nMeredith: Oh, too bad.\n\nCristina: Shame.\n\nBailey: Let's all take a moment to grieve. Clamp.\n\nCut to Webber coming out of an OR.\n\nBurke: Richard.\n\nWebber: We got the rapist. He stumbled right into the hospital.\n\nBurke: Yeah, I heard.\n\nWebber: Listen, Burke...\n\nBurke: Why?\n\nWebber: You really want to know?\n\nBurke: I want to know when you stopped thinking of me as your number one. Richard, I do more in this hospital than any other surgeon.\n\nWebber: You do only exactly as much as is necessary. You never take an extra step, you never give an extra minute. You're comfortable. And arrogant, and it doesn't impress me. You want to be chief, earn it. (leaves)\n\nBurke sighs. He sees Meredith, she's wheeling a patient around. He walks off.\n\nCut to Alison. She's unconscious, Derek is watching her. He slumps into a chair.\n\nCut to Izzie and the Chinese woman. Izzie's done.\n\nIzzie: I'm sorry. I have patients lined up, I don't have time, I don't understand you. I'm sorry. (sighs)\n\nThe Chinese woman finally nods, says something that sounds final, and leaves.\n\nShot of Seattle at night, clouds rolling in, then of Alex, in the spare beds + empty corridor area.\n\nAlex: My head hurts.\n\nCristina: Maybe it's a tumour.\n\nAlex: Yeah, you wish I had a tumour.\n\nCristina: Look, I'd rip your face off if it meant I got to scrub in.\n\nIzzie walks in.\n\nIzzie: I have been suturing all day. My hands are numb.\n\nGeorge: At least you're helping people.\n\nAlex: At least you get to practice freaking medicine.\n\nIzzie: I had to send one Chinese lady away. She was like, camped out down there.\n\nCristina: Oh, poor Izzie, turning away patients, boo-hoo.\n\nMeredith enters.\n\nMeredith: So the police say that they can't send down the crack crime scene guy for hours. So I have to spend the night with a pen1s. Alex, don't say it.\n\nAlex: Ahh, it was too easy anyway.\n\nGeorge: Who here feels like they have no idea what they're doing?\n\nEveryone raises their hands, except Alex.\n\nGeorge: I mean, are we supposed to be learning something, because I don't feel like I'm learning anything.\n\nIzzie: Except how not to sleep.\n\nCristina: It's like there's this wall, and the attendings and the residents are over there, being surgeons, and we're over here, being...\n\nMeredith: Suturing, code running, lab delivering penis-minders.\n\nAlex: I hate being an intern.\n\nBailey comes in and looks expectant. They get up and leave. She sits down and starts eating someone's chips.\n\nMeredith is back near the babies. She sees the parents of the boy she's worried about.\n\nMeredith: Hi.\n\nMother: Hi.\n\nMeredith: Is he yours?\n\nMother: (smiling) Yeah.\n\nMeredith: He's adorable.\n\nWe see the paeds intern checking on him. She looks up and sees Meredith talking more seriously to the parents.\n\nPaeds Intern: Oh, please. (comes out to them) You are so out of line.\n\nFather: She says the murmur might not be benign.\n\nMeredith: I think we should do an echo, to check.\n\nPaeds Intern: This is your career. (goes back to get her resident)\n\nMeredith: There really is no reason to get alarmed.\n\nPaeds intern returns with her resident.\n\nResident: What's the problem?\n\nMother: If our baby is sick, we want him treated. Now.\n\nResident: Who said your baby was sick?\n\nPaeds Intern: Her, the surgical intern who has no business on our service.\n\nResident: Who authorised you being here?\n\nMeredith: I was just, actually - (Burke comes up behind her)\n\nBurke: I did. Could you excuse us for a second? (takes the resident aside)\n\nResident: Dr Burke.\n\nBurke: Are you messing with my intern, Dr. Kerr?\n\nKerr: No, sir.\n\nBurke: Give me the chart.\n\nPaeds Intern: There's nothing wrong with him, I checked.\n\nBurke: Are you sure?\n\nPaeds Intern: Yes.\n\nBurke: You can guarantee that he is fine, you are 100% sure.\n\nIntern looks hesitant.\n\nKerr: How sure are you?\n\nPaeds Intern: I don't know, 75%.\n\nBurke: Not good enough. He's my patient now. That okay with you, Dr. K?\n\nKerr: Absolutely.\n\nPaeds Intern: (quietly and indignantly to her resident) He can take our patient?\n\nKerr: He's an attending.\n\nBurke: Which means I can do whatever I want. (returns to parents) Mr and Mrs Johnson, I'm Dr. Burke, head of cardio, we're going to run some tests and give you an answer within the hour. Grey, (to parents) excuse me, (leaves with Meredith) I want an EKG, a chest x-ray, and an ECHO. I don't have all day.\n\nMeredith: You're a busy man.\n\nBurke: I'm a busy man.\n\nThey walk off, past Izzie.\n\nIzzie: (to secretary) Anybody else?\n\nWoman: No.\n\nIzzie: Good. I need a bed. (sees the Chinese woman leaving) Ms. Lu?\n\nIzzie follows the woman outside. It's nighttime, and pouring rain. She stops before going into the rain.\n\nIzzie: Ms Lu! Ms Lu, wait, Ms Lu! (Ms Lu beckons) What is it?\n\nIzzie follows her across the street. Inside a junkyard, Ms Lu is talking to a girl, who's clutching a rag to her forehead. Ms Lu sees that Izzie's come over, and the girl shows Izzie her forehead.\n\nIzzie: Oh my god.\n\nShe's got some kind of cut, and there's dried blood all over her forehead. Izzie comes over to take a closer look.\n\nIzzie: It's okay. It's okay. (to Ms Lu) I'll help.\n\nA few minutes later, Izzie is examining it with a penlight.\n\nIzzie: It's deep. I need to clean it out...(she makes hand motions, trying to get the message across).\n\nGirl: Machine, it broke in the factory, it fall.\n\nIzzie: You speak English. Just, if you could come inside...(takes girl's arm)\n\nGirl: No, no, no, no inside, no, no, jail.\n\nMrs Lu is getting worried, but Izzie is undeterred.\n\nIzzie: Jail? She came inside...\n\nGirl: She green card! Me, no.\n\nIzzie: You're illegal. That's okay, we don't have to tell them that, I just need to get you inside, I have to sew that up.\n\nGirl: No, no inside. No inside.\n\nIzzie: Please. I promise, I promise you won't go to jail. You just - it's raining, please, come inside.\n\nThe girl and Ms Lu get upset and start speaking their native language, getting up to leave.\n\nIzzie: Okay! Okay. Okay. Not inside.\n\nThey sit back down.\n\nIzzie: Okay, wait here. Wait. I'll come back. I'll be back.\n\nCut to Meredith walking down a hallway. She sees Burke.\n\nMeredith: Well?\n\nBurke: It's a birth defect. Tetrology affirmed lower pulmonary artresia. You were right. I'm booking the OR for tomorrow.\n\nMeredith: Thank you for backing me up on this.\n\nBurke: Whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. You were right. But if you ever pull a stunt like that again...going to the parents behind a doctor's back? Trying to steal a patient from another service? I will make your residency year hell on earth.\n\nWe see him leave to speak to the parents. Meredith looks happy. Cut to George and the code team. Cut to Cristina getting hugged, then walking with Alex, then cut to Izzie stuffing her pockets with medical supplies, then Derek doing paperwork, checking on and sitting with Alison. Cut to Izzie leaving the supplies room, cut to George saying damnit' as they lose another patient, and walking out, cut back to Izzie, now dabbing at the girl's cut.\n\nIzzie: Okay. You're all sewn up. That's pretty good; I could've done a better job if I had more light. You might have a scar.\n\nGirl: Is good.\n\nIzzie: You're going to need to come back, in five days. Okay? I'm going to need to check the wound and remove the stitches. Okay? Here's my pager number, on this card, right here, okay? We'll meet, right back here, okay? You have to come back, but you can't tell anybody that I helped you outside of the hospital or I might lose my job. Understand?\n\nGirl: Yes. Come back, and don't tell.\n\nIzzie: (smiling) Yes. Okay, that's it, I'm done. You can go. I'll see you in five days.\n\nGirl: Yes, see you.\n\nThey walk off, Izzie packs up. The older woman comes back and takes Izzie's hand, still speaking her own language but obviously thanking her.\n\nIzzie: Thank you.\n\nBack inside the hospital, Burke has come over to Bailey.\n\nBurke: Do you think I'm too competent?\n\nBailey: No.\n\nBurke: Don't lie.\n\nBailey: You are my boss.\n\nBurke: All right then, anything you say in the next thirty seconds is free, starting now.\n\nBailey: I think you're cocky, arrogant, bossy and pushy, you also have a god complex, you never think about anybody but your damn self -\n\nBurke: But I -\n\nBailey: But what? I still have 22 more seconds, I am not done.\n\nBurke raises his eyebrows, looking sorry he asked but thoughtful.\n\nCut to locker room.\n\nCristina: I need a drink, a man or a massage. Or a drunken massage by a man. What's wrong with you?\n\nGeorge: Lost five patients on the code team today. I feel like the angel of death.\n\nCristina: George, 95% of all code patients can't be revived. Most of them are seriously dead before you even get there.\n\nGeorge: What?! (sounding upset) Why didn't you tell me that when I was going on and on about how great it was going to be?\n\nCristina: Because. You're George, and I'm Cristina. (leaves)\n\nPaeds Intern: His heart surgery is scheduled for the morning. I really did think I was right, you know.\n\nMeredith: I know. We almost never are. We're interns. We're not supposed to be right. And when we are, it's completely shocking.\n\nPaeds Intern: Are you - I mean, being an intern, do you feel...\n\nMeredith: Terrified. 100% of the time.\n\nPaeds Intern: Good, it's not just me.\n\nMeredith: No.\n\nCut to Meredith going to see Alison. Derek's still there.\n\nMeredith: How is she?\n\nDerek: No change.\n\nMeredith: Have you been here all night?\n\nDerek: Mm-hmm. Yup. You know I have four sisters? Very girly, tons of kids. If I was in a coma, they'd all be here. I'd want them here. Having no one? Can't imagine that.\n\nMeredith: I can.\n\nDerek: What're you talking about, what about your mother? She'd be in here ordering all the surgeons around. She'd fly these cowboys in from Prague to do these amazing medical procedures.\n\nMeredith: That's true. I do have my mother.\n\nDerek: So we're kissing but we're not dating?\n\nMeredith: I knew that was going to come up.\n\nDerek: Don't get me wrong, I like the kissing. I'm all for the kissing. More kissing, I say.\n\nMeredith: I have no idea what that was about.\n\nDerek: Is it going to happen again? Because if it is, I need to bring breath mints. Put a condom in my wallet.\n\nMeredith: Shut up now. (Derek laughs) There was this baby up in the nursery. He's brand new. No one's neglected him or damaged him yet. How do we get from there to here? She's wearing my shoes and someone's beat the crap out of her, and she's got nobody.\n\nBeeping. Alison's in trouble. Meredith hits an alarm on the wall.\n\nDerek: Her ICP's double, get OR! Put her in for a craniotomy.\n\nFadeout to later. Meredith's leaning against the wall, Derek walks past, turns back to her.\n\nDerek: Hey. I, uh, I had to leave her skull flap off, till the pressure in her brain goes down.\n\nMeredith: She's not going to make it, is she?\n\nDerek: She's going to be fine.\n\nMeredith: If she ever wakes up.\n\nDerek: (nodding) If she ever wakes up.\n\nCut to later on.\n\nDerek: Dr Burke! I'm off at six, you want to get that drink we talked about?\n\nBurke: No, I don't think so.\n\nDerek: Well, what about tomorrow night?\n\nBurke: Shepherd, you should know that Richard promised chief to both of us. (Derek doesn't really react) But you knew that already.\n\nDerek: Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\n\nBurke: Mm. You're not the enemy, you're just the competition.\n\nThey walk off. Cut to Meredith signing for the pen1s.\n\nOlder woman: So here is where you put the signature, down here, the initials.\n\nMeredith: Mmm. Okay.\n\nWebber: It...just says that the, um...the...\n\nOlder woman: pen1s.\n\nWebber: (laughing) I'm a doctor, it shouldn't be weird to say this, but I used to change her diapers...\n\nMeredith: I get it.\n\nWebber: It just says that it was never out of sight.\n\nMeredith: There you go. One pen1s.\n\nWebber: Officer. (police officer takes it and they go)\n\nCut to OR for the baby.\n\nBurke: We'll be using a medium approach for a trans-ventricular repair with a right ventriculostomy. Let's open him up. Grey!\n\nMeredith: Yes, sir?\n\nBurke: Go scrub in. When we've finished cracking the baby's chest, I'll let you hold the clamp.\n\nMeredith: Seriously?\n\nBurke: Don't make me change my mind.\n\nMeredith: I'm going.\n\nCut to Derek entering the rapist's room. He whacks the end of the bed to wake him up.\n\nDerek: I have good news and bad news. The good news is, Dr. Bailey stopped your bleeding. The bad news is, we're giving your pen1s to the cops. Have a nice life.\n\nHe leaves and the rapist realises he's cuffed to the bed.\n\nCut to Cristina and Alex giving more results.\n\nCristina: The results of your labs were clean; the tumour's benign, you can go home today.\n\nThe patient hugs her husband, who then goes for Cristina. Cristina acts fast and shoves Alex into his way. Alex gets a nice big hug, and Cristina leaves, pleased with herself. Cut to the OR, Meredith's holding the clamp.\n\nMeredith VO: At some point, you have to make a decision. (cut to her watching the babies again) Boundaries don't keep other people out. They fence you in. Life is messy. That's how we're made. (we see the other interns are with her) Okay, fine, George and Izzie, you can move into the house.\n\nGeorge: YES! Yes!\n\nIzzie: I can't believe you caved! (George and Izzie hug)\n\nGeorge: Yes! (George and Izzie go, dancing)\n\nMeredith: I can't believe I caved.\n\nCristina: I blame the babies. Toxic.\n\nMeredith VO: So, you can waste your life, drawing lines, (cut to Derek, on the phone outside Alison's room. Suddenly, he puts down the phone, mouth open. He's seen something) Or, you can live your life crossing them. (Low angle shot of Alison. Her eyelids are fluttering. They open and she sees Derek).\n\nDerek: Welcome back.\n\nCut to Meredith leaving in her same-as-Alison's shoes. She walks over to the elevator...where Derek is waiting.\n\nMeredith VO: But there are some lines...\n\nDerek: So. It's intense...this thing I have for, ah, ferry boats I mean.\n\nMeredith VO: ...that are way too dangerous to cross.\n\nMeredith: (turns to smile at Derek) I'm so taking the stairs this time.\n\nElevator dings.\n\nDerek: No self-control. It's sad. Really.\n\nCut to Meredith leaving. She runs to catch up with Izzie, George and Cristina.\n\nMeredith VO: But here's what I know. If you're willing to take the chance...the view from the other side is spectacular.\n\nFadeout.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1511323", "artist_names": "Sheena

1]\nThere's a gentle autumn breeze that blows\nWhenever we be lyin', lyin' in my bed\nThe moon appears and disappears, you look at me\nMy clothes I quickly, I quickly shed\nThe curtains dance a minuet, autumn plays the music, baby\nCome on, hold my hand\nLeaves are fallin' velvet splash\nOnly you and I can under-- only you can understand\n[Verse 2]\nThe sunlight draws a picture through the silky lace\nThat hangs above your, hangs above your door\nA picture that is waving, that it seems to be with every thrust you\nMake me beg for more\nOh, a robin sings a masterpiece\nThat lives and dies unheard\nFor screams of passion\nA sound produced by two in love\nCurtains dance and autumn plays on\n(Oh, two in love, on and on)\nThe screams of passion\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll I hear in my head echoing like a volcano, baby\nThe screams of passion\nBack and forth the raging seas of lust, I want you madly\nCan't you tell, can't you tell, can't you tell, can't you tell?\nOww!\nTake me in your arms, oh baby\nThe crime is done, I'd rather die here in your\nScreams of passion\nWhoa, hold me now, baby\nTell me that you love me\n(Is it Sunday)\nOr is it passion?\nYou might also

Oww\nIs it Sunday? (Ooh love, ooh love)\nI thought I heard a church bell (Or was it passion, passion?)\nYeah yeah (Oooh)\nPassion\nThe screams of passion\nWhat did you say baby?\nExcuse me, but ...\nIs that your passion?\nDo you want my passion?\nUh, do you want my passion?\n[Outro]\nIf you want my love, if you want my body baby\nLet me hear ya, let me hear ya, let, uh, let me hear ya scream!\nI want some

the dance, I even saw the freak of the week\n\nShe was wearing those red shoes, everybody replied, \"She's hot\"\nAnd as she riddled to the rhythm of a beat, everybody fell apart, woah\nAll of a sudden, she turned her head, eyes full of flame\nI was hypnotized, mesmerized, I didn't even know my name\nWell, well, well, and she was the finest thing I had ever seen\nFresh as she could be\nFreaky lovely thing, turned on me\nShe's freak-a-ristic, she's freak-a-ristic, hot\n\nShe took me by the hand, led me to the back\nAlmost had a heart attack\nShe took me to a dark space in her place\nWe kinda made it our own space\n\nThen she grabbed me around my neck and pulled my head to hers\nThat's when I felt my blood pressure surges and blown\nTake this fancy home where we'll never be all alone\nAnd turn it out 'cause you're freak-a-ristic\n\nShe was the finest thing I had ever seen\nFresh as she could be, freaky lovely thing, turned on me\nShe's freak-a-ristic, she's a freak, brilliant thing\nShe's freak-a-ristic, she's a freak-a-ristic thing\n\nShe's freak-a-ristic\nHypnotized me, mesmerized me\nShe's freak-a-ristic\nLove the way she moves\n\nShe's just the finest

Lyrics[Chorus]\nThey're playing basketball\nWe love that basketball\nThey're playing basketball\nWe love that basketball\n\n[Verse 1]\n(Now rapping basketball -- Number 1, Kurtis Blow)\nBasketball is my favorite sport\nI like the way they dribble up and down the court\nJust like I'm the king on the microphone\nSo is Dr. J and Moses Malone\nI like slam dunks, take me to the hoop\nMy favorite play is the alley-oop\nI like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go\n'Cause it's basketball, uh, Mister Kurtis Blow\n[Chorus]\nThey're playing basketball\nWe love that basketball\nThey're playing basketball\nWe love that basketball\n\n[Verse 2]\nI used to go to dinner, then take the girl\nTo see Tiny play against Earl The Pearl\nAnd Wilt, Big O, and Jerry West\nPlay basketball at it's very best\nBasketball has always been my thing\nI like Magic, Bird, and Bernard King\nAnd number 33, my man Kareem\nIs the center on my starting team\n\n(To the hoop, y'all, watch out, watch out\nIn yo' face, now here comes the rest)\n\n[Verse 3]\nClyde, Rick Barry, and Pistol Pete\nNow these players could never be beat\nIsiah, and Iceman too\nJust give 'em the ball, and then you chalk up two\nDantley and Wilkins are on the scene\nAnd Ralph Sampson is really mean\nBill Russell didn't take no junk\nAnd Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nTell me, were you in the joint\nThe night Wilt scored 100 points?\nOr when Celtics won titles back-to-back\nAnd didn't give nobody no kind of slack?\nOr when Dr. J shook the whole damn team\nWith moves that came right out of a dream?\nOr when Willis Reed stood so tall\nPlaying D with desire? It's basketball!\n\n[Chorus]\nThey're playing basketball\nWe love that basketball\nThey're playing basketball\nWe love that basketball\n\n[Verse 5]\nI get the ball and then I go and play\nLike a superstar in the NBA\nThe forwards, the centers, and all the guards\nThe ones you see on the bubblegum cards\nMe and homeboy would go one-on-one\n'Cause playing the game is a lot of fun\nSit by the TV and watch 'em all\n'Cause Kurtis Blow is rapping basketball12Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1769508", "artist_names": "Sheena Easton", "full_title": "Swear by\u00a0Sheena\u00a0Easton", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/66e337dd994123bf9a2cc9c294f53171.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/66e337dd994123bf9a2cc9c294f53171.500x500x1.jpg", "id": 1769508, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1430206726, "path": "/Sheena-easton-swear-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Sheena-easton-swear-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1984, "month": 9, "day": 7}, "release_date_for_display": "September 7, 1984", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 7, 1984", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/66e337dd994123bf9a2cc9c294f53171.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/66e337dd994123bf9a2cc9c294f53171.500x500x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Swear", "title_with_featured": "Swear", "updated_by_human_at": 1626695281, "url": "https://genius.com/Sheena-easton-swear-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/338024", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d88466131594429a41537584ce0f3b05.750x1000x1.jpg", "id": 338024, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d88466131594429a41537584ce0f3b05.750x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Sheena Easton", "slug": "Sheena-easton", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Sheena-easton"}, "artist": "Sheena Easton", "lyrics": "Swear LyricsI won't bother asking what youve done\nThough the rumors all point to something going on\nSee the past is the past, Im not gonna dwell\nBut I better never catch you with someone else\n\nSo Ill put it to you once, but never again (swear)\nIf you wanna be a lover, if you wanna be a friend (swear)\nThen take five fingers, and put it to your heart (swear)\n\nS.W.E.A.R\nHand over heart and swear that you love me, swear that you need me\n\nGet a judge and jury, bible in your hand\nGotta tell the whole truth, nothing less than that, boy\n\n(Swear) That you love me!

chanting and all the lies the wise ones tell\n\nThey say\nEast is east, west is west\nTwo diff'rent colors on the map\nWe say break the line, chew the fat\nA keep moving out into the gap\nBeggars in the back street, there for all the world to leave\nIt's you that's begging for attention\nWell it's all the same to me\nAnd I won't ask permission, not from teachers or from kings\nCause I can see for myself all the pain that you will bring\n\nThey say\nEast is east, west is west\nTwo diff'rent rhythms to the rap\nWe say break the line, chew the fat\nA keep moving out into the gap\n\nThey say\nEast is east, west is west\nTwo diff'rent colors on the map\nWe say break the line, chew the fat\nA keep moving out into the gap\n\nThey say\nEast is east, west is west\nTwo diff'rent colors on the map\nWe say break the line, chew the fat\nA keep moving out into the gap\n\nCan you smell the perfume of a hundred thousand years?\nDare you look into the eyes that hide a hundred million tears?\nBut there's no need to be so frightened of all the figures in the night\nCause we share the same emotions and no one's wrong and no one's right\nYou might also likeCause they say\nEast is east, west is west\nTwo

teens\nNorth of interstate and 18 into the 20s elsewhere\nSnow will move into my heart and western Pennsylvania towards the morning and spread east through sunrise\nWarm air from under your mouth will push up my nostrils across the Maryland border through the day\n\nDon\u2019t let me down\nDon\u2019t let me down, I\u2019m sorry\nDon\u2019t lay it all on me\nDon\u2019t give me up\nDon\u2019t give me up, I worry\nDon\u2019t lay it all on me\nThis will change the faith and the snow to rain south and east of interstate\nSnow will mix and change to sleet and freezing rain up to about interstate 80s through the afternoon\nThe temperature of my body will remain below  freezing from south-central mountains and points north\nTemperatures will reach the mid-30s or 40s depending on your age\nRain will continue in my life because you never came back\n\nDon\u2019t let me down\nDon\u2019t let me down, I\u2019m sorry\nDon\u2019t lay it all on me\nDon\u2019t give me up\nDon\u2019t give me up, I

The sounds of deep\nmoaning and sexual huffs and puffs. After a few seconds the\nsound grows even louder. It should sound as if the two\npeople are fucking into a microphone. The sounds should be\npainful and raw.\n\nGIRL (O.S.)\nOh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.\n\nINT. BEDROOM - DAY\n\nThe face of a very pretty young girl with long blond hair.\nHer face is inches from the CAMERA, the CAMERA is above her,\nlooking down, almost like the POV of the person she's having\nsex with. She id breathing extremely heavily; her face is\nred-hot and sweaty. Every time she moves, she makes a deep\nmoaning noise. She looks likes she's on the verge of pain\nand ecstasy.\n\nGIRL\nOh yes, Telly it hurts, oh yes, oh yes, please Telly, Telly.\n\nThe CAMERA backs up to reveal Telly having sex with the\ngirl. Telly is seventeen years old. He is short, dirty,\nslightly muscular, he has an interesting face, he is a\nstreet-smart punk, He is biting his bottom lip, the two of\nthem are sweating like mad, the sound of the bed post\nsmashing against the wall combines with the rhythmical\nmoaning of the two.\n\nRAPID FADE TO BLACK\n\n\nBACK IN TIME - BEFORE THEY HAD SEX\nTelly is in bed with the girl. The two of them are sitting\nup in the big bed that is raised high of the ground. Telly\nis naked except for a tight pair of white underwater. He is\nsitting above the blankets with his legs spread apart. The\ngirl is partially covered, she is wearing a black bra, one\nof her nipples is poking through. The two of them are very\nsweaty, they both have messed up hair, there is a great\nfeeling of heat and wetness.\n\nThe windows to her room are open, the sound of outside of\noutside traffic is circulating. There is a small fan on her\ndresser that is blowing from side to side. Socks, shirts,\nand pants are lying on her hard wood floor. The room is neat\nexcept for the clothing. A large poster of the Beastie Boys\nhangs on the wall. She has many stuffed animals on her bed\nand dresser drawer, she also has a small dollhouse in the\ncorner.\n\nTelly and the girl are looking at each other.\n\nThe girl speaks slowly and softly, she has a very innocent\nbeauty about her.\n\nTELLY\nYou know what I want to do?\nGIRL\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nWhat do I want to do?\n\nGIRL\nYou want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.\n\nTELLY\n(smiling)\nWhy?\n\nGIRL\nBecause, you know why. You know.\n\nTELLY\nBecause your a virgin?\n\nGIRL\nBecause I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.\n\nTELLY\nYou think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have\nto worry about that kinda stuff.\n\nGIRL\nWhy is that?\n\nTELLY\nBecause I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we\nfucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.\n\nGIRL\nI wouldn't believe it?\n\nTELLY\nI don't know. I just think that you would love it.\n\nGIRL\nBut, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change.\nBetween us.\n\nTELLY\nWhat things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.\n(he begins to caress her cheek and hair)\nI want to make you happy. That's all.\n\nTelly scoots up to the girl and starts to kiss her. He\nsticks his tongue in her mouth. They kiss.\n\nTELLY\n(whispering)\nYou know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.\n\nGIRL\n(whispering)\nDo you care about me?\n\nTELLY\n(whispering)\nOf course I do.\n\nRAPID CUT TO BLACK\n\n\nAN EXTREME CLOSEUP OF THE GIRL'S FACE\n\nAs she screams in total agony. Telly and the girl are on the\nbed having sex. All the lights are on. This scene should\nlook very white and bleached out, very electric and\nshocking. Everything should be exposed as Telly takes\nadvantage of the virgin girl.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\n(slowly)\nVirgins. I love 'em. No diseases, no loose as a goose pussy,\nno skank. No nothin. Just pure pleasure.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\n\nTHE CREDITS ROLL IN\n\nAs soon as the scene ends, so does the sound of the two\nhaving sex. Very fast, very hard-paced music accompanies the\ncredits. The music should be strong enough to maintain the\nintensity of the scene, Hard-core, Punk.\n\nCREDITS STOP\n\nFADE IN:\n\n\nINT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRCASE - DAY\n\nTelly gently shuts the door. He has a huge smile on his\nface. He looks down the center of the staircase and spits.\nHe watches his spit fall down till it smacks against the\nfloor. He runs down three flights of stairs as quickly as\npossible. He jumps down the last four steps and bumps into\nthe side of the wall. He is very happy. He runs down the\nskinny hallway and smacks the metal mailboxes.\n\n\nEXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - SIDEWALK - DAY\n\nTelly exits the building. CASPER is sitting on a middle\nstep. He is reading a comic book and drinking a 40oz. Bottle\nof malt liquor. The bottle is wrapped in a brown paper sack.\nAs he sips his drink he laughs at his comic book.\n\nCasper is Telly's second half. The two have been best\nfriends since grade school. Casper is small and funny,\neveryone likes him, he has a quick temper, and he isn't\nscared to fight someone twice his size. Telly provides\nCasper with a sense of adolescent wisdom. Casper makes Telly\nhappy; he's a smart ass, he has a strong New York accent, an\nassortment of tattoos, and crooked teeth. Telly and Casper\nare always together, They help each other to survive.\n\nTelly smacks Casper on the back of his head. Casper is\nstartled and spills a little bit of his beer onto his shoes.\n\nCASPER\nShit.\n\nTELLY\n(smiling)\nWas up bitch?\n\nCasper looks at Telly smiling.\n\nCASPER\nOh shit what happened?\n\nCasper is very excited. He stands up and pulls Telly's arm.\n\nTELLY\nWhat do you think?\n\nCASPER\nYou fucked it?\n\nTelly laughs and Casper jumps up and down.\n\nCASPER\nI knew you fucked it! I sat out her for like two hours! That\ngirl was like twelve, and you hit it up!\n\nTELLY\n(pounding his chest)\nWho am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.\n\nThey both start to laugh.\n\nThey move off the stairs and start walking down the\nsidewalk. The two of them are walking down the street,\nobvious to everything but themselves talking.\n\nCASPER\nWell, how was it?\n\nTELLY\nOh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.\n\nCASPER\nShe can fuck?\n\nTELLY\nHell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in\nshe screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.\n\nCASPER\nOh shit. How long did it take?\n\nTELLY\nDid what take?\n\nCASPER\nHow long did you fuck her?\n\nThey cross the street, paying no attention to speeding cars.\nCasper is listening to every word that Telly says. Casper\nseems much happier than Telly. Telly is laid-back. Casper is\nhyper as he jumps up and down and claws Telly's arm.\n\nTELLY\nWell it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took\nlike 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we\nfucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out\nand putting it back in. It hurts the first time.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nBut then when she got into it. She really got into it. It\nwas good.\n\nCASPER\nHow did she smell? Did her puss stink?\n\nTelly puts his four fingers together and then puts his hand\nin front of Caper's nose.\n\nTELLY\nTake a whiff.\n\nCasper takes a huge whiff, the snot in his nose makes a loud\nsound as he smells Telly's fingers.\n\nCASPER\nOh man, it smells like butterscotch.\n\nTELLY\nHell's yeah. She was so clean.\n\nCASPER\nOh man, that's the best.\n\nTELLY\nYou could tell she took care of herself. She had all these\npowders and creams in her bathroom.\n\nCASPER\nLet me smell it again.\n\nTelly lifts his fingers once again, as Casper breathes in\nthe odor.\n\nCASPER\nThat's why virgins are the best. I love that smell.\n\nAs they walk down the street, joggers, men in business suits\nwith briefcases, ambulances, and women with baby carriages\nall pass by.\n\nTELLY\nYou know what else?\n\nCASPER\nWhat?\n\nTELLY\nI can tell that she had just entered puberty.\n\nCASPER\nHow?\n\nTELLY\nWell, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her\nfamily, right.\n\nCASPER\nRight.\n\nTELLY\nAnd there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or\nsomething. And I said, you were cut when you were little.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nAnd she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year\nago. I look younger without my makeup.\n\nCasper starts to crack up.\n\nTELLY\nAnd I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this\ngirl is a baby.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nAnd for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know,\nbecause she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit,\nthat turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.\n\nThey both laugh.\n\nCASPER\nFuckin perverted bastard.\n\nThey continue to laugh and walk.\n\nTELLY\nI'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that\nshit.\n\nCASPER\nTo what? Virgins?\n\nTELLY\nYeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's\nlike lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex\nfantasies.\n\nCASPER\nWhat do you mean?\n\nTELLY\nI mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.\n\nCASPER\nYou mean like fucking two virgins at once.\n\nTELLY\n(laughing)\nThat would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like\nwhen I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I\nwould like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would\nhappen.\n\nCASPER\n(laughing)\nShe's probably smash you in the fucking face.\n\nTELLY\nI don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I\nwasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it\nslow. Show 'em some respect.\n\nCASPER\nDid you tell her that you loved her?\n\nTELLY\nLike. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin\nseduction guys.\n\nThey stop walking. Casper takes the last sip of his beer,\nthen throws it toward an orange trash can. He misses the can\nand the bottle smashes in the middle of a busy street.\n\nCASPER\nShit.\n\nTELLY\nWhat do you want?\n\nCASPER\nGet another forty.\n(burps)\nSmoke a blunt.\n\nTELLY\nAre you hungry?\n\nCASPER\nHell yeah. Fuckin starvin. Wait up a sec.\n\nCasper takes two steps away and starts urinating in\nsomeone's bushes. People walk by and stare.\n\nTELLY\nYou wanna go to Paul's house?\n\nCASPER\nWhat for? That guys a dick.\n\nTELLY\nI'm sue he's got food. He's always got those microwave\nburrito things in his freezer.\n\nCASPER\nYou think he's got any herb?\n\nTELLY\nI don't know, he quit dealin but I'll bet he'll smoke us\nout.\n\nCASPER\nYou think?\n\nTELLY\nProbably.\n\nCASPER\nHe lives on 76th?\n\nTELLY\n78th.\n\nCASPER\nDen less go Joe.\n\nHe zips up his pants.\n\nThey start walking again. Casper is carrying a folded up\ncomic book in his hand.\n\nCASPER\nTelly.\n\nTELLY\nYeah.\n\nCASPER\nDid she suck your dick?\n\nTELLY\nA little bit. But I didn't really want her to.\n\nCASPER\nWhy?\n\nTELLY\nI don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to\nsuck your dick. That's so easy.\n\nCASPER\nIt is right.\n\nTELLY\nI want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole\nphilosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's\nbasic because there's nothing lost.\n\nCASPER\nIt's no big deal, right?\n\nTELLY\nRight. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it.\nYou were the one. No one else can ever do it.\n\nCASPER\nYeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.\n(they both start laughing)\nIt's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like,\nif you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the\nvirgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were\ntheir first.\n\nTELLY\nYep.\n\nCASPER\nThey're gonna tell their grand kids.\n(mimicking an old lady)\nThat Telly. He sure was good in the sack!\n\nThe two of them are laughing, their conversation has gotten\nthem very excited.\n\nThey walk in front of a Korean grocery. The grocery has a\nsmall outdoor produce section, juice, fruit, sodas, etc. A\nKOREAN GUY with flip-flops and headphones is sitting on a\ntall wooden stool.\n\nTELLY\nYou thirsty?\n\nCASPER\nYeah, I feel dehydrated.\n\nTELLY\nYou got any money?\n\nCASPER\nThree pennies and a ball of lint.\n\nTELLY\nYou down with the boost?\n\nCASPER\n(whispers)\nUnzip my pack, yo.\n\nHe turns around and Telly quickly unzips his backpack.\n\n\nINT. KOREAN GROCERY - DAY\n\nThe grocery is your basic traditional market with a lunch\nbuffet. Behind the cash register is a middle-aged KOREAN\nMAN. He is watching a small black and white television set.\n\nThe two boys enter.\n\nCasper walks straight to the back where they keep the beer.\n\nTelly circles the buffet and then walks up to the cash\nregister.\n\nTELLY\nUh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nWhah?\n\nTELLY\nDiss digg. I'm curious if you have it?\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nWhah is dissdee?\n\nCasper is going through the beer section. He pulls out two\n40oz. bottles of and puts them on the floor.\n\nTELLY\nDiss digg, diss digg, diss digg.\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nI no understand you. Maybe crazy.\n\nA round mirror is reflecting Casper putting the bottles into\nhis backpack.\n\nTELLY\nI'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nWhah you say? Dissdee?\n\nCasper runs up to the counter and grabs his crotch.\n\nCASPER\nHe said This Dick, mutha fucka! Can't you understand\nEnglish?\n\nThe two of them both run out the door.\n\nTelly taps the Korean man who is sitting outside. The man\nlooks in the opposite direction while Casper grabs two\npeaches and puts them into his pocket.\n\nThe two boys run off.\n\nThe Korean man gets off his stool. He pulls his headphones\noff his ears.\n\nKOREAN MAN\nStupy fucky boys! Fucky!\n\nHe looks at his fruit stand and puts a peach in the spot\nthat Casper previously stole from.\n\n\nEXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - APARTMENT - DAY\n\nCasper and Telly are walking down the street. Casper is\neating a peach and drinking his 40oz. beer. Telly is also\ndrinking.\n\nCASPER\nYou know like in \"The Wonder Twins\" they share everything.\n\nTELLY\nThe cartoon?\n\nCASPER\nYeah. \"The Wonder Twins\".

PAUL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\nA medium sized apartment building on the Upper East Side.\nCars are speeding by the front of the building. Cabs drive\nby and beep their horns.\n\nTelly and Casper are sitting on the front steps. Telly rings\none of the buttons. The bottom switchboard is plastered with\nskateboarding stickers and \"Legalize Marijuana\" stickers. A\nVespa scooter is parked on the outside in front of the\nbuilding, it also has stickers on it.\n\nTelly rings it again.

Vitamin C for the new generation.\n\nPaul hands Casper another cartridge.\n\nCASPER\nThat's why I like 'em.

Everyone is cracking up.\n\nSUSAN\n(still laughing)\nI was like yes! I'm going out with him!\n\nLINDA\nThat's right.

Where just one more move and you would be like crazy.\n\nShe snaps her fingers.\n\nRUBY\nYep.\n\nLINDA\nBut then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What\nhappened!

The next sequence\nshould be done with fast edits.\n\nHAMILTON\nCut it.\n\nHamilton cuts the cigar down the center with his long\nthumbnail.\n\nHAMILTON\nScrape it.\n\nHe then scrapes all the tobacco out of the center and onto\nthe ground.\n\nHAMILTON\nLick it.\n\nHe then licks the outer paper till it gets very damp.\n\nHAMILTON\nDump it.\n\nCasper starts putting the weed inside, Hamilton licks it,\nthen pulls out a lighter and dries it.\n\nHAMILTON\nAnd smoke it.\n\nHamilton puts it in his mouth.\n\nHAMILTON\nYou wanna start off?\n\nHamilton looks at Casper and puts the blunt in his face.\n\nCASPER\nNaw, you got it Ham.\n\nHamilton smiles.\n\nHAMILTON\nAll right.\n\nHe puts the blunt in his mouth and lights it. A big flame\nshoots up as it catches the end of the Phillie. Hamilton\ntakes a few big puffs and then blows the smoke away.\n\nHAMILTON\nTake two pulls and pass.\n\nHamilton passes the blunt to Casper. A bunch of kids start\nhuddling around Casper as he puffs.\n\nSTEVEN, a skinny Spanish kid with gold front teeth, walks\nup.\n\nSTEVEN\nYo can I fuck wit dat?\n\nCasper smiles and blows smoke in his face.\n\nCASPER\nYeah boy!\n\nCasper hits it again and then hands it to Steve, who takes\nimmense hits.\n\nTwo male homosexuals in short shorts walk by holding hands.\n\nSteven turns his head and notices them. He exhales the smoke\nout of his nose.\n\nSTEVEN\nLook at that.\n\nHAROLD\nThat shit is sick. Fuckin faggots.\n\nCASPER\n(screaming at the top of his lungs)\nFuckin faggots!!!\n\nEveryone starts laughing.\n\nCASPER\n(as loud as possible)\nFaggots!!!\n\nCasper rubs his throat. People continue to laugh.\n\nCASPER\nMy throat.\n\nTelly is sitting away on the cement benches under the tree.\nHe is talking to Misha.\n\nMISHA\nHow can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.\n\nTELLY\nYou think so?\n\nMISHA\nYeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in\nlike seventh grade.\n\nTELLY\nHe still does.\n\nMISHA\nI hate 'em.\n\nTELLY\nIt's not his fault. He had a hard life.\n\nMISHA\nYeah?\n\nTELLY\nYou've heard the stories right?\n\nMISHA\nNo.\n\n\nEXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK - DAY\n\nBack in time. Casper is a little boy, age 11. He is walking\ndown the sidewalk with a lunch box and a \"Casper the\nFriendly Ghost\" T-shirt. He is wearing his hat on backwards.\n\nMusic accompanies this entire episode.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nWell, one day Casper had a stomachache and he got permission\nfrom his teacher to leave school early and go home.\n\nCasper walks up to a nice middle-class home, it could be in\nQueens or Brooklyn, it doesn't matter. He pulls out a key\nand opens the door. He enters his home.\n\n\nINT. CASPER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nThe house is dark. Plastic on all the furniture. A velvet\npicture of Christ is hanging on the wall in the hallway.\nVery simple and plain, a generic adobe.\n\nCasper enters his house and flips on a lightswitch.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he walks into his house and hears some strange noises.\n\nThe sounds of his mother screaming from upstairs.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming from upstairs)\nGet away! Get away! Help! You monster! Please help!\n\nCasper puts his lunch box down and walks to the first stair\nto listen to his mother's screams.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nThe noises were coming from upstairs. In his parents room.\n\nCasper's mom continues to scream from upstairs.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo, this freaked the hell out of Casper. He was just a\nlittle kid and he wasn't sure what to do.\n\nCasper moves off the step and runs into the kitchen.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he ran and got a big knife. The same knife his pops used\nto cut the turkey on Thanksgiving with.\n\nHe opens a drawer full of silverware and pulls out a\nhumongous glistening knife. He picks it up, and it shines on\nhis face.\n\nAs his mother screams he looks up at the ceiling with the\nknife in his hand.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming from upstairs)\nStop! Please stop! Oooh help!\n\nCasper runs up the stairs, he is holding the knife straight\nout.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he heard his mom's screams, and knew that she was in\ntrouble. It sounded like she was getting ready to be killed.\nLike someone was kicking her in the head.\n\nCasper runs down the hall and opens the door to his parents\nroom.\n\nWhat he sees is very shocking. His face becomes extremely\nanimated.\n\nCasper's mom is on the bed. She is completely naked except\nfor a pair of bright red high heel shoes. In between her\nlegs is a man wearing all black, including a black ski mask\nand motorcycle boots. He is having sex with Casper's mom. He\nhas her arms pinned down on the bed. He is grunting like a\npig.\n\nCasper watches for a moment in awe.\n\nMAN IN BLACK\nBitch. You fuckin bitch. Fuckin bitch. Slutty whore.\n\nThe man in black slaps Casper's mom hard on her naked ass.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming)\nNo! Stop! Get off me!\n\nShe is struggling to get loose.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo Casper opened the door and he saw some big guy with a ski\nmask fucking his mother. What a sight for an 11 year old\nkid.\n\nCasper runs up to the bed. He climbs on top of the bed with\nthe big knife in the air, all the while the man in black is\nhaving sex with his mother. And they don't even notice\nCasper at first.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nAnd he goes and jumps on his parent's bed. And for a second\nhe just looks and watches.\n\nCasper takes his knife and starts stabbing the guy in black,\nover and over. His mother is kicking and trying to stop him.\nAll the while, she is screaming outrageously and blood is\npouring out.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nAnd you know. Casper loved his mom, he didn't want anything\nto happen to her. So he started stabbing this guy, over and\nover. But it was a mistake.\n\nCasper's mom is kicking Casper as he stabs the man.\n\nCasper is biting his tongue as he stabs the man.\n\nThe man falls off the bed and onto the floor.\n\nCasper's mom is going totally nuts. She is completely naked,\nwith blood all over her body. There is blood all over the\nsheets. His mom is clawing her face in complete hysterics.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\nYou fuck!!! It's your father!!! We were playing a game you\nfuck!!! That's your father!!! We were just playing!!!\n\nCasper looks very confused as he looks at his naked mother.\nHe has the knife in his hand, and a little blood on his\nT-shirt and cheek.\n\nCasper's mom continues to yell at him.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\nCasper, you fucker!!! Oh, my god!!! Help me God!!!\n\nCasper looks at his mother, then he looks at the dead guy on\nthe floor. He bends down and takes off the mask. It's his\nfather.\n\nCASPER\n(calmly)\nThat's my dad.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(crying)\nYou fuck. You killed your father!\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo Casper killed his father. He came home with a stomachache\nand ended up murdering his pops. It was a very embarrassing\nthing.\n\n\nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - ON A CEMENT BENCH - DAY\n\nTelly is in the same spot talking to Misha.\n\nTELLY\nSo that's why Casper is how he is.\n\nMISHA\nOh god. That's horrible.\n\nA quick shot of Casper smoking a blunt and laughing with his\nfriends.\n\nTELLY\nYep.\n\nMISHA\nHoly shi. That's all true?\n\nTELLY\nNo. I was just kidding.\n\nMISHA\n(outraged)\nWhat?!\n\nTELLY\nI lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post\noffice.\n\n\nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - ON THE FOUNTAIN - DAY\n\nCasper and all his friends are passing around the blunt,\nwhich by now is almost gone. All that is left is a roach and\nCasper is sucking on it really hard.\n\nCasper breathes out the smoke and then passes the roach to\nHamilton.\n\nCASPER\nYo, that weed is mad good.\n\nHamilton gets ready to puff.\n\nHAMILTON\nHells yeah. Gimmie a taste of the mothafuckin chronic.\n\nCasper rubs his eyes.\n\nHamilton puffs on the little roach.\n\nCasper grabs somebody's skateboard and stands on it. He\nstarts rolling around slowly and doing some tricks.\n\nThe other kids continue to smoke. They watch Casper and\nlaugh.\n\nCasper is slowly trying to do tricks, but he's so stoned\nthat he just falls off.\n\nAs he skates in front of is friends he doesn't pay any\nattention to where he's going.\n\nA tall HOODLUM with gold front teeth is walking by. He is\nwearing all Polo and a thick white Fila headband. He is\nbiting down on a chew stick.\n\nThe hoodlum walks by. He has a certain ominous strut. He is\nlooking at the ground as he walks.\n\nHe takes the chew stick out of his mouth and looks at some\ngirl's ass as she walks by. He makes a little noise with his\nmouth.\n\nAs the hoodlum walks by, Casper is rolling backward, not\npaying attention. He rolls into the hoodlum's heels. Casper\nfalls down and laughs. Everyone watching laughs, including\nTelly who is still sitting with Misha.\n\nCasper jumps up and grabs his skateboard. The hoodlum is\nturned around. Casper walks up to him with a smile.\n\nCASPER\nYo, sorry money.\n\nThe hoodlum is a good seven inches taller than Casper. He\nputs his arms out like he's upset.\n\nHOODLUM\nYeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm\nsaying?\n\nCASPER\n(smiling)\nYeah, watch where you walk dukes.\n\nHOODLUM\nWhat?\n\nCASPER\nNuffin G. Just forget it.\n\nHOODLUM\nWhat the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?\n\nCasper throws his skateboard down. He quickly turns around\nand pulls his pants up. He runs right up to the hoodlum and\nhe looks up at him.\n\nCASPER\nSup then? Sup?\n\nHOODLUM\nCome on bitch. Throw your fists up.\n\n\nEXT. THE CEMENT BENCHES - DAY\n\nTelly and Misha are watching. Telly stands up.\n\nTELLY\nUh oh. Casper's in the mix.\n\nHe quickly walks up.\n\n\nEXT. THE FOUNTAIN - DAY\n\nAll the guys jump up and start screaming.\n\nSTEVEN\nOh shit. Throw down.\n\nSteven and all the guys run up and surround the hoodlum.\nThey all start screaming taunts. \"Fuck 'em up Casper!\"\n\nCasper is inches from the hoodlum. They are both in a\nfighting stance. Casper keeps pulling his pants up. Casper\nhas a huge smile on his face, like this is his favorite\nthing in the whole world.\n\nCASPER\nSup. Sup.\n\nHOODLUM\nCome on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.\n\nCASPER\nI'm gonna fuck you up bitch.\n\nThey are both right about to swing.\n\nEveryone in the whole park has turned their attention to the\nscuffle.\n\nAll of a sudden, out of nowhere, Harold runs up behind the\nHoodlum and with the truck of his skateboard, smashes the\nguy in the back of the head. A huge thud is heard and the\nhoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees.\n\nCasper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in\nthe face as hard as he can.\n\nEveryone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum.\nThey're all screaming. Even the girls are screaming. \"Fuck\n'em up!\"\n\nHarold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard.\n\nHitting him on the legs and stomach.\n\nCasper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head.\n\nCASPER\n(everytime he kicks the guy he says this)\nSuck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my dick!\n\nAll of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park,\nincluding Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start\nsmashing this guy, over and over.\n\nThe hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone\nfrantically tries to kill him.\n\nThe focus should be on the face of the skateboarders. How\nmuch they are enjoying this. They continue to pound him,\nover and over, like animals in on the prey.\n\nThis should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the\nfallen hoodlum. Even little kids are in the middle, beating\nthe guy.\n\nTelly looks up to the sky. He makes a loud noise as he\nclears his throat, like he's gathering mucus. Then he puts\nhis arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the\nhoodlum. His face is completely cracked and bloody. Telly\nsteps over him and spits a huge phlegm wad onto his face.\n\nCasper, still smiling, kicks the guy in the face.\n\nCASPER\nSuck my dick, Suck my dick. Suck my dick.\n\nEveryone stops kicking the guy and they all get kinda silent\nand look at him. He looks completely twisted, bloody, and\ndead.\n\nCasper bends over, right in his face.\n\nCASPER\n(smiling)\nNow get in my way! Bitch.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\n\nINT. / EXT. TAXICAB - GOING DOWNTOWN - EVENING\n\nJennie is in the back of a speeding cab. She is looking out\nthe window. Her face looks sad.\n\nThe TAXI DRIVER is a funny looking old man.

Can I ask you a question?\n\nJennie just shrugs.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nCan I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a\npest.\n\nJENNIE\nWhat?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was\nlooking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you,\nbut your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be\nof any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin.\nHelp make you happy. Who knows? Somethin maybe.\n\nAs the taxi driver talks, he looks in the mirror, and then\nlooks at the road. He is driving fast and clumsy. He pulls\nout his cigar and then puts it back in his mouth.\n\nJENNIE\nNo. I'm OK. Thanks.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYou're OK?\n\nJENNIE\nYeah.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nBecause gee, you don't look OK. I mean your a very beautiful\nyoung lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...\n\nJENNIE\nYeah well, it's been a bad day.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nA bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was\nsmashed over by a car and when my wife found out she\ncollapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack.\nPartial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way.\nNot me. It's not good for the soul.\n\nThe taxi driver begins to laugh a really squeaky laugh.\n\nJENNIE\nSorry.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who\nknows? You don't. No one does.\n\nJennie continues to look glumly out the window.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYou know. I could tell you were sad by the way your eyes\ndrooped. Like an adopted kid. That's the way an adopted\nkid's eyes look. All sad like that. All droopy and sweet.\nLike the honey that I lick off my finger.\n\nHe starts to laugh. Jennie continues to look sadly out the\nwindow.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWould I be prying if I asked you what was wrong?\n\nJennie is silent.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nMiss, would I be prying?\n\nJENNIE\nEverything is wrong.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nNo, not everything?

The taxi driver looks in the mirror and sees\nJennie smiling.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nNow that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you\nsmile. Like a glamour girl.\n\nJENNIE\nYeah?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom\nqueen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center\nof her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis.\nYou know you look a little bit like her.\n\nJENNIE\nThanks.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a\ncrush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in\nher mouth.\n\nHe stops at a red light and turns around to look at her.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nHey look. Whatever it is. Just forget about it. Life's too\nshort. Make yourself happy. I'll give you an example. When\nmy golden retriever passed away. God rest his soul.\n(he punches the roof of the cab)\nI was lonesome. I missed him. So I got a tattoo.\n\nHe pulls up his shirt and reveals a tattoo of a dog on his\nforearm. It says \"Bruno\" in big letters.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nNow how do you like that? Now he's with me forever.\n\nThe light turns and he starts driving.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nI swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight\noff my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.\n\nJENNIE\nYeah?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should\nmake yourself happy.\n\nJENNIE\nWhat if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything\nfalls apart?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You\nforget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My\ngrandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, \"Leon,\nmy darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't\nthink. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't\ntalk\" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be\nhappier.\n\nHe starts to laugh.\n\nA quick shot of his identification badge. He has a really\ngoofy smile and he's wearing the same Hawaiian shirt.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nThat's life.\n\nJennie is smiling.\n\nJENNIE\nYour a real philosopher.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.\n\nHe pulls up on Washington Square Park. He slams on the\nbrakes and turns around in his seat.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell here we are, Miss.\n\nJennie pulls some money out.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nAw, don't worry 'bout it. The rides on me.\n\nJennie has the money up to the glass.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nAll right, all right, I'll take it. But forget about the\ntip.\n\nHe takes her money.\n\nJENNIE\nThanks. Bye.\n\nThe taxi driver sticks his head out the window.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh yeah. Oh Miss. Miss. When you smile, God notices. That's\nwhy the sun is shining.\n\nHe points up to the sky before pulling away.\n\n\nEXT. LOWER EAST SIDE - APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING\n\nTelly is standing in the road in front of Darcy's apartment\nbuilding.

Great)\n\n[Verse 1: FatBoy SSE]\nAll this expensive linen got me feelin' like John with the Beatles\nLifestyle high fashion, I went and spent about three on my denim\nRollin' down Abbey Road and I'm drivin' slow, blowin' gas out the foreign, uh\nFeelin' like oh, darling, I cannot leave you, no, Iike I'm McCartney, uh\nNow and then I think I need you\nBut sometimes I feel like I don't\nChrome Heart the chain, gang swang\nAll this money make me cold, uh\nDrippin' in Dior-y fabrics\nMoney comin' in, no nitro\nNone of my bitches average\nAnd my neck and wrist look like a light show with the pyro\n[Chorus: FatBoy SSE]\nAll this money treat me different\nBaddies treat me like I'm Hendrix\nCartier frames be my lensies\nBlack Beatle, John Lennon\nBig ol' baguetties, boogers in my tennis\nMike Amiri's with the spinach\nAw yeah, Black Beatle, John Lennon\nGoing to fly away\nCan you imagine?\nA nigga so classic\nMike Amiri be my fashion\nFly away\nCan you imagine?\nLifestyle ain't average\nJohn Lennon with the Patek\n\n[Verse 2: Blueface & FatBoy SSE]\n(Uh-uh-uh)\nPut your bitch and my bitch on the same flight (Yeah, ayy)\nLeft her in the room, get your act right\nDiamonds bussin', came from bustin' the bag bite\nNow I'm in that new GT with the frog lights\nBlack on black but I'm steppin' in Off-White\nNow all they wanna hear is, \"Yeah, aight\"\nBut they do not wanna hear if you aight\nOh yeah\nIf he good wanna be my babymama for my babymama\nIf my mans died, gotta watch his daughter\nIf the well fell, I gotta fill the water\nWeight of the world on my shoulders\nIt's gettin' harder to look over my shoulders\nIt's heavy, these kinda problems could never be studied (Oh, oh, oh)\nGotta keep it on me (Oh, oh, oh)\nGotta keep it real, do you really want me, or you need me?\nShe only hit me when she see me\nTrendin' in the blogs and all in the TV\nYou never ask how it feel just to be me\nThey think 'cause I got it all, all that is easy\nAll this money did was make this shit harder\nBein' broke was easy, only one problem (Oh, oh, oh)\nYou might also like[Chorus: FatBoy SSE]\nAll this money treat me different\nBaddies treat me

everywhere around you\nBeckon you to turn the other way\nBut I say the results are superficial\nThere's only one way to play\n\nGive-when you have anything at all to give\nYou have everything to live for\n(Give all you've got to give)\nAfter you've given all you can\nGive again, give again, give again\nGive - when you have anything at all to give\nYou have everything to live for\n(Give all you've got to give)\nAfter you've given all you can\nGive again, give again, give again\n\nPut your head where your feet are going\n'Cause the good outweighs the bad\nIt's you that should be - you should be knowing\nIt's for what you give not what you have\nWhen it seems you - you can't give enough\nRealize it's the good you do it for\nSo when the going gets a little bit tough\nYou've got to give a little bit more\n\nGive-when you have anything at all to give\nYou have everything to live for\n(Give all you've got to give)\nAfter you've given all you can\nGive again, give again, give again\n\nGive-when you have anything at all to give\nYou have everything to live for\n(Give all you've got to give)\nAfter you've given all you can\nGive again, give again, give again\nYou might also likeWhen you're looking for an answer\nNothing seems to fit\nDon't give up\nYou've got to let your heart become the\nMirror of your mind\nGive in\n\nDon't wait for something to cause you reason\nSet your goal let your mind follow through\nWhen you feel something to believe in\nYou'll make all your dreams, all your dreams come true\n\nGive-when you have anything at all to give\nYou have everything to live for\n(Give all you've got to give)\nAfter you've given all you can\nGive again, give again, give again\n\nGive-when you have anything at all to give\nYou have everything to live for\n(Give all

to see\nMarble halls open doors\nSomeone found the key\n\n[Verse 2]\nUnderground sight and sound\nHuman Symphony\nHeard the voice had no choice\nNeeded to be free\nFly me high touch the sky\nLeft the earth below\nHeard the line saw the sign\nKnew which way to go\nCos it's easier to try\nThan to prove it can't be done\nAnd it's easier to stay\nThan to turn around and run\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a blue world\nIt takes somebody to help somebody\nOh it's a blue world\nIt's a new world\nIt needs somebody to love somebody\nOh it's a blue world\n\n[Verse 3]\nHeart and soul took control\nTook control of

On Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIt's her first night on the town since she was just eighteen\nA lady down on love and out of hope and dreams\nThe ties that once bound her now are broke away\nAnd she's like a baby, just learning how to play\nShe never thought that love could ever end so soon\nHer mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon\nWhen he asked her to marry and she gladly said okay\nAnd a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, she's a lady down on love\nShe needs somebody to gently pick her up\nShe's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound\nTo a man who would love her and never let her down\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I know a lady that's down on her love\n'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch\nBut work took me a way from home late at nights\nAnd I wasn't there when she turned out the lights\nThen both of us got lonely and I gave into lust\nAnd she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust\n\n[Chorus]See Alabama LiveGet tickets as low as $35You
