please promise me?\nLove me tomorrow like today\nLove me tomorrow, hurry back\nCan't you see I need you much more than yesterday?\n\n[Verse 2: Peter Cetera]\nYou know it's always cold at night\nIt's always lonely until the dawn\nAnd though it's not what we both want\nKnowing she's there, I'll carry on\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Peter Cetera]\nShe loves me and that's all I need to know\nShe's part of my life\nJust a part I won't let go\nThen she said\n\n[Chorus: Peter Cetera]\nLove me tomorrow Won't you please promise me?\nLove me tomorrow like today\nLove me tomorrow, hurry back\nCan't you see I need you more than any words can say?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Peter Cetera]\nShe loves me and that's all I need to know\nShe's part of my life\nJust a part I won't let go\nThen she said\nSee Chicago LiveGet

Deever\nDr. Jim Bayliss (Jim)\nSue Bayliss\nFrank Lubey\nLydia Lubey\nBert\nAct One\n\nThe back yard of the Keller home in the outskirts of an American town.\u00a0\u00a0August of our era.\nThe stage is hedged on right and left by tall, closely planted poplars which lend the yard a secluded\natmosphere.\u00a0\u00a0Upstage is filled with the back of the house and its open, unroofed porch which extends\ninto the yard some six feet.\u00a0\u00a0The house is two stories high and has seven rooms.\u00a0\u00a0It would have cost\nperhaps fifteen thousand in the early twenties when it was built.\u00a0\u00a0Now it is nicely painted, looks tight\nand comfortable, and the yard is green with sod, here and there plants whose season is gone.\u00a0\u00a0At the\nright, beside the house, the entrance of the driveway can be seen, but the poplars cut off view of its\ncontinuation downstage.\u00a0\u00a0In the left corner, downstage, stands the four\u2010foot\u2010high stump of a slender\napple tree whose upper trunk and branches lie toppled beside it, fruit still clinging to its branches.\nDownstage right is a small, trellised arbor, shaped like a sea shell, with a decorative bulb hanging from\nits forward\u2010curving roof.\u00a0\u00a0Carden chairs and a table are scattered about.\u00a0\u00a0A garbage pail on the ground\nnext to the porch steps, a wire leaf\u2010burner near it.\nOn the rise:\u00a0\u00a0It is early Sunday morning.\u00a0\u00a0Joe Keller is sitting in the sun reading the want ads of the\nSunday paper, the other sections of which lie neatly on the ground beside him.\u00a0\u00a0Behind his back, inside\nthe arbor, Doctor Jim Bayliss is reading part of the paper at the table.\nKeller is nearing sixty.\u00a0\u00a0A heavy man of stolid mind and build, a business man these many years, but with\nthe imprint of the machine\u2010shop worker and boss still upon him.\u00a0\u00a0When he reads, when he speaks, when\nhe listens, it is with the terrible concentration of the uneducated man for whom there is still wonder in\nmany commonly known things, a man whose judgements must be dredged out of experience and a\npeasant\u2010like common sense.\u00a0\u00a0A man among men.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDoctor Bayliss is nearly forty.\u00a0\u00a0A wry self\u2010controlled man, an easy talker, but with a wisp of sadness that\nclings even to his self\u2010effacing humor.\nAt curtain, Jim is standing at left, staring at the broken tree.\u00a0\u00a0He taps a pipe on it, blows through the\npipe, feels in his pockets for tobacco, then speaks.\nJim:\u00a0\u00a0Where's your tobacco?\nKeller: I think I left it on the table.\nJim goes slowly to table on the arbor, fings a pouch, and sits there on the bench, filling his pipe.\nKeller: Gonna rain tonight.\nJim: Paper says so?\nKeller: Yeah, right here.\nJim: Then it can't rain.\nFrank Lubey enters, through a small space between the poplars.\u00a0\u00a0Frank is thirty two but balding.\u00a0\u00a0A\npleasant, opinionated man, uncertain of himself, with a tendency toward peevishness when crossed, but\nalways wanting it pleasantly and neighborly.\u00a0\u00a0He rather saunters in, leisurely, nothing to do.\u00a0\u00a0He does not\nnotice Jim in the arbor.\u00a0\u00a0On his greeting, Jim does not bother looking up.\nFrank: Hya.\nKeller: Hello, Frank.\u00a0\u00a0What's doin'?\nFrank: Nothin'.\u00a0\u00a0Walking off my breakfast. {looks up at the sky} That beautiful?\u00a0\u00a0Not a cloud in the sky.\nKeller: {looking up} Yeah, nice.\nFrank: Every Sunday ought to be like this.\nKeller: {indicating the sections beside him} Want the paper?\nFrank: What's the difference, it's all bad news.\u00a0\u00a0What's today's calamity?\nKeller: I don't know, I don't read the news part anymore.\u00a0\u00a0It's more interesting in the want ads.\nFrank: Why, you trying to buy something?\nKeller: No, I'm just interested.\u00a0\u00a0To see what people want, y'know?\u00a0\u00a0For instance here's a guy is lookin' for\ntwo Newfoundland dogs.\u00a0\u00a0Now what's he want with two Newfoundland dogs?\nFrank: That is funny.\nKeller: Here's another one.\u00a0\u00a0Wanted, old dictionaries.\u00a0\u00a0High prices paid.\u00a0\u00a0Now what's a man going to do\nwith an old dictionary?\nFrank: Why not?\u00a0\u00a0Probably a book collector.\nKeller: You mean he'll make a living out of that?\nFrank: Sure, there's a lot of them.\nKeller: {shaking his head} All the kind of business goin' on.\u00a0\u00a0In my day, either you were a lawyer, or a\ndoctor, or you worked in a shop. Now...\nFrank: Well, I was going to be a forester once.\nKeller: Well, that shows you.\u00a0\u00a0In my day, there was no such think.\u00a0\u00a0{Scanning the page, sweeping it with\nhis hand} You look at a page like this you realize how ignorant you are.\u00a0\u00a0{softly, with wonder, as he scans\npage} Psss!\nFrank: {noticing tree} Hey, what happened to your tree?\nKeller:\u00a0\u00a0Ain't that aweful?\u00a0\u00a0The wind must've got it last night.\u00a0\u00a0You heard the wind didn't you?\nFrank: Yeah, I got a mess in my yard, too.\u00a0\u00a0{goes to tree}\u00a0\u00a0What a pity.\u00a0\u00a0{turning to Keller} What did Kate\nsay?\nKeller: They're all asleep yet.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just waiting for her to see it.\nFrank: {struck} You know?\u00a0\u00a0Its funny.\nKeller: What?\nFrank: Larry was born in August.\u00a0\u00a0He'd be twenty\u2010seven this month.\u00a0\u00a0And his tree blows down.\nKeller: {touched}\u00a0\u00a0I'm surprised you remember his birthday, Frank.\u00a0\u00a0That's nice.\nFrank: Well, I'm working on his horoscope.\nKeller: How can you make him a horoscope?\u00a0\u00a0That's for the future, ain't it?\nFrank: Well, what I'm doing is this, see.\u00a0\u00a0Larry was reported missing on November twenty\u2010fifth, right?\nKeller: Yeah?\nFrank: Well, then, we assume that if he was killed it was on November twenty\u2010fifth.\u00a0\u00a0Now, what Kate\nwants...\nKeller: Oh, Kate asked you to amke a horoscope?\nFrank: Yeah, what she wants to find out is whther November twenty\u2010fifth was a favorable day for Larry.\nKeller: What is that, favorable day?\nFrank: Well, a favorable day for a person is a fortunate day, according to the stars.\u00a0\u00a0In other words it\nwould be practically impossible for him to have died on his favorable day.\nKeller: Well, was that his favorable day? November twenty\u2010fifth?\nFrank: That's what I'm working on to find out.\u00a0\u00a0It takes time!\u00a0\u00a0See, the point is, if November twenty\u2010fifth\nwas his favorable day, then it's completely possible he's alive somewhere, because, I mean, it's possible.\n{he notices Jim now.\u00a0\u00a0Jim is looking at him as though at an idiot. To Jim, with an uncertain laugh:} I didn't\neven see you.\nKeller: {to Jim} Is he talkin' sense?\nJim: He's alright.\u00a0\u00a0He's just completely out of his mind, that's all.\nFrank: {peeved} The trouble with you is, you don't believe in anything.\nJim: And your trouble is that you believe in anything.\u00a0\u00a0You didn't see my kid this morning, did you?\nFrank: No.\nKeller: Imagine?\u00a0\u00a0He walked off with his thermometer.\u00a0\u00a0Right out of his bag.\nJim: {getting up} What a problem.\u00a0\u00a0One look at a girl and he takes her temperature. {goes to the\ndriveway, looks upstage toward street}\nFrank: That boy's going to be a real doctor. He's smart.\nJim: Over my dead body he'll be a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A good beginning, too.\nFrank: Why? It's an honorable profession.\nJim: {looking at him tiredly} Frank, will you stop talking like a civics book?\u00a0\u00a0\nKeller laughs\nFrank: Why, I saw a movie a couple of weeks ago, reminded me of you.\u00a0\u00a0Here was a doctor in that\npicture...\nKeller: Don Ameche!\nFrank: I think it was, yeah. And he worked in his basement discovering things.\u00a0\u00a0That's what you ought to\ndo.\u00a0\u00a0You could help humanity instead of ...\nJim: I would love to help humanity on a Warner Brothers salary.\nKeller: {pointing at him, laughing} That's very good, Jim.\nJim: {looking toward house} Well, where's the beautiful girl that was supposed to be here?\nFrank: {excited} Annie came?\nKeller: Sure, sleepin' upstairs.\u00a0\u00a0We picked her up on the one o'clock train last night.\u00a0\u00a0Wonderful thing.\u00a0\u00a0\nGirl leaves here, a scrawny kid.\u00a0\u00a0Couple of years go by, she's a regular woman.\u00a0\u00a0Hardly recognized her,\nand she was running in and out of this yard all her life.\u00a0\u00a0That was a very happy family used to live in your\nhouse, Jim.\nJim:\u00a0\u00a0Like to meet her.\u00a0\u00a0The block can use a pretty girl.\u00a0\u00a0In the whole neighborhood there's not a damned\nthing to look at. {Sue, Jim's wife, enters.\u00a0\u00a0She is rounding forty, an overweight woman who fears it.\u00a0\u00a0On\nseeing her, Jim wryly adds:} except my wife, of course.\nSue: {in same spirit} Mrs. Adams is on the phone, you dog.\nJim: {to Keller} Such is the condition which prevails.\u00a0\u00a0{going to his wife} My love, my light.\nSue: Don't sniff around me. {pointing to their house:} And give her a nasty answer.\u00a0\u00a0I can smell the\nperfume over the phone.\nJim: What's the matter with her now?\nSue: I don't know dear.\u00a0\u00a0She sounds like she's in terrible pain.\u00a0\u00a0Unless her mouth is full of candy.\nJim: Why don't you just tell her to lay down?\nSue: She enjoys it more when you tell her to lay down.\u00a0\u00a0And when are you going to see Mr. Hubbard?\nJim: My dear, Mr. Hubbard is not sick, and I have better things to do than to sit there and hold his hand.\nSue: It seems to me that for ten dollars you could hold his hand.\nJim: {to Keller} If you son wants to play golf tell him I'm ready.\u00a0\u00a0Or if he'd like to take a trip around the\nworld for about thirty years. {he exits}\nKeller: Why do you needle him?\u00a0\u00a0He's a doctor, women are supposed to call him up.\nSue: All I said was Mrs. Adams is on the phone.\u00a0\u00a0Can I have some of your parsley?\nKeller: Yeah, sure. {Sue goes to parsley box and pulls some parsley} You were a nurse too long, Susie.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou're too ... too ... realistic.\nSue: {laughing, pointing at him} Now you said it!\nLydia Lubey enters.\u00a0\u00a0She is a robust, laughing girl of twenty\u2010seven.\nLydia: Frank, the toaster ... {sees the others} Hya.\nKeller: Hello!\nLydia: {to Frank} The toaster is off again.\nFrank: Well, plug it in, I just fixed it.\nLydia: {kindly, but insistently} Please, dear, fix it back like it was before.\nFrank: I don't know why you can't learn to turn on a simple thing like a toaster! {He exits}\nSue: {Laughing} Thomas Edison.\nLydia: {apologetically} He's really very handy. {she sees broken tree} Oh, did the wind get your tree?\nKeller: Yeah, last night.\nLydia: Oh, what a pity.\u00a0\u00a0Annie get in?\nKeller: She'll be down soon.\u00a0\u00a0Wait'll you meet her, Sue, she's a knockout.\nSue: I should've been a man. People are always introducing me to beautiful women. {to Joe:} Tell her to\ncome over later: I imagine she'd like to see what we did with her house.\u00a0\u00a0And thanks. {she exits}\nLydia: Is shee still unhappy, Joe?\nKeller: Annie?\u00a0\u00a0I don't suppose she goes around dancing on her toes, but she seems to be over it.\nLydia: She going to get married?\u00a0\u00a0Is there anybody ... ?\nKeller: I suppose... say, it's a couple of years already.\u00a0\u00a0She can't mourn a boy forever.\nLydia: It's so strange.\u00a0\u00a0Annie's here and not even married.\u00a0\u00a0And I've got three babies.\u00a0\u00a0I always thought\nit'd be the other way around.\nKeller: Well, that's what a war does.\u00a0\u00a0I had two sons, now I got one.\u00a0\u00a0It changed all the tallies.\u00a0\u00a0In my day\nwhen you had sons it was an honor.\u00a0\u00a0Today, a doctor could make a million dollars if he could figure out a\nway to bring a boy into the world without a trigger finger.\nLydia: You know, I was just reading...\nEnter Chris Keller from house, stands in doorway.\nLydia: Hya, Chris.\nFrank shouts from offstage.\nFrank: Lydia, come in here!\u00a0\u00a0If you want the toaster to work don't plug in the malted mixer.\nLydia: {embarrassed, laughing} Did I?\nFrank: And the next time I fix something don't tell me I'm crazy! Now come in here!\nLydia: {to Keller} I'll never hear the end of this one.\nKeller: {calling to Frank} So what's the difference?\u00a0\u00a0Instead of toast have a malted!\nLydia: Sh! sh! {she exits, laughing}\nChris watches her off.\u00a0\u00a0He is thirty\u2010two.\u00a0\u00a0Like his father, solidly built, a listener.\u00a0\u00a0A man capable of\nimmense affection and loyalty.\u00a0\u00a0He has a cup of coffee in one hand, part of a doughnut in the other.\nKeller: You want the paper?\nChris: That's all right, just the book section.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHe bends down and pulls out part of the paper on porch floor.\nKeller: You're always reading the book section and you never buy a book.\nChris: {coming down to settee} I like to keep abreast of my ignorance.\nHe sits on the settee.\nKeller: What is that, every week a new book comes out?\nChris: Lots of new books.\nKeller:\u00a0\u00a0All different?\nChris: All different.\nKeller shakes his head, puts knife down on bench, takes oilstone up to the cabinet.\nKeller: Psss! Annie up yet?\nChris: Mother's giving her breakfast in the dining room.\nKeller: {looking at the broken tree} See what happened to the tree?\nChris: {without looking up} Yeah.\nKeller: What's mother going to say?\nBert runs up from driveway.\u00a0\u00a0He is about eight. He jumps on stool, then on Keller's back.\nBert: You're finally up.\nKeller: {swinging him around and putting him down} Ha! Bert's here!\u00a0\u00a0Where's Tommy?\u00a0\u00a0He's got his\nfather's thermometer again.\nBert: He's taking a reading.\nChris: What!\nBert: But it's only oral.\nKeller: Oh, well, there's no harm in oral.\u00a0\u00a0So what's new this morning, Bert?\nBert: Nothin'.\u00a0\u00a0{He goes to the broken tree, walks around it}\nKeller: Then you couldn't've made a complete inspection of the block.\u00a0\u00a0In the beginning, when I first\nmade you a policeman you used to come in every morning with something new.\u00a0\u00a0Now, nothin's ever\nnew.\nBert: Except some kids from Thirtieth Street.\u00a0\u00a0They started kicking a can down the block, and I made\nthem go away because you were sleeping.\nKeller: Now you're talkin', Bert.\u00a0\u00a0Now you're on the ball.\u00a0\u00a0First thing you know I'm liable to make you a\ndetective.\nBert: {pulling him down by the lapel and whispering in his ear} Can I see the jail now?\nKeller: Seein' the jail ain't allowed, Bert.\u00a0\u00a0You know that.\nBert: Aw, I betcha there isn't even a jail. I don't see any bars on the cellar windows.\nKeller: Bert, on my word of honor there's a jail in the basement.\u00a0\u00a0I showed you my gun, didn't I?\nBert: But that's a hunting gun.\nKeller: That's an arresting gun!\nBert: Then why don't you ever arrest anybody?\u00a0\u00a0Tommy sad another dirty word to Doris yesterday, and\nyou didn't even demote him.\nKeller chuckles and winks at Chris, who is enjoying all this.\nKeller: Yeah, that's a dangerous character, that Tommy.\u00a0\u00a0{beckons him closer} What word does he say?\nBert: {backing away quickly in great embarrassment} Oh, I can't say that.\nKeller: {grabbing him by the shirt and pulling him back} Well, gimme an idea.\nBert: I can't. It's not a nice word.\nKeller: Just whisper it in my ear.\u00a0\u00a0I'll close my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I won't even hear it.\nBert, on tiptoe, puts his lips to Keller's ear, then in unbearble embarrassment, steps back.\nBert: I can't, Mr. Keller.\nChris: {laughing} Don't make him do that.\nKeller: Okay, Bert.\u00a0\u00a0I take your word.\u00a0\u00a0Now go out, and keep both eyes peeled.\nBert: {interested} For what?\nKeller: For what! Bert, the whole neighborhood is depending on you.\u00a0\u00a0A policeman don't ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow peel them eyes!\nBert: {mystified, but willing} Okay. {he runs offstage back of arbor}\nKeller: {calling after him} And mum's the word, Bert.\nBert stops and sticks his head through the arbor.\nBert: About what?\nKeller: Just in general.\u00a0\u00a0Be v\u2010e\u2010r\u2010y careful.\nBert: {nodding in bewilderment} Okay. {he exits}\nKeller: {laughing} I got all the kids crazy!\nChris: One of these days, they'll all come in here and beat your brains out.\nKeller: What's she going to say? Maybe we ought to tell her before she sees it.\nChris: She saw it.\nKeller: How could she see it?\u00a0\u00a0I was the first one up.\u00a0\u00a0She was still in bed.\nChris: She was out here when it broke.\nKeller: When?\nChris: About four this morning. {indicating window above them} I heard it cracking and I woke up and\nlooked out.\u00a0\u00a0She was standing right there when it cracked.\nKeller: What was she doing out here four in the morning?\nChris: I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0When it cracked she ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen.\nKeller: Did you talk to her?\nChris: No, I... I figured the best thing was to leave her alone.\nPause.\nKeller: {deeply touched} She cried hard?\nChris: I could hear her right through the floor of my room.\nKeller: {after slight pause} What was she doing out here at that hour? {Chris silent.\u00a0\u00a0With an undertone\nof anger showing} She's dreaming about him again.\u00a0\u00a0She's walking around at night.\nChris: I guess she is.\nKeller: She's getting just like after he died. {slight pause} What's the meaning of that?\nChris: I don't know the meaning of it. {slight pause} But I know one thing, Dad.\u00a0\u00a0We've made a terrible\nmistake with Mother.\nKeller: What?\nChris: Being dishonest with her.\u00a0\u00a0That kind of thing always pays off, and now it's paying off.\nKeller: What do you mean, dishonest?\nChris: You know Larry's not coming back and I know it.\u00a0\u00a0Why do we allow her to go on thinking that we\nbelieve with her?\nKeller: What do you want to do, argue with her?\nChris: I don't want to argue with her, but it's time she realized that nobody believes Larry is alive any\nmore.\u00a0\u00a0{Keller simply moves away, thinking, looking at the ground}\u00a0\u00a0Why shouldn't she dream of him,\nwalk the nights waiting for him?\u00a0\u00a0Do we contradict her?\u00a0\u00a0Do we say straight out that we have no hope\nany more?\u00a0\u00a0That we haven't had any home for years now?\nKeller: {frightened at the thought} You can't say that to her.\nChris: We've got to say it to her.\nKeller: How're you going to prove it?\u00a0\u00a0Can you prove it?\nChris: For God's sake, three years!\u00a0\u00a0Nobody comes back after three years.\u00a0\u00a0It's insane.\nKeller: To you it is, and to me.\u00a0\u00a0But not to her.\u00a0\u00a0You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body\nand no grave, so where are you?\nChris: Sit down, Dad.\u00a0\u00a0I want to talk to you.\nKeller looks at him searchingly a moment\nKeller: The trouble is the Goddam newspapers.\u00a0\u00a0Every month some boy turns up from nowhere, so the\nnext one is going to be Larry, so...\nChris: All right, all right, listen to me. {slight pause.\u00a0\u00a0Keller sits on settee} You know why I asked Annie\nhere, don't you?\nKeller: {he knows, but} Why?\nChris: You know.\nKeller: Well, I got an idea, but... What's the story?\nChris: I'm going to ask her to marry me. {slight pause.\u00a0\u00a0Keller nods}\nKeller: Well, that's only your business, Chriss.\nChris: You know it's not only my business.\nKeller: What do you want me to do?\u00a0\u00a0You're old enough to know your own mind.\nChris: {asking, annoyed} Then it's all right, I'll go ahead with it?\nKeller: Well, you want to be sure Mother isn't going to...\nChris: Then it isn't just my business.\nKeller: I'm just sayin' ...\nChris: Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that? Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to Mother and\nshe throws a fit about it?\u00a0\u00a0You have such a talent for ignoring things.\nKeller: I ignore what I gotta ignore.\u00a0\u00a0The girl is Larry's girl.\nChris: She's not Larry's girl.\nKeller: From Mother's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl. {slight pause}\nNow you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm tellin' you I don't know where to go.\u00a0\u00a0\nSee?\u00a0\u00a0I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0Now what can I do for you?\nChris: I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because\nother people will suffer.\u00a0\u00a0My whole bloody life, time after time after time.\nKeller:\u00a0\u00a0You're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that.\nChris: To hell with that.\nKeller: Did you ask Annie yet?\nChris: I wanted to get this settled first.\nKeller: How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way Mother does?\nChris: Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.\u00a0\u00a0From her letters I think she's forgotten him.\u00a0\u00a0I'll find\nout.\u00a0\u00a0And then we'll thrash it out with Mother?\u00a0\u00a0Right? Dad, don't avoid me.\nKeller: The trouble is, you don't see enough women.\u00a0\u00a0You never did.\nChris: So what?\u00a0\u00a0I'm not fast with women.\nKeller: I don't see why it has to be Annie.\nChris: Because it is.\nKeller: That's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.\u00a0\u00a0You haven't seen her since you went to war.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's five years.\nChris: I can't help it.\u00a0\u00a0I know her best.\u00a0\u00a0I was brought up next door to her.\u00a0\u00a0These years when I think of\nsomeone for my wife, I think of Annie.\u00a0\u00a0What do you want, a diagram?\nKeller: I don't want a diagram... I...I'm... She thinks he's coming back Chris.\u00a0\u00a0You marry that girl and\nyou're pronouncing him dead.\u00a0\u00a0Now what's going to happen to mother?\u00a0\u00a0Do you know?\u00a0\u00a0I don't.\u00a0\u00a0{pause}\nChris: All right, then, Dad.\nKeller: {thinking Chris has retreated} Give it some more thougth.\nChris: I've given it three years of thought.\u00a0\u00a0I'd hoped that if I waited, Mother would forget Larry and then\nwe'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.\u00a0\u00a0But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get\nout.\nKeller: What the hell is this?\nChris: I'll get out.\u00a0\u00a0I'll get married and live some place else.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe in New York.\nKeller: Are you crazy?\nChris: I've been a good son too long, a good sucker.\u00a0\u00a0I'm through with it.\nKeller: You've got a business here.\u00a0\u00a0What the hell is this?\nChris: The business! The business doesn't inspire me.\nKeller: Must you be inspired?\nChris: Yes.\u00a0\u00a0I like it an hour a day.\u00a0\u00a0If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it\nbeautiful.\u00a0\u00a0I want a family, I want some kids, I want to build something that I can give myself to.\u00a0\u00a0Annie is\nin the middle of that.\u00a0\u00a0Now ... where to I find it?\nKeller: You mean... {goes to him} Tell me something, you mean you'd leave the business?\nChris: Yes. On this I would.\nKeller: {after a pause} Well... you don't want to think like that.\nChris: Then help me stay here.\nKeller: All right, but... but don't think like that.\u00a0\u00a0Because what the hell did I work for?\u00a0\u00a0That's only for you,\nChris, the whole shootin' match is for you!\nChris: I know that, Dad.\u00a0\u00a0Just you help me stay here.\nKeller: {putting a fist up to Chris's jaw} But don't think that way, you hear me?\nChris: I am thinking that way.\nKeller: {lowering his hand} I don't understand you, do I?\nChris: No, you don't.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a pretty tough guy.\nKeller: Yeah, I can see that.\nMother appears on porch.\u00a0\u00a0She is in her early fifties, a woman of uncontrolled inspirations and an\noverwhelming capacity for love.\nMother: Joe?\nChris: {going toward porch} Hello, Mom.\nMother: {indicating house behind her.\u00a0\u00a0To Keller} Did you take a bag from under the sink?\nKeller: Yeah, I put it in the pail.\nMother: Well, get it out of the pail.\u00a0\u00a0That's my potatoes.\nChris bursts out laughing.\u00a0\u00a0Goes up into alley.\nKeller: {laughing} I thought it was garbage.\nMother:\u00a0\u00a0Will you do me a favor, Joe?\u00a0\u00a0Don't be helpful.\nKeller: I can afford another bag of potatoes.\nMother: Minnie scoured that pail in boiling water last night.\u00a0\u00a0It's cleaner than your teeth.\nKeller: And I don't understand why, after I worked forty years and I got a maid, why I have to take out\nthe garbage.\nMother: If you would make up your mind that every back in the kitchen isn't full of garbage you\nwouldn't be throwing out my vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Last time it was the onions.\nChris comes on, hands her bag.\nKeller: I don't like garbage in the house.\nMother: Then don't eat. {she goes into the kitchen with bag}\nChris: That settles you for today.\nKeller: Yeah, I'm in last place again. I don't know, once upon a time I used to think that when I got\nmoney again I would have a maid and my wife would take it easy.\u00a0\u00a0Now I got money, and I got a maid,\nand my wife is workin' for the maid.\u00a0\u00a0{he sits in one of the chairs}\nMother comes out on last line.\u00a0\u00a0She carries a pot of string beans.\nMother: It's her day off, what are you crabbing about?\nChris: {to Mother} Isn't Annie finished eating?\nMother: {looking around preoccupiedly at yard} She'll be right out. {moves} That wid did some job on\nthis place.\u00a0\u00a0{of the tree} So much for that, thank Got.\nKeller: {indicating chair beside him} Sit down, take it easy.\nMother: {pressing her hand to top of her head} I've got such a funny pain on the top of my head.\nChris: Can I get you an aspirin?\nMother picks a few petals off ground, stands there smelling them in her hand, then sprinkles them over\nplants.\nMother: No more roses.\u00a0\u00a0It's so funny... everything decides to happen at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0This month is is\nbirthday, his tree blows down, Annie comes.\u00a0\u00a0Everything that happened seems to be coming back.\u00a0\u00a0I was\njust down the cellar, and what do I stumble over?\u00a0\u00a0His baseball glove.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't seen it in a century.\nChris: Don't you think Annie looks well?\nMother: Fine.\u00a0\u00a0There's no question about it.\u00a0\u00a0She's a beauty... I still don't know what brought her here.\u00a0\u00a0\nNot that I'm not glad to see her, but...\nChris: I just thought we'd all like to see each other again. {mother just looks at him, nodding ever so\nslightly, almost as though admitting something} And I wanted to see her myself.\nMother: {as her nods halt, to Keller} The only think is I think her nose got longer.\u00a0\u00a0But I'll always love that\ngirl.\u00a0\u00a0She's one that didn't jump into bed with somebody else as soon as it happened with her fella.\nKeller: {as though that were impossible for Annie} Oh, what're you...\nMother: Never mind.\u00a0\u00a0Most of them didn't waid till the telegrams were opened.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just glad she came,\nso you can see I'm not completely out of my mind.\u00a0\u00a0{sits, and rapidly breaks string beans in the pot}\nChris: Just because she isn't married doesn't mean she's been mourning Larry.\nMother: {with an undercurrent of observation} Why then isn't she?\nChris: {a little flustered} Well... it could have been any number of things.\nMother: {directly at him} Like what, for instance?\nChris: {embarrassed, but standing his ground} I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0Whatever it is.\u00a0\u00a0Can I get you an aspirin?\nMother puts her hand to her head.\u00a0\u00a0She gets up and goes aimlessly toward the trees on rising.\nMother: It's not like a headache.\nKeller: You don't sleep, that's why.\u00a0\u00a0She's wearing out more bedroom slippers than shoes.\nMother: I had a terrible night. {she stops moving} I never had a night like that.\nChris: {looking at Keller} What was it, Mom? Did you dream?\nMother: More, more than a dream.\nChris: {hesitantly} About Larry?\nMother: I was fast asleep and... {raising her arm over the audience} Remember the way he used to fly\nlow past the house when he was in training?\u00a0\u00a0When we used to see his face in the cockpit going by?\u00a0\u00a0\nThat's the way I saw him.\u00a0\u00a0Only high up.\u00a0\u00a0Way, way up, where the clouds are.\u00a0\u00a0He was so real I could\nreach out and touch him.\u00a0\u00a0And suddenly he started to fall.\u00a0\u00a0And crying, crying to me...Mom, Mom!\u00a0\u00a0I\ncould hear him like he was in the room. Mom! ...it was his voice!\u00a0\u00a0If I could touch him I knew I could stop\nhim, if I could only... {breaks off, allowing her outstretched hand to fall}\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I woke up and it was so funny.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe wind... it was like the roaring of his engine.\u00a0\u00a0I came out here... I must've still been half asleep.\u00a0\u00a0I\ncould hear that roaring like he was going by.\u00a0\u00a0The tree snapped right in front of me... and I like... came\nawake.\u00a0\u00a0{she is looking at tree.\u00a0\u00a0She suddenly realizes something, turns with a reprimanding finger\nshaking slightly at Keller.}\u00a0\u00a0See?\u00a0\u00a0We should never have planted that tree.\u00a0\u00a0I said so in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0It\nwas too soon to plant a tree for him.\nChris: {alarmed} Too soon!\nMother: {angering} We rushed into it. Everybody was in such a hurry to bury him.\u00a0\u00a0I sad not to plant it\nyet. {to Keller:} I told you to...!\nChris: Mother, Mother! {she looks into his face} The wind blew it down.\u00a0\u00a0What significance has that got?\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat are you talking about?\u00a0\u00a0Mother, please... Don't go through it all again, will you?\u00a0\u00a0It's no good, it\ndoesn't accomplish anything.\u00a0\u00a0I've been thinking, y'know? ...maybe we ought to put our minds to\nforgetting him?\nMother: that's the third time you've said that this week.\nChris: Because it's not right.\u00a0\u00a0We never took up our lives again.\u00a0\u00a0We're like at a railroad station waiting\nfor a train that never comes in.\nMother: {pressing the top of her head}\u00a0\u00a0Get me an aspirin, heh?\nChris: Sure, and let's break out of this, heh, Mom?\u00a0\u00a0I thought the four of us might go out to dinner a\ncouple of nights, maybe go dancing out at the shore.\nMother: Fine. {to Keller} We can do it tonight.\nKeller: Swell with me!\nChris: Sure, let's have some fun. {to Mother} You'll start with this aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0{he goes up and into the\nhouse with new spirit.\u00a0\u00a0Her smile vanishes}\nMother: {with an accusing undertone} Why did he invite her here?\nKeller: Why does that bother you?\nMother: She's been in New York three and a half years, why all of a sudden...?\nKeller: Well, maybe... maybe he just wanted to see her.\nMother: Nobody comes seven hundred miles \"just to see\".\nKeller: What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why shouldn't he want to see her\nagain? {Mother looks at him critically} Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told\nyou.\nMother: {a warning and a question} He's not going to marry her.\nKeller: How do you know he's even thinking about it?\nMother: It's got that about it.\nKeller: {sharply watching her reaction} Well? So what?\nMother: {alarmed} What's going on here Joe?\nKeller: Now listen, kid...\nMother: {avoiding contact with him} She's not his girl, Joe.\u00a0\u00a0She knows she's not.\nKeller: You can't read her mind.\nMother: Then why is she still single?\u00a0\u00a0New York is full of men, why isn't she married? {pause} Probably a\nhundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.\nKeller: How do you know why she waited?\nMother: She knows what I know, that's why.\u00a0\u00a0She's faithful as a rock.\u00a0\u00a0In my worst moments, I think of\nher waiting, and I know again that I'm right.\nKeller:\u00a0\u00a0Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?\nMother: {warningly} Nobody in this house dast take her faith away, Joe.\u00a0\u00a0Strangers might.\u00a0\u00a0But not his\nfather, not his brother.\nKeller: {exasperated} What do you want me to do? What do you want?\nMother: I want you to act like he's coming back. Both of you.\u00a0\u00a0Don't think I haven't noticed you since\nChris invited her.\u00a0\u00a0I won't stand for any nonsense.\nKeller: But, Kate...\nMother: Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself!\u00a0\u00a0Laugh.\u00a0\u00a0Laugh at me. {She points to tree}\u00a0\u00a0\nBut why did that happen the very night she came back?\u00a0\u00a0She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial\nbreaks in pieces.\u00a0\u00a0Look at it. Look.\u00a0\u00a0{She sits on bench} Joe...\nKeller: Calm yourself.\nMother: Believe with me, Joe.\u00a0\u00a0I can't stand all alone.\nKeller: Calm yourself.\nMother: Only last week a man turned up in Detroit, missing longer than Larry. You read it yourself.\nKeller: All right, all right, calm yourself.\nMother: You above all have got to believe, you...\nKeller: {rising} Why me above all?\nMother: Just don't stop believing.\nKeller: What does that mean, me above all?\nBert comes rushing on.\nBert: Mr. Keller! Say, Mr. Keller... {pointing up the driveway} Tommy just said it again!\nKeller: {not remembering any of it} Said what? Who?\nBert: The dirty word.\nKeller: Oh. Well...\nBert: Gee, aren't you going to arrest him?\u00a0\u00a0I warned him.\nMother: {with suddenness} Stop that, Bert.

In five minutes thirty nine\nstrange people are sitting at the table telling her their life storie.\nMother: If I can't ask Annie a personal question ...\nKeller: Asking her is all right, but don't beat her over the head.\u00a0\u00a0You're beatin' her, you're beatin' her.\u00a0\u00a0\n{they are laughing}\nAnn takes pan of beans off the stool, buts them on floor under chair and sits.\nAnn: {to Mother} Don't let them bulldoze you.\u00a0\u00a0Ask me anything you like.\u00a0\u00a0What do you want to know,\nKate?\u00a0\u00a0Come on, let's gossip.\nMother: {to Chris and Keller} She's the only one is got any sense.\u00a0\u00a0{to Ann} Your Mother ... She's not\ngetting a divorce, heh?\nAnn: No, she's calmed down about it now.\u00a0\u00a0I think when he gets out they'll probably live together.\u00a0\u00a0In\nNew York, of course.\nMother: That's fine.\u00a0\u00a0Because your father is still ...

I don't expect you to wait for him but ...\nAnn: {kindly} But that's what you meant, isn't it?\nMother: Well ... yes.\nAnn: Well, I'm not, Kate.\nMother: {faintly} You're not?\nAnn: Isn't it ridiculous?\u00a0\u00a0You don't really imagine he's ...?\nMother: I know, dear, but don't say it's ridiculous, because the papers were full of it.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know about\nNew York, but there was half a page about a man missing even longer than Larry, and he turned up in\nBurma.\nChris: {coming to Ann} He couldn't have wanted to come home very badly, Mom.\nMother: Don't be so smart.\nChris: You can have a helluva time in Burma.\nAnn: {rises and swings around in back of Chris} So I've heard.\nChris: Mother, I'll bet you money that you're the only woman in the country who after three years is still\n...\nMother: You're sure?\nChris: Yes, I am.\nMother: Well, if you're sure then you're sure. {She turns her head away for an instant} They don't say it\non the radio but I'm sure that in the dark of night they're still waiting for their sons.\nChris: Mother, you're absolutely ...\nMother: {waving him off} Don't be so damned smart! Now stop it!\u00a0\u00a0{slight pause} There are a few things\nyou don't know.\u00a0\u00a0All of you.\u00a0\u00a0And I'll tell you one of them, Annie.\u00a0\u00a0Deep, deep in your heart you've always\nbeen waiting for him.\nAnn: {resolutely} No, Kate.\nMother: {with increasing demand} But deep in your heart, Annie!\nChris: She ought to know, shouldn't she?\nMother: Don't let them tell you what to think.\u00a0\u00a0Listen to your heart.\u00a0\u00a0Only your heart.\nAnn: Why does your heart tell you he's alive?\nMother: Because he has to be.\nAnn: But why, Kate?\nMother: {going to her} Because certain things have to be, and certain things can never be.\u00a0\u00a0Like the sun\nhas to rise, it has to be.\u00a0\u00a0That's why there's Got.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise anything could happen.\u00a0\u00a0But there's God, so\ncertain things can never happen.\u00a0\u00a0I would know, Annie ... just like the day he {indicates Chris} went into\nthat terrible battle.\u00a0\u00a0Did he write me?\u00a0\u00a0Was it in the papers?\u00a0\u00a0No, but that morning I couldn't raise my\nhead off the pillow.\u00a0\u00a0Ask Joe.\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, I knew.\u00a0\u00a0I knew!\u00a0\u00a0And he was nearly killed that day.\u00a0\u00a0Ann, you\nknow I'm right!\nAnn stands there in silence, then turns trembling, going upstage.\nAnn: No, Kate.\nMother: I have to have some tea.\nFrank appears, carrying a ladder.\nAnn: {taking his hand} Why, Frank, you're loosing your hair.\nKeller: He's got responsibility.\nFrank: Gee whiz!\nKeller: Without Frank the stars wouldn't know when to come out.\nFrank: {laughs. To Ann} You look more womanly.\u00a0\u00a0You've matured. You ...\nKeller: Take it easy, Frank, you're a married man.\nAnn: {as they laugh}\u00a0\u00a0You still haberdashering?\nFrank: Why not?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I too can get to be president.\u00a0\u00a0How's your brother?\u00a0\u00a0Got his degree, I hear.\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0Oh, George has his own office now!\nFrank: Don't say! {funereally} And your dad?\u00a0\u00a0Is he ...?\nAnn: {abruptly} Fine.\u00a0\u00a0I'll be in to see Lydia.\nFrank: {sympathetically} How about it, does Dad expect a parole soon?\nAnn: {with growing ill\u2010ease}\u00a0\u00a0I realy don't know, I ...\nFrank:\u00a0\u00a0{staunchly defending her father for her sake}\u00a0\u00a0I mean because I feel, y'know, that if an intelligent\nman like your father is put in prison, there ought to be a law that says either you execute him, or let him\ngo after a year.\nChris: {interrupting} Want a hand with that ladder, Frank?\nFrank: {taking cue}\u00a0\u00a0That's all right, I'll ... {picks up ladder}\u00a0\u00a0I'll finish the horoscope tonight, Kate.\u00a0\u00a0\n{embarrassed} See you later, Ann, you look wonderful.\u00a0\u00a0{he exits.\u00a0\u00a0They look at Ann}\nAnn: {to Chris, as she sits slowly on stool} Haven't they stopped talking about Dad?\nChris: {comes down and sits on arm of chair} Nobody talks about him any more.\nKeller: Gone and forgotten, kid.\nAnn: Tell me.\u00a0\u00a0Because I don't want to meet anybody on the block if they're going to ...\nChris: I don't want you to worry about it.\nAnn: {to Keller} Do they still remember the case, Joe?\u00a0\u00a0Do they talk about you?\nKeller: The only one still talks about it is my wife.\nMother: That's because you keep on playing policeman with the kids.\u00a0\u00a0All their parents hear out of you is\njail, jail, jail.\nKeller: Actually what happened was that when I got home from the penitentiary the kids get very\ninterested in me. You know kids.\u00a0\u00a0I was {laughs} like the expert on the jail situation.\u00a0\u00a0And as time passed\nthey got it confused and ... I ended up a detective.\u00a0\u00a0{laughs}\nMother:\u00a0\u00a0Except that they didn't get it confused.\u00a0\u00a0{to Ann} He hands out police badges from the Post\nToasties boxes.\u00a0\u00a0{they laugh}\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnn rises and comes to Keller, putting her arm around his shoulder.\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0{wonderously at them, happy} Gosh, it's wonderful to hear you laughing about it.\nChris: Why, what'd you expect?\nAnn: The last thing I remember on this block was one word ... \"Murderers!\"\u00a0\u00a0Remember that, Kate?\u00a0\u00a0Mrs.\nHammond standing in front of our house yelling that word?\u00a0\u00a0She's still around, I suppose?\nMother: They're all still around.\nKeller:\u00a0\u00a0Don't listen to her.\u00a0\u00a0Every Saturday night the whole gang is playin' poker in this arbor.\u00a0\u00a0All the\nones who yelled murderer takin' my money now.\nMother: Don't, Joe.\u00a0\u00a0She's a sensitive girl, don't fool her.\u00a0\u00a0{to Ann} They still remember about Dad.\u00a0\u00a0It's\ndifferent with him. {indicates Joe} He was exonerated, your father's still there.\u00a0\u00a0That's why I wasn't so\nenthusiastic about your coming.\u00a0\u00a0Honestly, I know how sensitive you are and I told Chris, I said...\nKeller:\u00a0\u00a0Listen, you do like I did and you'll be all right.\u00a0\u00a0The day I come home, I got out of my car ... but\nnot in front of the house... on the corner.\u00a0\u00a0You should've been here, Annie, and you too Chris.\u00a0\u00a0You'd'a\nseen something.\u00a0\u00a0Everybody know I was getting out that day.\u00a0\u00a0The porches were loaded.\u00a0\u00a0Picture it now.\u00a0\u00a0\nNone of them believed I was innocent.\u00a0\u00a0The story was, I pulled a fast one getting myself exonerated.\u00a0\u00a0So I\nget out of my car, and I walk\u00a0\u00a0down the street.\u00a0\u00a0But very slow.\u00a0\u00a0And with a smile.\u00a0\u00a0The beast!\u00a0\u00a0I was the\nbeast ... the guy who sold cracked cylinder heads to the Army Air Force ... the guy who made twenty one\nP\u201040s crash in Australia.\u00a0\u00a0Kid, walkin' down the street that day I was guilty as hell.\u00a0\u00a0Except I wasn't, and\nthere as a court apper in my pocket to prove I wasn't, and I walked ... past ... the porches.\u00a0\u00a0Result?\u00a0\u00a0\nFourteen months later I had one of the best shops in the state again, a respected man again, bigger than\never.\nChris: (with admiration) Joe McGuts.\nKeller:\u00a0\u00a0(now with great force): That's the only way you lick 'em is guts! (To Ann)\u00a0\u00a0The worst thing yoiu\ndid was to move away from here.\u00a0\u00a0You made it tough for your father when he gets out.\u00a0\u00a0That's why I tell\nyou, I like to see him move back right on this block.\nMother: (pained) How could they move back?\nKeller: It ain't gonna end till they move back!\u00a0\u00a0(to Ann) Till people play cards with him again, and talk\nwith him, and smile with him ... you play cards with a man you know he can't be a murderer.\u00a0\u00a0And the\nnext time you write him I like you to tell him just what I said. (Ann simply stares at him)\u00a0\u00a0You hear me?\nAnn: (surprised) Don't you hold anything against him?\nKeller: Annie, I never believed in crucifying people.\nAnn: (mystified) But he was your partner, he dragged you through the mud.\nKeller: Well, he ain't my sweetheart, but you gotta forgive, don't you?\nAnn: You, either, Kate?\u00a0\u00a0Don't you feel any ...?\nKeller: (to Ann) The next ime you write Dad ...\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0I don't write him.\nKeller: (struck) Well, every now and then you ...\nAnn: (a little shamed, but determined) No, I've never written to him.\u00a0\u00a0Neither has my brother.\u00a0\u00a0(to Chris)\nSay, do you feel this way, too?\nChris: He murdered twenty one pilots.\nKeller: What the hell kinda talk is that?\nMother: That's not a thing to say about a man.\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0What else can you say?\u00a0\u00a0When they took him away I followed him, went to him every visiting day.\u00a0\u00a0\nI was crying all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Until the news came about Larry.\u00a0\u00a0Then I realized.\u00a0\u00a0It's wrong to pity a man like\nthat.\u00a0\u00a0Father or no father, there's only one way to lookat him.\u00a0\u00a0He knowingly shipped out parts what\nwould crash an airplane.\u00a0\u00a0And how do you know Larry wasn't one of them?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMother:\u00a0\u00a0I was waiting for that.\u00a0\u00a0(going to her) As long as you're here, Annie, I want to ask you never to\nsay that again.\nAnn: You surprise me.\u00a0\u00a0I thought you'd be mad at him.\nMother:\u00a0\u00a0What your father did had nothing to do with Larry.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing.\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0But we can't know that.\nMother: (striving for control) As long as you're here!\nAnn: (perplexed) But, Kate...\nMother: Put that out of your head!\nKeller: Because...\nMother: (quickly to Keller) That's all, that's enough.\u00a0\u00a0(places her hand on her head) Come inside now,\nand have some tea with me. (She turns and goes up steps)\nKeller: (to Ann) The one thing you ...\nMother: (sharply) He's not dead, so there's no argument! Now come!\nKeller: (angrily) In a minute! (Mother turns and goes into house) Now look, Annie...\nChris:\u00a0\u00a0All right, Dad, forget it.\nKeller: No, she dasn't feel that way.\u00a0\u00a0Annie...\nChris: I'm sick of the whole subject, now cut it out.\nKeller: You want her to go on like this? (to Ann) Those cylinder heads when into P\u201040s only.\u00a0\u00a0What's the\nmatter with you?\u00a0\u00a0You know Larry never flew a P\u201040.\nChris: So who flew those P\u201040s, pigs?\nKeller: The man was a fool, but don't make a murderer out of him.\u00a0\u00a0You got no sense?\u00a0\u00a0Look what is does\nto her!\u00a0\u00a0(to Ann) Listen, you gotta appreciate what was doin' in that shop in the war.\u00a0\u00a0The both of you!\u00a0\u00a0It\nwas a madhouse.\u00a0\u00a0Every half hour the Major callin' for cylinder heads, they were whippin' us with the\ntelephone.\u00a0\u00a0The trucks were hauling them away hot, damn near.\u00a0\u00a0I mean just try to see it human, see it\nhuman.\u00a0\u00a0All of a sudden a batch comes out with a crack.\u00a0\u00a0That happens, that's the business.\u00a0\u00a0A fine,\nhairline crack.\u00a0\u00a0All right, so...so he's a little man, your father, always scared of loud voices.\u00a0\u00a0What'll the\nMajor say? Half a day's production shot... What'll I say?\u00a0\u00a0You know what I mean?\u00a0\u00a0Human. (he pauses)\u00a0\u00a0\nSo he take out his tools and he ... covers over the cracks.\u00a0\u00a0Alright,\u00a0\u00a0that's bad, it's wrong, but that's what\na little man does.\u00a0\u00a0If I could have gone in that day I'd a told him... Junk 'em Steve, we can afford it.\u00a0\u00a0But\nalone he was afraid.\u00a0\u00a0But I know he meant no harm.\u00a0\u00a0He believed they'd hold up a hundred percent.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat's a mistake, but it ain't murder.\u00a0\u00a0You mustn't feel that way about him.\u00a0\u00a0You understand me?\u00a0\u00a0It ain't\nright.\nAnn: (she regards him a moment) Joe, Let's forget it.\nKeller: Annie, the day the news came out about Larry he was in the next cell to mine...Dad.\u00a0\u00a0And he\ncried, Annie...he cried half the night.\nAnn: (touched) He shoulda cried all night.\u00a0\u00a0(slight pause)\nKeller: (almost angered) Annie, I do not understand why you ...!\nChris: (breaking in, with nervous urgency) Are you going to stop it?\nAnn: Don't yell at him.\u00a0\u00a0He just wants everybody happy.\nKeller: (clasps her around the waist, smiling) That's my sentiments.\u00a0\u00a0Can you stand steak?\nChris: And champagne?\nKeller: Now you're operatin'! I'll call Swanson's for a table!\u00a0\u00a0Big time tonight, Annie!\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0Can't scare me.\nKeller: (to Chris, pointing at Ann)\u00a0\u00a0I like that girl.\u00a0\u00a0Wrap her up.\u00a0\u00a0(they laugh.\u00a0\u00a0Goes up porch) You got nice\nlegs, Annie! ...I want to see everybody drunk tonight.\u00a0\u00a0(pointing at Chris) Look at him, he's blushin' (He\nexits, laughing, into the house).\nChris: (calling after him) Drink your tea, Casanova. (he turns to Ann) Isn't he a great guy?\nAnn: You're the only one I know who loves his parents.\nChris: I know.\u00a0\u00a0It went out of style, didn't it?\nAnn: (with a sudden touch of sadness)\u00a0\u00a0It's all right.\u00a0\u00a0It's a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0(She looks about)\u00a0\u00a0You know?\u00a0\u00a0It's\nlovely here.\u00a0\u00a0The air is sweet.\nChris: (hopefully) You're not sorry you came?\nAnn: Not sorry, no.\u00a0\u00a0But I'm ... not going to stay.\nChris: Why?\nAnn: In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.\nChris: Well...\nAnn: You saw that... and then you... You've been kind of...\nChris: What?\nAnn: Well... kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.\nChris:\u00a0\u00a0The trouble is I planned on kind of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.\u00a0\u00a0But they\ntake it for granted that we're all set.\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0I know they would.\u00a0\u00a0Your mother anyway.\nChris: How did you know?\nAnn: From her point of view, why else would I come?\nChris: Well... would you want to?\u00a0\u00a0(Ann still studies him) I guess you know this is why I asked you to\ncome.\nAnn: I guess this is why I came.\nChris: Ann, I love you.\u00a0\u00a0I love you a great deal.\u00a0\u00a0(finally) I love you.\u00a0\u00a0(Pause. She waits) I have no\nimagination .... That's all I know to tell you.\u00a0\u00a0(Ann is waiting, ready) I'm embarrassing you.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't want\nto tell it to you here. I wanted some place we'd never been, a place where we'd be brand new to each\nother... You feel it's wrong here, don't you?\u00a0\u00a0This yard, this chair?\u00a0\u00a0I want you to be ready for me.\u00a0\u00a0I don't\nwant to win you away from anything.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnn: (putting her arms around him) Oh, Chris, Ive been ready a long, long time.\nChris:\u00a0\u00a0Then he's gone for ever.\u00a0\u00a0You're sure.\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0I almost got married two years ago.\nChris: Why didn't you?\nAnn: You started to write me... (slight pause)\nChris: You felt something that far back?\nAnn: Every day since.\nChris: Ann, why didn't you let me know?\nAnn: I was waiting for you , Chris.\u00a0\u00a0Till then you never wrote. And when you did, what did you say?\u00a0\u00a0You\nsure can be ambiguous, you know.\nChris: (looks toward house, then at her, trembling) Give me a kiss, Ann. Give me a ...(they kiss) God, I\nkissed you, Annie, I kissed Anni. How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you!\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0I'll never forgive you. Why did you wait all these years? All Ive done is sit and wonder if I was crazy\nfor thinking of you.\nChris: Annie, we're going to live now!\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to make you so happy. (He kisses her, but without their\nbodies touching)\nAnn: (A little embarrassed) Not like that you're not.\nChris: I kissed you...\nAnn: Like Larry's brother.\u00a0\u00a0Do it like you, Chris. (He breaks away from her abruptly) What is it, Chris?\nChris: Let's drive some place... I want to be alone with you.\nAnn: No... what is it, Chris, your mother?\nChris: No... nothing like that.\nAnn: Then what's wrong? Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.\nChris: Yes.\u00a0\u00a0I suppose I have been.\u00a0\u00a0But it's going from me.\nAnn: You've got to tell me...\nChris: I don't know how to start. (He takes her hand)\nAnn: It wouldn't work this way. (Slight pause)\nChris: (speaks quietly, factually at first) It's all mixed up with so many other things ...You remember,\noverseas, I was in command of a company?\nAnn: Yeah, sure.\nChris: Well, I lost them.\nAnn: How many?\nChris: Just about all.\nAnn: Oh, gee!\nChris: It take a little time to toss that off. Because they weren't just men. For instance, one time it'd\nbeen raining several days and this kid came to me, and gave me his last pair of dry socks.\u00a0\u00a0Put them in\nmy pocket.\u00a0\u00a0That's only a little thing... but... That's the kind of guys I hd.\u00a0\u00a0They didn't die... They killed\nthemselves for each other.\u00a0\u00a0I mean that exactly.\u00a0\u00a0a little more selfish and they'd've been here today.\u00a0\u00a0And\nI got an idea ...watching them go down.\u00a0\u00a0Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed to me that\none new thing was made.\u00a0\u00a0A kind of... responsibility.\u00a0\u00a0Man for man.\u00a0\u00a0You understand me?\u00a0\u00a0To show that,\nto bring that onto the earth again like some kind of a monument and everyone would feel it standing\nthere, behind him, and it would make a difference to him. (pause) And then I came home and it was\nincredible.\u00a0\u00a0I.... there was no meaning in it here.\u00a0\u00a0The whole thing to them was a kind of a ... bus\naccident. I went to work with Dad, and that rat\u2010race again.\u00a0\u00a0I felt... what you said... ashamed somehow.\u00a0\u00a0\nBecause nobody was chaged at all.\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.\u00a0\u00a0I felt wrong to be\nalive, to open the bank\u2010book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.\u00a0\u00a0I mean you can take\nthose things out of a war, but when you drive that car you've got to know that it came out of the love a\nman can have for a man, you've got to be a little better because of that.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise what you have is\nreally loot, and there's blood on it.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't want to take any of it.\u00a0\u00a0And I gues that included you.\nAnn: And you still feel that way?\nChris: I want you know, Annie.\nAnn: Because you mustn't feel that way any more.\u00a0\u00a0Because you have a right to whatever you have.\u00a0\u00a0\nEverything, Chris, understand that? To me, too... And the money, there's nothing wrong in your money.\u00a0\u00a0\nYour father put hundereds of planes in the air, you should be proud.\u00a0\u00a0A man should be paid for that...\nChris: Oh Annie, Annie... I'm going to make a fortune for you!\nKeller: (offstage) Hello ... Yes. Sure.\nAnn: (laughing softly) What'll I do with a fortune? (they kiss. Keller enters from house)\nKeller: (thumbing toward house) Hey, Ann, your brother... (They step apart shyly. Keller comes down,\nand wryly) What's this, Labor Day?\nChris: (waving him away, knowing the kidding will be endless) All right, all right.\nAnn: You shouldn't burst out like that.\nKeller: Well, nobody told me it was Labor Day. (looks around) Where's the hot dogs?\nChris: (loving it) All right. You said it once.\nKeller: Well, as long as I know it's Labor Day from now on, I'll wear a bell around my neck.\nAnn: (affectionately) He's so subtle!\nChris: George Bernard Shaw as an elephant.\nKeller: George!\u00a0\u00a0...Hey, you kissed it out of my head ...your brother's on the phone.\nAnn: (surprised) My borother?\nKeller: Yeah, George.\u00a0\u00a0Long distance.\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0What's the matter, is anything wrong?\nKeller: I don't know, Kate's talking to him. Hurry up, She'll cost him five dollars.\nAnn: (takes a steop upstage, then comes down toward Chris) I wonder if we ought to tell your mother\nyet?\u00a0\u00a0I mean I'm not very good in an argument.\nChris: We'll wait till tonight.\u00a0\u00a0After dinner. Now don't get tense, just leave it to me.\nKeller: What're you telling her?\nChris: Go agead, Ann. (With misgivings, Ann goes up and into house.) We're getting married, Dad. (Keller\nnods indecisively) Well, don't you say anything?\nKeller: (distracted) I'm glad, Chris, I'm just... George is calling from Columbus.\nChris: Columbus!\nKeller: Did Annie tell you he was going to see his father today?\nChris: No, I don't think she knew anything about it.\nKeller: (asking uncomfortably) Chris! You... you think you know her pretty good?\nChris: (hurt and apprehensive) What kind of question?\nKeller: I'm just wondering. All these years George don't go to see his father.\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly he goes... and she\ncomes here.\nChris: Well, what about it?\nKeller: It's crazy, but it comes to my mind. She don't hold nothin' against me, does she?\nChris: (angry) I don't know what you're talking about.\nKeller: (a little more combatively) I'm just talkin'. To his last day in court the man blamed it all on me...\nand his is his daughter.\u00a0\u00a0I mean if she was sent here to find out something?\nChris: (angered) Why? What's there to find out?\nAnn: (on phone, offstage) Why are you so excited, George? What happened there?\nKeller: I mean if they want to open up the case again, for the nuisance value, to hurt us?\nChris: Dad... how could you think that of her?\nAnn: (still on the phone) But what did he say to you, for God's sake?\nKeller: It couldn't be, heh.\u00a0\u00a0You know.\nChris: Dad, you amaze me...\nKeller: (breaking in) All right, forget it forget it. (with great force, moving about) I want a clean start for\nyou, Chris. I want a new sign over the plant... Christopher Keller, Incorporated.\nChris: (a little uneasily) J. O. Keller is good enough.\nKeller: We'll talk about it. I'm going to build you a house, stone, with a driveway from the road. I want\nyou to spread out, Chris, I want you to use what I made for you. (He is close to him now) I mean, with\njoy, Chris, without shame... with joy.\nChris: (touched) I will, Dad.\nKeller: (with deep emotion) Say it to me.\nChris: Why?\nKeller: Because sometimes I think you're... ashamed of the money.\nChris: No, don't feel that.\nKeller: Because it's good money, there's nothing wrong with that money.\nChris: (a little frightened) Dad, you don't have to tell me this.\nKeller: (with overriding affection and self\u2010confidence now.\u00a0\u00a0He grips Chris by the back of the neck, and\nwith laughter between his determined jaws) Look, Chris, I'll go to work on Mother for you. We'll get her\nso drunk tonight we'll all get married. (steps away, with a wide hesture of his arm) There's gonna be a\nwedding, kid, like there never was seen! Champagne, tuxedos...!\nHe breaks off as Ann's voice comes out loud from the house where she is still talking on the phone.\nAnn: Simply because when you get excited you don't control yourself... (Mother comes out of house)\nWell, what did he tell you for God's sake? (Pause) All right, come then. (Pause) Yes, they'll all be here.\nNobody's running away from you. And try to get hold of yourself, will you? (Pause.) All right, all right.\nGoodbye.\nThere is a brief pause as Ann hangs up receiver, then comes out of kitchen.\nChris: Something happen?\nKeller: He's coming here?\nAnn: On the seven o'clock. He's in Columbus. (To Mother) I told him it would be all right.\nKeller: Sure, fine! Your father took sick?\nAnn: (mystified) No, George didn't say he was sick.\u00a0\u00a0I... (Shaking it off) I don't know, I suppose it's\nsomething stupid, you know my brother...(She comes to Chris) Let's go for a drive, or something....\nChris: Sure. Give me the keys, Dad.\nMother: Drive through the park. It's beautiful now.\nChris: Come on, Ann. (to them) Be back right away.\nAnn: (as she and Chris exit up driveway) See you.\nMother comes down toward Keller, her eyes fixed on him.\nKeller: Take your time. (to Mother) What does George want?\nMother: He's been in Columbus since this morning with Steve. He's gotta see Annie right away, he says.\nKeller: What for?\nMother: I don't know. (She speaks with warning) He's a lawyer now, Joe. George is a lawyer.\u00a0\u00a0All these\nyears he never even sent a postcard to Steve. Since he got back from the war, not a postcard.\u00a0\u00a0\nKeller: So what?\nMother: (her tension breaking out) Suddenly he takes an airplane from New York to see him.\u00a0\u00a0An\nairplane!\nKeller: Well? So?\nMother: (trembling) Why?\nKeller: I don't read minds. Do you?\nMother: Why, Joe? What has Steve suddenly got to tell him that he takes an airplane to see him?\nKeller: What do I care what Steve's got to tell him?\nMother: You're sure, Joe?\nKeller: (frightened, but angry) Yes, I'm sure.\nMother: (sits stiffly in a chair) Be smart now, Joe.\u00a0\u00a0The boy is coming. Be smart.\nKeller: (desperately) Once and for all, did you hear what I said? I said I'm sure!\nMother: (nods weakly) All right, Joe.\u00a0\u00a0(he straightens up) Just... be smart.\nKeller, in hopeless fury, looks at her, turns around, goes up to porch and into house, slamming screen\ndoor violently behind him. Mother sits in chair downstage, stiffly, staring, seeing.\nCURTAIN.\nAs twilight falls, that evening.\nOn the rise, Chris is discovered sawing the broken\u2010off tree, leaving stump standing alone.\u00a0\u00a0He is dressed\nin good pants, white shoes, but without a shirt. He disappears with tree up the alley when Mother\nappears on porch. She comes down and stands watching him. She has on a dressing gown, carries a tray\nof grape juice drink in a pitcher, and glasses with sprigs of mint in them.\nMother: (Calling up alley) Did you have to put on good pants to do that? (she comes downstage and puts\ntray on table in the arbor. Then looks around uneasily, then feels pitcher for coolness.\u00a0\u00a0Chris enters from\nalley brushing off his hands) You notice there more light with that thing gone?\nChris: My aren't you dressing?\nMother: It's suffocating upstairs. I made a grape drink for Georgie.\u00a0\u00a0He always liked grape.\u00a0\u00a0Come and\nhave some.\nChris: (impatiently) Well, come on, get dressed. And what's Dad sleeping so much for? (He goes to table\nand pours a glass of juice)\nMother: To his last day in court Steve never gave up the idea that Dad made him do it.\u00a0\u00a0If they're going\nto open the case again I won't live through it.\nChris: George is just a damn fool, Mother. How can you take him seriously?\nMother: That family hates us. Maybe even Annie...\nChris: Oh, now, Mother...\nMother: You think just because you like everbody, they like you!\nChris: All right, stop working yourself up.\u00a0\u00a0Just leave everything to me.\nMother: When George goes home tell her to go with him.\nChris: (noncommittally) Don't worry about Annie.\nMother: Steve is her father, too.\nChris: Are you going to cut it out? Now, come.\nMother: (going upstage with him) You don't realize how people can hate, Chris, they can hate so much\nthey'll tear the world to pieces.\nAnn, dressed up, appears on the porch.\nChris: Look! She's dressed already. (As he and Mother mount porch) I've just got to put on a shirt.\nAnn: (in a preoccupied way) Are you feeling well, Kate?\nMother: What's the difference, dear.\u00a0\u00a0There are certain people, y'know, the sicker they get, the longer\nthey live. (She goes into the house)\nChris: You look nice.\nAnn: We're going to tell her tonight.\nChris: Absolutely, don't worry about it.\nAnn: I wish we could tell her now. I can't stand scheming.\u00a0\u00a0My stomach gets hard.\nChris: It's not scheming, we'll just get her in a better mood.\nMother: (offstage, in the house) Joe, are you going to sleep all day!\nAnn: (laughing) The only one who's relaxed is your father.\u00a0\u00a0He's fast asleep.\nChris: I'm relaxed.\nAnn: Are you?\nChris: Look. (He holds out his hand and makes it shake.) Let me know when George gets here.\nHe goes into the house.\u00a0\u00a0Ann moves aimlessly, and then is drawn toward tree stump.\u00a0\u00a0She goes to it,\nhesitantly touches broken top in the hush of her thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0Offstage Lydia calls, \"Johnny! Come get your\nsupper!\" Sue enters, and halts, seeing Ann.\nSue: Is my husband...?\nAnn: (turns, startled) Oh!\nSue: I'm terribly sorry.\nAnn: It's all right, I ... I'm jst a little silly about the dark.\nSue: (looks about) It's getting dark.\nAnn: Are you looking for your husband?\nSue: As usual.\u00a0\u00a0(laughs tiredly) He spends so much time here, they'll be charging him rent.\nAnn: Nobody was dressed so he drove over to the depot to pick up my brother.\nSue: Oh, your brother's in?\nAnn: Yeah, they ought to be here any minute now.\u00a0\u00a0Will you have a cold drink?\nSue: I will, thanks.\u00a0\u00a0(Ann goes to table and pours) My husband.\u00a0\u00a0Too hot to drive me to the beach.\u00a0\u00a0Men\nare like little boys... for the neighbors they'll always cut the grass.\nAnn: People like to do things for the Kellers.\u00a0\u00a0Been that way since I can remember.\nSue: It's amazing.\u00a0\u00a0I gues your brother's coming to give you away, heh?\nAnn: (giving her drink) I don't know. I suppose\nSue: You must be all nerved up.\nAnn: It's always a problem getting yourself married, isn't it?\nSue: That depends on your shape, of course.\u00a0\u00a0I don't see why you should have had a problem.\nAnn: I've had chances...\nSue: I'll bet.\u00a0\u00a0It's romantic... It's very unusual to me, marrying the brother of your sweetheart.\nAnn: I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's mostly that whenever I need somebody to tell me the truth I've always\nthought of Chris. When he tells you something you know it's so.\u00a0\u00a0He relaxes me.\nSue: And he's got money.\u00a0\u00a0That's important, you know.\nAnn: It wouldn't matter to me.\nSue: You'd be surprised.\u00a0\u00a0It makes all the difference.\u00a0\u00a0I married an intern.\u00a0\u00a0On my salary.\u00a0\u00a0And that was\nbad, because as soon as a woman supports a man he owes her something.\u00a0\u00a0You can never owe\nsomebody without resenting them. (Ann laughs) That's true, you know.\nAnn: Underneath, I think the doctor is very devoted.\nSue: Oh, certainly. But it's bad when a man always sees the bars in front of him.\u00a0\u00a0Jim thinks he's in jail all\nthe time.\nAnn: Oh...\nSue: That's why I've been intending to ask you a small favor, Ann.\u00a0\u00a0It's something very important to me.\nAnn: Certainly, if I can do it.\nSue: You can.\u00a0\u00a0When you take up housekeeping, try to find a place away from here.\nAnn: Are you fooling?\nSue: I'm very serious. My husband is unhappy with Chris around.\nAnn: How is that?\nSue: Jim's a successful doctor.\u00a0\u00a0But he's got an idea he'd like to do medical research. Discover things. You\nsee?\nAnn: Well, isn't that good?\nSue: Research pays twenty five dollars a week minus laundering the hair shirt.\u00a0\u00a0You've got to give up\nyour life to go into it.\nAnn: How does Chris...\nSue: (with growing feeling) Chris makes people want to be better that it's possible to be.\u00a0\u00a0He does that\nto people.\nAnn: Is that bad?\nSue: My husband has a family, dear.\u00a0\u00a0Everytime he has a session with Chris he feels as though he's\ncompromising by not giving up everyting for research. As though Chris or anybody else isn't\ncompromising.\u00a0\u00a0It happens with Jim every couple of years. He meets a man and makes a statue out of\nhim.\nAnn: Maybe he's right.\u00a0\u00a0I don't mean that Chris is a statue, but...\nSue: Now darling, you know he's not right.\nAnn: I don't agree with you.\u00a0\u00a0Chris...\nSue: Let's face it, dear.\u00a0\u00a0Chris is working with his father, isn't he? He's taking money out of that business\nevery week in the year.\nAnn: What of it?\nSue: You ask me what of it?\nAnn: I certainly do.\u00a0\u00a0(She seems about to burst out) You oughtn't cast aspersions like that, I'm surprised\nat you.\nSue: You're surprised at me!\nAnn: He'd never take five cents out of that plant if there was anything wrong with it.\nSue: You know that.\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0I know it.\u00a0\u00a0I resent everything you've said.\nSue: (moving toward her) You know what I resent, dear?\nAnn: Please, I don't want to argue.\nSue: I resent living next to the Holy Family. It makes me look like a bum, you understand?\nAnn:\u00a0\u00a0I can't do anything about that.\nSue: Who is he to ruin a man's life?\u00a0\u00a0Everybody knows Joe pulled a fast one to get out of jail.\nAnn: That's not true!\nSue: Then why don't you go out and talk to people? Go on, talk to them.\u00a0\u00a0There's not a person on the\nblock who doesn't know the truth.\nAnn: That's a lie.\u00a0\u00a0People come here all the time for cards and...\nSue: So what?\u00a0\u00a0They give him credit for being smart. I do, too, I've got nothing against Joe.\u00a0\u00a0But if Chris\nwants people to put on the hair shirt let him take off the broadcloth.\u00a0\u00a0He's driving my husband crazy\nwith that phony idealism of his and I'm at the end of my rope on it! (Chris enters on porch, wearing shirt\nand tie now.\u00a0\u00a0She turns quickly, hearing. With a smile) Hello, darling. How's Mother?\nChris: I thought George came.\nSue: No, it was just us.\nChris: (coming down to them) Susie, do me a favor, heh? Go up to Mother and see if you can calm her.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe's all worked up.\nSue: She still doesn't know about you two?\nChris: (laughs a little) Well, she senses it, I guess.\u00a0\u00a0You know my mother.\nSue: (going up to porch) Oh, yeah, she's psychic.\nChris: Maybe there's something in the medicine chest.\nSue: I'll give her one of everything.\u00a0\u00a0(on porch) Don't worry about Kate... couple of drinks, dance her\naround a little... She'll love Ann.\u00a0\u00a0(To Ann) Because you're the female version of him.\u00a0\u00a0(Chris laughs) Don't\nbe alarmed, I said version.\u00a0\u00a0(She goes into house)\nChris: Interesting woman, isn't she?\nAnn: Yeah, she's very interesting.\nChris: She's a great nurse, you know, she...\nAnn: (in tension, but trying to control it) Are you still doing that?\nChris: (sensing something wrong, but still smiling) Doing what?\nAnn: As soon as you get to know somebody you find a distinction for them. How do you know she's a\ngreat nurse?\nChris: What's the matter, Ann?\nAnn: The woman hates you.\u00a0\u00a0She despises you!\nChris: Hey... What's hit you?\nAnn: Gee, Chris...\nChat happened here?\nAnn: You never... Why didn't you tell me?\nChris: Tell you what?\nAnn: She says they think Joe is guilty.\nChris: What difference does it make what they think?\nAnn: I don't care what they think, I just don't understand why you took the trouble to deny it. You said it\nwas all forgotten.\nChris: I didn't want you to feel there was anything wrong in you coming here, that's all.\u00a0\u00a0I know a lot of\npeople think my father was guilty, and I assumed there might be some question in your mind.\nAnn: But I never once suspected him.\nChris: Nobody says it.\nAnn: Chris, I know how much you love him, but it could never...\u00a0\u00a0\nChris: Do you think I could forgive him if he'd done that thing?\nAnn: I'm not here out of blue sky, Chris.\u00a0\u00a0I turned my back on my father, if there's anything wrong here\nnow...\nChris: I know that, Ann.\nAnn: George is coming from Dad, and I don't think it's with a blessing.\nChris: He's welcome here. You've got nothing to fear from George.\nAnn: Tell me that... just tell me that.\nChris: The man is innocent, Ann.\u00a0\u00a0Remember he was falsely accused once and it put him through hell.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow would you behave if you were faced with the same thing again? Annie, believe me, there's nothing\nwrong for you here, believe me, kid.\nAnn: All right, Chris, all right.\u00a0\u00a0(They embrace as Keller appears quietly on the porch. Ann simply studies\nhim)\nKeller: Every time I come out here it looks like Playland! (they break and laugh in embarrassment)\nChris: I thought you were going to shave?\nKeller: (sitting on bench) In a minute.\u00a0\u00a0I just woke up, I can't see nothin'.\nAnn: You look shaved.\nKeller: Oh, no. (massages his jaw) Gotta be extra special tonight. Big night, Annie. So how's it feel to be a\nmarried woman?\nAnn: (laughs) I don't know, yet.\nKeller: (to Chris) What's the matter, you slippin'? (He takes a little box of apples from under the bench as\nthey talk)\nChris: The great roue'!\nKeller: What is that, roue'?\nChris: It's French.\nKeller: Don't talk dirty. (they laugh)\nChris: (to Ann) You ever meet a bigger ignoramus?\nKeller: Well, somebody's got to make a living.\nAnn: (as they laugh) That's telling him.\nKeller: I don't know, everbody's gettin' so Goddam educated in this country there'll be nobody to take\naway the garbage. (they laugh) It's gettin' so the only dumb ones left are the bosses.\nAnn: You're not so dumn, Joe.\nKeller: I know, but you go into our plant, for instance.\u00a0\u00a0I got so many lieutenants, majors and colonels\nthat I'm ashamed to ask somebody to sweep the floor.\u00a0\u00a0I gotta be careful I'll insult somebody. No kiddin'.\nIt's a tragedy: you stand on the street today and spit, you're gonna hit a college man.\nChris: Well, don't spit.\nKeller: (breaks the apple in half, passing it to Ann and Chris) I mean to say, it's comin' to a pass. (he takes\na breath) I been thinkin', Annie... your brother, George.\u00a0\u00a0I been thinkin' about your brother George.\nWhen he comes I like you to brooch something to him.\nChris: Broach.\nKeller: What's the matter with brooch?\nChris: (smiling) It's not English.\nKeller: When I when to night school it was brooch.\nAnn: (laughing) Well, in day school it's broach.\nKeller: Don't surround me, will you? Seriously, Ann... You say he's not well.\u00a0\u00a0George, I been thinkin', why\nshould be know himself out in New York with that cut\u2010throat competition, when I got so many friends\nhere... I'm very friendly with some big lawyers in town.\u00a0\u00a0I could set George up here.\nAnn: That's awfully nice of you, Joe.\nKeller: No, kid, it ain't nice of me. I want you to understand me.\u00a0\u00a0I'm thinking of Chris. (slight pause)\nSee... this is what I mean. You get older, you want to feel that you... accomplished something.\u00a0\u00a0My only\naccomplishment is my son.\u00a0\u00a0I ain't brainy. That's all I accomplished. Now, a year, eighteen months, your\nfather'll be a free man.\u00a0\u00a0Who is he going to come to, Annie? His baby.\u00a0\u00a0You. He'll come, old, mad, into\nyour house.\nAnn: That can't matter any more, Joe.\nKeller: I don't what that to come between us. (gestures between Chris and himself)\nAnn: I can only tell you that that could never happen.\nKeller: You're in love now, Annie, but believe me, I'm older than you and I know... a daughter is a\ndaughter, and a father is a father.\u00a0\u00a0And it could happen. (he pauses) I like you and George to go to him in\nprison and tell him... \"Dad, Joe wants to bring you into the business when you get out.\"\nAnn: (surprised, even shocked) You'd have him as a partner?\nKeller: No, no partner. A good job. (pause.\u00a0\u00a0He sees she is shocked, a little mystified. He gets up, speaks\nmore nervously) I want him to know that when he gets out he's got a place waitin' for him.\u00a0\u00a0It'll take his\nbitterness away. To know you got a place...\nAnn: Joe, you owe him nothing.\nKeller: I owe him a good kick in the teeth, but he's your father.\nChris: Then kick him in the teeth! I don't want him in the plant, so that's that! You understand? And\nbesides, don't talk about him like that.\u00a0\u00a0People misunderstand you!\nKeller: And I don't understand why she has to crucify the man.\nChris: Well, it's her father if she feels...\nKeller: No, no.\nChris: (almost angrily) What's it to you? Why...?\nKeller: (a commanding outburst in high nervousness) A father is a father! (as though the outburst had\nrevealed him, he looks about, wanting to retract it. His hand goes to his cheek.) I better... I better shave.\n(He turns and a smile is on his face, to Ann) I didn't mean to yell at you, Annie.\nAnn: Let's forget the whole thing, Joe.\nKeller: Right. (to Chris) She's likeable.\nChris: (a little peaved at the man's stupidity) Shave, will you?\nKeller: Right again.\nAs he turns to porch Lydia comes hurrying from her house.\nLydia: I forgot all about it. (Seeing Chris and Ann) Hya. (To Joe) I promised to fix Kate's hair for tonight.\nDid she comb it yet?\nKeller: Always a smile, hey, Lidia?\nLydia: Sure, why not?\nKeller: (going up on porch): Come on up and comb my Katie's hair.\u00a0\u00a0(Lydia goes up on porch) She's got a\nbig night, make her beautiful.\nLydia: I will.\nKeller: (holds door open for her and she goes into kitchen.\u00a0\u00a0To Chris and Ann) Hey, that could be a song.\n(He sings softly) Come on up and comb my Katie's hair... Oh, come up and comb my Katie's hair.... Oh,\ncom on up, 'cause she's my lady fair.... (To Ann) how's that for one year of night school? (he continues\nsinging as he goes into kitchen) Oh, come on up, come on up, and comb my lady's hair....\nJim Bayliss rounds corner of driveway, walking rapidly.\u00a0\u00a0Jim crosses to Chris, motions him and pulls him\ndown excitedly.\u00a0\u00a0Keller stands just inside kitchen door, watching them.\nChris: What's the matter?\u00a0\u00a0Where is he?\nJim: Where's your mother?\nChris: Upstairs, dressing.\nAnn: (crossing to them rapidly) What happened to George?\nJim: I asked him to wait in the car. Listen to me now. Can you take some advice? (they wait) Don't bring\nhim in here.\nAnn: Why?\nJim: Kate is in bad shape, you can't explode this in front of her.\nAnn: Explode what?\nJim: You know why he's here, don't try to kit it away.\u00a0\u00a0There's blood in his eye; drive him somewhere and\ntalk to him alone.\nAnn turns to go up drive, takes a couble of steps, sees Keller, and stops.\u00a0\u00a0He goes quietly on into house.\nChris: (shaken, and therefore angered) Don't be an old lady.\nJim: He's come to take her home.\u00a0\u00a0What does that mean?\u00a0\u00a0(to Ann) You know what that means.\u00a0\u00a0Fight it\nout with him some place else.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnn: (comes back down toward Chris) I'll drive... him somewhere.\nChris: (goes to her) No.\nJim: Will you stop being an idiot?\nChris: Nobody's afraid of him here.\u00a0\u00a0Cut that out!\nHe starts for driveway, but is brought up short by George, who enters there.\u00a0\u00a0George is Chris's age, but a\npaler man, now on the edge of his self\u2010restraint.\u00a0\u00a0He speaks quietly, as though afraid to find himself\nscreaming.\u00a0\u00a0An instant's hesitation and Chris steps up to him, hand extended, smiling.\nChris: Helluva way to do;\u00a0\u00a0what're you sitting out there for?\nGeorge: Doctor said your mother isn't well, I...\nChris: So what?\u00a0\u00a0She'd want to see you, wouldn't she? We've been waiting for you all afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0(He\nputs his hand on George's arm, but George pulls away, coming across toward Ann).\nAnn: (touching his collar) This is filthy, didn't you bring another shirt?\nGeorge breaks away from her, and moves down, examining the yard. Door opens, and he turns rapidly,\nthinking it is Kate, but it's Sue.\u00a0\u00a0She looks at him; he turns away and moves to fence. He looks over it at\nhis former home. Sue comes downstage.\nSue: (annoyed) How about the beach, Jim?\nJim: Oh, it's too hot to drive.\nSue: How'd you get to the station... Zeppelin?\nChris: This is Mrs. Bayliss, George.\u00a0\u00a0(Calling, as George pays no attention, staring\u00a0\u00a0at house) George!\n(George turns) Mrs. Bayliss.\nSue: How do you do.\nGeorge: (removing his hat) You're the people who bought our house, aren't you?\nSue: That's right.\u00a0\u00a0Come and see what we did with it before you leave.\nGeorge: (walks down and waay from her) I liked it the way it was.\nSue: (after a brief pause) He's frank, isn't he?\nJim: (pulling her off) See you later... Take it easy, fella.\u00a0\u00a0(they exit)\nChris: (calling after them) Thanks for driving him! (Turning to George) How about some grape juice?\u00a0\u00a0\nMother made it especially for you.\nGeorge: (with forced appreciation) Good old Kate, remembered my grape juice.\nChris: You drank enough of it in this house. HOw've you been, George?\u00a0\u00a0...Sit down.\nGeorge: (keeps moving) It take me a minute. (looking around) It seems inpossible.\nChris: What?\nGeorge: I'm back here.\nChris: Say, youve gotten a little nervous, haven't you?\nGeorge: Yeah, toward the end of the day.\u00a0\u00a0What're you, big executive now?\nChris: Just kind of medium.\u00a0\u00a0How's the law?\nGeorge: I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0When I was studying in the hospital is seemed sensible, but outside there doesn't\nseem to be much of a law.\u00a0\u00a0The trees got thick, didn't they? (points to stump) What's that?\u00a0\u00a0\nChris: Blew down last night.\u00a0\u00a0We had it there for Larry.\u00a0\u00a0You know.\nGeorge: Why, afraid you'll forget him?\nChris: (starts for George) What kind of remark is that?\nAnn: (breaking in, putting a restraining hand of Chris) When did you start wearing a hat?\nGeorge: (discovers hat in his hand) Today. From now on I decided to look like a lawyer, anyway. (He hold\nis up to her) Don't you recognize it?\nAnn: Why? Where...?\nGeorge: Your father's... He asked me to wear it.\nAnn: How is he?\nGeorge: He got smaller.\nAnn: Smaller?\nGeorge: Yeah, little.\u00a0\u00a0(holds our his hand to measure) He's a little man. That's what happens to suckers,\nyou know.\u00a0\u00a0It's good I want to him in time... another year there'd be nothing left but his smell.\nChris: What's the matter, George, what's the trouble?\nGeorge: The trouble?\u00a0\u00a0The trouble is when you make suckers out of people once, you shouldn't try to do\nit twice.\nChris: What does that mean?\nGeorge: (to Ann) You're not married yet, are you?\nAnn: George, will you sit down and stop...?\nGeorge: Are you married yet?\nAnn: No, I'm not married yet.\nGeorge: You're not going to marry him.\nAnn: Why am I not going to marry him?\nGeorge: Because his father destroyed your family.\nChris: Now look, George...\nGeorge: Cut it short, Chris. Tell her to come home with me.\u00a0\u00a0Let's not argue, you know what I've got to\nsay.\nChris: George, you don't want to be the voice of God, do you?\nGeorge: I'm...\nChris: That's been your trouble all your life, George, you dive into things. What kind of statement is that\nto make? You're a big boy now.\nGeorge: I'm a big boy now.\nChris: Don't come bulling in here.\u00a0\u00a0If you've got something to say, be civilized about it.\nGeorge: Don't civilize me!\nAnn: Shhh!\nChris: (ready to hit him) Are you going to talk like a grown man or aren't you?\nAnn: (quickly, to forestall an outburst) Sit down, dear. Don't be angry, what's the matter? (He allows her\nto seat him, looking at her) Now what happened? You kissed me when I left, now you...\nGeorge: (breathlessly) My life turned upside down since then. I couldn't go back to work when you left.\u00a0\u00a0\nI wanted to go to Dad and tell him you were going to be married. It seemed impossible not to tell him.\nHe loved you so much. (He pauses) Annie... we did a terrible thing.\u00a0\u00a0We can never be forgiven. Not even\nto send him a card at Christmas.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't see him once since I got home from the war! Annie, you don't\nknow what was done to that man.\u00a0\u00a0You don't know what happened.\nAnn: (afraid) Of course I know.\nGeorge: You can't know, you wouldn't be here. Dad came to work that day. The night foreman came to\nhim and showed him the cylinder heads... they were coming out of the process with defects.\u00a0\u00a0There was\nsomething wrong with the process. So Dad went directly to the phone and called here and told Joe to\ncome down right away.\u00a0\u00a0But the morning passed. No sign of Joe.\u00a0\u00a0So Dad called again.\u00a0\u00a0By this time he\nhad over a hundred defectives.\u00a0\u00a0The Army was screaming for stuff and Dad didn't have anything to ship.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo Joe told him... on the phone he told him to weld, cover up the cracks in any way he could, and ship\nthem out.\nChris: Are you through now?\nGeorge: (surging back at him) I'm not through now! (Back to Ann) Dad was afraid. He wanted Joe there if\nhe was going to do it.\u00a0\u00a0But Joe can't come down... He's sick. Sick! He suddenly gets the flu! Suddenly! But\nhe promised to take responsibility.\u00a0\u00a0Do you understand what I'm saying? On the telephone you can't\nhave responsibility! In a court you can always deny a phone call and that's exactly what he did. They\nknow he was a liar the first time, but in the appeal they believed the rotten lie and now Joe is a big shot\nand your father is the patsy. (He gets up) Now what're you going to do? Eat his food, sleep in his bed?\nAnswer me. What're you going to do?\nChris: What are you going to do, George?\nGeorge: He's too smart for me, I can't prove a phone call.\nChris: Then how dare you come in heare whith that rot?\nAnn: George, the court...\nGeorge: The court didn't know your father! But you know him. You know in your heart Joe did it.\nChris: (whirling him around) Lower your voice or I'll throw you out of here!\nGeorge: She knows.\u00a0\u00a0She knows.\nChris: (to Ann) Get him out of here, Ann. Get him out of here.\nAnn: George, I know everything you've said. Dad told me that whole thing in court, and they...\nGeorge: (almost a scream) The court did not know him, Annie!\u00a0\u00a0\nAnn: Shhh! ...But he'll say anything, George.\u00a0\u00a0You know how quick he can lie.\nGeorge: (turning to Chris, with deliberation) I'll ask you something, and look me in the eye when you\nanswer me.\nChris: I'll look you in the eye.\nGeorge: You know your father...\nChris:\u00a0\u00a0I know him well.\nGeorge: And he's the kind of boss to let a hundred and twenty one cylinder heads be repaired and\nshipped out of his shop without even knowing it?\nChris: He's that kind of boss.\nGeorge: And that's the same Joe Keller who never left his shop without first going aroiund to see that all\nthe lights were out.\nChris: (with growing anger) The same Joe Keller.\nGeorge: The same man who knows how many minutes a day his workers spend in the toilet.\nChris: The same man.\nGeorge: Any my father, that frightened mouse who'd never buy a shirt without somebody along... That\nman would do such a thing on his own?\nChris: On his own. And because he's a frightened mouse this is another thing he'd do... Throw the blame\non somebody else in court but it didn't work, but with a fool like you it works!\nAnn: (deeply shaken) Don't talk like that!\nChris: (sits facing George)\u00a0\u00a0Tell me, George. What happened? The court record was good enough for you\nall these years, why isn't it good now?\u00a0\u00a0Why did you believe it all these years?\nGeorge: (after a slight pause) Because you believed it... That's the truth, Chris. I believed everything,\nbecause I thought you did. But today I heard it from his mouth. From his mouth it's altogether different\nthan the record. Anyone who knows him, and knows your father, will believe it from his mouth.\u00a0\u00a0Your\nDad took everything we have. I can't beat that. But she's one item he's not going to grab.\u00a0\u00a0(He turns to\nAnn) Get your things. Everything they have is covered with blood.\u00a0\u00a0You're not the kind of girl who can\nlive with that. Get your things.\nChris: Ann... You're not going to believe that, are you?\nAnn: (goes to him) You know it's not true, don't you?\nGeorge: How can he tell you? It's his father. (To Chris) None of these things ever even cross your mind?\nChris: Yes, they crossed my mind. Anything can cross your mind!\nGeorge: He knows, Annie. He knows!\nChris: The voice of God!\nGeorge: Then why isn't your name on the business? Explain that to her!\nChris: What the hell has that got to do with... ?\nGeorge: Annie, why isn't his hame on it?\nChris: Even when I don't own it!\nGeorge: Who're you kidding? Who gets it when he dies? (To Ann) Open your eyes, you know the both of\nthem, isn't that the first thing they'd do, the way they love each other? ...J. O. Keller and Son? (Pause.\nAnn looks from him to Chris) I'll settle it. Do you want to settle it, or are you afraid to?\nChris: What do you mean?\nGeorge: Let me go up and talk to your father. In ten minutes you'll have the answer. Or are you afraid of\nthe answer?\nChris: I'm not afraid of the answer. I know the answer. But my mother isn't well and I don't want a fight\nhere now.\nGeorge: Let me go to him.\nChris: You're not going to start a fight here now.\nGeorge: (To Ann) What more do you want! (There is a sound of footsteps in the house).\nAnn: (turns her head suddenly toward house) Someone's coming.\nChris: (to George, quietly) You won't say anything now.\nAnn: You'll go soon.\u00a0\u00a0I'll call a cab.\nGeorge: You're coming with me.\nAnn: And don't mention marriage, because we haven't told her yet.\nGeorge: You're coming with me.\nAnn: You understand? Don't... George, you're not going to start anything now! (She hears footsteps)\nShhh!\nMother enters on porch. She is dressed almost formally. Her hair is fixed. They are all turned toward her.\nOn seeing George she raises both hands, comes down toward him.\nMother: Georgie, Georgie.\nGeorge: (he has always liked her) Hello, Kate.\nMother: (cups his face in her hands) They made an old man out of you. (Touches his hair) Look, you're\ngrey.\nGeorge: (her pity, open and unabashed, reaches into him, and he smiles sadly) I know, I...\nMother: I told you when you went away, don't try for medals.\nGeorge: (laughs, tiredly) I didn't try, Kate. They made it very easy for me.\nMother: (actually angry) Go on. You're all alike. (To Ann) Look at him, why did you say he's fine? He\nlooks like a ghost.\nGeorge: (relishing her solicitude) I feel alright.\nMother: I'm sick to look at you. What's the matter with your mother, why don't she feed you?\nAnn: He just hasn't any appetite.\nMother: If he ate in my house he'd have an appetite. (to Ann) I pity your husband! (To George) Sit down.\nI'll make you a sandwich.\nGeorge: (sits with an embarrassed laugh) I'm really not hungry.\nMother: Honest to God, it breaks my heart to see what happened to all the children. How we worked\nand planned for you, and you end up no better than us.\nGeorge: (with deep feeling for her) You... you haven't changed at all, you know that, Kate?\nMother: None of us changed, Georgie. We all love you. Joe was just talking about the day you were born\nand the water got shut off. People were carrying basins from a block away... A stranger would have\nthought the whole block was on fire! (they laugh. She sees the juice. To Ann) Why didn't you give him\nsome juice!\nAnn: (defensively) I offered it to him.\nMother: (scoffingly) You offered it to him! (thrusting glass into George's hand) Give it to him! (To\nGeorge, who is laughing) And now you're going to sit here and drink some juice... and look like\nsomething!\nGeorge: (sitting) Kate, I feel hungry already.\nChris: (proudly) She could turn Mahatma Ghandi into a heavyweight!\nMother: (to Chris, with great energy) Listen, to hell with the restaurant! I got a ham in the icebox, and\nfrozen strawberries, and avocados, and...\nAnn: Swell, I'll help you!\nGeorge: The train leaves at eight thirty, Ann.\nMother: (to Ann) You're leaving?\nChris: No, Mother, she's not...\nAnn: (breaking through it, going to George) You hardly got here. Give yourself a chance to get\nacquainted again.\nChris: Sure, you don't even know us anymore.\nMother: Well, Chris, if they can't stay, I don't...\nChris: No, it's just a question of George, Mother, he planned on...\nGeorge: (gets up politely, nicely, for Kate's sake) Now wait a minute, Chris...\nChris: (smiling and full of command, cutting him off) If you want to go, I'll drive you to the station now,\nbut if you're staying, no arguments while you're here.\nMother: (at last confessing the tension) Why should he argue? (she goes to him. With desperation and\ncompassion, stroking his hair) Georgie and us have no argument. How could we have an argument,\nGeorgie? We all got hit by the same lightning, how can you...? Did you see what happened to Larry's\ntree, Georgie? (She has taken his arm, and unwillingly he moves across the stage with her.) Imagine?\nWhile I was dreaming of him in the middle of the night, the wind came along and...\nLydia enters on porch. As soon as she sees him:\nLydia: Hey, Georgie! Georgie! Georgie! Georgie! Georgie! (She comes down to him eagerly. She has a\nflowered hat in her hand, which Kate takes from her as she goes to George)\nGeorge: (As they shake hands eagerly, warmly) Hello, Laughy. What'd you do, grow?\nLydia: I'm a big girl now.\nMother: Look what he can do to a hat!\nAnn: (to Lydia, admiring the hat) Did you make that?\nMother: In ten minutes! (she puts it on)\nLydia: (fixing it on her head) I only rearranged it.\nGeorge: You still make your own clothes?\nChris: (of Mother) Ain't she classy! All she needs now is a Russian wolfhound.\nMother: (Moving her head) It feels like somebody is sitting on my head.\nAnn: No, it's beautiful, Kate.\nMother: (kisses Lydia. To George) She's a genius! You should've married her. (they laugh) This one can\nfeed you!\nLydia: (strangely embarrassed) Oh, stop that, Kate.\nGeorge: (to Lydia) Didn't I hear you had a baby?\nMother: YOu don't hear so good.\u00a0\u00a0She's got three babies.\nGeorge: (a little hurt by it. To Lydia) No kidding, three?\nLydia: Yeah, it was one, two, three... Youve been away a long time, Georgie.\nGeorge: I'm beginning to realize.\nMother: (to Chris and George) The trouble with you kids is you think to much.\nLydia: Well, we think, too.\nMother: Yes, but not all the time.\nGeorge: (With almost obvious envy) They never took Frank, heh?\nLydia: (a little apologetically) No, he was always one year ahead of the draft.\nMother: It's amazing. When they were calling boys twenty seven Frank was twenty eight, when they\nmade it twenty eight, he was just twenty nine. That's why he took up astrology.\u00a0\u00a0It's all in when you\nwere born, it just goes to show.\nChris: What does it go to show?\nMother: (to Chris) Don't be so intelligent. Some superstitions are very nice! (To Lydia) Did he finish\nLarry's horoscope?\nLydia: I'll ask him now, I'm going in. (to George, a little sadly, almost embarrassed) Would you like to see\nmy babies? Come on.\nGeorge: I don't think so, Lydia.\nLydia: (Understanding) All right.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you, George.\nGeorge: Thanks.\u00a0\u00a0And to you... And Frank. (She smiles at him, turns and goes off to her house. George\nstands staring after her).\nLydia: (as she runs off) Oh, Frank!\nMother: (Reading his thoughts) She got pretty, heh?\nGeorge: (sadly) Very pretty.\nMother: (as a reprimand) She's beautiful, you damned fool!\nGeorge: (looks around longingly, and softly, with a catch in his throat) She makes it seem so nice around\nhere.\nMother: (shaking her finger at him) Look what happened to you because you wouldn't listen to me! I\ntold you to marry that girl and stay out of the war!\nGeorge: (laughs at himself) She used to laugh too much.\nMother: And you din't laugh enough. While you were getting mad about Fascism Frank was getting into\nher bed.\nGeorge: (to Chris) He won the war, Frank.\nChris: All the battles.\nMother: (in pursuit of this mood) The day they started the draft, Georgie, I told you you loved that girl.\nChris: (laughs) And truer love hath no man!\nMother: I'm smarter than any of you.\nGeorge: (laughing) She's wonderful.\nMother: And now you're going to listen to me, George. You had big principles, Eagle Scouts the three of\nyou. So now I got a tree, and this one (indicating Chris) when the weather gets bad he can't stand on his\nfeet. And that big dope (pointing to Lydia's house) next door who never reads anything but Andy Gump\nhas three children and his house paid off. Stop being a philosopher, and look after yourself.\u00a0\u00a0Like Joe was\njust saying... You move back here, he'll help you get set, and I'll find you a girl and put a smile on your\nface.\nGeorge: Joe? Joe wants me here?\nAnn: (eagerly) He asked me to tell you, and I think it's a good idea.\nMother: Certainly. Why must you make believe you hate us? Is that another principle? ...That you have\nto hate us? You don't hate us, George, I know you, you can't fool me, I diapered you. (Suddenly, to Ann)\nYou remember Mr. Marcy's daughter?\nAnn: (laughing, to George) She's got you hooked already! (George laughs, is excited)\nMother: You look her over, George.\u00a0\u00a0You'll see she's the most beautiful...\nChris: She's got warts, George.\nMother: (to Chris) She hasn't got warts! (To George) So the girl has a little beauty mark on her chin...\nChris: And two on her nose.\nMother: You remember.\u00a0\u00a0Her father's the retired police inspector.\nChris: Seargent George.\nMother: He's a very kind man!\nChris: He looks like a gorilla.\nMother: (to George) He never shot anybody.\nThey all burst out laughing as Keller appears in the doorway. George rises abruptly and stares at Keller,\nwho comes rapidly down to him.\nKeller: (the laughter stops. With strained joviality) Well! Look who's here! (Extending his hand) Georgie,\ngood to see ya.\nGeorge: (shaking hands. Somberly) How're you, Joe?\nKeller: So\u2010so. Gettin' old. You comin' out to dinner with us?\nGeorge: No, got to be back in New York.\nAnn: I'll call a cab for you. (She goes up into the house)\nKeller: Too bad you can't stay, George. Sit down. (To mother) He looks fine.\nMother: He looks terrible.\nKeller: That's what I said, you look terrible, George. (They laugh) I wear the pants and she beats me with\nthe belt.\nGeorge: I saw your factory on the way from the station. It looks like General Motors.\nKeller: I wish it was General Motors, but it ain't. Sit down, George. Sit down. (Takes cigar out of his\npocket) So you finally went to see your father, I hear?\nGeorge: Yes, this morning. What kind of stuff do you make now?\nKeller: oh, little of everything. Pressure cookers, an assembly for washing machines. Got a nice, flexible\nplant now. So how'd you find Dad? Feel alright?\nGeorge: (searching Keller, speaking indecisively) No, he's not well, Joe.\nKeller: (lighting his cigar) Not his heart again, is it?\nGeorge: It's everything, Joe. It's his soul.\nKeller: (blowing out smoke) Uh huh....\nChris: How about seeing what they did with your house?\nKeller: Leave him be.\nGeorge: (to Chris, indicating Keller) I'd like to talk to him.\nKeller: Sure, he just got here. That's the way they do, George. A little man makes a mistake and they\nhang him by his thumbs. The big ones become ambassadors.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you'd\u2010a told me you were going to\nsee Dad.\nGeorge: (studying him) I didn't know you were interested.\nKeller: In a way, I am. I would like him to know, George, that as far as I'm concerned, any time he wants,\nhe's got a place with me. I would like him to know that.\nGeorge: He hates your guts, Joe. Don't you know that?\nKeller: I imagined it. But that can change, too.\nMother: Steve was never like that.\nGeorge: He's like that now. He'd like to take every man who made money in the war and put him up\nagainst a wall.\nChris: He'll need a lot of bullets.\nGeorge: And he'd better not get any.\nKeller: that's a sad thing to hear.\nGeorge: (with bitterness dominant) Why? What's you expect him to think of you?\nKeller: (the force of his nature rising, but under control) I'm sad to see he hasn't changed. As long as I\nknow him, twenty five years, the man never learned how to take the blame. You know that, George.\nGeorge: (he does) Well, I...\nKeller: But you do know it. Because the way you come in here you don't look like you remember it. I\nmean in nineteen thirty seven when we had the shop on Flood Street. And he damn near blew us all up\nwith that heater he left burning for two days without water. He wouldn't admit that was his fault, either.\nI had to fire a mechanic to save his face. You remember that.\nGeorge: Yes, but...\nKeller: I'm just mentioning it, George. Because this is just another one of a lot of things. Like when he\ngave Frank that money to invest in oil stock.\nGeorge: (distressed) I know that, I...\nKeller: (driving in, but restrained) But it's good to remember those things, kid. The way he cursed Frank\nbecause the stock went down. Was that Frank's fault? To listen to him Frank was a swindler. And all the\nman did was to give him a bad tip.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nGeorge: (gets up, moves away) I know those things...\nKeller: Then remember them, remember them.\u00a0\u00a0(Ann comes out of house) There are certain men in the\nworld who rather see everybody hung before they'll take blame. You understand me, George?\nThey stand facing each other, George trying to judge him.\nAnn: (coming downstage) The cab's on its way. Would you like to wash?\nMother: (with the thrust of hope) Why must he go? Make the midnight, George.\nKeller: Sure, you'll have dinner with us!\nAnn: How about it? Why not? We're eating at the lake, we could have a swell time.\nA long pause, as George looks at Ann, Chris, Keller, then back to her.\nGeorge: All right.\nMother: now you're talking.\nChris: I've got a shirt that'll go right with that suit.\nGeorge: Is Lydia...? I mean, Frank and Lydia coming?\nMother: I'll get you a date that'll make her look like a... (she starts upstage)\nGeorge: (laughing) No, I don't want a date.\nChris: I know somebody just for you! Charlotte Tanner! (he starts for the house)\nKeller: Call Charlotte, that's right.\nMother: Sure, call her up. (Chris goes into house)\nAnn: You go up and pick out a shirt and tie.\nGeorge: (stops, looks aroiund at them and the place) I never felt at home anywhere but here. I feel so...\n(he nearly laughs, and turns away from them) Kate, you look so young, you know? You didn't change at\nall. It ... rings an old bell. (turns to Keller) You too, Joe, you're amazingly the same. The whole\natmosphere is.\nKeller: Say, I ain't got time to get sick.\nMother: He hasn't been laid up in fifteen years.\nKeller: Except my flu during the war.\nMother: Huhh?\nKeller: Well, sure... (To George) I mean except for that flu. (George stands perfectly still) Well, it slipped\nmy mind, don't look at me that way. He wanted to go to the shop but he couldn't lift himself off the bed.\nI thought he had pneumonia.\nGeorge: Why did you say he's never....?\nKeller: I know how you feel, kid, I'll never forgive myself. If I could've gone in that day I'd never allwo\nDad to touch those heads.\nGeorge: She said you've never been sick.\nMother: I said he was sick, George.\nGeorge: (going to Ann) Ann, didn't you hear her say...?\nGeorge: Id remember pneumonia. Especially if I got it just the day my partner was going to patch up\ncylinder heads... What happened that day, Joe?\nFrank enters briskly from driveway, holding Larry's horoscope in his hand. He comes to Kate.\nFrank: Kate! Kate!\nMother: Frank, did you see George?\nFrank: (extending his hand) Lydia told me, I'm glad to... you'll have to pardon me. (pulling mother over)\nI've got something amazing for you, Kate, I finished Larry's horoscope.\nMother: You'd be interested in this, George. It's wonderful the way he can understand the...\nChris: (entering from house) George, the girl's on the phone...\nMother: (desperately) He finished Larry's horoscope!\nChris: Frank, can't you pick a better time than this?\nFrank: The greatest men who ever lived believed in the stars!\nChris: Stop filling her head with that junk!\nFrank: Is it junk to feel that there's a greater power than ourselves? I've studied the stars of his life! I\nwon't argue with you, I'm telling you. Somewhere in this world your brother is alive!\nMother: (instantly to Chris) Why isn't it possible?\nChris: Because its insane.\nFrank: Just a minute now. I'll tell you something and you can do as you please. Just let me say it. He was\nsupposed to have died on November twenty fifth. But November twenty fifth was his favorite day.\nThat's known, that's known, Chris!\nMother: Why isn't it possible, why isn't it possible, Chris!\nGeorge: (to Ann) Don't you understand what she's saying? She just told you to go. What are you waiting\nfor now?\nChris: Nobody can tell her to go. (A car horn is heard)\nMother: (to Frank) Thank you, darling, for your trouble. Will you tell him to wait, Frank?\nFrank: (as he goes) Sure thing.\nMother: (calling out) They'll be right out, driver!\nGeorge: You heard her say it, he's never been sick!\nMother: He misunderstood me, Chris! (Chris, looks at her, struck)\nGeorge: (to Ann) He simply told your father to kill pilots, and covered himself in bed!\nChris: You'd better answer him, Annie. Answer him.\nMother: I packed your bag, darling.\nChris: What?\nMother: I packed your bag. All you've got to do is close it.\nAnn: I'm not closing anything. He asked me here and I'm staying till he tells me to go. (To George) Till\nChris tells me!\nChris: That's all! How get out of here, George!\nMother: (to Chris) But if that's how he feels...\nChris: That's all, nothing more till Christ comes, about the case or Larry as long as I'm here! (to George)\nNow get out of here, George!\nGeorge: (to Ann) You tell me. I want to hear you tell me.\nAnn: Go, George!\nThey disappear up the driveway, Ann saying, \"Don't take it that way, Georgie! Please don't take it that\nway\".\nChris: (turning to his mother) What do you mean you packed her bag? How dare you pack her bag?\nMother: Chris...\nChris: How dare you pack her bag?\u00a0\u00a0\nMother: She doesn't belong here.\nChris: Then I don't belong here.\nMother: She's Larry's girl.\nChris: And I'm his brother and he's dead, and I'm marrying his girl\nMother: Never, never in this world!\nKeller: You lost your mind?\nMother: You have nothing to say!\nKeller: (cruelly) I got plenty to say. Three and a half years you\u00a0\u00a0been talking like a maniac...\nMother smashes him across the face.\nMother: Nothing. You have nothing to say. Now I say. He's coming back, and everybody has got to wait.\nChris: Mother, Mother...\nMother: Wait, wait...\nChris: How long? How long?\nMother: (rolling out of her) Till he comes. Forever and ever till he comes!\nChris: (as an ultimatum) Mother, I'm going ahead with it.\nMother: Chris, I've never said no to you in my life, now I say no!\nChris: You'll never let him go till I do it.\nMother: I'll never let him go and you'll never let him go!\nChris: I've let him go. I've let him go a long...\nMother: (with no less force, but turning from him) Then let your father go. (pause. Chris stands\ntransfixed)\nKeller: She's out of her mind.\nMother: Altogether! (To Chris, but not facing them) Your brother's alive, darling, because if he's dead,\nyour father killed him. Do you understand me now? As long as you live, that boy is alive. God does not\nlet a son be killed by his father. Now you see, don't you? Now you see. (Beyond control, she hurries up\nand into the house)\nKeller: (Chris has not moved. He speaks insinuatingly, questioningly) She's out of her mind.\nChris: (in a broken whisper) Then... you did it?\nKeller: (with the beginning of plea in his voice) He never flew a P\u201040...\nChris: (struck. Deadly) But the others.\nKeller: (insistently) She's out of her mind. (he takes a step toward Chris, pleadingly.)\nChris: (unyielding) Dad... you did it?\nKeller: He never flew a P\u201040, what's the matter with you?\nChris: (still asking, and saying) Then you did it. To the others.\nBoth hold their voices down.\nKeller: (afraid of him, his deadly insistence) What's the matter with you? What the hell is the matter\nwith you?\nChris: (quietly, incredibly) How could you do that? how?\nKeller: What's the matter with you!\nChris: Dad... Dad, you killed twenty one men!\nKeller: What, killed\nChris: You killed them, you murdered them.\nKeller: (as though throwing his whole nature open before Chris) how could I kill anybody?\nChris: Dad! Dad!\nKeller: (trying to hush him) I didn't kill anybody!\nChris: then explain it to me. What did you do? Explain it to me or I'll tear you to pieces!\nKeller: (horrified at his overwhelming fury) Don't, Chris, don't...\nChris: I want to know what you did, now what did you do? You had a hundred and twenty cracked\nengine heads, how what did you do?\u00a0\u00a0\nKeller: If your going to hang me then I...\nChris: I'm listening. God almighty, I'm listening!\nKeller: (their movements are those of subtle pursuit and escape. Keller keeps a step out of Chris's range\nas he talks: You're a boy, what could I do! I'm in business, a man is in business. A hundred and twenty\ncracked, you're out of business. You got a process, the process don't work you're out of business. You\ndon't know how to operate, your stuff is no good, they close you up, they tear up your contracts.\u00a0\u00a0What\nthe hell's it to them? You lay forty years into a business and they knock you out in five minutes, what\ncould I do, let them take forty years, let them take my life away? (his voice cracking) I never though\nthey'd install them. I swear to Got. I thought they'd stop 'em before anybody took off.\nChris: Then why'd you ship them out?\nKeller: By the time they could spot them I thought I'd have the process going again, and I could show\nthem they needed me and they'd let it go by. But weeks passed and I got no kick\u2010back, so I was going to\ntell them.\nChris: Then why didn't you tell them?\nKeller: it was too late. The paper, it was all over the front page, twenty one went down, it was too late.\nThey came with handcuffs into the shop, what could I do? (He sits on bench) Chris... Chris, I did it for\nyou, it was a chance and I took it for you. I'm sixty one years old, when would I have another chance to\nmake something for you? Sixty one years old you don't get another chance, do ya?\nChris: You even knew that they wouldn't hold up in the air.\nKeller: I didn't say that.\nChris: But you were going to warn them not to use them....\nKeller: But that doesn't mean...\nChris: It means you knew they'd crash.\nKeller: It don't mean that.\nChris: Then you thought they'd crash.\nKeller: I was afraid maybe...\nChris: You were afraid maybe! God in heaven, what kind of a man are you? Kids were hanging in the air\nby those heads. You knew that!\nKeller: For you, a business for you!\nChris: (with burning fury) For me! Where do you live, where have you come from? For me! ...I was dying\nevery day and you were killing my boys and you did it for me? What the hell do you think I was thinking\nof, the Goddam business? Is that as far as your mind can see, the business? What is that, the world of\nbusiness? What the hell do you mean, you did it for me? Don't you have a country? Don't you live in the\nworld? What the hell are you? You're not even an animal, no animal kills his own, what are you? What\nmust I do to you? I ought to tear the tongue out of your mouth, what must I do? (With his fist he pounds\ndown upon his father's shoulder. He stumbles away, covering his face as he weeps) What must I do,\nJesus God, what must I do?\nKeller: Chris... My Chris...\nCURTAIN\u00a0\u00a0\nTwo o'clock the following morning, Mother is discovered on the rise, rocking ceaselessly in a chair,\nstaring at her thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0It is an intense, slight, sort of rocking. A light shows from upstairs bedroom,\nlower floor windows being dark. The moon is strong and casts its bluish light.\nPresently Jim, dressed in jacked and hat, appears, and seeing her, goes up beside her.\nJim: Any news?\nMother: No news.\nJim: (gently) You can't sit up all night, dear, why don't you go to bed?\nMother: I'm waiting for Chris. Don't worry about me, Jim, I'm perfectly all right.\nJim: But it's almost two o'clock.\nMother: I can't sleep. (slight pause) You had an emergency?\nJim: (tiredly) Somebody had a headache and thought he was dying. (slight pause) Half of my patients are\nquite mad. Nobody realizes how many people are walking loose, and they're cracked as coconuts.\nMoney. Money\u2010money\u2010money\u2010money. You say it long enough it doesn't mean anything. (She smiles,\nmakes a silent laugh) Oh, how I'd love to be around when that happens!\nMother: (shaking her head) You're so childish, Jim! Sometimes you are.\nJim: (looks at her a moment) Kate. (Pause) What happened?\nMother: I told you. He had an argument with Joe. Then he got in the car and drove away.\nJim: What kind of an argument?\nMother: An argument, Joe... He was crying like a child, before.\nJim: They argued about Ann?\nMother: (after slight hesitation) No, not Ann. Imagine? (Indicates lighted window above) She hasn't\ncome out of that room since he left. All night in that room.\nJim: (looks up at window, then at her): What'd Joe do, tell him?\nMother: (stops rocking) Tell him what?\nJim: Don't be afraid, Kate, I know. I've always known.\nMother: How?\nJim: It occurred to me a long time ago.\nMother: I always had the feeling that in the back of his head, Chris... almost knew. I didn't think it would\nbe such a shock.\nJim: (gets up) Chris would never know how to live with a thing like that. It takes a certain talent... for\nlying. You have it, and I do. But not him.\nMother: What do you mean... He's not coming back?\nJim: Oh, no, he'll come back. We all come back, Kate. These private little revolutions always die. The\ncompromise is always made. In a peculiar way. Frank is right... every man does have a star. The star of\none's honesty. And you spend your life groping for it, but once it's out it never lights again. I don't think\nhe went very far. He probably just wanted to be alone to watch his star go out.\nMother: Just as long as he comes back.\nJim: I wish he wouldn't, Kate. One year I simply took off, went to New Orleans; for two months I lived on\nbananas and milk, and studied a certain disease. And then she came, and she cried. And I went back\nhome with her. And now I live in the usual darkness; I can't find myself; it's hard sometimes to\nremember the kind of man I wanted to be. I'm a good husband; Chris is a good son... He'll come back.\nKeller comes out on porch in dressing gown and slippers. He goes upstage...To alley. Jim goes to him.\nJim: I have the feeling he's in the park. I'll look for him. Put her to bed, Joe; this is no good for what she's\ngot. (Jim exits up driveway)\nKeller: (coming down) What does he want here?\nMother: His friend is not home.\nKeller: (comes down to her. His voice is husky) I don't like him mixing in so much.\nMother: It's too late, Joe. He knows.\nKeller: (apprehensively) How does he know?\nMother: He guessed it a long time ago.\nKeller: I don't like that.\nMother: (laughs dangerously, quietly into the line) What you don't like.\nKeller: Yeah, what I don't like.\nMother. You can't bull yourself through this one, Joe, you better be smart now. This thing...this thing is\nnot over yet.\nKeller: (indicating lighted window above)And what is she doing up there? She don't come out of the\nroom.\nMother: I don't know, what is she doing? Sit down, stop bing mad. You want to live? You better figure\nout your life.\nKeller: She don't know, does she?\nMother: Don't ask me, Joe.\nKeller: (almost an outburst) Then who do I ask? But I don't think she'll do anything about it.\nMother: You're asking me again.\nKeller: I'm askin' you. What am I, a stranger? I thought I had a family here. What happened to my\nfamily?\nMother: You've got a family. I'm simply telling you that I have to strength to think any more.\nKeller: You have no strength. The minute there's trouble you have no strength.\nMother: Joe, you're doing the same thing again. All your live whenever there's trouble you yell at me\nand you thing that settles it.\nKeller: Then what do I do? Tell me, talk to me, what do I do?\nMother: Joe... I've been thinking this way. If he comes back...\nKeller: What do you mean \"if\"? He's comin' back!\nMother: I think if you sit him down and you... explain yourself. I mean you ought to make it clear to him\nthat you know you did a terrible thing. (Not looking into his eyes) I mean if he saw that you realize what\nyou did. You see?\nKeller: What ice does that cut?\nMother: (a litle fearfully) I mean if you told him that you want to pay for what you did.\nKeller: (sensing... quietly) How can I pay?\nMother: Tell him... You're willing to go to prison. (pause)\nKeller: (struck, amazed) I'm willing to...?\nMother: (quickly) You wouldn't go, he wouldn't aks you to go. But if you told him you wanted to, if he\ncould feel that you wanted to pay, maybe he would forgive you.\nKeller: He would forgive me! For what?\nMother: Joe, you know what I mean.\nKeller: I don't know what you mean! You wanted money, so I made money. What must I be forgiven?\nYou wanted money, didn't you?\nMother: I didn't want it that way.\nKeller: I didn't want it that way, either! What difference is it what you want? I spoiled the both of you. I\nshould've put him out when he was ten like I was put out, and make him earn his keep. Then he'd know\nhow a buck is made in this world. Forgiven! I could live on a quarter a day myself, but I got a family so I...\nMother: Joe, Joe... It don't excuse it that you did it for the family.\nKeller: It's got to excuse it!\nMother: There's something bigger than the family to him.\nKeller: Nothin' is bigger!\nMother: There is to him.\nKeller: There's nothing he could do that I wouldn't forgive. Because he's my son. Because I'm his father\nand he's my son.\nMother: Joe, I tell you...\nKeller: Nothin's bigger than that. And you're going to tell him, you understand? I'm his father and he's\nmy son, and if there's something bigger than that I'll put a bullet in my head!\nMother: You stop that!\nKeller: You heard me. Now you know what to tell him. (Pause. He moves from her. Halts) But he\nwouldn't put me away though... He wouldn't do that... Would he?\nMother: He loved you, Joe, you broke his heart.\nKeller: But to put me away...\nMother: I don't know. I'm beginning to thing we don't really know him. They say in the war he was such\na killer. Here he was always afraid of mice. I don't know him. I don't know what he'll do.\nKeller: Goddam, If Larry was alive he wouldn't act like this. He understood the way the world is made.\nHe listened to me. To him the world had a forty foot front, it ended at the building line. This one,\neverything bothers him. You make a deal, overcharge two cents, and his hair falls out. He don't\nunderstand money. Too easy, it came too easy. Yes, sir. Larry. That was a boy we lost. Larry. Larry. (He\nslumps on chair in front of her) What am I gonna do, Kate?\nMother: Joe, Joe, please... you'll be alright, nothing is going to happen.\nKeller: (desperately, lost) For you, Kate, for both of you, that's all I ever lived for....\nMother: I know, darling, I know. (Ann enters from the house. They say nothing, waiting for her\u00a0\u00a0to speak)\nAnn: Why do you stay up? I'll tell you when he comes.\nKeller: (rises, goes to her) You didn't eat supper, did you? (to mother) Why don't you make her\nsomething?\nMother: Sure, I'll...\nAnn: Never mind, Kate, I'm all right. (they are unable to speak to each other) There's something I want\nto tell you. (She starts, then halts) I'm not going to do anyting about it.\nMother: She's a good girl! (To Keller) You see? She's a ...\nAnn: I'll do nothing about Joe, but you're going to do something for me. (Directly to Mother) You made\nChris feel guilty with me. I'd like you to tell him that Larry is dead and that you know it. You understand\nme? I'm not going out of here alone. There's no life for me that way. I want you to set him free. And\nthen I promise you, everything will end, and we'll go away, and that's all.\nKeller: You'll do that. You'll tell him.\nAnn: I know what I'm asking, Kate. You had two sons. But you've only got one now.\nKeller: You'll tell him.\nAnn: And you've got to say it to him so he knows you mean it.\nMother: My dear, if the boy was dead, it wouldn't depend on my words to make Chris know it...\nThenight he gets into your bed, his heart will dry up. Because he knows and you know. To his dying day\nhe'll wait for his brother! No, my dear, no such thing. You're going in the morning, and you're going\nalone. That's your life, that's your lonely life. (she goes to porch, and starts in)\nAnn: Larry is dead, Kate.\nMother: (she stops) Don't speak to me.\nAnn: I said he's dead. I know! He crashed off the coast of China November twenty fifth! His engine didn't\nfail him. But he died. I know...\nMother: How did he die? You're lying to me. If you know, how did he die?\nAnn: I loved him. You know I loved him. Would I have looked at anyone else if I wasn't sure? That's\nenough for you.\nMother: (moving on her) What's enough for me? What're you talking about? (She grasps Ann's wrists)\nAnn: You're hurting my wrists.\nMother: What are you talking about! (Pause. She stares at Ann a moment, then turns and goes to Keller)\nAnn: Joe, go in the house.\nKeller: Why should I...\nAnn: Please go.\nKeller: Lemme know when he comes. (Keller goes into house)\nMother: (as she sees Ann taking a letter from her pocket) What's that?\nAnn: Sit down. (Mother moves left to chair, but does not sit) First you've got to understand. When I\ncame, I didn't have any idea that Joe... I had nothing against him or you. I came to get married. I hoped...\nSo I didn't bring this to hurt you. I thought I'd show it to you only if there was no other way to settle\nLarry in your mind.\nMother: Larry? (snatches letter from Ann's hand)\nAnn: He wrote to me just before he... (mother opens and begins to read letter) I'm not trying to hurt\nyou, Kate. You're making me do this, now remember you're... Remember. I've been so lonely, Kate... I\ncan't leave here alone again. (a long low moan comes from Mother's throat as she reads) You made me\nshow it to you. You wouldn't believe me. I told you a hundred times, why wouldn't you believe me!\nMother: Oh, my God.....\nAnn: (with pity and fear) Kate, please, please...\nMother: My God, my God...\nAnn: Kate, dear, I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry.\nChris enters from the driveway. He seems exhausted.\nAnn: Where were you? ... You're all perspired. (mother doesn't move) where were you?\nChris: Just drove around a little. I thought you'd be gone.\nAnn: Where do I go? I have nowhere to go.\nChris: (to Mother) Where's Dad?\nAnn: Inside lying down.\nChris: Sit down, both of you. I'll say what there is to say.\nMother: I didn't hear the car...\nChris: I left it in the garage.\nMother: Jim is out looking for you.\nChris: Mother... I'm going away. There are a couple of firms in Cleveland, I think I can get a place. I mean,\nI'm going way for good. (To Ann alone) I know what you're thinking, Annie. It's true. I'm yellow. I was\nmade yellow in this house because I suspected my father and I did nothing about it, but if I know that\nnight when I came home what I know now, he'd be in the district attorney's office by this time, and I'd\nhave brought him there. Now if I look at him, all I'm able to do is cry.\nMother: What are you talking about? What else can you do?\nChris: I could jail him! I could jail him, if I were human any more. But I'm like everybody else now. I'm\npractical now. You made me practical.\nMother: But you have to be.\nChris: The cats in that alley are practical, the bums who ran away when we were fighting were practical.\nOnly the dead ones weren't practical. But now I'm practical, and I spit on myself. I'm going away. I'm\ngoing now.\nAnn: (going up to him) I'm coming with you.\nChris: No, Ann.\nAnn: Chris, I don't ask you to do anyting about Joe.\nChris: You do, you do.\nAnn: I swear I never will.\nChris: in your heart you always will.\nAnn: Then do what you have to do!\nChris: Do what? What is there to do? I've looked all night for a reason to make him suffer.\nAnn: There's reason, there's reason!\nChris: What? Do I raise the dead when I put him behind bars? Then what'll I do it for? We used to shoot\na man who acted like a dog, but honor was real there, you were protecting something. But here? This is\nthe land of the great big dogs, you don't love a man here, you eat him! That's the principle; the only one\nwe live by... it just happened to kill a few people this time, that's all. The world's that way, how can I\ntake it out on him? What sense does that make? This is a zoo, a zoo!\nAnn: (to Mother) You know what he's got to do! Tell him!\nMother: Let him go.\nAnn: I won't let him go. You'll tell him what he's got to do...\nMother: Annie!\nAnn: Then I will!\nKeller enters from house. Chris sees him, goes down near arbor.\nKeller: What's the matter with you? I want to talk to you!\nChris: (pulling violently away from him) Don't do that, Dad. I'm going to hurt you if you do that. There's\nnothing to say so say it quick.\nKeller: Exactly what's the matter? what's the matter? you got too much money? Is that what bothers\nyou?\nChris: (with an edge of sarcasm) It bothers me.\nKeller: If you can't get used to it, then throw it away. You hear me? Take every cent and give it to\ncharity, throw it in the sewer. Does that settle it? In the sewer, that's all. You think I'm kidding? I'm\ntellin' you to do it, if it's dirty then burn it. It's your money, that's not my money. I'm a dead man, I'm an\nold dean man, nothing's mine. Well, talk to me! What do you want to do.\nChris: It's not what I want to do. It's what you want to do.\nKeller: What should I do? (Chris is silent) Jail? You want me to go to jail? If you want me to go, say so! Is\nthat where I belong? Then tell me so! (Slight pause) What's the matter, whay can't you tell me?\n(Furiously) You say everyting else to me, say that! (Slight pause) I'll tell you why you can't say it. Because\nyou know I don't belong there. Because you know! (with growing emphasis and passion, and a persistent\ntone of desperation) Who worked for nothin' in that war? When they ship a gun or a truck outa Detroid\nbefore they got their price? Is that clean? It's dollars and cents, nickels and dimes; war and peace, it's\nnickels and dimes, what's clean? Half the Goddam country is gotta go if I go! That's why you can't tell\nme.\nChris: That's exactly why.\nKeller: Then... Why am I bad?\nChris: I know you're no worse than most men but I thought you were better. I never saw you as a man. I\nsaw you as my father. (Almost breaking) I can't look at you this way, I can't look at myself!\nHe turns away, unable to face Keller. Ann goes quickly to Mother, takes letter from her and starts for\nChris. Mother instantly rushes to intercept her.\nMother: Give me that!\nAnn: He's going to read it! (She thrusts letter into Chris's hand) Larry. He wrote it to me the day he died.\nKeller: Larry!\nMother: Chris, it's not for you. (he starts to read) Joe... go away...\nKeller: (mystified, frightened) Why'd she say, Larry, what...?\nMother: (desparately pushes him toward alley, glancing at Chris) Go to the street, Joe, go to the street!\n(she comes down beside Keller) Don't, Chris... (pleading with her whole soul) Don't tell him.\nChris: (quietly) Three and one half years... talking, talking. Now you tell me what you must do... Thisis\nhow he died, now tell me where you belong.\nKeller: (pleading) Chris, a man can't be a Jesus in this world!\nChris: I know all about the world. I know the whole crap story. Now listen to this, and tell me what a\nman's got to be! (Reads:) \"My dear Ann: ...\", you listening? He wrote this the day he died. Listen, don't\ncry.... Listen! \"My Dear Ann: it is impossible to put down the things I feel. But I've got to tell you\nsomething. Yesterday they flew in a load of papers from the States and I read about Dad and your father\nbeing convicted. I can't express myself. I can't tell you how I feel... I can't bear to live any more. Last\nnight I circled the base for twenty minutes before I could bring myself in. How could he have done that?\nEvery day three or four men never come back and he sits back there doing 'business'.... I don't know\nhow to tell you what I feel.... I can't face anybody... I'm going out on a mission in a few minutes. They'll\nprobably report me as missing.\u00a0\u00a0If they do, I want you to know that you mustn't wait for me. I tell you,\nAnn, if I had him there now I could kill him...\" (Keller grabbs the letter from Chris's hand and reads it.\nAfter a long pause) Now blame the world. Do you understand that letter?\nKeller: (speaking almost inaudibly) I think I do. Get the car. I'll put on my jacket. (he turns and starts\nslowly for the house. Mother rushes to intercept him)\nMother: Why are you going? You'll sleep, why are you going?\nKeller: I can't sleep here. I'll feel better if I go.\nMother: You're so foolish. Larry was your son too, wasn't he? You know he'd never tell you to do this.\nKeller: (looking at letter in his hand) Then what is this if it isn't telling me? Sure, he was my son. But I\nthink to him they were all my sons. And I guess they were, I guess they were. I'll be right down. (exits\ninto house)\nMother: (to Chris, with determination) You're not going to take him!\nChris: I'm taking him.\nMother: It's up to you, if you tell him to stay he'll stay. Go and tell him!\nChris: Nobody could stop him now.\nMother: You'll stop him! How long will he live in prison? Are you trying to kill him?\nChris: (holding out letter) I thought you read this!\nMother: (of Larry, the letter) The war is over! Didn't you hear? It's over!\nChris: Then what was Larry to you? A stone that fell into the water? It's not enough for him to be sorry.\nLarry didn't kill himself to make you and Dad sorry.\nMother: What more can we be!\nChris: You can be better! Once and for all you can know there's a universe of people outside and you're\nresponsible to it, and unless you know that, you threw away your son because that's why he died.\nA shot is heard in the house. They stand frozen for a brief second. Chris starts for porch, pauses at step,\nturns to Ann.\nChris: Find Jim! (He goes on into the house and Ann runs up driveway. Mother stands alone, transfixed.\nMother: (softly, almost moaning) Joe... Joe... Joe... Joe... (Chris comes out of house, down to Mother's\narms.)\nChris: (almost crying) Mother, I didn't mean to...\nMother: Don't dear. Don't take it on yourself. Forget now. Live.\nChris stirs as if to answer. Shhh.... She puts his arms down gently and moves toward porch. Shhh... As\nshe reaches porch steps she begins sobbing.\nCURTAINEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1256831", "artist_names": "Sheena Easton", "full_title": "When He Shines

you\nI swear we've been through everything there is\nCan't imagine anything we've missed\nCan't imagine anything the two of us can't do\n\n[Chorus]\nThrough the years, you've never let me down\nYou turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found\nI've found with you... through the years\nI've never been afraid, I've loved the life we've made\nAnd I'm so glad I've stayed, right here with you\nThrough the years\n[Verse 2]\nI can't remember what I used to do\nWho I trusted, whom I listened to before\nI swear you've taught me everything I know\nCan't imagine needing someone so\nBut through the years it seems to me\nI need you more and more\nThrough the years, through all the good and bad\nI knew how much we had, I've always been so glad\nTo be with you ... through the years\nIt's better every day, you've kissed my tears away\nAs long as it's okay, I'll stay with you\nThrough the years\nThrough the years, when everything went wrong\nTogether we were strong, I know that I belonged\nRight here with you... through the years\nI never had a doubt, we'd always work things out\nI've learned what love's about, by loving you\nThrough the years\n\n[Chorus]\nThrough the years, you've never let me down\nYou've turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found\nI've found with you ... through the years\nIt's better every day, you've kissed my tears away\nAs long as

love me\nYou are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy\nThere's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you\nYou're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you\nI still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you\nHow I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you\nYou must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in\nThat's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, my love\nA thousand kisses from you is never too much\nI just don't wanna stop\nOh, my love\nA million days in your arms is never too much\nI just don't wanna stop\n[Chorus]\nToo much, never too much, never too much, never too much\n\n[Verse 2]\nWoke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started\nI called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted\nHung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding\nOpened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing\nWell, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar\nI'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler\nLove is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning\nWe've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning\n\n[Outro]\nOh, my love\nA thousand kisses from you is never too much\n(Never too much, never too much, never too much)\nI just don't wanna stop\nOh, my love\nA million days in your arms is never too much\n(Never too much, never too much, never too much)\nAnd I just don't wanna stop\nOh, my love\nA thousand kisses from you is never\n(Never too much, never too much, never too much)\nI

my heart\nYou'll just tear it apart\nMoving in for the kill tonight\nYou got every advantage when they put out the lights\nIt's not so pretty when it fades away\n'Cause it's just an illusion in this

memory that never forgets\nI love to hear you say my name\nEspecially when you say yes\nI got your body right now on my mind\nBut I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex (Hmmmm)\nTo the sound of old T-Rex (oh)  \u2013 and Who's Next\n[Chorus]\nWhen I say I love you you say you better\nYou better you better you bet\nWhen I say I need you you say you better\nYou better you better you bet\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou better bet your life\nOr love will cut you like a knife\n\n[Verse 2]\nI want those feeble minded axes overthrown\nI'm not into your passport picture -- I just like your nose\nYou welcome me with open arms and open legs\nI know only fools have needs but this one never begs\nI don't really mind how much you love me\nOoh, a little is alright\nWhen you say come over and spend the night\nTonight, tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen I say I love you you say you better\nYou better you better you bet\nWhen I say I need you you say you better\nYou better you better you bet\nYou

time now\nYou better shove me back into line now\n\n[Guitar solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI showed up late one night\nWith a neon light for a visa\nBut knowing I am so eager to fight\nCan't make letting me in any easier (oooh ooh)\nI know I've been wearing crazy clothes\nAnd I look pretty crappy sometime (oooh ooh)\nBut my body feels so good\nAnd I still sing a razor line every time\nAnd when it comes to all night living\nI know what I am giving\nI have got it all down to a tee\nAnd it's free\n[Chorus]\nWhen I say I love you you say you better\nYou better you better you bet\nWhen I say I need you you say you better\nYou better you better you bet\nWhen I say I love you you say you better\nYou better you better you bet\nWhen I say I need you you scream you better (ooh)\nYou better you better you

cloudy draw\n\nTheir brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel\nTheir horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel\nA bolt of fear went through him as they

would never forget her\nNow I can't recall her name\nThe first time I was a fool\nNever knew that love could be so cruel\nIt happened again\nThird time lucky\nOh Yeah\nI was in love one time\nI thought it was the real thing\nBut I kept the feelings to myself\nAfraid to show them\nExpecting her to know\nIt's the reason she found someone else\nIt's all behind me\nThere's good luck up

taught me one thing\nTaught me to hold on to my love\n\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes\nI just can't help thinkin' livin' without you, baby\nSee, sometimes, I just can't live cryin' about you, baby\nI'm not worried 'bout a doggone thing\nI'll take anything you bring\nAlthough I love the sunshine\nI'll still accept rain\n'Cause when I'm in my lonely mood\nAnd I just can't be with you\nI tried everything to occupy my mind\nAnd there was no substitute\nThinking all that life would be\nWhen you're not around\nI just could not find my way\nI wouldn't even know up from down\nBut since I've had you in my life\nAll things can be found\nSo strong and true, baby\nAll comin' from you\n\n[Chorus]\nYou, I call your name, girl (Whenever I am lonely, baby)\nI call your name (When I feel the need of love)\nI think of you, and it eases the pain\nTake away the strain\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't worry what my people say\nIn my life today\nAlthough they try to say you're not the one for me\nI'll love you anyway\n'Cause their intentions might be cool\nIf what they say was true\nBut there's more to you than they could ever see\nAnd they don't even know you\n\nThinking all that life would be\nWhen you're not around\nI just could not find my way\nI wouldn't even know up from down\nBut since I've had you in my life\nAll things can be found\nSo strong and true, baby\nComin' from you, you, you, you,

receive\nThat's why I call your name\n\nOh, baby, when I am lonely\nWhen I am discouraged\nI call your name, girl\nI think of you and it eases the pain\nTake away the strain\n\n[Chorus]\nYou, I call

over there (Where?)\nThere, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend\nThey say that looks don't count for much\nIf so, there goes your proof\n\n[Chorus]\nIs she really going out with him?\nIs she really gonna take him home tonight?\nIs she really going out with him?\n'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me\nThere's something going wrong around here\nAround here\n\n[Bridge]\nBut if looks could

were so fine\nThey waited there in line\nAnd when they got up on their feet they made the show\nAnd that was sweet\nBut I can hear the sound\nOf slamming doors and folding chairs\nAnd that's a sound they'll never know\n[Verse 2]\nNow roll them cases out and lift them amps\nAnd haul them trusses down and get 'em up them ramps\n'Cause when it comes to moving me\nYou know you guys are the champs\nBut when that last guitar's been packed away\nYou know that I still wanna play\nSo just make sure you got it all set to go\nBefore you come for my piano\n\n[Steel Guitar Solo: David

towns all look the same\nWe just pass the time in the hotel rooms\nAnd wander 'round backstage\n'Til those lights come up and we hear that crowd\nAnd we remember why we came\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow we got country and western on the bus, R 'n' B\nWe got disco and eight tracks and cassettes in stereo\nAnd we got rural scenes and magazines\nAnd we got truckers on C.B.\u00a0\nAnd we got Richard Pryor on the video\nWe got time to think of the ones we love\nWhile the miles roll away\nBut the only time that seems too short\nIs the time that we get to play\nSee Jackson Browne LiveGet tickets as low as

my blue world)\n\n[Chorus]\nI turn to stone, when you are gone\nI turn to stone\nTurn to stone, when you comin' home?\nI can't go on\n[Verse 2]\nThe dying embers of the night\n(A fire that slowly fades till dawn)\nStill glow upon the wall so bright\n(Turning, turning, turning)\nThe tired streets that hide away\n(From here to everywhere they go)\nRoll past my door into the day\nIn my blue world\n\n[Chorus]\nI turn to stone, when you are gone\nI turn to stone\nTurn to stone, when you comin' home?\nI can't go on\nTurn to stone, when you are gone\nI turn to stone\n\n[Bridge]\nYes, I'm turnin' to stone 'cause you ain't comin' home\nWhy ain't you comin' home If I'm turnin' to stone\nYou've been gone for so long and I can't carry on\nYes, I'm turnin', I'm turnin', I'm turnin' to stone\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe dancing shadows on the wall\n(The two step in the hall)\nAre all I've seen since you've been gone\n(Turning, turning, turning)\nThrough all I sit here and I wait\n(I turn to stone, I turn to stone)\nYou will return again someday\nTo my blue world\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI turn to stone, when you are gone\nI turn to stone\nTurn to stone, when you comin' home?\nI
